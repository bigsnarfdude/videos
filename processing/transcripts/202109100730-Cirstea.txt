Just from the University of Sydney, who is going to talk about anisotropic elliptic equations with gradient-dependent lower-order terms and L1 data. Please. Thank you very much, Andrea, for the introduction. I would like to start by thanking the organizers for their kind invitation. It is a great pleasure to give a talk at this prestigious conference in Danf. Conference in Banff, and I feel sorry that I could not come in person to the conference to attend the conference that we have to adapt. So, what I'd like to talk today, I would like to talk about very recent results. In fact, the paper that I'm talking about is just completed with my collaborator, Barbara Brandolini from the University of Palermo. And the research was supported by the Australian Research Council, and in fact, And in fact, we started a couple of years ago, or even more, started thinking about this problem. Barbara Brandonini visited me in 2019 for two months, in August, September 2019, just it was before COVID. So it was very nice to talk to her and work on this problem. So I'm also privileged to have several experts. Privileged to have several experts in the area in the organizing committee and audience. So I really appreciate any questions or feedback. So let me give you a bit of background and what we were led to in our search for the aims we wanted to reach. So we looked at a series of papers by Bocardo with various collaborators. With various collaborators who studied the non-linear electric problems in a bounded open subset of Rn involving P-Laplacian type operators, in fact, more general, quercy-bounded continuous and pseudo-monotone Le Rayliance operators from W0 and P into its dual, where P is greater than one less than infinity. And the prototype model was the Pilar Placian. And I've mentioned here several papers of Bocardo collaborators, Ben Suzanne, and Zi with the also. With the awesome RA and 1990s and early 2000 papers, that the techniques developed in these papers accommodate for a lower the term, G, which has a natural growth in the gradient, and more importantly, has also no restriction on the growth in the modulus of U. And what is the good thing about this non-linear TG is that it has a good sign condition and that is. A good sign condition. And that means here that when you multiply g of xs psi by s, you get a non-negative number. And the other things that they considered in their problem was low summability, that of low summability like f in L1 or H in the dual of W0MP. So they could include this because of this term G. But what is really important is that the solutions are obtained in W01P space. Containing W0MP space. So we had this. So just to illustrate, I mentioned here one result, the Susan Bookard de Mira in 1988. And for every, so take any m greater than one, lambda positive, p greater than one, and h in the dual w0 and p, and you can find a solution to the problem in the distribution sense for the equation one. Distribution sense for the equation one for U in W dramati and in L M. Now, the existence in a suitable space holds for not just for the Philaplacian operator, but for a larger class, which is Lorelians type operators, and in divergence form from W Z ramping to the dual, and also replacing the term here lambda modulus u n minus 2 u by a nonlinear low order term g, which Nonlinear lower order term G, which has a natural growth in the gradient and under the sign condition mentioned earlier. But for simplicity, I mentioned it in this situation. When H is sufficiently smooth, then the existence of bounded solutions was proved by many authors, and I mentioned several authors here, Aman Crandall, Ben Sussan Fres Moscow, Vocard Milla Piel, Ben Sussan Fres. But what is also important to mention What is also important to mention is that, in general, even for the corresponding linear equation, we cannot expect the solution to be bounded. But if you have data such as in W minus 1, Q and Q greater than N over P minus 1, then the boundedness issues according to the paper by Bocca and Giacchetti. So, what is one of the main difficulties in the study? In the study, stems from the fact that you have no restriction on the growth of G in respect to the modulus of U, which in the previous example means that M is created in one arbitrary, and no growth structure respect to modulus of U when you take G. And what also another difficulty is that the solution is usually expected to be unbounded if, for example, you take H in the in the dual of W0 and P. In the dual of W0 and P. Okay, now the solution, another aspect that is important when one tries to look at approximation schemes is to be able to take as a test function the solution itself. And so this is they also proved because the solution is not only in W0P, but is also in LM, allows them to prove that in the as a test function, they can take the solution itself. This is important because the Is important because the test function is required to be in L infinity, and the solution itself may not be in L infinity. But because U is in L M, they can take the test function, the solution itself. Now, there are other works, of course, many, many works on the anisotropy Laplacian. There is a flourishing literature and also in this case of the Le Releuance operators for Pilaplacian-type operators. Operators and under various conditions on the G and other, you can imagine you put certain conditions on the data, you get better results if the data is in the right space. So I just mentioned some here, Grenonira, Poreta, Ferrone, Messano, but there are many, many, so I apologize I didn't mention, but there are many, many people who have obtained results with varying assumptions on the data. But I wanted to mention the ones that are most relevant for our study. Available for our study. What was our aim? Well, at the beginning, what we wanted to do is to consider anisotropic elliptic equations with singularities, because this is the area in which I get funded for DRC and I really like it. And we wanted to have nonlinearities, a lower order term that depends on the gradient and allows and also on the function itself in such a way that it can blow up as when you take a Up as when you take a digital boundary condition on the boundary of the domain. But it turns out that to deal with such equation, you have to be that was very, it was a very ambitious project and we are looking now at that, but as the foundation did this paper first, so there will be no similarities in this paper, but I will add you to the idea of what you can do to tackle also singular problems with singularities. So we are taking taking um okay so for our uh problems which are um anisotropic types they have been investigated uh widely in the literature and the interest is because of their applications for from image recovery and mathematical modeling of non-Newtonian fluids to biology and also for the models for the propagation of epidemic diseases in heterogeneous domains In heterogeneous domains. Now, the operator, you are safe to take the anisotropy Pilaplacian throughout the talk, but I would like to show you that the results work in a very general framework, as we are also motivated by having a very general framework to obtain existence of solution in W01 anisotropic W01P space. That was one resolution we wanted, to allow L1 data in the problem, to allow singularities, as mentioned earlier. As mentioned earlier. And how can you do all that? So you have to have something to counter because otherwise you want to march in, you have to have something, right? So the good thing that we will have is to counter the negative effect of low summability is this natural growth, this Naniati that will model the natural anisotropic growth in the gradient that G mentioned before from Bocaplo's papers with collaborators. And so it has to have the right sign. It has to have the right sign, and so we will have such a term. And then, as a novelty, we wanted also to have besides H in the dual of W0MP, we wanted to see, okay, can you get a very general class of operators that goes beyond this H in W0MP? How far can you go? So, this is broadly speaking, the aim we wanted to reach. And so, what we how we do this, we take a LiRadios operator A, but Take a Loredius operator A but corresponding to anisotropic divergence from anisotropic operator from the corresponding anisotropic W0MP space into each dual. Now the assumptions everywhere will have that PJs are P1 to Pn are greater than one. You can order them, that's not a problem. But with the harmonic mean less than n, or equivalently, the sum of the reciprocals of PJs is going to be. sum of the reciprocals of PJs is greater than one. So we are working in the difficult case P less than n, where P is the harmonic mean of the P1 to Pn. The good thing is that we have anisotropic sobola embeddings corresponding to the anisotropic sobola spaces. So this is a plus that we will take advantage of. In terms of notation, R prime is the conjugate exponent of R, R greater than one. And P star is the anisotropic subolet exponent, which simply corresponds to the sobola. Which simply corresponds to the Sobolev exponent, the usual Sobolev exponent, but applied for the harmonic mean of the pj's. So p star is np over n minus p. Okay, so what is our problem? The type, the form of our equation is in five, where you have the operator A, think about minus isotropy P Laplacian, and you get all the features will be generalized to the operator A. Then the phi is what was mentioned before. The phi is what was mentioned before as G, so it's that good thing, the natural anisotropic growth in the gradient here, phi. Theta is the nicest term possible because it's going to be bounded. The character deli function is bounded, but it has its place in the equation. I'll explain why it needs to be there. And then f is in the data with the loss of mobility in L1, and the B, the operator B from W into the joule, is a new possible operator that. A new class of operator that we wanted to introduce in order to see what kind of features you need for the operator B to tackle many, many, many kind of nonlinearities. So that is what I would like to show you, what kind of conditions one would need to include H in the dual of W0 and P, anisotropy, W0 and P, but to go much beyond this. Okay, so the conditions we put on A are very much very natural. They are modeled on the anisotropy Pilaplash, and you will have cohesive. So to pipila plausion, you will have coercivity, a monotonicity type condition, and the growth condition on the components in the divergence of the gradient function. Then the divergence of the vector, I will show in a moment. The conditions we have on the operator A will make this operator coercive bandicontinous M pseudo-monoton. Let me show you in what sense I mean solution. A solution, as I mentioned before, would like to be in the W0 and P. That's very important. 0 on p that's very important condition we want since this is a natural space to work with whereas we consider a Dirichlet boundary condition equals 0 on the boundary of omega. By the way, omega is always bounded and no assumption, no smoothness, it's open, bounded and no smoothness assumption. And because we are with P less than N, we define W0MP as the closure of the test function C infinity contact report to respect to the norm given by the sum of the LPJ norm. Of the LPJ norm of the derivative of u respective j. And you can do that. You don't need to add the norm of u in some LQ space because you have diagnosed toposopoli embeddings. So you can do, you can define W in these sets. So omega is bounded. Okay, so weak solution will mean a function W round p, and we need that phi applied to the to x u the gradient of u to be in L1 because of the test function being in L infinity and in W is round p and we have And in W is around P and V has to be null infinity if you want to take F in L one, so that the integral f v to exist, you need V to be null infinity. So the test function is W 0 P and intersected with L infinity. And for this reason, we need phi x u null u to be n L one. And let's not forget that phi has an anisotropic natural growth in the gradient. I'll show you the examples. And theta don't worry about it is bounded. So now the operator, I will show you in a few minutes the conditions on. Minutes the conditions on this new class of operators B, and then let me show you very quickly the assumption on A. So, A is of the form minus divergence of A x u nabla u with a components of A being Aj. And the conditions on Aj are the first one is the coercivity condition, obviously satisfied that, but the case of the misotropy pilaplacian, the monotonicity condition, and the growth condition. Monotonicity condition and the growth condition. One small observation here: in the growth condition, if you look at the power of modulus of T, we have taken there the maximum power that you can take from the point of view of anisotropic sobo-lave embeddings, which is here P star over PJ prime. If you take all the PJs equal in the literature, usually it's P minus one, but you can go up to P star over PJ prime. You have to be a bit more careful when you prove the pseudomonoson. When you prove the pseudomonosonicity of the operator A, but it does work. Okay, now I said that it's very important the time the phi, the operator phi, the gradient dependent lower button phi, which depends on XU and nabla U. And you can see on the top of the screen an example. So you see that it has natural growth in the gradient, anotropic growth in the gradient is this sum J1 to n modulus dju to the power pj. dju to the power pj plus one multiplied by modulus u m minus two times u and then another term in which you have you can take a product of the power of dj u to power qj less than pj and modulus u theta j minus u theta minus j times u with this theta j is an m any number you want greater than one the fact that we have no restriction in the growth of modulus of u means that you can take any Modulus of U means that you can take any m greater than 1 and any theta j greater than 1. That's what it means here. And the sign condition is important. It means that those BJ's have to be greater than or equal to zero if you want to have it checked. Okay, so what I would like to mention now is that besides any F in L1, we want to have this general class of operators B, which Which will include in particular functions H in the dual of W01P. So now these are the two conditions that we need for everything to work fine. So let's call B and C B from bounded C from coercive. The class of all bounded operators B from W 0 and P into is dual. And we need two properties. One property, which means that although minus means that although minus B may not be coercive, you want A minus B to be coercive from W z ramping to its dual. This is an important property, tells us how it behaves as the normal view in W Z ramping goes to infinity. Condition P2 is absolutely important, is used a lot, and I'll mention that is something that is reminiscent of a famous condition, but let me show which is P2 in our case. So in our case is that if you have weak convergence of UL. If you have weak convergence of UL to U and V L to V, weak convergence in W0 and P, you want when you apply B to U L, B U L applied to V L to converge to B U applied to V. So these are the preconditions that are essential. Now, when you have, if you don't include F in the equation, you take F equals zero or a nice data F, then this will be enough, these two conditions. But it turns out that if you want to allow any F in L one, Want to allow any f in L1, we do need another condition which is a little bit in the sense that you need, if you look at the condition that goes to infinity, that difference as the norm of u goes to infinity looks like coercivity. The only thing is that I need to test with B U applied to the truncation of U at any level K. So I take any K and I need that difference to go to infinity. So it's the first one is coming from the cohesivity condition. The cohesivity condition of A, that quantity in the cohesivity condition, but you want this B you apply to the truncation to be controlled by the first term as the norm of U goes to infinity. Now, I'll be honest, we were not able to, we are still to investigate whether P3 is automatically satisfied by D1. It seems in all the examples that it's satisfied, but I'm not sure if this can be proved that it's always satisfied. So, for safety, we So, for safety, we put it there. It doesn't seem to be stronger, but the fact that B is anything, I don't know if it's always satisfied by P1 or not, because we have to take the truncation there. Okay, so now you may wonder, are there many examples of operators? And there are plenty and quite diverse. So, for example, take NF in the L P star prime and H and another function, H tilde. Another function H tilde in the dual of W0AMP, isotropic W dramat. And then you can take Bu equals H, as suggested in the papers by Bocardo in the isotropic case, or you can take Bu, this function capital F plus rho constant modulus U to Var theta minus 2u. Depending on the sign of rho, remember that we have a coercivity condition A minus B to be coercive. Then if rho is positive, then you have a restriction on this power. On this power, var theta has to be less than p. This comes from the first condition p1, in fact. But if you have that rho is negative, then you just need var theta less than p star, var theta greater than less than p star, that comes from p2. So it seems that in all the examples we look at, p1 is more restrictive, p2 is better. So p2 is usually the second condition is which I didn't mention is in some spirit, in some In some spirit, in some senses, in the spirit of the condition 3i in the hypothesis, second hypothesis of theorem 1 in a celebrating paper by L'Oreal Luos. So it's quite similar to that condition, in fact. It's not identical, but it's very much related. And so in practice, P2 is really check it by applying anisotropic embedding theorems. And condition P1 is really relating to the sign if. Relating to the sign, if you can't induce the sign P U apply to U, then it could be good or bad, and then you may have a restriction on the powers depending on, as you see, as with the raw, for example. So that is where you have to check the condition P1. But what is interesting that we can also take divergence from operators, like in the last example four, where is you see, it's Whereas you see, it's minus sum j1 to n, the partial derivative respective j of beta j plus modulus u to sigma j minus 1 times u, where beta j is in Lpj prime and sigma j between 0 and p over pj prime. So you can accommodate divergence form operators here. And all the examples satisfy all of the conditions in the mentioned P1, P2, and the extra. The P1, P2, and the extra condition. Okay, so what is our result? Is the following under suitable conditions on phi, which informally I mentioned, and on the operator A in the Lorentz class with the conditions of coercivity, monotonicity, and growth conditions. Then for every F in L1 and the operator B in the class DC with the extract condition, you get at least a solution in the. At least a solution in the sense that I mentioned earlier. Now, several remarks here. Without the term phi, we cannot expect to find solutions in W0 and P for every FNL1. This is a clear observation made even in the isotropic case by Bocardo and Galvi in 1992. So if you want solutions in W0 and P, what can you do to what conditions do you need? You need some conditions on five, and that is the sign conditions. Now you can see. The sign conditions. Now you can see condition 10 shows that we have a sign condition and the growth condition. The function zeta applied to the modules of 2 is just non-decreasing, no restriction on the growth. And you see the natural growth in the gradient, the amisotropic growth of some J1 to N modulus, psi J to PJ, and C is in L1. Theta, don't worry about it, it's bounded. And I must say that if you do want to have any I must say that if you do want to have any f in L1, we also need the last condition on phi, which is a lower bound estimate. You need that the modulus of phi when modulus of t is large to be greater than or equal to some positive constant, some j1 to n modulus psi j to pj. And I will explain why you need this. But if f is zero, you don't need the last one. The condition 11 is not needed. So it's only needed in the case that f is in a one. So these are the conditions. Now, facts are well known. Now, facts are well known. The unstoppable inequality, you get it for under the condition that P is less than N. This back to Tracy 1969, and by density argument, we are on an omega boundary domain, you can extend it to obtain a corresponding sobolette embedding of W0MP into LP star. And that implies embedding of W0MP in LS continues whenever S is between. S continues whenever S is between one and P star, inclusive of them, the end of the endpoints, and compact provided that S is strictly less than P star. Okay, so these are, of course, important tools, but let me see what are the obstacles to prove our result. Well, first of all, is the low summability of F for F, F is in L1, and the fact that you have unrestricted growth of phi respective modulus of U. And these are really two competing restrictions. And then you may say, okay, but I know how to do. May say, okay, but I know how to do each of them. Yes, individually, yes, if you have only one of these, but not both at the same time. So, if you have, if you want to treat f to the difficulty with f, you will have to approximate it by l infinity functions f epsilon with modules of f epsilon less than or equal to modules of f, convergence, point to as convergence of f epsilon to f. This is standard. Similarly, you could replace phi by phi index epsilon in the formula mentioned here to In the formula mentioned here, to make it bounded, you preserve the sign of phi, the good sign condition on phi, you preserve it for phi epsilon, and you gain boundedness. But what the big problem is that you can't do both of them at the same time. Believe me, this is a very difficult problem. You cannot deal with both at the same time because you want before you approx, before you are able to replace f by f epsilon and pass the limit, you need very good properties on the solution. Whereas if you do both approximations of if you do both approximations of the same type same time you are not able to get uniform boundedness of the solutions and you cannot pass to the limits so this is this is the problem so we know already about this limitation in mentioned in Bensoson and Bokard in 2002 in the isotropic case so we cannot do both at the same time and it's also important in which order we have to take the approximation so first take f equals zero and as I mentioned before if And as I mentioned before, if f is zero, then you get you don't need the last condition or the lower bound of modules of phi. And then we obtain, notice, an extra property of the solution u, which is phi applied to u times u is in l1. What does it mean? If you take phi to be modulus of u to n minus 2 times u, it means that u is in lm is exactly corresponding to what I showed you at the beginning. So you get this very good property: phi of u times u is in l1. Of u times u is in L1. And you also get that you can take the test function to be the solution itself. That's extraordinarily important because we want to run an approximation scheme. So you want to replace the test function by the solution u, which could be unbounded if you have H in the dual of W0 isotopic space W0P. So what is the sketch of the proof? I will briefly mention the steps when F is zero, because the beauty of the way in which we prove things, like if you take ethical We prove things like if you take f equals zero, you actually, there's another way in which you can prove, and I'll mention a little bit. But the way we do it here is that the same ideas that we use it for f equals zero, we want to, at least in big pick the big picture, to apply it also when you take f in L1 with certain modifications, but we want to adapt the arguments. So what we do, we consider approximate problems for which you have distributional solutions. Which you have distributional solutions, then show that you can pass to the limit in weak formulation. Yeah, so this is this is standard procedure. What does it mean here? We place phi by phi epsilon, and we obtain the problem on the on the bottom of the page, problem 15. And for this problem 15, this is where we are using that a minus b is coercive. Then phi epsilon is bounded, there is no problem, the operator that will generate when you write the solution. rate when you write the solution will be not to bother you at all. So by a solution here we mean a function u epsilon such that the identity in 16 is satisfied for every v in w ramp. Remember here phi epsilon is bounded. So there's no problem anymore with now for every epsilon there exists a solution. Very briefly what is the idea? For this problem it's enough to prove that the opera if you go with B terminal The operator, if you go with B term in the left-hand side, then you get an operator from W into the dual, and prove that that operator is subjective. That will give you the existence of a solution. And what the idea is to show that that operator you get when you go beam the left-hand side is queries down into the monotone. And then, since W0MP is real, reflexive, and separable Banach space, you get the existence of a solution from a result of resistance. So the hard part, let's So, the hard part, let's say, is to prove the pseudo-monotonicity of the operator. What is the key here? A minus B is coercive, the operator will become coercive, the cooperative psi epsilon. Boundedness is not problem, B is bounded from assumption, and the pseudomonotonicity for B, you get it because the P2 condition ensures that it's strongly continuous. And it's known that every strongly continuous operator is pseudomonotone. So, minus B is strongly continuous, minus B is pseudomonotone. B is pseudomonoton, added to it a pseudomonatone operator, the sum of two pseudomonatone operators episodomonoton. That's really the key. I'm not going to the details because they're too technical. Then the next thing is to show that the sequence of approximate solutions is bounded, uniform bounded in W0 and P, and also the bounding is the second integral in the part A in the left-hand side. Then the reflexivity of W0 and P allows you to pass to sub-sequence to say that your epsilon converges weakly and almost. U epsilon converges weakly and almost everywhere to a function capital U, and you want to prove that is the solution. Nice and easy to state. The not too difficult to prove the boundedness of u epsilon in d epsilon p. We use the coercivity of a minus b, use the fact that b is bounded, and the good signed condition on phi. And that's very important here. You will be using it. You take the test function, the solution epsilon itself, and it's not difficult to prove using the cohesivity of. Using the cohesivity of assumptions that we have and Young's inequality to see that you have the boundaries. That's really not the key. The next thing to do is really the key for everything to work to be able to pass to the limit. Remember, when you pass to the limit from phi epsilon to phi, phi has a natural growth in the gradient. And you need to have for this, you need to have the strong convergence of the truncation. It could be enough to have, but you need at least. would be enough to have but you need at least that you need the strong convergence of the truncation of u epsilon to the truncation of capital u in w0 and p it turns out in fact that if f is zero which is the case that i'm discussing here you can actually get the strong convergence the full strong convergence in w0 and p of u epsilon to u so you could do that you can actually go straight to the strong convergence of u epsilon to u in w zero and p when f is zero but we don't do it this way you can do it in fact initially we did it that way but we don't want to That way, but we don't want to do it this way here because the problem is when you have f, you will not be able to get u epsilon to converge strongly in u in w draw when you take f in l1. So then it's a better strategy to prove the strong convergence of the truncation of u epsilon to the truncation of u in w drama d and then this you could also obtain when you take f in l1 and you go through a second approximation scheme. So that's why we want to prove the strong verges of the truncations rather than of the u epsilon p. Than of the u epsilon p. Okay, uh, in fact, in the paper, uh, we also obtain, we upgrade from uh, and to obtain that u epsilon converges to strongly in WZ Long. So we still can obtain this upgrading from from the convergence of the truncations. Okay, the key observation here to obtain what we want is that this scant quantity in red d epsilon k to converge to zero in L1. This is the hardest part, really. The rest, more or less. Best, more or less, you can do it. So, from the literature. So, limits superior. So, you want to prove that the limit superior of the integral is less than or equal to zero. And there are two steps. You have to distinguish on where the modulus of reaction is greater or equal than k and when it's less than k. The plan in part A, it's easy, no problem. Part B is the most technical one. So, the key idea is really to look at the difference between the truncation of UAPs. difference between the truncation of u epsilon and the truncation of u denote that by z epsilon k and take at the test function um this function z epsilon k times exponential lambda z epsilon k squared and lambda is suitably chosen a positive number suitably chosen so that's really the key it's quite technical so i'll skip the parts um then once you get the the convergence the point once you have this part that the Once you have this part that d epsilon k converges to zero in L1, then you should we would be able to get the convergence first the pointwise convergence of the gradient of d k u epsilon to the corresponding gradient dk of capital U, and also the strong convergence. So this is again, this at least the first part is this part is not difficult anymore once you prove the first that the epsilon k converges to zero in L1 omega. Okay, so I won't insist on this and then. Okay, so I won't insist on this, and then you can go past the limit and everything will work. For the other theorem, for the theorem where we introduce f in L1, what do we do? Well, I already mentioned that you want to, now you are able to approximate f after you have applied, after you have got the case with f equals zero first, and you are able to work with phi, then directly, then you are able to approximate f. Then you are able to approximate f by f epsilon and take an approximation now in f epsilon, but work with phi. You see, so uh, we do an approximation like mentioned for f epsilon and apply our result for uh apply our result for the problem in which f equals unit is replaced by f epsilon. F epsilon is in L infinity. So there's absolutely no problem with it. You can actually include it all together with the operator B and you know the operator, the new operator B. And you know, the operator, the new operator B epsilon, and B epsilon satisfies the same properties as B. And so there's no problem at all. And you can apply the theorem I mentioned to get the existence of a solution capital U epsilon now instead of L2 U epsilon. The difficulty here is that you cannot obtain under the same assumptions as for the other case F equals U, you cannot obtain uniform boundedness as before. You have to pay the price. You need the next. Price, you need an extra assumption, and this extra assumption: one assumption is that on five, this last condition 11. And the reason for this, if you look what happens here, you have, you need to know what happens when modulus of t greater than or equal to tau. The reason is because you are testing the problem with the truncation of u epsilon at the level tau. And then the phi term will help you. term will help you to obtain from to get the boundedness of capital u epsilon and doubles one p the part when modulus u epsilon is greater than or equal than tau is helps you define and the other part helps you the part from a from capital a from the operator a so in this way they combine together and you get the boundedness uh the boundedness of the u epsilon w is round b and also to be fair that's where i also need this other Where I also need this other, where we need the other condition on the operator B. You see the condition P3 because I test with the truncation of U, not with the U, not C. So this last condition, I want to make sure that this term BU, the truncation of U at the level of K and then any level K does not spoil things. So we get the bandness. So that's really, there are several small changes, some changes, but over. Small changes, some changes, but overall the scheme for the theorem is going with some adaptation also when F is in L1 with these ideas. And this study opens up the, what I mentioned at the beginning, the avenue to study singular problem with singularities. If you look at the model file on the top of the page, what happens when BJ is negative? That was actually our first question. That's what we started with. Question. That's what we started with. When Bj is minus one, then if you take all the BJ's to be minus one, then the sign condition is ruined. And you cannot use these terms in phi because the sign condition doesn't work. Then another thing we wanted is to allow theta j to be between zero and one. So you actually have a genuine singularity as u goes to zero. These are the things that will come in the next papers. In the next papers to study the singular case and when BJ's are negative, so that you cannot include them in phi. And so then you have to run another type of approximation. And the term theta is the one that allows us to use these results I talked here to continue the study to tackle singularities. So that's what I wanted to say. I think my time is up. Thank you very much. Thank you, Florika. Thank you, Florika, for your talk. Are there any questions or remarks? Thank you very much, Florika, for this nice talk. Can you take a Diraclet condition that is not zero and have some kind of results like this? We have not looked at other conditions than Dirichlet because our main motivation was honestly to take Honestly, to take terms that model, when you take, for example, the Laplacian U equal function on modules of u to gamma. So when u is zero on the boundary, then you have the singularity coming from nonlinearities powers. So you have modules u to a negative power, and you wanted u to be zero so that you have singularity. That's why we are interested in Dirichlet homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. And yeah, so this is really interesting because it builds on this. We needed this. It builds on this. We needed this as a preliminary study to tackle the similarities because then we have to again run other types of approximation and we need these results first. Probably if you have a bounded boundary data, then the technique should apply because then you work with truncations and above some the maximum of the datum, this might work. But for general boundary data, this might uh Later, this might become harder, I'm afraid. Other questions? Yes, I do have a question about uniqueness. So the main result is mainly about existence. I presume that means for uniqueness, you will need some smallness condition on the inhomogeneous term in the equation or something. Yes, yes, definitely. So the uniqueness, I must be honest, we have. I must be honest, we haven't thought about the uniqueness very carefully because, yes, you will have to have some restrictions. Definitely, you will have to have some restrictions. And our main goal definitely is an excellent question, definitely. But our main aim in this paper was to go as general as possible, and especially with the operator B. We really wanted to understand what makes, when you go through these approximation schemes, what kind of conditions you need for. Conditions you need for like operator B. That so this type of conditions, the coercivity of A minus B is enough, and the condition P2, which is related to subcritical growth, if you have, yeah. So for the uniqueness, we haven't thought that it's a very good question to as a follow-up. Yeah, thank you very much. More questions? What about did you investigate assumptions on better integrity properties on F than just L1, which tell you that the solution, for instance, is L infinity or has some mobility properties? Is it the same as in the isotropic case where you have F in L Q with Q larger than this threshold over P in or so you have boundedness of solution? I think I think that many things can go, can be adapted, but we have not looked into this. There are many, many beautiful questions that can be studied. And many people have, as you mentioned, have looked at as you play with F, where you play with five, you drop the sign condition, then there are many papers who investigate this kind of questions. These kinds of questions, and it's for these low-ready types of operators in the isotropic cases. A lot of literature, to be honest, when we started looking at the literature, I was like, wow, is there anything not done? So, this has been done a lot and beautiful results. So, one can go in many directions and understand what you can do in the isotropic case. And of course, one knows that there are many things that cannot be extended, like the Jerome proof that the strong Maximum principle doesn't work for anisotropic. Strong maximum principle doesn't work for an isotropic operator. So there are limitations, many serious limitations, and one has to be careful when trying to extend. But also, much can be done and still remains to be done. I mean, lots of questions that are in the wait for to be extended to allisotropic settings and very difficult questions. Good, thanks. So, if there are no more questions, let's thank Florika. Let's thank Florika again. Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you. And we shall start in just three minutes with the next speaker. And I will so can I share my screen? Or please check if everything works. I stopped the recording. Yes, I was going to. I was thinking about it. Sorry. Good. So I tried to share my PDF.
