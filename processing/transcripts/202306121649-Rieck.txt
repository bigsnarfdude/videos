I went for the last three years with Vaughan, who was my undergrad at that time, and now he's harloted with his PhD, and Negan, who was my grad student, who is now graduated and is working. So, Amegan was actually the one who got us into this, you know, so she was a With us, you know, so she was a former figure skater on very high level. So she told us all about it. So I didn't know much about figure skating. I mean, I can skate, but sort of not by not falling down. That's about my level of my skin. There is, when you think about figure skating, you think about sort of Olympic style with fancy outfits and With fancy outfits and jumps and things like that. And this is not it. That's not the only. So the actual words of figure skating, the skating of figures, those of us who are old enough and remember those things being broadcasted on TV. It is not broadcasted for obvious reasons, which is really boring to watch. So So, but basically, it's based on a book that Neighbor has shown us. It's an over 100-year-old book with 150 or so pictures on ice that I guess every lady or gentleman in the Nordic country had to do to be accepted in high society, that all these people with top hats and fancy dresses and doing things on ice. And so, this is actually, we're going to repeat that picture. We're going to repeat that picture event by the end of the talk. We'll actually reproduce some of the system. So, of course, a figure skater is a human on skates is a very complicated problem. So, we're not going to solve that. We're going to simplify it as much as possible. So, I wanted to remind those of you who are not in non-allonic mechanics. We're not in non-allonomic mechanics. How to, because this is something we're going to use for the dynamics. So, if you have some Lagrangian and you have some constraints, and you have the constraints a function of Q and T only, or can it be reduced to the function of Q and T, and they call the holonomic constraints. And you take an action and you put these constraints with Lagrange multipliers. Multipliers under the action and variety, and you get some equations on that which involve these Lagrange multipliers, and these are called constraint forces. And if you have constraints that are affine in velocities, you can't do it like that. I mean, you could put it in the action, but you get what's called vacanomic results, which gives you different answers, different equations. But there is But there is a Lagrange-de-Lambert formula for these non-holonomic constraints. So, whenever you see dots, you put deltas here, you erase the right-hand side, and you vary the action with constraints on variations on delta Q. So it's a little different procedure than just pure variational calculus. So it's a variational calculus with... It's a variational calculus with constraints and variations, and so you put the variations with the constraints and variations with Lagrange multiply, and you get the you vary and you get something that's proportional to delta Q, and these are your equations of motion. So you have, in general, if you have n equations of motion, you'll get n variables, you get n equations of motion. Variables, you get n equations of motion, and also exactly the same number of Lagrange multipliers as your constraints. So you have totally of n plus m equations that you have to solve. So this is something to keep in mind for our preliminaries. And this is actually a picture of Omegan that introduces coordinate system. And in this part of the And in this part of the talk, we are going to assume that Megan or any kind of skater looks okay. Yeah, this looks all right. Monitor is not projector is not something of the last one. They're still hearing? So, because of the technical difficulties, we went to six. Well, they leave at 4:30 the right. Something looks like a no signal. No, you have to choose the source thing. It's a source there. The problem is why you need to report this part. So that according to this, it may not be reporting anymore. It's recording anything. That is a monitor. What if we just kill the whole thing and reboot? Do that, but if it doesn't start again, then it's probably faster. But you'll send the golden key and the yeah. Even the yeah, that's true. I don't see any one of them wrote me, but I don't see them right on it. Oh, it says video over there. I think that's that's us that's the people I mean it's okay just go ahead don't don't stop it's okay I'm just listening that's okay don't worry thank you um all right so um All right, so this is a picture of Megan, and throughout this talk, the small letters will be spatial coordinates. So let's say a figure skater parents of leaders looking at the kids performing. That's their coordinate system. And the capital letters are everything related to the figure skaters coordinates. To the figure skaters coordinators. So then Megan brought her skates and she's pretty high level, so she has professional fever skates. And interestingly enough, I always thought that hockey skates were curved, but actually hockey skates are flat. They kind of have a curve in the front. They look curved. But if you actually put the hockey skates on Skates on the table, they don't rock. But the figure skate actually rocks a little bit, not too much, but a little bit. So that's done. So it rotates really easily and it glides really easily. But of course, it cannot go perpendicular to the sun. So the important thing is even though it rocks just a little bit, Even though it rocks just a little bit, the pitch, it's very rigid food, so the pitch of the skate is not allowed to change, basically. You know, it's plus minus one degree. So in this first part of the talk, we assume that Megan is not allowed to move her arms and legs. It's just fixed position. So, and then we'll talk about the control on the second part of the talk. So, the skates are done in such a way that along the skate, you have basically zero friction for all practical purposes. But, of course, normal to the skate there is infinitely large friction. This zero and infinity are not really zero and infinity, but quite But quite close to those. So just as we do in the rigid body and calculation of satellites and so on, everything is easier to work with in body training. And that's what we're going to do. And here we are, as I said, we're not allowing a skater to move. We use our configuration method SE3, so group of rotations and transcription. So, group of rotations and translations. So, variable would be lambda orientation at R position. And so the static scatter in the first part and for control, we allow a slight change of configuration. We're going to move an extra mass. It's not quite what really happens, but there is something that I'll tell you that is. Something that I'll tell you that is rather simplified, the assumption captures right, but really. So the Lagrangian is kinetic minus potential energy. So if you just try to do it straight out with coordinates and matrices of orientation, that's too many variables. So you want to have symmetry-reduce Lagrangian, and it depends on the And it depends on the angular velocity in the body frame and linear velocity y in the body frame. And then there is also, because you have gravity, you have a vector, we call it gamma, and that's how the scatter sees the vertical, the fixed vector direction. That's what we're going to measure the potential, the gravitational potential. So this first term is the rotational. One is the rotational kinetic energy. Second one is the translational kinetic energy. And the third one is the gravitational potential energy. There is, if you talk about SO3 group, you can do other groups, but then you have fewer constraints, but they're less nice to work with. So all another constraints are the pitch constancy, as I said, the front angle, you know. The front angle, you're not allowed to move forward or backward. The boot is very rigid. And the continuous eyes contact, because that's actually what's required for the figure skating, for a compulsory figure skating. And a non-holonomic constraint is the blade cannot move normal to itself. So, equations of motion, I'm not going to derive that, but it's a Lagrange-de-Lembert method with symmetry reduction. It's sometimes called Euler. It's sometimes called oil park or a suslow. Yeah, that's late. And these are the equations of motion. And you can see that there are three constraints. There are three Lagrange multipliers. And these Lagrange multipliers are up on. Kappa, lambda, and mu, and the blue one is a non-holonomic constraint. So the blue one comes from holonomic, the other one is holonomic. And these are the momenta, so the angular and linear momenta, the derivative of Lagrange with respect to appropriate velocities. And then gamma is rotating. Is rotating. So, gamma is just passively addicted. Because as we turn, as the scale of turns, gamma changes. So, it's very simple coefficient. So the phase, you know, there's, as you see, it's quite a few equations. There's actually three here, three here, three here, so nine, but nine is too much. Or nine, but nine is too much. There's actually fewer equations because you can see that the real variables, there's four of them. There are angle with respect to vertical because these angles are not allowed. They're not variables. So only this angle. The time derivative of this angle is also, we call it omega one. Omega two is like this velocity. That angle, the That angle, the angle withers, ice is the same. Well, unless there's judges somewhere or parents, you know, and then there's attraction, non-uniformity in space. But apart from that, the space is uniform. And then it's well known that under these conditions, you have conservation of energy. So it's a standard result of holding on mechanics. And that's for general moments of inertia. And A is the distance from this contact point to the center of mass. That's all you have. There's nothing else. So, but you can actually get some more useful information by thinking about symmetries and some metric. Some magic symmetries plus magic. So the system, as the way we looked at it, is invariant with respect to translation and rotation on the ice. But just I wanted to advertise, and I'll talk a little bit more about Tamoki's paper that just got some. Got submitted and it's available on archive. There's a very nice discussion of symmetry. You can actually consider the SC3 symmetry and the three, you know, there's a control. So I'll talk about that later. But there is additional symmetry if you have the projection of center of mass on the skate on the contact point. Of the contact point coincides with the contact point, so on the scale. And the reason why there is a symmetry, it creates symmetry because if that is true, if projection of center of mass on the point of contact coincides with the point of contact, and I rotate myself around the center of mass at an angle, then the blade doesn't grind in the ice. So you can rotate continuously. But if it doesn't coincide, you're But if it doesn't coincide, you rotate around the center of mass, the blade starts to drag, and you have so, in general, because it's non-holonomic system, just because you have a symmetry, you know, there are some conditions for Nertho-like theorems to be satisfied. So, in this case, you can show that if this is true, if this condition is true, that the center of mass lands on the contact point. Lands on the contact point, then there is conservation of angular, vertical angular momentum. But if it's not, then it's not conserved. But that's not enough because we have energy, we have this, right? We have a four-dimensional system. So we need one more equation. And this is where magic starts. And those of us who work in non-hole mechanics know that there is magic all over the place. So we are looking for first integrals as linear functions of momentum. And this is known as gauge integrals, and people thought about it for quite a while. And there are some theorems when they exist, they don't exist. So, anyway, you basically get to try and yeah, we're successful. So, it turns out, so if you look for If you look for something in that form, then it actually is conserved where this function beta is this arctangent something. So this is a realistic case. This is like typical figure scatter. Where does it come from? I don't know. And Tomoki has different equations for, you know, he obtained it and he gets the He obtained it and he gets the same integral, and it's also not clear with that comes from. So it's not clear what this integral is. It's just if. So, and that gives you the variability. So that was without any assumptions, right? Projection. The only assumption is projection of something. Yeah, so you need that from the durability. And so the reason. And so the result we have in that paper is: if that is satisfied, then these two integrals exist. It's very hard to create an inverse result because you don't know the other, well, you know that the integral, you know, the vertical angular momentum is not conserved, but there may be some two crazy cubic integral for some, you know, and you'll never find it. So I'm not saying that this is. This is if and only if, but I can throw some numerics that sort of tells you that it may be if and only if. I just don't know at all. But for our younger colleagues, I wanted to show this inspirational slide. And in Tony's book, there's an example of integrable non-holy anonymic systems. So when we teach mechanics, there's numerous examples of integrable systems. Example of integrable systems, there's chapters, books, how to derive them. But integrable non-holonomic system is basically something you can solve. And I don't know, I would say that fingers of two hands is enough to calculate the number of indecorble cases. So and one is a round sphere and so it is dynamically symmetric sphere with an offset center of mass. The offset center of mass. And there's the Chaplain sphere. It's in homogeneous sphere, so eyes, moments of motion are different, but center of mass is geometric center. There's Chaplain slate, there's Suslov problem. There's Suslov top, which is the same as a rigid body with constraints on angular velocity, but then with potential lessy low. These things are, I mean, they're kind of simple. I don't know, I still count them. But then, figure skating. And Devon, when he, you know, when we published the paper, he's an undergrad, right? Like, and these are not the last people in mechanics. So I think it was very inspiring for our younger colleagues. So I wanted to show you why we think it's if and only if for. We think it's if and only if for simulations. But we don't have a theorem proving that. But it is still. So if you take a, well, this particular example of a typical figure skater, I mean, not me, but somebody who looks like a figure skater, that then you take the A is the distance, remember, from the contact point to the center of mass. So you take A1 is zero meters. One is zero meters, is the integrable case, and we'll have it variable. I say 10 centimeters here, but we also will have it variable to see how the non-integerability happens. And then there's some A2 and A3 that's typical for human. And then we did some initial conditions. And you can see that the angular velocity is the left is integrable. Angular velocity is the left is integrable case, and you can see it's very periodic. The right case is not integrable, it's aperiodic. So this is angular velocity about the axis, so like this on the gone. This one is sorry, and this one is linear velocity. And if you look, plot other coordinates that will also look similar. Look similar. And if you go into three-dimensional space, you get closed curves. And in one case, something looks like a little bit messy. So it's four-dimensional system, right? It's a projection of three-dimensional. So it's going to be pretty messy looking. No reason to expect any service. And then if you see the energy along the solutions. Along the solutions, both chaotic and integrable cases are constant, as it should be. And only for integrable phase, you have an angular momentum brought the vertical. A1 equals zero is constant, and this mysterious J2 is constant. R hyperbolic engine. And then why I think it is if and only if is that if you start. If you start with the same energy and you increase A1, change A1, but you on the same energy surface, then as A1 increases, you will get more and more chaotic looking solution, and you can actually compute how the trajectory is spread and packed. And let's calculate the output of its phonon, and it seems to be increasing. Of its phone, and it seems to be increasing with A1. Well, that's a numerics, right? So it could drop here, you know, somewhere to zero, but you know, we don't know. Yeah, but you know, it looks positive. So basically, the figure skaters supposed to have their, well, I guess for integrability, not for control, but for integrability. Not for control, but for the variability, the projection onto the skate should be probably minimized. So that's our hypothesis. As close to integrability as possible, because otherwise you get very caloric solutions. And this is sort of the abuse of KAM theorem. If you have a parameter which is A1 and you increase that parameter, you get from integrable to non-integrable cases. How would you do that? Contegrable cases. How do you do that? Well, you're from here and moves worse and worse and worse and worse. Then I couldn't resist to put these pictures in there. So you start with integrable, right? And then here, and it is still, you know, five millimeters. So it's not much. But you can see how sensitive it is to this parameter able. Parameter A1. So everything seems to be dependent on this parameter A1. But I wanted to advertise the paper by Kamaki and his grad student. And they did a general analysis of symmetry breaking due to non-holonomic. They applied their theory to this particular case. Don't want you, what do you call it? Pendulum skater, right? Or something. Call it pendulum skater, right? Or something, yeah. Pendulum skater. I thought it was kind of almost not a previous skater. That's okay. So, pendulum skater. So, um, and um, they did a very nice calculation of uh all of Pancare systems, uh, with that, how to deal with a detective parameter for non-holonomic von Korea system. And they um got a new derivation for G1 and G2, and they also uh And they also figured out how to stabilize the unstable equilibrium. So please read that paper. It's available in the archive. And another one is the CDC control proceedings. So now we go to actual figure skating, tracing of figures. So we can't do it for the initial 3D skaters, 3D pendulum. 3D skaters, 3D pendulum. It's a little too complicated. So we did the we will do a simplified model which is based on Choplag and Slate with the moving mass, but we want to reproduce something like this. So the rules of the games are, and I can tell you why it's not popular anymore for television. So there is a picture that the skaters must Skaters must trace, and then they trace it, and I guess the judges crawl on ice and measure something. So you can imagine, you know, not a good advertising spot. But they do have their own competition, so they, you know, the mandatory, the compulsory speeds are separated, it's a separate sport. The important thing is that the speed is not. The speed is not important, so you allow a certain number of pushes, and you can do it at any speed you want. You can do it super fast, you can do it super slow, just as long as you're precise. Megan actually knows the world champion and figure skating, but bad figure skating, skating of figures. But the speed, the speed helps charger scales, you know, go very slowly. Yeah, people go excessively slow, but you don't also don't want to go too fast. But you don't also don't want to go too fast. If you look, there is a bunch of these videos of these competitions online, and they're going pretty slow. And I wanted to talk perhaps about Hamel's approach to mechanics before we go ahead with this. And so, general General Euler-Lagrange equation of motion, we have Lagrange's momenta, which is derivative, derivatives of Lagrange with respect to velocities. And the time derivatives of this momentum minus delta Q is F. So if you have a constraint system, especially non-electronic constraints, this gives Lagrange multipliers. I mean, we can deal with it, but it's a bit awkward. So Hannel decided, well, instead of Lagrange multipliers, Lagrange multipliers. In terms of geometry, if you think about a configuration manifold Q, and you have a tangent to that, TQ. So the coordinates on TQ are sort of slavishly follow the coordinates on Q, right? They're sort of connected on each tangent plane. So Heinrich said, Well, you don't have to. Hamel said, Well, you don't have to follow those coordinates, you can rotate them any way you want. And so that's the Hamel's transformation. We say that the velocities is some transformation depending on coordinates, and that's the nice thing about it, times quasi-velocity. And you substitute that into Lagrangian, and you get sort of modified Lagrangian in terms of quasi-velocities, their variational principle that leads to Hamlin's mechanics. How does it Hamless mechanics, how does it work? You take, well, the easiest way to write it, I mean, you can write it in coordinates too, but the easiest way to write it is you have GGQ and this is a vector field, and you get these, it looks like structure constant, but it's not any kind of Lie group or anything. And then you have, so we have this CIG, and these are Hamilton's equation models. And these are Hamlin's equation of motion. They reduce exactly to Euler-Lagrange equation if you have A is equal to identity. So for a non-holonomic system, it actually is really nice because it allows you to write equations of function without any Lagrange multipliers. There is actually extra equations for, if you choose the you choose the the quasi-velocities that sort of follow your follow your some of them follow your constraints and some of them are sort of chosen arbitrarily then the ones that follow your constraints they don't enter i mean they have lagrange multipliers in them but if you write them out the only thing that these equations say is that this um wise velocities have to be zero so that's the uh um and then And that's why you don't have any Lagrange multipliers. It's very nice. So you have exactly the same number of equations as you have unknowns, no Lagrange multipliers. And I mean, Dmitry Dankov has taught me a lot. Oh, he knows a lot about this. So I'm not an expert in this, but in this particular case, it's very. But it's in this particular case, it's very useful for calculation. So, and the reason why I used the, I wanted to throw this slide is because that we're going to use Chapligan's sleigh with the added mass to trace the desired trajectoronize. And there's people. And there's people who work who have worked on Chapley's lay without a mask, not on this particular case trajectory facing, but the dynamics, integrability, and some control. So the Osborne and Zenco, when it's going to follow, is they actually were talking about Talking about having desired trajectories, but not in the case of specified trajectory. And I did that because I tried to derive this equations of motion using Lagrange Dallant here. I tried it for a while and for a week or so. And every time I derived it, I got different answers. So I asked Dimitri, and he said, why are you wasting your life on? Say, why are you wasting your life on this? Just use Hamill's equation. And it's true. Hamill's equation will give you results right away. And so the coefficient manifold is SO2. And there is X, Y, and theta. So theta is this vertical rotation. And the constraint on velocity is basically that you can't move normal to it. And so we choose quasi-velocities: one as vertical rotation, one as along the Vertical rotation one is along the plane, along the escape, in other words, perpendicular to escape, and that's the one that's zero. So then you have none, you can derive the non-holonomic momenta, and they have this particular case, they have a physical meaning that you can identify. And these are equations of motion. So the same ones as Osborne and Zenkov. So P1. Was born in Zenkov. So P1 dot equals something, P2 dot equals something. And so xi1 is linear, I remind you, is angular velocity, and xi2 is linear velocities. And then in terms of coordinates A and B, so A and B is the coordinates of the added mass on the slide. You know, there's complicated equations if you, but they come from inverting some linear system. Gamma is a determinant of something. So here's a statement of the problem. We started that and you have some piecewise smooth plane curve and you find initial conditions and some A. Initial conditions and some A and B A dot and B dot such such that you minimize distance between your curve, your dynamics, what you trace on the ice cycle. And AI is very important and we decided it's not solvable. We tried all kinds of things and it's not an AI kind of problem because the sequence. The sequence of mapping these trajectories into trajectories on ICE. It's a very complicated map. You can't really learn it. Or don't go there. So I think eventually we learn using some kind of reinforcement learning in our brain. But we try to split it up into little pieces, and I will show that there is actually some control. Actually, some control interesting control theory which may tell you how great our brain is hopefully. So we sort of struggled a little bit and then Negan had a suggestion, why don't we make sort of an alphabet of trajectories? Because that's how we start scaling. And what's the first? Look at the alphabet, well, it's a circle. So we try a circle. A circle, and as it turns out, if it is a circle, then you have the motion of, not control masses, but the motion of the point, a quadrant point satisfies psi two equals r psi watch, the angular and linear loss to connect, where r is the r is the three of the curve. The radius of the curve. And then you, from the equations of motion, you see that there is an affine relationship between A dot and B dot. So A and B are coordinates with respect to the Chaplain slayer of the mass. And so there's some A times A dot plus B times B dot A. And these are some complicated things. But the proof is very easy. It's just a definition. The proof is very easy, it's just a definition of circle and polar coordinates, basically. But then if you are on a circle, if you're tracing a circle, it turns out it's a very special curve for Japanese slate because it gives you an integral of motion p1 and p2 also in it. So, interestingly enough, no matter how a and b. Interestingly enough, no matter how A and B move, you will still have an integral of motion. P1 and P2 do something of it. So given a circular trajectory, so let's say we want to trace a circular trajectory, you can, in principle, select B dot and calculate A dot, but or the other way around, but there are singularities. If you have A or B equals zero, then the speed is infinite. Speed is an infinite, which is sort of not good. I think you could say, well, it's, you know, you move something really fast, human best, but within a month infinite space. So the suggestion from one of the referees was, and perhaps one of the referees, these referee, who suggested that, is in the audience, I would like to thank that anonymous. Audience, I would like to thank them. It wouldn't surprise me if they're in the audience, but you don't have to say it. So they say, Well, what if you have a lazy figure sticker? I want to minimize the effort. And we said, ah, that was a good idea. So, what if you have the velocity velocities that are minimized subject to Subject to the constraint that you are tracing a circular trajectory. So this depends on. So you can see that there's simple minimization procedure. And lo and behold, no singularities. So that's a very robust lazy fibrous scatter. It's not quite correct to say it's kinetic energy because it's relatively lost. So and it's unphysical to. And it's unphysical to say relative kinetic energy. There's no such thing. But something like this is minimized. And then we say, well, there's actually we can wait in the result from 95 about just like splits. You can approximate any curve circles. So and then basically, you know, the distance between the arcs. So So, what we do is we approximate the trajectory by circular arcs. Then, you have these cusps, and at the corners of these cusps, megan, not me, but megan, can make a turn. So that's what they do. Get to the corners and make a turn. But they only can make turns if the velocity, linear velocity, is zero. Otherwise, we sort of follow. So at the edges. Follow so at the edges, at the cusps, the control is to be such that your skater reaches zero velocities. So, and then if your trajectory is an arc, then the precision is infinite, right? So, you will trace it exactly. And we put the, I mean, the Uh, I mean, the ancient book of ladies and gentlemen and ice doesn't specify you know which spline parameters used, obviously. So we just approximated the arcs as much as we could. And so this is an example of one arc. So this is an XY plane. And this is psi two, which goes does something, but goes from zero to zero. zero to zero and a there's a of t and b of t so a is the distance along the skate and b is the distance of s perpendicular to the skate and a doesn't have to be continuous because a third at each at each cusp so so if a is allowed to be discontinuous um and then uh um this is uh This is a trajectory which comes like this: one of the outer trajectories. So, if you remember this flower-like thing that had the pre-customer, and this you actually can do it along Felsoup, you can calculate and match these points. There's, as I said, this control system is very robust, a lazy degree scatter. So then this is the final pattern that you get. Yeah. So we win. So the conclusions are, you know, okay, so obviously it's some abstract thing, right? So but it's already But is are any autonomous vehicles for which ellipses or circles or something or satellites, you know, moving on a sphere? I don't know. Is there a special, something special about circular trajectories? There's underwater vehicles, there is a people argue whether it's non-holonomic or vacuum. Vacuum out there. So some people in the audience know way more about it. And I'm sure the discussions are quite heated. So I don't know the answer to that question, but it will be interesting to see. And then there is, Omega told me about this injury, which sounds pretty bad. It's called catching up a plate, where the skate goes one way. The skate goes one way, and the knee goes the other way, and there's a torque. So, we want to model it using an elastic rod, not a rigid rod. And so somewhere you lose infigurability. And Vaughan is actually building a robot. So bad signs are being on bad road or something. They'll be interested. So that's the first part of my talk. So that's the first part of my talk. And I, as I said, I spent some time in industry. So I don't know if we want to take questions. And the organizer asked me to talk about my experience. So I don't know if you want to take questions about the question. So I have a couple brings back memories that I have a little interesting one is Keynes equations. Keynes equations a lot in all equations, especially in the space. Yeah, yeah. Hamel's equations added another pair of rigs. So I'm just curious why you chose Handler. Because my friend Dmitry told me that, but and he already had the equations. I mean, he derived equations, but I heard about Keynes' equation. We haven't tried them yet, but I think that's a good idea. I think Hammond's equations is not like you need natural, right? Because those quasi-velocities, you can find them any way you want. So my understanding is that Keynes' equations. Yes, and my understanding is the King's equations are special choice of quality points. Yes, yes, and they come from Gibbs. Yeah, when I talk about space, we've got so there's also something I was curious about. The projection of the center of mass down state. So now speed doesn't matter. How speed doesn't matter. I was just curious, as you vary that offset, I feel like speed creates, I mean, this is just intuition, physical intuition, but speed would show up in creating some kind of gyroscopic stability to allow for less divergence in trajectories. Oh, that way, yeah, yeah. I think it's definitely, those lap and components definitely depend within it your surface. Yeah, because I was like, I was just by intuition. Yeah, definitely. Just by intuition. Yeah, definitely. And we, I mean, we try quite a few things and it's kind of hard to quantify it. We were looking, maybe we can find some dips or something in terms of, you know, just to look for more integral, but we couldn't find anything. But I think if somebody wants to do, there's much more numerics to be done. It's just the stability analysis to do this. I'm just curious if there's that optimal. I'm just curious if there's an optimal speed, one that maintains stability, but still, because there's got to be some robustness to how far you're away from the original project and how fall over leading over here, not leading. Yeah, yeah. Well, Komokia analyzed stability of spins like this and straight lines. So straight lines were always unstable. That's right. Spins are, but you could stabilize it and then using. Stabilize it and then using control or gravity, and then spins like this are condition of state, which if you spin fast enough, yeah, and I think that's because of the Jarson telescope, it's really right, which shows up in space path as well. But thank you very much, David. Thank you. Sorry, David. Well, I just simply, yeah, you have all of these first intervals at one point. And if you're looking for the families of swans, I mean, if you've got enough first intervals, I mean, things like First integral, I mean, things like hyperlink functions or something like that. Oh, um, yeah, the first integrals, uh, they were for 3D. The circles were for 2D, so that's a different system with control. But I agree with you, there's like you know, choplicking slate has a lot of difference. But yeah, I mean, we for control, if you move, you move your weight, you Move you move your weight of your mass, additional mass, a lot of those integrals die, but some of them survive. And so, we haven't dug into everything, you know, consistent theory helps to preserve the integrals. So maybe that's the way to analyze the right alphabet, you know, which curves survive using, you know because because you know, Choplin slain is very particular desired trajectories. Desired projectors. The other thing is, remind me of: we did stuff 10 years ago when we were interested in sort of motion description language for things like robots dancing. And, you know, this idea of emotional figure described led to people who tried to sort of develop formal languages to express choreography. Choreography and a lot about sauce because that's a particularly simple form of dance. But you could do this with skating too, I would imagine. We could and definitely I can say that Megan was very happy when I got the special results for circles because she says that you actually study, you know, start figure skating by studying circles. So there's something about circles that's also particular to us. To us, so but I agree. I mean, then there's it's like uh well, there's not don't have ellipses, there's something do we escape by approximating just circles, you know? Well, no, but these things with cusps and things like that does look like what you would expect to see, I think, right? Yeah, there's uh there's cusps and uh um there are yeah, so so circles and cusps, right? But are there like ill. And cusps, right? But are there like ellipses of federal professional things? That's not clear to me. I mean, I know professionals can do it, nice. I don't know much beyond that. It's gonna hardly be. There's probably some articulation of the body. It's yeah, it's like a constant state. And under the assumptions that you had, it's you know, those are probably the people who are. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, thank you. Any other questions? Yeah. People that design highways, they're not straight or circular, but they're increasing curvature, say, around the turn, they make it linear in the curvature increases linearly in the arc. You're steering, turning the steering wheel out of constants. Ah, interesting. So you say there's over some trajectors where something moves linearly at time. Yeah, yeah, that could be. And if you saw, remember the trajectories is A's and B's, I mean they're kind of sinusoidal looking and roughly I mean they're not sinusoidal, but they're not straight lines, but but I see what you're saying, well maybe there's reverse man. Well, maybe there's reverse map. I would imagine the skater knows that instinctively, yeah, as they tighten the circle. Yeah, and apparently, tightening the circle to zero, you know, those spins are where these are actually one of the most hard, the hardest trajectories, hardest elements. You're supposed to do a really tiny circle on ice, but you can never do it. Theoretical figure state. Any more questions? We can move to part two. Part two. Thank you. So, I was asked by the organizers to talk about my experience in industry. I was for three years, I was working at a company called ATCO. Working at a company called ATCO. Some of those of you who live in Alberta, you probably know there's construction trucks and utilities. And so I led the science and tech part of what's called transformation team. It was great fun. And that's a great company to work for. And there's some great companies to work for, and some are not so great. So, but I think this is for our younger colleagues. Our younger colleagues, I would strongly encourage you to open your mind to outside academia. I think that's deployment of industry presents great opportunities. And the question is, what do you need for successful employment in industry? And I can only say it for our team, you know, and I consider good, really good industry. A really good industry and really good experience. So, and it's not unlike academia in some levels. And you, one of the things you won't do is publish. You don't, like, usually your bonus or whatever salary doesn't depend on how many papers you publish. There's other, I mean, you have to solve problems or solutions, and it has to be understandable. And it has to be understandable and good, and you know. But you need to understand, I mean, it's not unlike what we're doing. You need to understand the problem from both, you know, physics and engineering and math. But there's also business modeling, which makes sense to do it or infinitely expensive or break down all the time, you know. And one of the things that we strongly discourage people to do is discourage people to do is not to lead from solutions. So, you know, let's say, oh, I heard about this new AI method, must be used for something. And you know, in academia, we are often guilty of stuff like this too. It's probably human nature. And it's not a good example leading from solutions. Now, difference in academia is that you will be asked to learn new things. To learn new things quickly if you are in that sort of creative environment. There's some industries where don't respect me, but if you're in the right kind of industry which challenges your creativity, then you will have to switch and learn new things and be uncomfortable sometimes because learning new things is uncomfortable. And you won't be hyper-specialized, but you should be able to take somebody's. Be able to take somebody's papers and quickly understand what they write and why and limitations of their methods. You should enjoy working as a part of the team because be open and transparent with your colleagues and try not to hog all their words for yourself. This is actually one of my interests is the theory of dictators, and I went to Plato. Plato already says that the Plato already says that the good workers, good advisors, you know, behave like this. They have hearts of gold and they do it for pure spirit. You know, that's when any kind of... Did you notice the dictators rise when you were using dictators? No. Well, like I was not a dictator. Well, maybe I was. I definitely try to avoid being a dictator. But no. But no, the recent political events, geopolitical events got me into reading Plato and trying to find counter arguments to apologists, dictatorships. And you should be open and transparent with your colleagues, what you're doing, why you're doing it, all the information for yourself. And so when people say, well, what should I learn? People say, well, what should I learn? Well, it actually doesn't matter what you learn because you will have to relearn it. So, if what you need is a solid foundation. And of course, when we hired, we wanted people to have achieved something. We usually hire the PhDs. So, it should be some kind of mountain of knowledge, which celebrates in the peak. You have achieved something, improved what you can solve. Achieved something, improved that you can solve a difficult problem. I mean, a delta function is not very useful. Nothing to build on if you want to do something else. So when people say, to ask me, you know, whether professors or students, what courses should we teach, should we take? My opinion is irrelevant because, you know, knowing academia, Academia. You know, it's, you know, any kind of program takes five to ten years to put together, and it's probably five years behind when it was designed. So wherever you, you know, these ideas that we should try to chase the latest fashionable things and put them in the program, well, by the time they're put in the program, they're not latest, either latest or fashionable. So, but the solid foundation that you Foundation that you acquire or teaches professors is, I think, crucial because with the foundation, you can learn anything you need. It doesn't matter what it is. But without foundation, if it's just, you know, the professors were chasing the latest fashions, it's not a good idea. A lot of cavities and knowledge then. So there are buildings. Uh, so the ability if they uh, if you do an interview, we had that pretty, uh, I would say, interesting and fun. Um, some people say they're brutal, but I think it was interesting and fun for those who passed that, probably, for those who didn't, there weren't that much fun. Um, we did have math exam, you know, because I think the prerequisite of knowledge is math, you know, and then we have the credit exam, and then we had real. Cheese exam and then we're really through. And you have to create beyond, you have to be able to think creatively and don't limit yourself. Well, I haven't studied this machine learning method, so I'm not going to do anything else. No, that's not going to work. But also you need to understand the context. Don't look at just formulas to solve the problem. Just formulas to solve problems. Because I want to apply this formula or meet this method, this is not really good. And if you don't have enthusiasm to discover working problems, you'll get all pretty fast. So yeah, it's not for everybody, but I think it's a fascinating career. It's a fascinating career and can be very rewarding, both intellectually and financially, of course. But we are looking mostly for PhDs because, I mean, we were open to everybody, but somehow only PhDs could pass our exams. But our math exam was undergrad, basically. But it's the creativity, the depth of thinking. Creativity, the depth of thinking. If you have the right PhD, the right knowledge, it works really well. But it could also work really badly. But if you do the right PhD, you don't find shortcuts to solution. You expect it to solve to think deeply. So I'm looking for some folks who are interested in postdoc internship opportunities in industry. Opportunities and industry with APCO. So, if you're interested, especially if you have Canadian citizenship or PR, let me know. But even if you don't, write to me and maybe we can figure something out. Thank you. Questions about this part that is resurrected behind the early part. Back behind. Oh, sorry, I can't have that stop recording. All right, so this is the end of
