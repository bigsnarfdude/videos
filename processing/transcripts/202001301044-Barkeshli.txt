It isn't about fractons necessarily, but at some point I'll comment on some of the relations, why it should be interesting, even if you're interested in fractons. But it's really about, this is about solving an issue that has sort of been around for the last five to ten years in the theory of symmetry-enriched topological phases, which is the problem of understanding anomalies in sort of complete generality. Sort of complete generality that we've been tackling. So, this is work done with Daniel Bulmash. It's a paper that should appear hopefully soon. And there's several earlier related works. So, I wrote a paper with Meng Chang about relative anomalies in the summer. And then these are papers from a few years ago, some of which I'll be using extensively in this talk. And just as a this talk is specific to bosonic topological phases. To bosonic topological phases of matter, so systems where the microscopic degrees of freedom are all bosons, as opposed to fermionic systems. So we all know that in topologically ordered phases, if you have symmetry, you can have fractional symmetry quantum numbers. So in the absence of symmetry, the properties of topologically ordered phases of matter in two dimensions are characterized by the fusion and braiding properties of anions. If you add symmetry to the story, you can get fractional and quantum numbers. To the story, you can get fractional and quantum numbers under the symmetry group G, and so that's what we call symmetry fractionalization. And I think everyone knows the sort of famous canonical example: the fractional electric charge of quasi-particles and the fractional quantum Hall effect, which is only defined if we have U1 charge conservation symmetry. The spin-ons, i.e. the spin-1 half excitations in quantum spin liquids, are fractional, have fractional quantum numbers under SO3 spin rotation symmetry. Somewhat less well-known one is if you have. Somewhat less well-known one is if you have time reversal symmetry. Even if t squares to plus one on the many body state, the anions can locally have t squared equals minus one, so the anions can locally carry a Cromer's degeneracy, which locally t squares to minus one, which is another example of fractional quantum numbers under time-reversal symmetry. So one of the developments over the last few years was the understanding that symmetry fractionalization can be anomalous. So what do we mean by anomaly? anomaly. One way of stating what an anomaly is, for example, if you're talking about an anomaly in two plus one dimensions, what that means is that there's some kind of obstruction to defining the theory in purely two plus one dimensions. And one way of thinking about what that obstruction is, is that it's an obstruction to defining a consistent theory of symmetry defects. If you're a field theorist, the language that you might use is the theory makes perfect sense in the absence of background fields for the symmetry group, but when you Fields for the symmetry group, but when you turn on background fields, the theory becomes inconsistent. That's what the high-energy field theorists would say. So, some standard examples are the single Dirac cone at the surface of a topological insulator. There you have U1 charge conservation and time reversal symmetry. And if you impose that, that can only occur at the surface of a 3 plus 1 D Ti. So, this 2 plus 1D theory would be anomalous. The chiral fermion at the chiral fermion in 1 plus 1D, that Carol fermion in 1 plus 1d that occurs at the boundary of a quantum Hall system. And the original one, the axial anomaly for 3 plus 1d dirac fermions, another example of anomaly which is related to pion decay in the standard model. Now it's conjectured that all anomalous symmetry fractionalization classes, so whenever we encounter some kind of obstruction, you can then realize that symmetry fractionalization class at the surface of a higher dimensional SPT. A higher dimensional SPT. So if you have 2 plus 1D topological order with anomalous symmetry fractionalization, we think that that can always occur at the surface of a 3 plus 1d SPT, but it has not yet been proven. It's not the status of the conjecture. So one of the things that I'm going to do in this talk is just prove this by explicit construction and complete generality. Now, why are we interested in anomalies? Anomalies are extremely powerful constraints on many-body physics. They're non-perturbative constraints. Physics. They're non-perturbative constraints. So we all grow up knowing that symmetry is an important aspect of physics, but anomalies are another important aspect which often isn't emphasized quite as much as symmetry. And in fact, anomalies are kind of topological invariant of renormalization group flows, which is what makes them so powerful. You only consider uh one dimension above the so two plus ones and three plus one. So do you not consider higher order anomalies? Anomalies? How do you think of those? Hierarchy I's for example. I don't really have, I don't know how to think about those in sort of a general framework right now. I mean here the well you'll see but the idea is like you set up some kind of pattern of symmetry fractionalization, you realize that there's something wrong with it, and I'm going to show you that you can always realize it at the boundary of 3 plus 1. But I think your boundary doesn't have another boundary. Have another boundary. That's right. Yeah. I think for the higher order situation, it's more like you need to impose an additional crystalline symmetry on the system that's one dimension higher. And then you might be forced to go even one dimension above that. But that wouldn't be included in this framework. Okay, so just one important example of an anomaly is, you know, there's this important theorem in condensed matter physics, the Lieb Schultz-Mattis theorem. Matter of fact, the Leipschlz-Mattis theorem. And it turns out that the Leipschlight-Mattis theorem places extremely strong constraints on the infrared behavior of some spin of a spin model, like a spin one-half model where you have spin one-half per unit cell. And it turns out that the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem is actually related to the existence of a mixed anomaly between on-site symmetry and translation symmetry. And once you view the Lieb Schultz-Mattis theorem in this way, then you realize that you can actually Realize that you can actually significantly strengthen the Liebschulz-Mattis theorem by thinking about anomalies in sort of more general contexts. Okay, so what's the question now? Given a topological order and some pattern of symmetry fractionalization, the question is, how do you, we just want a theory for how you calculate the anomaly. So one thing that we would like is we'd like, for example, a general proof that every time you have an anomalous symmetry fractionalization class, An anomalous symmetry fractionalization class in 2 plus 1d, it can occur at the surface of a 3 plus 1d SPT. And furthermore, we would like to just have a systematic method to determine which 3 plus 1d SPT you have to exist at the surface of. So that way, you give me some lattice model, and I'll be able to tell you what patterns of symmetry fractionalization would be allowed in two dimensions, what patterns would be allowed at the surface of a 3 plus 1 dspt, and so on. Can I also? And so, what is it? Is there a systematic way of discovering that you have an anomaly? So, that's the that's how, yes, yes, and that's what I'm going to show you. Yeah. Excuse me. If I remember correctly, you described it. Because Pedroski is something simple because one be a lot of older symmetry, they would require another cost one to S and T instead of three plus one P D. So that's not a symmetry fractionalization anomaly, that's something else, a symmetry localization anomaly. So, here when I say, Anomaly. So here when I say anomaly, I'm really talking about symmetry fractionalization anomalies. And I'll mention a few words about that actually. So just a comment on, you know, if you're just interested in fractons, while you might still be interested in this kind of thing. And this is basically because of this paper that is going to appear, which I'm very excited about and have been for a long time and disappointed that it's not out yet. So, but this is summarized in the paper by Danny, in the talks by Danny and Kevin. In the talks by Danny and Kevin, and the point is that we can view fracton models as some network of defects in a topological quantum field theory. And so what the lesson here, one of the lessons, is that to fully understand the space of fracton models, we need to understand defects in topological quantum field theories. And understanding anomalous symmetry fragmentalization classes is like one basic step towards understanding codimension one defects more generally. Okay, so this is how I view it. Okay, so this is how I view this as being part of this broader picture. Okay, so what's been done so far? So, so far, our ability to calculate anomalies has been very restricted to certain classes of symmetries and certain ways that symmetries act on the topological order. So, first, if you assume that the symmetry is unitary and it preserves the parity of space and it does not permute the anions, Permute the anions, then these works understood how you could calculate the anomaly, how you could figure out which 3 plus 1 d SPT you have to be at the surface of. And it goes back to some work in the mathematical community, and then it was picked up in the condensed matter community a few years later. But this basic formula was sort of goes back to this 2009 paper. But you see, this is very restrictive because it doesn't include time-reversal symmetries, it doesn't include spatial reflection symmetries, it doesn't include Spatial reflection symmetries. It doesn't include symmetries that can permute anions, more importantly. If you restrict to time-reversal symmetry, for that, a few years ago, some of the progress was that we understood how you calculate anomalies. And a simple formula was given for how you calculate what the anomaly is for time-reversal symmetry. That happened in 2016. And also, over the last few years, if your symmetry group is U1 semi-direct Z2 time reversal or U1 cross-Z2 time reversal, E1 cross, E2 time reversal. There were also a number of works that showed how you can find the anomaly. But aside from this, there hasn't been a general method to do it. I think this ran out of badness. Does anyone have like another thing? I don't want to throw it. So, my talk's about bosonic systems. It's true that. Talks about bosonic systems. It's true that some of these works have, like the two and three, have been extended to fermionic systems as well. Yeah. Thank you. Okay, so there's kind of two main approaches to solving. Two main approaches to solving this problem if you want to have completely general results. One is you can study what are called relative anomalies, which is you consider two different symmetry fractionalization patterns, and then you ask what the difference in anomalies are between those two. It turns out that's a much easier question to answer, and that's what we did a few years in the summer, and also building on this earlier work. And the other is absolute anomalies, which is you just give me a symmetry fractionalization class and you tell me what the anomaly is. Translation class, and you tell me what the anomaly is. So that's what I'm going to be talking about in this talk. So I just, you know, first brief review of the theory of anions, modular tensor category theory. I think in this audience, most people are familiar with this. So the idea is you have some finite set of quasiparticle types. So you can consider a basis of states where to each region, to some sequence of regions, you would associate some fixed topological charge. We have diffusion rules, and we have. And we have these fusion and splitting spaces. So we have a vector space, VABC, and then it's a dual space, VCAB. And the dimension of this vector space is just the fusion coefficients. And we represent a vector in this vector space by this diagram. So the utility of this is that you can then build up, if you have a state with n anions at various locations, you can build it up by first saying this anion, this anion, fuse to... This anion, this anion fuse to another anion, and then that one fuses with that one. I mean, so you can build up this fusion tree, and these, and that, and so that state lives in a tensor product of these local vector spaces. Now, we have these F symbols, which are basis transformations between different fusion trees. We have R symbols, which describe braiding. And these F and R symbols are subject to some consistency conditions, pentagon and hexagon equations. And this data defines what's called a braided fusion. Defines what's called a braided fusion category. There are gauge transformations, so you can do local basis transformations on these vector spaces, and that changes the F and R symbols. So inequivalent topological orders are associated with gauge inequivalent consistent choices of diffusion coefficients, F symbols, and R symbols. And so the point is that this consistent set of data is what characterizes topological order in 2 plus 1 dimensions. Now we add symmetry to the story. So we have a global symmetry, and the idea is that first we need to figure out how the global symmetry, when you implement it, permutes the anions. So if I have anions A, B, C at different places, and it act with the symmetry operation, then those anions can permute into a different set of anions, GA, GB, GC. Now, when I permute the anions, that then has an action on those vector spaces and the F symbols and the R symbols. Vector spaces and the F symbols and the R symbols. So when I, so this rho G maps this vector space VABC to the permuted vector space. And if we pick a basis, we can represent this map by a set of matrices, which is this UG. So this UG will play an important role in this talk. So you should remember what this UG is. It's the action of the symmetry transformation on this fusion space. Space. And this ought C is the group of automorphisms of the module tensor category. So it's the group of permutations that you can do on the anions without changing the topological quantum numbers. So without changing the fusion and grading statistics. So this also has an action on R, so you get these equations where schematically it looks like this. So you can use these equations. Once you specify how the symmetry permutes the anions, then you can solve these equations and obtain. Solve these equations and obtain this UG. Okay, so once you know how the symmetry permutes anions, that specifies these set of matrices, UGs. So far, what we have is we have a set of data, which is this rho and U, which I've defined here. And one motivation for all these constraints is that you want to guarantee that all closed diagrams that you draw for the anions, they should be all g-symmetric. So that's sort of where these conditions come from. Yes. Come from. Can I ask that? Yes. So like you mentioned, inversion symmetry. Yes. So that, does that, you know, what does that do to the, how does that act in the NEM? Well, so if G is space-time purity reversing, then you would need to make sure that you put complex conjugations here. But it doesn't, it doesn't do anything. What does it do to the anion? Well, so time, like if you have, say, spatial reflection symmetry, that has to take an anion to another anion whose spatial reflection. Another anion whose spin is reversed. Oh, I see. So you necessarily. So in some cases, like for Toric code, you don't have to permute anions because the spins are all zero or one half. For other theories, like the doubled semion, you necessarily have to permute the anions. Okay, so once we have this row, that immediately defines an element that lives in the third cohomology group, where this A is an abelian group, which is Is abelian group which is defined by the fusion of the abelian anions. And I'm not going to say much about this at all, so I'm going to assume this O is trivial, but O is an obstruction to symmetry localization. So your comment, Juven, was about the situation where O is non-trivial, the paper by Lukash that you mentioned. But I'm going to assume this O is trivial for the following. Okay, so now we come to this idea of symmetry localization. So you have a ground state, you assume the ground state is symmetric. Assume the ground state is symmetric. Now you consider the state with two quasi-particles at far separated locations, and you apply your symmetry transformation. You ask what happens. Well, now that symmetry is going to permute your particles, so A is going to become GA, A bar is going to become GA bar. But far away from these anions, the system locally looks like its ground state. So we have an onsatz that the way that this should act is that you should have local unitaries in the two regions, that's UG1 and UG2, but there should still be another But there should still be another action, ρg, which is specifying sort of the action on the fusion tree, the global state space of the system. So you still need to carry that around. If the symmetry does not permute anions, it turns out you can always set this U to 1. So that's what Mike Hermelli and Andrew Eston had done a while ago. Okay, so the point of this H3 that I mentioned is that this onsats is This onsatz is consistent if you consider associativity of three group elements, only if this element O that I mentioned earlier is trivial. So I'm just going to assume that for now. So now what is symmetry fractionalization? The point of symmetry fractionalization is that you look at these local unitaries, and the point is that even if the way that the symmetry acts on the global state space is such that it forms a linear representation, the local unitaries can form something like a projected representation. Like a projective representation. It's not actually a projective representation. We should stop using those words. It's kind of like a projective representation. And what specifically happens is that you get an equation that looks like this when you consider g and h. And the important point is these etas. So these etas are the data that characterizes what is symmetry fractionalization. Okay, so this is now a math. We've turned it into mathematics. We know exactly what we mean when we say symmetry fractionalization. It's these choice of etas. Of etas. And there's a general result here, which isn't really important for my talk, which is that symmetry fractionalization is classified by the second group cohomology of G with coefficients of A. Where does eta live? Eta is just a phase. Is it what? Eta is a phase. But it has certain important properties. Like eta A of G H times eta B of G H is equal to eta C of G H if A B fuses the C. That's like an important property. So can you just elaborate why? Elaborate. Why is it not projecting representation? Because I have this rho g here. Like, if I didn't have this rho g, rho g inverse, I would just have u g, uh equals ugh up to a phase, but I have this guy. That's one reason. Also, like, you have these constraints on these etas. So it's, like, a little bit more subtle exactly what it is. And you're only demanding that this equation holds the yeah, you're also demanding that this yeah, that's true. Also, demanding that this, yeah, that's true. Acting on that set of sticks. Okay, so if symmetries do permute anions, the idea here is that the difference between symmetry fractionalization classes is classified by this H2. So it's not that H2 characterizes symmetry fractionalization. It's that different classes are related to each other by elements of H2. So if you just give me an element of H2, you haven't specified to me the symmetry fractionalization class. You've only specified to me the difference between two symmetry fractionalization classes. Between two symmetry fractionalization classes. So, really, you need these etas to characterize symmetry fractionalization in general. So, now, a useful way of talking about symmetry fractionalization is to start thinking about symmetry defects. So, if you're working with a lattice model, you can insert a symmetry defect by taking a cut through the system, removing all the terms in the Hamiltonian along this cut, and then putting them back. But when you put them back, you conjugate operators that straddle the cut. That straddle the cut, you conjugate one side by elements of the symmetry group. So that's kind of a general prescription to create symmetry defects. In space, we would depict the symmetry defect by like a branch cut labeled by G. And if it ends, you can have distinct top-level distinct endpoints. So we need an additional label, so that's why we have AG here. In space-time, this G Dffect looks like a sheet. And if we have an anion going through that G Dffect sheet, it permits to a different kind of anion. kind of anion. So now I can talk about symmetry fractionalization in a convenient way. I can consider in space-time I have a GH defect as splitting into G and an H defect. And I can consider the situation where I take an anion X through G and then through H. And then I can compare that to the process where I take it through GH. And the idea is I get this phase, eta X of G H. The u's I can also describe in a similar way. If I have a diagram, so it's like a fusion That's like a fusion or splitting space. So anion C comes in and splits into AB, I can have those anions go through a symmetry defect. And then if I pass that symmetry defect through the vertex, I get this U acting. So that was the same U that I had introduced earlier, but now I have a diagrammatic representation for it. And so the point is that distinct symmetry fractionalization classes are characterized by inequivalent and consistent choices of these etas, and then the different classes. And then the different classes can all be related to each other by this element of H2 that I mentioned earlier. So I mentioned consistent choices of eta. So there's a bunch of consistency conditions where you need to think about consistency between eta and u, and that leads to these kinds of equations. And this also, Leo, answers your question, because why is this not a projective representation? It looks like it is, except here I have g bar acting on A. So this is not the usual two-co-cycle condition if I allow permutations of anions. Mutations of anions. Now, these u's and etas also have gauge transformations. They look like this. So the point is that consistent gauge inequivalent choices of eta and u characterize symmetry fractionalization. You can also derive similar types of equations for anti-unitary symmetries like time reversal, where you don't have to use symmetry defects to derive those. So now I can state the problem a little bit more precisely, actually. So symmetry defects, just like anions, Defects, just like anions, must satisfy some set of consistency conditions for braiding and fusion. And for unitary spacetime parity-preserving symmetry, this leads to a new mathematical structure called a G-crossed braided tensor category. And the failure to satisfy these consistency conditions is an anomaly. And the mathematicians had shown that there's an obstruction to defining a G-cross-braded tensor category that lives in the fourth cohomology group. And actually, even in the math community, it's kind of been an open question. Community, it's kind of been an open question since this paper to actually understand how you calculate this obstruction in general. No one ever did it. So the idea is that symmetry fractionalization data must determine an element in H4. And we also know that 3 plus 1 d SPTs are at least partially classified by H4. So the idea is given an anion theory C and some symmetry fracturization pattern specified by rho u eta, determine the three. U eta determine the 3 plus 1 d SPT that hosts this 2 plus 1d theory at its surface. That's what we'd like to do. So the main idea is: given this module tensor category C and the symmetry fracturalization data, the symmetry group, how the symmetry groups pernute anions, and these U's and etas that I mentioned, I'm going to show you how you can define a 3 plus 1D topologically invariant path integral, state sum. And I'm going to show you that the path integral describes a 3 plus 1d SPT, and then I'm going to show you. plus 1 d SPT. And then I'm going to show you that the surface theory of that, the 2 plus 1 d surface theory, is a symmetry enriched topological state whose data is again specified by C, G, rho, U, and eta, which were the same data that we input into the theory. Okay, that's the logic. Now what does this give us? Well, this gives us anomaly indicators because now we can just calculate this path integral on the appropriate G bundle, and then we can figure out what SPT. And then we can figure out what SPT we have. It gives an explicit method for computing this absolute H4 obstruction. The method also works for arbitrary types of spacetime reflecting symmetries. And furthermore, not only does it give us anomaly indicators, it also just gives us a proof by explicit construction that every symmetry fractionalization class can be realized at the surface of a 3 plus 1D SPT. Nathan, does it work for continuous symmetries? I actually think it does. Yeah. I think we could try to do an example, but we have. I think we could try to do an example, but we haven't yet. It's just that the sum would become a sum that becomes an integral. But isn't the statement that it's really h4 of g, u1 a little subtle for continuous symmetries? Okay, that's true. So I'm not going to, I don't have anything like real to say about continuous symmetries aside from the fact that some things should work. I don't know. We haven't really studied it. Okay, so let me just mention some previous related constructions. So like so you take a field like a two plus one dimensional figure you have this data and you cannot satisfy consistently this these constraints. So then there's an anomaly. So then I'm going to take that data, which is anomalous, and then I'm going to feed it into some construction. And that construction is going to be a construction that tells me how to create a path integral in 3 plus 1d. But what property does 3 plus 1d? But what property of the 3 plus 1 D path integral captures the anomaly? The fact that it's, I can show that its surface theory is described by anion theory, which has exactly that symmetry fractionalization data I put in. So it just shows that that theory actually lives at the surface. But that doesn't say it's an option. You're right, there's one extra step, which is to show that if the Extra step, which is to show that if the bulk SPT is trivial, then I can actually now define a G-crossbreak tensor category. So, yes, that's true. So let me just mention some previous related constructions. There was this Taraya-Vero-Barret-Westbrey construction in the early 90s that showed given a unitary fusion category, you can define a 2 plus 1d path integral state sum. And the Hamiltonian realization of this was by Levin and Wen. In 1993, And when. In 1993, Crane Yetter showed how given a braided fusion category, you can define a 3 plus 1 d-path integral state sum. And the Hamiltonian realization of that is Walker-Wong. In 2016, Sean Tree showed how, given a G-crossed fusion category, you can define a 3 plus 1D path integral state sum. And the Hamiltonian realization was done by Dominic and Zheng Han. Now, what we're doing is we're, ours is building on this one, but it's changing it a little bit. Changing it a little bit, we're taking a braided fusion category plus some anomalous symmetry fractionalization data, and then we're creating a 3 plus 1d path integral state sum for a 3 plus 1d SPT. So how does it work? So the idea is you triangulate your four manifold, you pick what's called a branching structure, which is a local ordering of vertices. Let's assume for simplicity that the fusion coefficients are all 0 or 1. And so here's what we do. On each 0 simplex, we put a group element. Group elements. On one simplicities, we don't do anything. On each two simplex, we put an anion. On each three simplex, we put an anion. But the anion on the three simplex has to satisfy these two constraints. So that leads to this picture. This is a three-cell, where group elements on vertices, anions on faces, and there's an anion in the center. And if we dualize here, you can think of it as I have G domain walls cross, like G sheet domain walls crossing the. Like G-sheet domain walls crossing the one simplices, the dual picture. And then I have anions over here. And so we want to resolve this a little bit by, and the way that we'll resolve it is we'll move everything, we'll move every anion on a two-cell towards the highest labeled vertex. So that's what we've done here. And you can see now that this is basically a fusion diagram, which I've drawn in this way. So here at A013 and A123, that's these two guys, are fusing together. Two guys are fusing together to give me the center guy, B0, 1, 2, 3, and then that thing is splitting off into these anions. And importantly, this line has to go through this domain wall to get to that anion A012. So that's why we have a line over here, because the Nion has to go through that domain wall to get there. So now if I have a 3-simplex with positive orientation, I draw this diagram. If I have a 3-simplex with a negative orientation, I draw sort of the reflected version of this diagram, which Of the reflected version of this diagram, which is this diagram. And now, given a four-simplex, I get a braided fusion diagram. Because what I do is, if I have a four-simplex 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, I have 5 3 simplices, each of which looks like this. And I put these five 3 simplices, I just put them on the plane, and I connect up the edges as in the way that they're labeled. So that gives me a diagram that looks like this, and there's a crossing here, which is why you need braiding to define it. To define it. And so we to the four cell, to the four simplex, we associate an amplitude, which is the evaluation of this diagram. So this diagram is like, there's some formula for this Z plus, which is extremely complicated, and this N, which is some normalization. And then the 3 plus 1D state sum is you sum over all labelings of the group elements, anions, onto. Group elements, anions on two simplices and three simplices. You take a product over all four simplices of these amplitudes. If, depending on the orientation of the four simplex, you would complex conjugate or not. And so this gives you a 3 plus 1d state sum. And so what you can prove about this state sum is one, it's topologically invariant, meaning it's independent of the triangulation you picked and the branching structure. It has a global G-sum. It has a global G symmetry. If I take a particular labeling and I shift all the group elements by G, I get the same exact amplitude. And furthermore, we can actually show it's a G SPT. The way that we can do that is if we just calculate the path integral on the 4 torus and S3 cross S1, we find that it's 1. And so that proves that the state actually has trivial intrinsic topological order, and therefore it's SPT state. So now I can calculate anomalies because all I have to do is calculate this 3 plus 1 d SPT over the appropriate G bundle. And I know how to do that by just, I can modify the state sum slightly to allow non-trivial G holonomies through non-contractible cycles, which allows the computation on arbitrary non-trivial G bundles. So I have an example here for Z2 cross Z2 symmetry where we do the calculation, but I don't have any time, so I'll just run through it. So, I'll just run through it. So, I just want to mention one other thing. So, now the surface. I said the surface of this theory is a SET and the 2 plus 1D surface, and it's anomalous. So, to study the 2 plus 1D surface, the path integral isn't good enough, actually, because the path integral can only give us a wave function on a closed 3-space. And I want to study the surface of the bulk, so I want a 2 plus 1d. I want the space to be two-dimensional. The space to be two-dimensional. So, to study the 2 plus 1D surface, we actually need to go to a Hamiltonian. So, we're going to define a Hamiltonian for the bulk 3 plus 1D system. And then we're going to study this Hamiltonian in the presence of a boundary that respects the G-symmetry. And then we're going to study the quasi-particle wave functions for that boundary Hamiltonian. So, the method to do this is kind of standard at this point to write a Hamiltonian. It's like these Walker-Wong type constructions. But schematically, the way that the ground-state waveform. But schematically, the way that the ground state wave function looks is that it's a ground state wave function is a superposition over all group elements, so on like basically over all possible G-defect networks in space, and a sum over all braided fusion diagrams in the presence of these G-defect networks. And then the amplitude is given by evaluation of that braided fusion diagram in the presence of all those G, that G-defect network. And you can show the ground state. And you can show the ground state is symmetric. If you apply the symmetry transformation, this is its action, and so you can show that the ground state is symmetric under the symmetry operation. We can show that there's a G-symmetric surface termination. I can't explain it to you right now due to time. But the key point is you can show that the antions of the surface are described by the same modular tensor category that was input into the construction. And you can actually calculate matrix elements of the string operators. And the way that you can do that is you can kind of. And the way that you can do that is you can kind of fuse, you can imagine that you have some basis state for the ground state wave function. This is one of them, schematically, where you have a bunch of G-defect networks and braided fusion diagrams in the bulk. And you want to fuse this string into the bulk, so you pass it through the surface, and then you do a bunch of moves to fuse it into something that's part of the bulk. And now this tells you, this basically can tell you what the matrix element is. Can tell you what the matrix element is for the string operator that creates these anions at two far-separated locations. So the way the anion states look is that, for example, you'll have some state in the superposition where there's no G defects anywhere, and that reference state would just look something like this. And then you'd superpose over all other states from that reference state by fluctuating in G-defect networks and considering more complicated fusion diagrams on the bulk. More complicated fusion diagrams in the bulk, and the amplitudes of all those are given by evaluation of those diagrams. And importantly, there's actually no term in the Hamiltonian that fluctuates a G membrane that surrounds a surface anion, and that leads to a local G degeneracy associated with each anion state. So schematically, the way that we picture that is we're looking now from the top view, from the surface, looking at the surface from the top. And so we have this degeneracy, local degeneracy. And so we have this degeneracy, local degeneracy, K and L, where K runs from 1 to G, and L runs from 1 to G. And they differ by having a G defect that encircles that anion. And now the other states can be obtained from the reference state by putting in G defect networks and so on and then evaluating the corresponding diagram. And it gives you amplitudes that look like this schematically. So the cool thing now is that we can now The cool thing now is that we can now apply the symmetry action and we can actually see that symmetry localization onslaughts happening explicitly. We can explicitly see that when we act the symmetry transformation, it acts as a local unitary near the two anions, and then along with this rho g, this action on the global state space. And this is now an exact statement. There's no approximation anywhere. It's happening in this exactly solvable model. Is exactly solvable model. So we can just see that you have the symmetry factualization on the surface, and the eta that you get is the same eta that you put into the model. So that's basically the story. So the summary is we have a theory to compute anomalies for SET states of bosons in basically complete generality. We have an exact construction to realize all possible symmetry fractionalization classes. And then to see, and we can see that that fractionalization data appears. Fractionalization data appears exactly in the analysis of the symmetry actions on the surface. And so this gives a proof by construction that all anomalous symmetry fractionalization classes exist at the surface of a 3 plus 1 d SPT. And one thing I didn't mention, but we can do, is we can extend this construction to include arbitrary types of time reversal and spatial reflection symmetries. So we can now do that calculation as well. So I'll end there. Thank you. Did you actually tell us how to compute the anomaly? I kind of sketched it. So the idea is to compute the anomaly is you need to figure out what the bulk 3 plus 1 d SPT is. So you need to figure out what the bulk cohomology class is. And that is defined by calculating the topological path integral on the appropriate G bundle. And in our construction, you can calculate that path integral. You can calculate that path integral on any G bundle you want by kind of putting twisted boundary conditions for the group elements as you cross a non-contractable cycle. So, can you explicitly show that with the label you can start basically only by little unity to that change? It's a state with G symmetry, it's invertible, there's no intrinsic topological order. There's no intrinsic topological order, and then I can calculate it. So I can like, I haven't proven that you get an element of H4 always, I guess. I just showed what the bulk 3 plus 1 d SPT is. I mean, I just gave a construction for the bulk 3 plus 1 dspt. But no, I don't know how to do a local unitary to get to their wave function. Yeah, I can first just say that. Yeah, okay. Firstly said, uh do you have a like contact around the indicator formula? I can't give you a formula because um what? I can't give you like for any G, I can give you a formula. But I, like, I can't give you a formula that's just immediately going to apply to all G, because you need to know what the G bundle is to calculate the path integral on. So that, this isn't, I don't think it's possible. It doesn't make sense even that question. It doesn't make sense, even that question in some sense, because for every G, it's a different formula. So it would have to be a super formula. This is like a super formula. But for some G, that might be a problem, right? Yeah, given some G, this is an explicit construction for how you get the function. The second one is that hop all the case, the last thing you comment about reflection and turn is what I say work. How does it work? Oh, um that's a longer story. That's a longer story. You have to put, yeah, I'll tell you offline. You need to think about it as a three-category, and then there's like complex conjugations involved and various equations. I'm happy to understand all that question. Did you have a question? Yeah, so can you understand this as if it helped me find a local or wherever you can? Yeah, you can think of it like that. I mean, the thing is that that's not qu I mean, I'm thinking of it as you do a path integral calculation on some non-trivial space. But something like that would also work. And this does not work with young things. Well, it does in the sense that I can take like the three fermion model and put it into this construction. and put it into this construction. And it'll give me the beyond cohomology SPT. So this, yes. You're just getting the bulk 3 plus 1 SPT. Alright. So that's the thing.
