I'm going to talk about a work which I did with the ex-master student, Bidhi, and also something done independently. And this is about just channels, but from the point of view of dynamical systems, especially also defining classical equivalence of these quantum channels. And for me, classical is police and, you know, Newton and Hamilton. Newton and Hamilton. And yeah, so I think this is still not working. So maybe now I think.  Yeah. So that's going to be roughly what I'm going to talk about. First, I'll have a very brief review of quantum channels, at least in the notation that I'm going to use. And I'm going to define classical channels, which are analogs of these quantum channels. So it's the other way around from quantum to classical, but really these are from classical Koopman. These are from classical Koopman operators. And so these are, in some sense, channels which have a semi-classical limit. And then I'll define dual-unital operators or channels and they're channels which come from such dual unital operators. And they're used in many body classical as well as quantum circuits. But I'm not going to go into quantum circuits as much. I'm just going to mention it. And then I'm going to talk about. And then I'm going to talk about classical quantum correspondence in a single channel and take an example of a non-integrable oscillator to just see some things of what's happening. So it's somewhat exploratory. Yeah, so Schrodinger and Heisenberg's dynamics are unitary given any density matrix rho. Schrodinger evolves the density matrix, Heisenberg evolves an observable. They are kind of adjoint of each other. And that Other and that defines a channel for a unitary channel. So, all of unitary dynamics defines a channel. Channel being just a direct action on a state or an observable. This is being in a joint action on this. So, direct actions are obtainable by looking at these operators as vectors in some vector space, and then looking at what is it that's going to evolve these operators, the operators of the. These operate the operators or the super operators on these. So it's straightforward. This is a kind of a row vectorization. You take a density matrix, take rows, put them all, stack them all in one column, and you call that the vector row. That's actually just this definition of vectorization. So in that case, this adjoint action has a direct action with the super operator, which is simply super operator which is simply a tensor product of this of this unitary operator and this is the complex conjugate and that's the adjoint although I have put an S prime there ignore it and you can you can just think about it as just S. And similarly the Heisenberg evolution is just that with U being replaced by U adjoint. And so these are the channels. And so these are the channels. And in fact, for most of my talk, I'm going to be looking at it from an Heisenberg point of view or Heisenberg picture. So that's the channel. And that's a unitary channel. And of course, the spectrum of this is on the unit circle because the whole thing is unitary. And so this is how the spectrum of this would look like, the eigenvalues of this channel n. Now, in general, general quantum evolution is non-unitary. Evolution is non-unitary, typically because we have access only to a subsystem. And therefore, the entire law of completely positive linear maps has developed, which says that you have an observable A that is a, or an, let's fix observable in our mind for Heisenberg. So observable A gets mapped to another observable under this positive linear map. Positive linear map. There is this time-spring dilation, which says that any such completely positive linear map can be thought about as something which is a unitary operation on a joint system of your system of interest, which we call S, and ancilla or environment, which we will call E. So there is this exists this unitary operator on this joint subsystem, joint system. So that is represented. Joint system. So that is represented just in this picture, in this cartoon, like this. So S and E together form a joint system. And the dynamics is unitary on the large system, which is given by this USE. And you have an observable A, which is on the subsystem of interest or system of interest S. And you may take the systems or the state of the environment to be anything, but I'm Be anything, but I'm going to concentrate on the case when it's just identity operator. I've divided it by the dimension of the environment so that the trace of these operators are the same after and before the evolution. Of course, in the case of a state, this has a nice interpretation in terms of this is the reduced density matrix of the joint state when the environment is in the most mixed state. Mixed state. The mathematics is the same. Okay, now the description of only the action on the system S, again, is a direct thing, is a direct action like what I said, on the vectorization of this observable A. And what is that channel? That channel is no more unitary, but I'm writing it, and there are many ways of writing it. I'm just writing it in a form which would be useful for me later. Writing it in a form which would be useful for me later on, as essentially this unitary channel of this joint S and E, which we saw from the previous slide. But now it's actually contracted or traced by using these maximally entangled states in the environment. So you can see that both KET and BRA have maximally entangled states. So this is an operator from the system to An operator from the system to the system environment is in some sense traced away. So that is the correct channel, and that's its action on a vectorization of A gives you the new observable A. This is in general not unitary. It's a sub-unitary matrix in general. And the eigenvalues would typically lie inside the circle. Since we are getting it from the Steinspring dilation, there it happens to be a unital channel, and there is an. Unit of channel, and there is an eigenvalue which is one, and that is the trivial case when A itself is an identity operator. So, apart from this eigenvalue, the non-trivial eigenvalues all lie inside the circle and they have some dynamical meaning to this. So, associated with this channel, there is a positive matrix. So, M is in general, as I said, non-unitary. It has interesting symmetry properties, which are well known. But, apart from that, But apart from that, it's a matrix with a complex spectrum. But associated with this, very closely associated with this, is a positive definite matrix, the Choi matrix. And this is one way of writing the Choi matrix. It looks like a reduced density matrix of vectorization of the unitary operator itself, where you're tracing out the environment. And this is not direct, this is the channels realignment or basically a Or basically, an interchange of system and environment indices. So it's just a simple permutation of the channel. Okay, so that's the quantum channel that we are going to, when we are looking for classical equivalents of these, we would like to be as close to quantum mechanics. And in fact, Koopman was. And in fact, Koopman was inspired by von Neumann's treatment of quantum mechanics and Hilbert space to ask what is the connection with classical mechanics. So in a way, classical mechanics from Newton to Hamiltonian, Hamilton, Lagrange, and then Koopman is the most abstract form of this. I wouldn't advise it for any student trying to solve a pulley problem. But nevertheless, But, nevertheless, it is a very interesting thing because you start from the usual situation in classical mechanics is that you start from a phase space point, and the phase space itself is compact and finite dimensional, number of degrees of freedom multiplied by two, your positions and momenta. But this transformation of the phase space point itself is generally nonlinear. And that's the crux of the matter, is what makes classical mechanics so much interesting. Makes classical mechanics so much interesting and different from quantum mechanics in some way. But Koopman observed that you could lift this, instead of looking at the action on the phase space points, you look at the action on functions defined on this phase space itself. And then you look at the action of what how this is the action actually defined. This is the dynamic. So phi t is a This is the dynamic. So, phi t is a flow after a time t. f is any function. This is the action of the Koopman after a time t on this function. f is simply a composition. So you follow the point x to phi tx and then evaluate this function. So this is actually an observable. This is the equivalent of an observable in classical mechanics. And the space of functions you can choose as any. Space of functions you can choose as anything for our purposes. Really, it's sufficient to consider the squared integrable L2 functions on this. The interesting thing is that this is a linear transformation, but the cost to pay is that it's an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of the space of functions on this phase space. And if this flow is measure-preserving, as Liu-Will measure is preserving. Liuville measure is preserved in a Hamiltonian flow, it implies that the Schoopman operator is also unitary. So here we have a classical mechanics description of nonlinear flow in general, but in terms of a linear transformation or linear operator, and that linear operator is unitary, just as in quantum mechanics. Okay, so in fact, Koopman, although it's 1931. Koopman, although it's 1931, is back in fashion in some communities, at least in control, non-linear control community is looking at it. And so also the data science community with a huge amount of data processing that's happening is finding the Koopman approach interesting and useful. So I have taken this particular slide. I have taken this particular slide, which is just what I said in more picturesque form here. You have a phase space S. These are how we usually think about it. But you could also think about it as in terms of functions which are being evolved by unitary operators. Here I've called this is U in this picture. This is K. This is from this website by message. Okay, so we have this object which is like the unitary operator, which we would look at. Which we would look at as in this system environment space. And so, what are the underlying systems? So, let's take now the system and environment degrees of freedom. I'm going to call Q1, P1 as the system. Let's say Q2, P2 as environment. So we just think about it as two degrees of freedom. And there is a canonical transformation that is a classical flow into this, into this, which I'm going to separate out. Into this, which I'm going to separate out for convenience rather than keeping all four symbols like this. So this is, so xi1 prime are the, xi1 refers to q1p1, xi2, the second degree of freedom. So that is the canonical transformation of the first degree of freedom in terms of the first and second. And this is of the second degree of freedom again in terms of the first and second. So phi one and phi two are part of this canonical transformation. The Koopman The Koopman operator is then very simple. We can look at it from a Dirac notation point of view to keep close to class quantum mechanics and just define this like this that okay I think my thing went out but so it's it's it's it's just the keeping with the flow so Keeping with the flow. So eta1 and eta2 are. So let's look at this as the kernel of the Koopman operator. You can verify that this does the job by just acting the Koopman on some function on phase space. Let's say f of xi1, psi2. Then that is given in the Dirac notation like this. You can insert some completeness. It looks like quantum mechanics, but this is all classical. Eta1, eta2. And then this xi1 prime. And then this Xi 1 prime, Xi 2 prime is related to Xi 1 and Xi 2 by the transformation. So that is simply the composition operator. So we can define, so that is an explicit form of that unitary operator. Okay, somehow I think I have lost, I seem to have. Yeah, I'll do that. Oh, does it help? No. It's fine. I'll just change it from here. No problem. No problem. No problem. Yeah. So let me just let me continue. Me let me continue. So it's fine. I'm thinking. Yeah. So one of the properties of the Koopman operator, of course, it's unitary, but it's also unital, which is a simple way of saying something obvious, since it's a composition function. And this doesn't depend on whether the dynamics is symplectic or not. Any constant function goes to a constant function. Okay, so that's all. Okay, so that's all I'm saying here, but written in this somewhat this fu is just a constant function on phase space. So this constant function goes to a constant function. So that is actually true irrespective of whether it's symplectic, as I said. So that is simply this statement here, where we are, so there is this constant function which I haven't written. That's just one here. We are integrating out over the first the system and the environment together. And the environment together. That is how I want to look at it. And that's just a constant function. Slightly non-trivial is the integration over this pair of system and environment degrees of freedom, but that follows Simplectic certainly gives you that because the inverse of the canonical transformation is also measure-preserving. Okay, so that is. So, that is the equivalent of unitality. So, now I want to write that whatever I said in a slightly more abstract form. And that's how it's a direct action on the space of functions. So, this fu is just a constant function, remains constant function. And then the adjoint is also true. Now, notice that when you come to the quantum channel for the system and environment, and it's a unitary. Environment, and it's a unitary, then there exists an exact analog of this where the constant function is replaced by the maximally entangled state or the Bell state, that is what I called phi plus. So this and these are the analogs of this, the phi plus on the system states and phi plus on the environment. On the environment, are eigenstates of this, and also the they're also right as well as left, of course, because of the unitarity of this. Okay, now what are channels which are derived from this? Channels are subsystem maps because we are going to look at system to system mapping by tracing out the environment. And in fact, the tracing out the environment is a really simple operation in the classical picture. In the classical picture. So, again, that K, which I have written here with all of the symbols intact, is a unital, not only unital, it's a unitary channel. It's a unitary dynamics on the entire SE to SE. But now you can do this operation, which is just integrating out the environment. But now the environment are all the two degrees of freedom, that is xi2 and eta2. Xi 2 and eta 2, and you get something which is a function on somebody doesn't like what I'm doing. Okay. It's fine. So corrections are welcome. So system to system. So this is one is the system map. So you see now that is we're taking this kernel of the Koopman operator, integrating Of the Koopman operator integrating out the environment variables, and we get a function, we get an operator whose matrix elements are given by this first thing. And you can play the game for integrating out the system, and that will give you the environment-to-environment map. And you can also do the system to environment, this cross-maps by integrating out in similar ways the other two. So there are exactly four classical channels that we can define. Channels that we can define. And they are in complete analogy to the quantum channels. This one I've already introduced, the usual system-to-system channels. And you can see that the integration over this constant function is precisely the inner product with the maximally entangled states. So the second channel would be with maximally entangled states of system and system. And then here there will be a cross of system environment. Be a cross of system, environment, environment, system. And there are these ratios which I put in so that it's consistent with the definition of maximally entangled states and allowing for the dimensionality of the sub system S to be not equal to the dimension of the environment. Okay, so there are these classical channels which thanks, thanks, that's fine, thank you. Yeah, so Yeah, so these classical channels, like the quantum channels, are not unitary. They are sub-unitary. And I'm interested in exploring the connection between these two objects. But actually, all of these things has a very nice interpretation in terms of tensor network pictures or simple stick pictures. So for those of you who are familiar, this might work. For those, you're not losing money. Work for those not, you're not losing much. So, so think about this. By the way, you can think about these diagrams completely classical quantum. It's embarrassingly the same. Okay, so this square here, you may consider as u tensor u in the quantum case or the Koopman kernel or the Koopman operator. Okay, in the class in the quantum case, this Case, this input here is a maximally entangled state. You should think about this as having two of these legs. I'll come to what that means. So, the input here is a maximally entangled state, maximally entangled state. In the classical, we have already seen this is just a uniform function. So, circles are just uniform functions or maximally entangled states, classical quantum. This is integrating out in both system and environment. So, Environment. So, in the same time, so you get just trivial f of u in each of these things. That's what this line means. Okay, and this is the slightly non-trivial case when you have the constant functions in there. So, this is just unitality. The channels you get by changing the place of these things. So, this is where the integration comes. So, this is the integration only on. So, this is the integration only on the environment or the second degree of freedom gives you the first channel. And similarly, integrating out on the system gives you the second channel. And that is, yeah, so integrating, yeah, so that gives you, so I've represented them in a somewhat obscure notation as Kr1 and Kr2. And this one here is system and environment. So the input into this is the system, the output is on the environment. The output is on the environment. And here it's the other way around: environment and system. Okay. Yeah, please stop me if things are not. It's gone again. Needs coaxing. Yeah. So I also want to define what one means by dual unitality, which are special kinds of channels. Actually, the Actually, the channels are maybe one can put dual unitality in the following way. They are special unitary operators from which we are constructing the SE channels, or in the classical case, special Koopman operators, such that some of these channels which you're deriving are completely depolarizing. Okay, so in the classical case, what does a completely depolarizing channel mean? It means that you put an Channel means it means that you put in any function, it will just return a constant function to that. Okay, so that's what a depolarizing channel does, independent of that. In other words, so a dual unital Hoopman would be something whose channel Kr1, which I defined first by tracing out the environment, is just a projector on the constant function, the system space. In the quantum case, this is the same as this channel being. The same as this channel being a projector onto the maximally entangled state. So that's duality. And in fact, if so, R1 and R2, both of them will be completely depolarizing. But there is no condition on these channels here, which are actually complementary channels. The word complementary channels was already mentioned. So KR1 and K gamma are complementary. Gamma are complementary channels. So the complementary channel need not be maximally depolarizing. But if they are, then we call that gamma dual. So gamma duality is when the complementary channels are maximally depolarizing. Duality is when the channel is maximally depolarized. So in pictures, now this is simply equal to this. Okay. You want to? I know, I think I'll do it. Thanks. I'll try. Maybe the use of laser might lower that. Yeah. So now, just as in quantum, we have the local operations in In classical, you have local Koopman operators, or unit, they are basically canonical transformations on individual degrees of freedom. So if you have K1, two, let's say, to be some interaction between one and two degrees of freedom, you can have K1 and K2, K1 prime and K2 prime to be local canonical transformations, Koopman operators coming from local canonical transformations. So that is also a Koopman operator respecting unitality. Operator respecting unitality. What is interesting is that if this interaction is dual or gamma dual, then this duality conditions are preserved under local Koopman operators or local transformations. This is just as in the quantum world, entanglement is not, characteristics of non-locality is not changed by local transformations. So that's the equivalent here. So I've said a lot, but I've said a lot, but also what are the examples? So, if you look at the swap operator, a swap operator is a dual operate, a dual unitary operator. So, that is swapping system and environment in both classical and quantum, in the way I've defined here. Five more minutes. Okay, thanks. Identity is a gamma-dual operator. Okay, so now you can go between gamma-dual and dual by multiplying. Dual and dual by multiplying with the corresponding Koopman operators for the swap operator. So, swap is what is taking you between these two degrees of free, between these two kind of operators. Okay, so here is the use of all of these things in a many-body context. So, many body unitary circuits have been said. This is actually from this work of Kauch, Bertini, and Prossen. Bosch, Bertini, and Prosen. There was an earlier work. This one is a work which kind of nicely puts it together. So now, forget about what I've said. Just look at unitary operators. And so not channels at this point. And these unitary operators are u and this x is just the particles. So there are two particle unitaries in a brick wall circuit. And the big U is the floquet operator corresponding to. Floquet operator corresponding to this one step with these. What we are interested in is in the iteration of these and correlation functions which come out from them. So here is an example of a single operator A, which is a local operator sitting in one of these things. And we are evolving, time evolving that operator A for a time t. This is how the circuit diagram would be given for that. U adjoint are these, u is the red. U is the red, then you have a and then u adjoint, or u to the power of t. So you can put more time in this. Now, the interesting thing is you can take this kind of circuit and double this. So you can take the red ones and fold it into the violet ones, and you can get something which looks like a collection of channels. So actually, these green are exactly the unitary channels which I introduced. Unitary channels which I introduced. So you can forget about the unitary picture, look at it completely in terms of channels, and then you get this channel. So this calculating a correlation function or time evolved state would be just equivalent to finding this diagram. And a correlation function would be to calculate, a correlation function between two operators would be to calculate that diagram. And now you can use the rules of these diagrams. These diagrams, which I showed, to simplify this. And in particular, there is something to be got if this U there is dual unitary or that channel is dual unital, then this channel which you're getting from this W is maximally depolarizing. In a way, you should think about this in a physical sense as there is a lot of interaction or chaos in some sense, a maximal interaction between system and environment. Maximal interaction between system and environment, that so it's an extreme case. In that case, actually, correlations vanish everywhere except on the light cone. So that is the extreme case. So you have a many body system. You are looking at correlations between two operators. They only exist if this position is equal to time. And it decreases on this light cone exponentially. Okay, so in fact, I just Okay, so in fact, I just wanted to show you that there was an experiment done last, this came out last month with dual unitary circuits, 91 qubits. This was an IBM experiment. And this is actually a kicked Ising model, which is a realization of this dual unitary. And you can see that in that picture here, there is a, this one here shows you correlations, which are kind of decreasing here, in fact, exponentially, and they vanish everywhere. And they vanish everywhere else. So, this is qubit index, and that is time. Okay, so the rate of decay of this, so this is from this paper, those of you who want to say, dynamical simulation of many-body quantum chaos. So, the rate of decay of this is given precisely by the eigenvalues of this channel, which corresponds to actually the complementary channel corresponding. The complementary channel corresponding to you, because the channel itself is completely depolarizing. It's a complementary channel which controls the decay of correlations. Okay, so, but what I want to say is that all of that is completely true classically as well, that you can have observables like this, which are only localized on one of the particles. And there is a Koopman which is evolving this giant function. This giant function, and this function is now being scrambled across the particles. And you can calculate basic correlation functions such as this by using exactly the same techniques, except that we now interpret these things as Koopman operators, and the channels corresponding to these come into play as I've defined them. And these are classical many-body systems. And in fact, in some sense, a folded picture is the most natural in the classical case. Classical case because there is no role of the unitary. It's not their joint action, which is natural in classical. And in fact, the consequences of this being a dual Koopman operator, if there is such a dual Koopman operator, as I said, correlation functions are governed by the powers of this channel k gamma, which I define. And therefore, the eigenvalues of these determine how fast the correlations are going to go. Relations are going to go. Maybe, yeah, that is a lot, but a couple of minutes, two more minutes. Okay, so as I said, yeah, the spectrum of this two-body, so eigenvalues of this derived from just the two-body dual Koopman operators determine the decay correlations in many body systems. By the way, there are also interestingly operators, Koopman operators, which are both dual and gamma-dual. In that case, Gamma dual. In that case, they lead to very rapid decay. It looks like Bernoulli many-body systems. Okay, but I want to go the other way around. I want to not go to many body, but just look at the channel itself, which is from system to system, and look at that. And that actually looks like just a noisy dynamics on that one degree of freedom system because we have integrated out the environment. And so the environment. And so the environment acts like a noise. And this Koopman operator corresponding to this is actually a stochastic Koopman operator. And the quantum channels, if the channels are gamma dual, are actually Hadamard or Shur channels, which is just defined in this manner. Okay, so I'm going to now take a concrete nonlinear system to see how that is going to be the case. So this is two coupled. Case, so this is two coupled pendula, but they're also kicked in time so that even a single pendulum is chaotic. This is a famous standard map. It's a textbook example of Hamiltonian chaos. And so there are two degrees of freedom. That's the canonical transformation. And a single degree of freedom I can show, two degrees of freedom we cannot. So this alpha is the parameters which control the degree of chaos in the system or environment. And here I've marked them as k. And here I've marked them as k in this diagram. So alpha equal to zero is integrable, momentum is conserved. As alpha has increased or k has increased, the system goes into chaos or in a very regular kind of a manner. I mean, there is all these channels. Okay, so now we can write the classical channel for this and the corresponding quantum channel as explicit expressions of these. And interestingly, the And interestingly, the classical channels are just some noise added, which is coming through the J0 Bessel function of this. And the quantum channel is governed by an inverse Planck constant, which is the number of the Hilbert space dimensions, the local Hilbert space dimensions. And yeah, so this is, I'll just flash two more diagrams, and I mean, essentially, pictures, and I'll close. So this is showing you the spectrum of. So, this is showing you the spectrum of the classical channel and the quantum channel. So, you can think about the classical channel as an n equals infinity, h equal to zero limit, and that's here for two values of the system dynamics. So, the system dynamics for alpha s2 is not very chaotic. So there is some kind of intermediate dynamics of regular and chaos. And what you see interestingly in the quantum case, n equals 60, n equals 150 is more More classical is that you have a lot of eigenvalues in the periphery which remain the same and they survive the classical limit. And there is a kind of ring structure where a lot of eigenvalues of the channels accumulate. And this is for a case when the system is actually ergodic or chaotic. And you still have these ring structures, but these eigenvalues are getting far away from. Are getting far away from eigen from one. Okay, so let me stop here, but I'll say that the largest eigenvalue, the quantum classical, has you can interpret them in terms of the dynamics. So that is all of that. And maybe I'll skip this slide, which is talking about these rings, which have connections to random matrix theory. And also the spectrum itself, the eigenfunctions have very The eigenfunctions have very interesting structures, scarring of these by classical orbits. So there's a classical channel, quantum channel. This is the eigenvalue of the largest non-trivial eigenvalue. Okay, so I'll summarize by saying that, yeah, I'll just put it down, you can read it. I think some of the interesting maybe kind of questions are also to do with the fact that one uses a lot of random circuits. One uses a lot of random circuits to do quantum supremacy experiments, but you also have very class, I mean, classical systems with almost the same kind of properties. So I don't know what is the situation with quantum complexity in these kind of, or complexity in these kinds of circuits. Yeah, so thank you and sorry for keeping you between lunch and
