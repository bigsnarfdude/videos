The last speaker today is Uppsala Witter. Speaks on agroteometric decomposition of symmetric A frequencies. All right, so thank you so much for inviting me and I'd also like to extend a thank you to everyone from BERS who has been organizing us and making stuff work in this fun new place. This is This is a collaboration with a bunch of people. So we have Tyler Kelly, we have Chuck Duran zooming in, Steve Sperver, me, John Boyt, and Adriana Salerno. And I wanted to extend a special thank you to BERS because way back in 2013, some of us actually met at BERS and had some of the conversations that led to the stuff that I'm going to be talking about. That led to the stuff that I'm going to be talking about today. So, this is in some sense a reunion talk, if you will. This is going to be a talk based on papers that are available. There's a paper called Zeta Functions of Alternate Neurocolamio Families. And then there's another paper which came out in 2020, which means that I didn't get a chance to talk about it quite as much as I might have liked. So, I'm going to jump on the opportunity. Jump on the opportunity with friends who love K3 surfaces to talk really in detail about some arithmetic properties of K3 surfaces today. And then if you really just want a really quick overview of this stuff, I also have an expository paper that came out in the contemporary math proceedings that I'll just show you some cool data and a quick overview of what goes into this kind of process. What's the big goal? The great, big, huge goal. The great, big, huge goal, sort of overarching hope, is that you might be able to use the physical intuition that you take, maybe from knowing stuff about mirror symmetry or even from other string theoretic kinds of constructions, and bring that back not only to geometry, but actually push it all the way down to arithmetic structure. We want to make that goal a bit more concrete. Goal a bit more concrete. So, we're going to be looking at specific K3 surfaces. All of these are projective hypersurfaces. One of them, I'm sure you know, is the sum of cortics. It might be the Fermat cortic or the Dork cortic, depending on whether your personal training lead more toward mere symmetry or more towards number theory. And then we have S2L2, which starts off looking like it might be the format. Which starts off looking like it might be the Fermat Fortic, but then we have what's called a loop where we have a cubic in one variable multiplied by another variable, and then we loop back and take that other variable, cubic, multiplied by the beginning variable. So that's a very short loop, just two elements. The Klein Mukai has one lonely fourth power and then a loop with three elements. I'm going to take this Klein Mukai as my sort of like example. Is my sort of like example thing that's not the format cortic in a lot of this talk. It does admit a very large symplectic symmetry group. That's where the Mukai part comes in. The Klein part comes in because this is a fourfold cover branched over a Klein's curve. And then we could have a pair of loops or we could have one long loop. We've got this collection of cool, highly structured cortics. And if we want, we can extend each of these to a pencil just by deforming by four, which I'm picking for nice arithmetic reasons, times the product of all my variables. And I have a symplectic group action that multiplies coordinates by appropriately chosen roots of unity, modulo the overall projective action. So for the fortic console, that's Z mod 4 Z squared. For the Klein For the Kleins and Kai console, which I'm going to be focusing on, we have a Z mod 7Z symmetry. Now, much more concretely, since the first goal I offered to you is like a huge dream, it's maybe too much of a dream for a single hour, I'm going to try to see if we can talk really specifically about the relationship between these group actions on these various councils. Actions on these various pencils, and what happens when we try to count points on these varieties over finite fields. This is one way of trying to visualize the Klein Buchai. So if you're wondering what that thing looks like, I guess from the proper angle, here's one way to look at it somewhere on the pencil. All right. So how are we going to organize our information about points on finite fields? We're going to use a zeta function. Let's look at some finite fields. Let's look at some finite field. And then we can imagine: okay, we count points in our variety over that finite field, then we extend our finite field, and we count points with that new extension. Maybe we pick up some new points, then a bigger extension, a bigger extension, a bigger extension, stuff all that information into a generating function, and we get what's called the zeta function. There's lots of beautiful, essentially classical at this point. Essentially classical at this point in the 21st century, known about the zeta function. So, first of all, it's a rational function. And not only is it a rational function, we can factor it in a specific way using polynomials with Android coefficients. And the size of those polynomials is going to be related to the geometry of the underlying variety. Skip important geometry. Yeah, so we can say a lot about the degrees of these polynomials. They're just given by Betty numbers of our underlying variety. And in particular, if I have a smooth projective hyper surface in Pn, I'm going to have one interesting piece of the zeta function. Depending on dimension, it might be in the numerator or it might be in the denominator. in the denominator and then I'm going to have one minus t times one minus q q t times one minus q squared t all the way up to one minus q to the n minus one where that n is the dimension of my variety times t. So if I'm looking specifically at projective hypersurfaces, which I promised you that we would be doing, we're actually asking not so much about a rational function, but about trying to characterize this particular polynomial that's the kind of unexpected part of the zeta function. An unexpected card in the zeta function. So let's look at some examples here. Let's pick the prime 281 just to pick something that doesn't seem too tiny. Let's pick the parameter in our pencil being 5. Then I can try to actually find out what is the zeta function factor in this particular example. Factor in this particular example. For the Fermat pencil, I have a bunch of linear factors, and then I have a cubic factor. I should also point out this is corresponding to the primitive cohomology in our beta function, in our betting number numerology here. So the overall degree of this thing is 21. For the Klein-Bucke pencil, I have a degree six polynomial, which is cubed. And then I have another I have another degree three factor, and the reason that I have highlighted these in red is that you can see this is exactly the same cubic in each of these pencils. So in the first big paper coming out of this project that we started at Burr way back when, we showed that we have a Showed that we have a common factor of degree three for each of the pencils in these families, and side by side, as long as you're doing something where the zeta function makes sense, which means it's better be smooth for that psi and for that prime. And in fact, this isn't just a story about K3 surfaces. If you're interested in common factors of zeta functions, you can do this for Calabio. Do this for collabio pencils in projector space in any dimension that you like to tell a similar story. And morally speaking, the reason that we have that common factor is that we're able to identify pencils of K-through surfaces or collabiels where the Picard-Fuchs equation that's associated to the unique up-to-scale and holomorphic form is the same along each pencil. Along each pencil. So we're able to match the Picard-Fuchs equations and then pull that information back to arithmetic stuff. Here we go. All right. If you're wondering, sort of, what is the process that goes on in identifying and matching those? One of the big ideas that we use is we use Bergland control. Ideas that we use is we use Bergland-Huprabit's mirror symmetry, and we use combinatorial stuff associated to invertible polynomials, which are one of the ingredients in BHK mirror symmetry. So here we have Berglund on another hike. We have Tristan Hoopsch looking very snazzy, and we have Mark Kravitz who went off into finance, so that's his finance outfit. If you're specifically interested in the common factor, Interested in the common factor just of the pencils that I'm telling you about today, there is also a more geometric way of looking at this, which was worked out after seeing us talk about this project. So that's a paper called Zeta Functions of Monomial Deformations of Delta-Herpic Surfaces. He uses a covering map to identify the same kind of zeta function factor. And he also does a bunch of geometric work telling you. Metric work telling you about some of the Picard lattice information of these various pencils. So, if you'd like to dig more into the geometry of that family, that information is out there for you. Okay, so I told Do we know about this common factor, which is amazing, it's cool, like we can push it up to Labyloz, there's all kinds of stuff, but that's only a Dodori 3 factor, and we have an eight. And we have a degree 18 polynomial that we might also care about. So, what I'd really like to do today is to tell you about the rest of the zeta function, the stuff that is not preserved, the stuff that is different for this collection of pencils. And the way we're going to do that, we're going to use hypergeometric Picard-Fuchs equations as a sort of like guideline telling us what we should expect, what kinds of things we should hope to see, then to actually Then, to actually work it out, we're going to generalize hypergeometric things to finite fields, and we're going to give a really careful description of hypergeometric functions over finite fields. And then finally, we're going to do extensive computational validation. So you should assume that anything that I'm telling you about is something that we have actually worked out in a bunch of examples. And there's all kinds of code hanging around. You know, we didn't just do it for prime 281, we have lots of other data. 281, we have lots of other data on our right. The way we write this down, we actually package all of our zeta functions together into what are called L-series. So for each of our varieties, we're going to have some bad primes where stuff stops being smooth, so we should throw those away. And then let's fix an element of our family in a particular psi where things are nice. A particular psi where things are nice, and a particular prime. Well, then we've got this degree 21 factor of the zeta function that's the interesting factor. And we can then combine for all of the different primes that aren't in our bad set. We can just multiply all of those together and make an L series. This is going to be something that converges for any complex number C. For any complex number C in some kind of right half plane. And so the actual overall goal is to factor this L series in terms of specific, very explicit, again, hypergeometric L series. So that's the kind of shape of our big result. And now I'm going to dive in and tell you a little bit more about the structures that go into making that specific. That go into making that specific. But first, I should tell you one thing about mirror symmetry and about what happens with this degree 18 polynomial, which is again related to mirror symmetry. If you look at the mirror to cortic, to all of the cortics in P3, you can construct that by taking the Fermat pencil and modding out by the appropriate group action resulting singularities. Will it has a really Well, it has a really nice zeta function. It has the 1 minus t and 1 minus p squared t stuff that you might expect. It has a whole ton of linear factors, which are just 1 minus pt. And then it has this r. What is this r? This is the same common factor r that we've already seen. Not only is it shared across all our families, it's also preserved under this mirror relationship. If we work over a finite field that has enough roots of unity, we actually show, or you might expect it for other reasons because we're looking at things that have Picard rank 19 over the complex numbers, that the zeta functions of all of these things actually factor in a similar way. So the zeta functions over the appropriate field look again like 1 minus t times 1 minus qt to a big power times 1 minus t To a big power times one minus q squared times the preserved factor. We like to say that our zeta functions are potentially equal. In other words, if we extend our field enough and we extend our field in the right way, the zeta functions will all look like this mirror zeta function. So that's one thing I can tell you straight off about that degree 18 piece. If you extend it, if you extend it, if you extend it the right way, it'll just be one minus q of t to a big power. T into a big power. And again, it'll be exactly the mirror cortics. But I'm still allowed to care about the transient stuff, right? I mean, maybe if I extend my field past the field of order 281, it will be simpler. But like this degree six polynomial cubed is really interesting. And so I don't. Interesting. And so I don't want to throw everything away. I want to actually be able to understand where these transient factors are coming from. What are they doing? Okay, so we're going to dig into these. And the first way you try to dig into these is you just say, okay, well, I'm counting stuff. I want to see, can my computer compute a zeta function for me in a specific example. In principle, well, we have a generating function, we know that that generating function also corresponds to some rational function with particular parameters. So if you had a huge computer that worked really, really fast, you could just sit down and you could count stuff over a field and then you extend your field and count again, and then you extend your field and count again. And you match up coefficients, you do some huge, huge, huge one-year algebra problem, and you have. Algebra problem, and you have exactly worked out your zeta function. This would work great if you were working at looking at like an elliptic curve, but you actually have to count up to an extension that's about half the sum of the Betty numbers. And so that would be in practice for something like a K3 surface, where we know we have a 21-dimensional primitive cohomology. That's just a giant combinatorial explosion. So, if you want to make your computers do it, there are examples. There's lots of examples known for curves. People have worked really hard to find algorithms for curves. If you care about higher dimensional stuff, you can do K3 surfaces in P3, double covers of P2, and some special threefolds or fourfolds. There is some really There is some really interesting computational work coming out of the physics community. Candelas de la Assa and Duko von Straten, and then following on with some associate PhD students and people responding to the work of Candelas della Assa and von Straten. They've looked really hard at just the factor of the zeta function that you would expect to be associated to a holomorphic form on a Calabia variety. So then you have some really intriguing suggestions. Suggestions about factorization properties of that piece. But that is again just one piece of the zeta function. They're not computing the entire zeta function for a Flavier tree folder. At least you can have. Okay, here we go. All right. Here we go. All right. So, if you want to be more sophisticated about your computations, we have a combinatorial explosion if we just naively count points and do linear algebra. So, instead, you might want to take a characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius action on an appropriately defined p-adic cohomology space. Computing that characteristic polynomial of Frobenius is the more sophisticated way of actually doing a computation that's that will. Computation that will get you accessibility of higher-dimensional stuff in a more reasonable kind of time. The exact cohomology space varies a little bit depending on who's implementing this. Edgar Costa's code, which we've used extensively, uses Monski-Waschester cohomology. Our work looking at the common factor dug really hard into dork cohomology. And then from what I understand, And from what I understand of these physics computations, they're basically using Dirt Cohomology methods along with some partially conjectural computational extensions. In particular, we know that if we have a subspace of piatic cohomology that's stable under the action of Frobenius, we're going to get. Of Fromenius, we're going to get a factor of the zeta function. That's how we really started trying to pull out common factors. And so that says, okay, maybe we want to be able to break up our cohomology space in some way and try to understand what's going on with the action of the provenius on particular pieces of our middle cohomology. What did we actually do? We computed a bunch of hypergeometric Picard-Fuchs equations for all of our primitive cohomology, not just the unique holomorphic form, but that whole middle cohomology. We work out the Picard-Fuchs equation for it. And then we write down finite field hypergeometric functions that have parameters that are related to the parameters that we see when we do the. That we see when we do the Carfoux computation over the complex numbers. So let me try to show you some of the data. Sorry, I'm having to get more and more. Okay, hypergeometric functions. There is a book called Hypergeometric Functions, My Love, but I don't know if you have brought hypergeometric functions into your heart. So if you haven't, let me just remind you. Let me just remind you that over C, a hypergeometric function looks like sort of partial factorials. We have a number, a variable times variable plus one times variable plus two, up to some point when we stop, which you could write as a ratio of factorials or a ratio of gamma functions if you're feeling fancier. And then we have a product of a bunch of those kinds of things on top and a product. Of those kinds of things on top, and a product with a bunch of those kinds of things on the bottom divided by a k for a real k factorial multiplied by z to the k add from zero to infinity. So you've got this generating function, it feels very factorially, and it depends on parameters called alpha and other parameters called beta. We also have hypergeometric differential operators. If you take the differential operators, If you take the differential operator that's just variable z times d dz and you combine it with betas and alphas, you get a differential operator that will have a fairly high degree but very constrained kind of structure because of the alphas and the betas and the fact that you're just controlling what kinds of derivatives you take in each spot. Of derivatives you take in each square. So, given a hypergeometric function, I can write down a corresponding differential operator. And if I have a differential operator in this form, I could extract a function from it. The first thing that we notice is that we can take our symplectic group actions and we can decompose our primitive cohomology using the characters of the group action on monomials, which represent the cohomology. Which represents the cohomology class. So, because we've chosen simplicity provections, they're going to fix the monomials corresponding to the holomorphic form, but monomials that don't correspond to the holomorphic form, maybe they'll get multiplied by some root of unity, and it might be a different root of unity depending on what the monomial is. And then So here's an example. If you look at it, if we look at the from a pencil, we're going to have 21 periods and we get corresponding hypergeometric differential equations. We have three periods which correspond to our holomorphic form and its derivatives, satisfying this particular differential operator. Then we have six periods. So we have six periods showing up in pairs that correspond to another differential operator, and we have 12 periods satisfying an even simpler but still hypergeometric differential operator. And the groups that those fall into and the characters of the group action play together in a nice way. So, what would you So, what would you, your sort of naive expectation? We know that this talk story about the three periods and the Holomorphic-Picard-Fuchs equation gives us a degree three factor. So you might hope that the rest of it falls into the same kind of situation. That we might have three degree two factors corresponding to this one fourth, three-fourth thing, and that we might have twelve linear factors corresponding to this one-half one. And then we could play the same kind of game with the Klein-Mukai pencil. If we look at the Klein-Mukai pencil, we have 21 periods and all of these different differential operators, which have various fractions with 14 in the denominator. But 14 isn't a huge surprise because, remember, it has a group of order 7 acting on this thing. And so, your naive expectation would be, oh, Your naive expectation would be: oh, okay, well, each of these three periods gives me this differential operator, and so I should have a ton of degree three factors, one for every point of the differential operator. But unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how much you like complexity, we have, remember when we actually worked out an example, this is a degree six polynomial cubed, and a degree. Polynomial cubed. And a degree of six polynomial cubed, that's not a bunch of cubic factors over the integers. So, what I would sort of hope being that every one of these differential operators corresponds to a single factor, that isn't actually happening once we start looking at the rest of the cohomology. There's something a bit more subtle going on here. So, I'm going to, at this point in the talk, this is the point where I'm going This point in the talk, this is the point where I start diving in and telling you sort of more intense technical stuff. But you should expect here that the intensity of the technical stuff is kind of driven by the weirdness of this degree six to the third factor, right? Like we should expect something a little bit fiddly and a little bit careful to happen because that degree six thing isn't factoring the way we might hope. Right. So a thing I'm going to use is Gauss sums. And Gauss sums are kind of related. They're like a finite field generalization of the gamma function. So remember, you can think of the gamma function as appropriate analytic continuation of the integral from zero to infinity of t to the z minus one times e to the minus d t dt. Over finite fields, a Gauss sum is going to play in the same kind of way. What we do is we take a generator of a multiplicative character group on our finite field, and we take an additive character on our finite field, and then we just find a sum that multiplies some power of our multiplicative character times our additive character. Additive character. So just to match here, the integral here is acting like our sum, our multiplicative character is acting like this t factor, and our additive character is acting like the e to the minus t, which you can think of as acting like an additive term. That's the sense in which this analogy holds. We would like to assemble our To assemble our Gauss sums into something that is a finite field hypergeometric object. So the first thing that we do is we say, okay, let's make the assumption that if I multiply by Q minus 1, I can clear the denominators in all my alphas and my betas. Just these alphas and betas, I usually expect them to be fractions. Let's just assume I can clear those denominators using. Those denominators using the order of my finite field minus one, and then we'll define a finite field hypergeometric sum that involves a sum over everything almost in the finite field using again our multiplicative character and we'll use our Gauss sums. Remember hypergeomic. Remember, hypergeometric functions we thought of as kind of like complicated combinations of gamma functions. So now here I've got a complicated combination of a Gauss sum. The Gauss sum is acting like my gamma function, or if you prefer, like my sort of partial rising vector. So these have lots of properties that act like hypergeometric things in various ways. In particular, this capital G here, it's a combination of lots of little gas sums. So it really has that kind of like ratios of lots of different gamma functions field that we might expect using our alphas and our betas. And just to do some kind of plausibility check here, we said our common factor corresponded to this. A common factor corresponded to this particular hypergeometric differential operator. And when would this definition of Gauss sums that I just showed you apply? It would apply whenever 4 divides Q minus 1, the degree of our finite field. So that is a restriction on what kinds of finite fields we can work over, but it's not a horrible restriction. Unfortunately, it turns out that that kind of finite field hypergeometric function doesn't do everything that we wanted it to do. So we're going to use some work of Boykers and Cohen and Anton Mellet. I really appreciate all of the different algebraic surfaces that Boykers has here. They make this a They make this assumption or use this assumption that hypergeometric parameters, this list of alphas and this list of betas, are what they call defined over the rationals. What does it mean to be defined over the rationals? We take x minus e to the 2 pi i times our first fraction in the alphas, and then we take x minus 2 pi e to the 2 pi i times our second fraction, the alphas, multiply those all together. Look at the polynomial, though, each. Together, look at the polynomial that we get, and we ask: does that polynomial have coefficients that are in the rational, or does it instead have coefficients that are in some other extension of the rational, some other number field? Same with the betas. So the alpha and the beta are defined over Q if these polynomials have coefficients in Q. So just again to Just again to check that this is not an empty requirement, if I take the common factor parameters, I'll end up with an x minus i times an x plus 1 times an x plus i. And then, of course, my x minus i and my x plus i will pair up and give me something that's defined over the rationals. And for the betas, well, the betas are just 1, 1, 1. So it's not, you know, I think we can all trust that that is defined over the rations. So, okay, great. So, okay, great. The common factor parameters are defined over the rationals. And then we also need whatever the size of our finite field is, not to have any divisors in common with the least common denominator of the alphas and the betas, because it would be kind of bad if these alphas and betas were dividing by zero for us. So let's assume that we have. Let's assume that we have good primes. And if we have alpha and beta defined over Q, what we get when we play this game is we get things that are sort of a piece of a cycloton polynomial. We can multiply appropriately on the top and the bottom to make it actually look like x to some power minus one on the top and x to some other power minus one. And x to some other power minus one on the polymer. So associated to the alphas and the betas, we get other powers, we get other integers, p and q, that we can compute using the alphas and the betas. I don't want to write it down for you because I feel like I've already thrown a lot of notation at you. But taking these very computable P's, then Q's, Poinkers, Cohen, and ML that define Poikers, Cohen, and Mel that define a finite field hypergeometric sum that works for all of the good Q. Now, if you think about it, the bad Q are just going to be some finite list of things. If we're working only over finite fields and not their extensions, they would just be throwing away the factors of the L C D of our fractions outside beta. So, this finite field hypergeometric sum, it really generalizes what we said before, because instead of working. For because instead of working only for certain Q satisfying some kind of congruence, it works for all of the Q except for a finite list we have to throw away. All right, so that's the second advantage I was telling you about. And the first advantage is that these two definitions of finite field hypergeometric sums actually agree in the cases where they overlap. That sounds great. That sounds really useful. That sounds like we could compute a lot of stuff. But then when we actually sat down and started trying to use these things, we found out that we were looking, for instance, at stuff related to parameters with a 1/14th and a 9 14th and an 11 14th. And if you do out this computation, You do out this computation looking to see if it's defined over Q, the X minus E, the 2 pi i over 14, et cetera, et cetera, that is not defined over Q. So we have these hypergeodometric parameters that arose in a really natural way. We really are interested in this object we think is not too bad, but we didn't have an actual definition of a finite field hydrogen. Definition of a finite field hypergeometric sum that worked in that case. And the classic definition, if we jump back to that, it'll work as long as we require that our degree of our finite field is 1 mod 28. But 1 mod 28 starts to feel kind of restrictive, right? Like you might want to know about primes that are not 1 mod 28. So we'd really like to do better. And what we ended up doing And what we ended up doing is defining a notion that we called splitable, which says, okay, we've got some alphas and we've got some betas. Let's try to split them up so that some of our alphas are defined over Q, some of our betas are defined over Q, and then the rest of them are nice in the classic sense. So, we kind of have this trade-off. We'll build this kind of messy hybrid definition that works for any queue that's good and that is splittable in this sense. Kind of break stuff down that way. And then using this extension of the finite field hypergeometric sums, you can stick them all together and make an exponential series. And you'll actually get an L series again for any Q so that you have your splittable alpha and beta. So I'm heading up to the point where I can actually show you. I'm heading up to the point where I can actually show you some L-series. And way back when I said that we threw away some bad primes, so I should tell you what our bad primes are. 2 is always a bad prime. We kind of expect it to be bad because we multiplied by minus 4 times the product of all the variables. And then 7 is also bad for the client Buchai, and when we have a Zmod5Z symmetry, 5 is good. We'll throw those away. Let's throw those away. If we have a prime that divides the numerator or the denominator of either our parameter or our parameter minus one, those also are not great. Unsurprisingly, so here's what our main result looks like. Let me show you just the Fermat boarding first. We have the L series for the The L series for the entire firm according. It breaks down into a piece, an L series associated to this hypergeometric function. These are the same kind of parameters as we saw in the holomorphic form. And then we have another piece to the third power and another piece to the sixth power. And we can be really Really specific about various characters that we plug in to our L-series when we're evaluating. That's the Fermat pencil. One cool thing that you can do once you work this out really carefully is you can talk about the field of definition for the Neuhansevary on the Fermat Henson. So this gives you a way to pull it out. Gives you a way to pull it out. The field of definition for the nearline suburbia, we're going to want eighth-root immunity and then some very nice square root kind of things depending on summary. What happens for everything else? Stay tuned for the giant table. Here it is. So you can see, okay, here's the Fermat pencil. And in fact, in this case, the degree. In fact, in this case, the degrees of various factors did match up exactly with that computation that we did just on the periods, just working, looking at the various differential forms. On the other hand, with the Klein-Buchai, we have the degree three thing that's the fixed common factor, and then we have a degree 18 thing. In fact, in general, in our L series, those Those three sextics that I showed you, they actually just sort of all bunch together. So, the best that we can say over the client with eye is you've got the 318 all stuffed in. And then we can tell similar stories about factorizations for every single one of our families. They're associated to either hypergeometric function parameters, which we've listed explicitly here, or in a couple of places we get something that's just. Couple of places we get something that's just an L series associated to like a Dirichlet zeta function. So that doesn't get hypergeometric function parameters, but that's what those little dashes are in a table if you were wondering. Those are basically linear-ish factors. All right. So I've thrown a bunch of information at you. Let me thank you here and ask for any questions.
