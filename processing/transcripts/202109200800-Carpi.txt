McCarpi, who will be speaking on from W3 algebras to conformal nets. Well, so first of all, thank you very much. I thank the organizers for this very interesting meeting for the opportunity to talk. Well, this is quite, it was not prepared. It's quite, it was not prepared, but I think the two talks were near yes. This talk is very close. So, in spirit, in a sense, the argument is very close. I'll talk technically, there are many different, but with the Enrique's talk. So, I started with a specific type, also concentrated in model, but actually we have some abstract results. The emphasis on good algebra. The emphasis on Gutri algebra is that, for the moment, is the class of really non-trivial new examples that we get with this method. Okay. So there will be some repetitions with the Andre. I have a problem with the why. No, because the slides are not moving. I try. Try. I have some problem here now. Okay. Try to put full string again. Sorry. Okay, can you see the slides? No, because with full screen is not moving. I don't know why. Maybe I should do this. Ah, okay. This way is not. Okay, so. Okay, so this almost, so essentially, we know, we know from the previous talk, so we have these two approaches to what I call chiral conformal theories and conformal field theories on the circle. And one is vertex operator algebra or more generally vertex algebras and the other is conformal nets. And we are interested exactly as in Andre talk in the relation between these two approaches. Relation between these two approaches because, okay, there are many reasons to be interested on because one can, so probably one of the more of there is a conceptual reason. So we have two description of the same physical objects, say, so we would like to understand if they are equivalent and the other is mathematical. So because we have very different kind of axiomatization and also of instruments. And also of instruments to prove things. So if we can translate, we can maybe get results from one from one setting to the other or vice versa. Okay. Conformal nets are given with von Neumann algebras and okay here. This is a conference in subfactors and also vertex of either algebra. So I will not recall too much. I will recall something because of course the audience is quite Audience is quite interdisciplinary. Well, we'll try to. I have some problem. Okay. Okay. This was said also by Andre. So, okay, the fact that these two approaches were connected is known from many times. So there are many examples which are treated in body approaches and so on. But from the general point of view, The general point of view of looking for a general connection, take an abstract VOA and get an abstract net of vice versa. This is quite recent, and in particular, there is this paper by myself together with Yasu Kabaygashi, Roberto Lomno, and Michi Bener. It's published in 2018. Okay, and then there are some extensions. So, yeah, Tiziano Gaudio is a PhD student of Robin Hill. A PhD student of Robin Hillier, which worked also with me, has recently done a thesis in which more or less he extends all these results. And we have done this together. Probably will, so we are working on a preprint. This is okay. We extend this to super DOA. This is interesting because also to get new strongly local model passing through fermions, it's a good thing to do, for example, tenner. thing to do for example tenner also started from fermions in order to get things in this framework so here just i am adding that james tenner and now i should say also andre enriguez so there is a different approach which is more close in the spirit of siegel cft which looks quite different in for the connection but it's probably more or less the same so we all feel that all these things are equivalent so we can manage Equivalent. So we can manage. And the point is, we have different instruments and different ways to look at essentially the same problem. So this could be technically useful to prove more easily things. Okay, so what is this connection? One starts with the unitary VOA and one have to add an assumption, which is essentially a definition. And then one gets a conformal net. Of course, this is very abstract. Of course, this is very abstract nonsense, and the main point is that we get a lot of examples, but we have also a lot of examples which are open, so we don't know what happens. Okay, so many examples here is a short list. We know that strong localities, so we can do this for Virasoro VOAs, for example, for the affine unitary VOAs, of course, Virasoro unitary VOAs and Moonshine. VOA and moonshine, which is unitary, lattice VOA, and so on. Yeah, I should also mention that this is done, for example, lattice was proved by Ling Wui in general, because in the paper here, we proved only the Rankuan case. And maybe I should mention that, so I think after this first paper, which is essentially what I would call the vacuum sector, there have been very important progress in representation theory, which Representation theory, which probably is the more interesting aspects of the story, especially for tensor categories, which is part of the title of this work. Okay. Okay. Okay, in the proof, maybe I will say something more, but okay, these proofs of strong locality relies on some bounds that we call linear energy bounds. I will say something more. Bounce. I will say something more later. So essentially, one assumes that the algebraic object, the VOA, has a scalar product, so we have a norm, and then we need some bounds with respect to the conformal Hamiltonian, so the energy operator, L0, the zero part of the Virasoro algebra. Okay. And okay, these linear energy bounds typically are quite restrictive. When I say more or less directly, is the following. So, the example I typically done as follows: we take a model generated by linear energy-bounded fields, and then we take sub-algebras. And so, all the examples are given in this way, more or less. Here is a new method. It's a really new method. Maybe there is some new method also in the presentation theory worked by Bingui for Lattice. It's not exactly the same, but it's in any case related. The same, but it's in any case related to linear energy bounds. Okay, and then this new method we can treat an example for which clearly the natural generator do not satisfy the linear energy bounds, but can be treated in this way. Okay, so I started around four at ten. No, it's four here. Now, after many. No, after many, so just Robert. Can you hear me? Yeah, you start. Hello, I said at 10, 15, more or less than 10. Yeah, yeah. 10, 10. Say 10, 10. Okay. Just to okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, oh, yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Okay. Sorry. Okay. So I was saying this. So we have this new method, which is based on so-called local energy bounds. And I will explain something later. And the point is that, okay, the V3 W3 VOAs, the simple one with central charge C greater than two, have been proved to be useful. Have been proved to be unitary recently. So, strong locality VOA makes sense if the VOA is unitary. And then, using further result, we can prove that they satisfy the needed local energy bound. So, we get strong locality. And so we get new conformal nets from the W3 algebra. So, these conformal nets are, I think, completely new. So, we'll never found this kind of construction. From this kind of construction, so there are no alternative constructions, okay. And the talk is based on two recent papers with Yo Tanimoto and Michi Weiner. They are both on the archive. The first one is on unitarity. So unitary, this is a VOA paper, essentially. While the second is functional, more functional analysis paper on log and energy bounds strong locality. The first paper is going to appear in The first paper is going to appear in transformation groups. Okay, I see there is something in the chat, but it's for me. I don't know. Okay, okay. Well, now, sorry, I'm not so usual with the with Zoom. Okay. There is something because I don't see the top of the because there is okay no because I see the zoom okay now it's better okay I start with the recalling something we know almost everything so conform now we know it's uh so we have a map from intervals here I intend the function intervals here i intend the phonema conformanet in a contro concrete sense so the algebra for neumann algebra a i are given on a vacuum sector fixed limit space okay and we have all these assumptions i don't write every assumption i just make some names to this assumption so one is locality conformal covariance is related to this we have seen projective unitary representation of the different Unitary representation of the diffeomorphism group, which is related to the Virasoro algebra. And then the energy is bounded from below, and then there exists a vacuum vector with certain property. Okay. The tool, so the emphasis of my talk is on locality, so I repeat locality. What it means, it means that if we have disjoint intervals on the unit circle, then the corresponding fundamental algebra commute. So the element, each element of the first commute with each element. Commute with each element of the second. Okay, again, just to even to fix some notation, I recall something about vertex operator algebras. So let me see. Sorry, yeah, okay. So So, here we have instead of algebras, we have fields, what we call fields or formal power series. And in particular, we have this called vertex variable algebra. So, we have a complex vector space, B, or equal maybe for Neumann algebras are defined as complex Hilbert space. Okay, here we have a vector space, which is typically of countable, so in this case, countable dimension, so it's surely not a Hilbert space because. Because it cannot be complete. Okay, and then this is again should be thought about as the vacuum sector in the physicist language. And then we have this state field correspondence. So to each vector, we have a field. So operator variant distribution, formal distribution, or formal power series with coefficient in the space of endom. The space of endomorphisms of the vector space. Okay, and then we have various assumptions. I don't recall the technical details, but they, in a sense, look structurally similar. So we have locality, we have a conformal covariance, which this is expressed at the Lie algebra level, because we cannot integrate representation because the vector space is not complete. Okay. And again, the And again, the energy, which is the conformal energy, is bounded from below. We have a vacuum vector, and so on. Okay, oh, just again, because locality is important, I recall here, this looks very different, but it's not so. So, this is the way how one can describe the locality property of quantum field theory in the VOA setting. So, we say you take the commutator. Say you take the commutator of two fields at different variables, okay, and then this okay is not zero because this is too strong, but is zero if multiplied by a certain power of the difference of the two variables. Okay, this makes perfectly sense as a formal power series identity, okay. Identity. Okay. At the point we have to do this because this is something algebraic. So, more precisely, given A and B, you have to find such positive integer n, such that this, if you change A and B, n, that can change. Okay. Again, if we want to do conformal nets, we need the Hilbe space, it's a scalar product, so we need the notion of unitary VOA. Okay, and we can. Okay, Enriquez have given André gave the precise definition. Okay, the important point is there is some special scalar product which is related to the VOA structure through this antilinear automorphism of the VOA, which is called, we call the PCT operator. Okay. But this is something around VOA theory from many, many years. Many years. Okay, so this color product we call the invariance color product because it's related to the support invariant linear form on the VOA, which is typically unique. Okay. And then we have a norm, of course. Once we have a scalar product, we have a norm. Okay, maybe there is something that I brought. Okay, I wrote this that in the case of in the unitary case, this is interesting, is important. So, the uniqueness of the vacuum, which in this case is exactly saying that V is of CFT type, technically, then is equivalent, which is not in general true in VOA, to the simplicity of the VOA. Okay, so from now on, I will assume this sort of uniqueness of the vacuum, which means that the VOA is simple and unitary. Okay, and then I have to recall there is some vector, special vector, which describes the conformal symmetry. And here, because I need the notations. So the vertex operator, so the field related to this conformal vector has coefficients Ln satisfying a representation of A representation of the Villa-Soro algebra on V positive. And since the VOA in this case is unitary, this is a unitary representation of the Villa-Soro algebra. And then remember that maybe before I use parentheses for the coefficients of the vertex operators, this is annotation of the book of Victor Kartz, Vertex Algebra from Beginners. Here I introduce another. Here, I introduce another notation without parentheses, which is a sort of translation. And so the new endomorphism without parentheses are defined in the following way. Okay, it's just for homogeneous vector, this is just a translation of the indices. But it's more natural from for quantum filter in the universe. Okay, what you have to do? Okay, what you have to do? Uh, okay, okay, how we pass from VOA to conformantness. So, first of all, this is what we treated here, some three years ago, but in fact, much more than this. The preprint was there in 2015. Okay, the first assumption is. The first assumption is sort of technical, but it seems to be always true, is sort of bounds that we can see from the VOA. So we ask essentially that the of course, say in another way, so the VOA is a direct sum of finite dimensional exist spaces of L0. Okay, so we have operators, so and the operators and the endomorphisms, A. The endomorphisms A and restrict to this subspace. So, in this case, they give bounded operators. What we are asking, and these norms do not increase too fast. In fact, increase polynomially with the energy, so with the grading. Okay, so this kind of bound can be proved algebraically in bio situation. Of course, you have to do often when you say algebra means that there are no inequalities, but this is in fact true. This is in fact true, but okay, it's you have to add some inequalities. Okay, then once you have this, we define, of course, we have a vector space with the scalar product and we can complete it. As I said, V is never complete because of comfortable dimensions, so we get much larger vector space, which is the Hilbert space completion. Okay, on this vector space, we define what we call the smear vertex of Hilbert. The smeared vertex of a rigid. So essentially, this is done in the following way. So this should be: we take a vector in B, in the VOA, and we take this infinite sum. And this infinite sum, which is a n times the Fourier coefficient and Fourier coefficients of F, is convergent due to this energy bounds. Okay, and define a vector in Hilbert space. vector in the space. Okay, in this way, one gets an operator which is closable. Clausable means that the closure of the graph is the graph of an operator, of a linear operator. And this linear operator is unique. This operator associated to the closure of the graph is called the closure. And with the note here, without the not. So this YAF is the smear vertex. Is the smear vertex operator? Okay, these are typically unbounded. Okay, but unbounded operator can be related. So the point is that von Neumann algebras are algebra of bounded operators. Okay, bounded means continuous. They are everywhere defined on the Hilbert space. Unbounded operators are not continuous, but can be well behaved. And there is a way to relate unbounded operations. Way to relate unbounded overego to fundamental algebra. More precisely, okay, I say there is a fundamental algebra which is generated by this family, arbitrary family of closed operators. And in this case, we have this family and define this A V I as the phenomenal algebra generated by the subminer vertex operator. Smear vertex operator related to functions which have support in I. So this function should be smooth functions in any case. Okay. More or less, this means the following. So when you have a closed operator, one have a polar decomposition. One can write the operator as the product of a bounded operator, which is a partial isometry, and the self-adjoint operator. Saying that This is, in a sense, affiliated with the von Neumann algebra means that the polar part, so the phase, the partial isometry, and the spectral projection obtained by the spectral theorem of the positive part of the polar decomposition are elements of the fundamental algebra. Okay, and there is a smaller von Neumann algebra to which a family of operator is affiliated. Family of operator is a few weeks. Okay. Okay. So the map here is quite clear that if the family is larger, the phenomenal algebra generated is larger. So if we increase the interval, we have more functions with support in the given interval. And so we get larger phoneme algebra. So the map is inclusion preserving. Okay, there is a mistake here because. Okay, there is a mistake here because preserving there is an N, which, okay. The point is, what about locality? So, of course, there are many other properties, but locality is most important. So, here I make some comments. So, the point is: okay, as I said, the smear vertex of either are in general unbounded. In fact, they are essentially always in a certain sense. Always in a certain sense. Of course, they could be zero if f is zero, but in this case, they are always unbounded. They can be bounded in the super VOA case, but just if the vector has width one half. So this is the free Fermi field. Okay. And then, moreover, they are unbounded, so they are not defined on the complete Hilbert space, but just on dense domains. And different smirked operators will typically have different domains. So when you multiply. So, when you multiply, you sum, you are making something nasty, you have to pay some attention. Okay, the good things is that there is a sort of what is called a common invariant core. So we have a dense subspace of the Lild space, which is invariant for which is in the domain of every smear vertex operator and is invariant under the action of these smear vertex operators. These mere vertex operators, and also about the action of, for example, the dipheamorphis group, and so on. And on this, we can, for example, take the commutator of two fields. Okay. Okay. And so the fields with the smear with function with disjoint supports will commute. And this is called locality in the sense of Whiteman. And okay, so this is the relation between. Okay, so this is the relation between the traditional quantum field theory locality in the sense of Whitman and the VOA locality. But this is true. But the point is, okay, we have two unbounded operators that commute. Is it true that the corresponding von Neumann algebra that they generate will commute? And this is known to be, in general, false. So it's false, we don't know. In the VOA secting, we don't know. There is a conjecture that should be always true. Should be always true, but from the point of view of abstract operator theory, there are many contra examples. The first, probably more interesting, were constructed by Ed Nelson in the 50s, in the 60s, maybe. So he managed even very two sel self adjoint operator with the common invariant core commuting on this for which the corresponding phoneme algebras do not compute. Algebras do not convert. So we don't know if this is true. What we do, we give a definition. Of course, this is not nice. We say, okay, if the AB is satisfied locality, then we say that B is strongly log. And of course, this looks bad because we solve a solution with a problem with the definition, but. With a problem with the definition, but this is fruitful, in fact. Okay, so once we have strong galaxies, so we solve the problem of locality, then all the other actions comes. So A V is a conformant net. Okay, and then this map is very, so very, I don't know, quite well behaved. So we have many natural constructions which are preserved. Natural construction which are preserved, for example, tensor products, unitary sub-algebras. Okay, this natural construction preserves strong logality. So with this construction, if you have a finite family of examples, we can construct many other examples of strongly logality. And this is the way we proceeded in our paper. So we get a lot of examples. Oh, there is something technical more because. Is something technical more because the assumption, maybe I should say, one of the important results we got is that here we really want to use all the vectors in the DOA. So all the fields and not only a generating family. So this looks very restrictive, but in fact, we prove that it's not. So if we have a good generating family which works, then things work for this is one of more interesting technical results. Interesting technical result of our paper. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now come to the new things. This was a sort of motivation and notation. Okay. Then we have here the notion of primary field and primary vector is very important. So primary means this, that means that this. This, that means that this is a singular vector for the representation of the Villasoro algebra, or primary vector. So there are many names. So lowest, highest weight vector for the Villa-Soviet algebra. So this is okay. And then the corresponding field will say it is a primary field. This condition corresponds to the dithiomorphism covariance, a covariance of the single field. Okay, so the field is well behaved under the action of the lithe. Behave under the action of the lithomorphous group. Okay. Oh, now there is a point. Recall that V is a unitary soda representation of the Villasoro algebra is unitary, and then V is a direct sum of unitary representation of the Villasoro algebra. From this fact, it easily follows that the V is generated by the conformal vector together with its prime. Together with its primary vectors. So, okay, so primary vectors are the generative function. In fact, typically, you even, there is one case in which you need the conformal vector, which is the case of Virasoro VOA. In all other cases, I think you only need the primary vectors in order to generate the VOA. Oops. Oops, that's okay. Oh, finally, I want to define what is the remitian here. So we say that this field is a remittane if the following condition is satisfied. Okay. And then we can also see that, okay, the every, for example, every primary vector is a sum of anermic. Of an emission and I times another emission field. So it's a sort of real part and imaginary part. Okay. Okay, now take a primary of dimension d greater than one. Dimension is recalled, dimension is this, is the eigenvalue of the action of L0. So this is in the This is in the kernel of L0 minus D. Okay, so I take a vector which is primary of dimension D, and we assume the following. We assume a bound. Okay, of course, if we want, for the moment, I'm not assuming that the VOA is satisfying this polynomial energy bound that we use. I just assume that it satisfies this kind of polynomial bound for just one single. Bound for just one single A0. So the zero mode of this of the vertex or a variety corresponding to this selected fixed one vector. Okay. And we assume that this satisfies this kind of bound. Of course, here there is no n, no, it's just a zero. So there are two constants. So one is n and the other is certain s. Okay. I assume this bound. Then. I assume this bound. Then, what happens? We can prove this result. If, first, if s is less than b minus one, then a is zero. So we cannot hope to have the bound which such slow decrease. So you have to increase polynomially at most as d minus one. Okay. On the other hand, so this there is no oh, of course, if s is smaller, one should say that this you have a better bound. This you have a better bound, but if s is smaller than d minus one, this bound is true, it's too much, you cannot okay. If you get the best you can do, so s is equal to d minus one, then we have many, many other bounds, which are what we call these local energy bounds. So, the local energy bounds are the following: we take a function with Function which is non-negative, okay. And then we take its power at d minus one. So, of course, d is an integer here. So, this is again a smooth function with the same support. So, with support containing here. So, I take this mere vertex operator, and this is not bounded by okay, yeah, there is a mistake because the vector are missing here. Okay, I'm sorry. Yeah, okay, I'm sorry. So these are norms of operators, this is infinite. Okay, I wanted the norm of this applied to a function, okay, to a vector. So here you have to put after the parenthesis a vector, say c, and this has to be true for all c. Okay, so we have this local exactly as in the other bounds. I'm sorry for this. Sorry for this, and uh, okay, and here is that to have L0 plus one. We have this, I call Tg, again, this is notation I did not define, so the Tg is should be, so I call Tz the field defined by the conformal vector, so the Villasoro field. Okay, this is just took rapidly. So, this is the field, so when g is equal to one, this is a g is equal to one this is l0 this is the the field defined by the conform the vertex operator of the conformal vector smear with the function okay so what is the difference is that while l0 is something global which is smeared with the function with support in the whole circle because it's one here we have something which have the same support this so this bound makes sense locally okay okay Okay. Okay. But Rigold, this is not a norm, this is a mistake. Here, you need a vector. Okay. Okay. Okay, the results that say that we cannot hope more than s equal to d minus one. So this, when we have this power, This, when we have this power s equal to d minus one, we say this is optimal bound for a zero. Okay, so this is optimal bound for a zero, and it implies something more, these local energy bounds. Okay, of course, these bounds are interesting, could be, for example, interesting in other construction, for example, in order to work with this framework considered by Tener and Andrea. I think. I think also that James used this in some other papers. And okay, and they are interesting also for representation theory for spectral triples and so on. But here, the emphasis in this talk is with the strong locality. So they have consequence in strong locality. The point is the following. And okay, one can prove the following. So if you have two vectors, which are primary vectors of the Hermitian, I have. I have to say, yes, Hermitian, primary vectors of dimension di, so different, one i is equal to one and two, and they satisfy, they both satisfy optimal bounds with respect to their dimension. And if g1 and g2 are non-negative smooth functions, then we take those mere vertex operators corresponding to this quantity, and this will Will the spectra come you are self-adjoint if, of course, they are remedian. These operators are self-adjoint. This is not trivial at all because you have that the operators are symmetric, but the fact that they are really self-adjoint is not trivial at all. And moreover, the spectral conjecture commutes. Okay, and this is exactly the kind of problem we need. Maybe I take some comment for the expert. So, the main point here is that. So the main point here is that we are able in a sense to prove linear energy bounds using these local bounds. We are able to prove the linear energy bounds. Not that the local energy bounds are in a sense non-linear. Linear means that the power here is one. Okay, so the so S is equal to one and here typically B this will be greater than one if the dimension is greater than two. Dimension is greater than two. Okay, but one would like to have linear bounds with other operators which are not the conformal Hamiltonian. And this is what we can do. And it works. It works because essentially one can find nice positive operator which bounds this smear vertex operator and which commute with them. And this makes things easy. Using this criteria by Using this criteria by Lieslier Frehrlik and or Jaffe Glimmer Jaffe, which they use this kind of things with linear energy bounds in order to prove that the interactive model of P52 satisfies their Castle axioms. Okay. And then we have the following consequence. So I take a VOA, which is generated by V1. So V1 are the fields of dimension. So, V1 are the fields of dimension one. This was known that they are good because they satisfy linear energy bounds. Also, Viraso Hermitian Virasoro fields, also these are good, this was known before, but we can add a family of new fields which satisfy the optimal energy bound. And then, if this is the case, be strongly local and generate a conformal net B. Okay, now we go a little bit ruggy. Now we go a little bit rapid on this part because I think I have 10 minutes more or less. I'm right. Robert, I don't know. Okay. Yeah, I think maybe more or less, but I think I will stop a little bit. I try to stop a little bit before. Okay, just check something here. Yes, okay. Okay, using the previous result. So, this is something abstract. The point is: okay, let me show examples about this. Okay, we were the feeling is that, okay, this should be always true, but we only get some few examples. Actually, the first example was done by Michi Wener in the case of fields of dimension one, which is the case of which is not. Which is not good for this theorem, but the local energy bounds can be proved in other cases. Okay, but we wanted non-trivial examples. Non-trivial examples, we were looking to do W3 algebra. Okay. Okay. And then look for the case with central char greater than two. Why? We look to this case. So, okay, if one looks. Okay, so okay, if one look to the central charge in the unitary case. So in the unitary case, if you look at cases in which the central charge is less than or equal to two, then you can make a free field or other coset realization showing that these are unitary subalgebras of well-known strongly local like VOA. Like VOA, like they are fine, or yes, or U1 currents, and so on, Heisenberg. So, okay, in this case, you get strong locality by the old result of old, so the previous result by myself with Yazu, Roberto Longo, and Michi Reiker. Okay. Okay, so the interesting case is C greater than two. Okay. Greater than two. Okay. So let me recall another little bit what W3 algebra is. So I just give a definition in a VOA setting. So I say I take C difference for this number. One can define the W3 also in this case, but it's a little bit singular. Say I don't want to do this. Okay. And then we have the VOA. Okay, I just defined the simple one, in fact, typically simple, automatically. So, the simple VOA generated by a conformal vector nu and a single primary vector of dimension three, which I call WZ, the corresponding field. So the field corresponding to this new vector, primary vector, is a primary field of dimension three. And we ask the following commutation relation. Commutation relation. Okay. Okay, now it's not so, of course, it's very important to look at this commutation relation to get our results because we need to prove estimates. But now, I just want to give an intuition. So, one of the main points is that also here, there is a mistake. Something is missing. There is a mistake here. Okay, there should be. Failure should be maybe someone can recognize. I don't remember, there should be something. No, maybe not. I'm not sure. No, no, maybe it's good. No, no, maybe it's good in this way. So the main point is that, see, this is not a relation of Lie algebra type, like in a fine case of Virasoro case, because, okay, then when you take the commutator of that to V, then you get some Virasoro operators, but you get this guy, Lambda. Get this guy lambda, and this guy lambda is something which is non-linear in Virasoro in the Virasoro generity. Okay, and okay, this is also called a sort of non-linearity algebra by Katz and this alle. Okay, if we want to prove strong locality, we need the unitarity, and this is the first problem, okay, and this is the necessary. And this is the necessary condition which was known many, many, many years ago. I think at the end of the 80s, more or less, or first with Zubuchi and various others. Okay, the necessary condition is the following. We have, similarly to Villasor, we have a discrete series below two and then a continuous. Okay, if you want unitary, so in particular, central charge is real and non-negative. Of course, we have the case C equal to zero. Of course, we have the case c equal to zero, which corresponds to the trivial. Everything is trivial. And okay. Okay. Okay. These are necessary conditions. The question, it was known that for C less or equal to two, there are this explicit unitary construction embedding into unitary VOA, so you can get unitary for C less than two or equal to two. C less than two or equal to two. But what about C greater than two? Okay, we look at this, and with surprise, we did not find any result in the literature. And at the end, we work it sometimes, it's not trivial at all, and we get the result. So this VOA is unitary for all C greater than two. So the necessary condition in this case is okay. Okay, see what to do was known. Okay, okay. Well, okay, there is some comment about the proof. The idea is that there was a well-known free field realization of W3 by Fatev and Zamologikov at the end of the 80s. Okay, and then we make a sort of strange singular modification of this using. Modification of this using a related construction by Google School, but use it in the context of is again a free filterization of Virasoro. So essentially, we extend this singular free filterization of Virasoro by Googles and Schutzmir back to the case of Farrev Zamologykov. And using this, this is good because the Farrev Zamology of this explicitly non-unitary realization. Unitary realization, while in a certain sense, the Google School buck is almost unitary. Okay, then I don't want to give more detail on this because I have no time at all. Okay, the next steps is the following proposition. This is okay, the first result unitarity is the unitary paper, and the second is the more recent paper, 2021. Okay, and then the point is that the W. The point is that the wz field, so the second field generating, so the generator for w3 satisfies the optimal boundary. Okay, this is hard work, but is it true? So, of course, it's a kind of checking some bound. I have idea to prove this. Okay, this is true for C greater than. So, we prove at least for C greater than or equal to one. In any case, this is interesting because in the other case, strong locality was known. And then, as a pro as a consequence, together. Consequence together with everything, we get this family of new examples which also give new conformal nets. So we have strong locality for all this. Note that these are fairly non-rational, VOA and the corresponding conformal nets are absolutely not completely rational. So this is an interesting family like the family of Villasoro conformal nets or Villasoro BioA with central charge greater than one. Okay, I can stop here. Okay, I can stop here. Just thank you for the attention. Okay, thank you. Are there any questions?
