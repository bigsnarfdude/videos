Okay, just a second, please. Okay, uh, first of all, I want to say thanks to the organizer for this invitation. I am so happy to be here. Unfortunately, I couldn't assist presentially, but anyway, I am even so happy. In this talk, I want to show you about our work that relies with. Today lies with Duban Cardona, Elena Kaikina, and Naka Hayashi. In this work, we consider the initial boundary value problem for the Benjamin equation, where H denotes the Hilbert transform. In this paper, in this paper of Shamir, Shamir, we can find an interesting study of this Hilbert transform on certain domains, especially in this work. He proves some properties of this Hilbert transform when we restrict our function u on the right half line. This symbol denotes the principal value of this integral, of this integral. integral of this integral. Okay. How about the Benjamin on equation? Ah, sorry, I have a mistake here. We notes that for the real line, this Benjamin equation admits multi-solutions and satisfies infinitely many conservative quantities. Even we know that the Benjamin equation The Bring-Jaminon equation is a model for long internal waves. We know that we can solve this equation for a method, but analog method of the inverse scattering. We can find this result in this paper of aerobics and focus. About the local and global wealth positions, Yorio proved. Well, Pos and I proved that if we take the initial datum in Hs with S greater than 3 over 2, and we use some of these conserved quantities, we can prove local well-posedness in this space, and even we can prove global well-positeness when in HS when S greater than two. Even Even in this paper of the law of Bona and Sato, the authors proved that the global positions for the Benjamin equation in HS with S greater than 3 over 2. Even in this paper, the author extends the results of Yurio. Even Ponce In 1981, extended the local results to this critical index. He proved that the global result for any solution in HS with S is greater than equal that 3 over 2. Ian Tao recently showed that the initial value problem associated to the evangelical Problem associated to the Benjamin equation is globally well posited in HS. And UNESCO and Kenny established local results for the Benjamin equation, sorry, for the generalized Benjamin equation in HS. Now, the idea of our work is prove this main result. We establish global solutions. Global solution for the initial boundary value problem for the Benjamin equation when in this functional space, when we consider the initial datum in this sovereign space, like type sovereignty, this is the initial condition and this is the boundary condition. Even we prove that our solution. That our solution we can control the norm in H1 by the norm of the initial condition in the boundary data. This control, we can control this norm for all t greater than zero, but the norm of the solution in L to one in this weighted Lebesgue space depends of the time, even depends on the time. So what Of the time. So, what is the idea here? What is the problem? The first step is to consider the linear problem. We consider this, and the idea is to find an integral representation for the solution to this problem. But we have a problem here because the idea is apply Laplace transform to the equation, something like this, but But the first problem is how to understand this Laplace of the Hilbert transform. Even the symbol of the Hilbert transform is not analytic. In the Laplace transform, the Laplace transform of a function must be analytic in some domain, in some special domain. So the idea here is use an approach invested in the analytic. An approach invested in the analytic continuation method given by Haya Sheikh and Kalkina. Here, the idea is to use some tools of complex analysis in order to solve this problem of not analyticity for the symbol. How to solve this problem? We introduce an operator. This operator is like a Hilbert transform but on the imaginary line. On the imaginary line, in order to solve the non-analyticity of the symbol. And even we showed that exactly one only boundary condition is necessary in order to the solubility of this problem. So the idea is applied to Laplace transform to the equation. And even we prove the Laplace transform of the Hilbert transform of the Happen. Transform of the second derivative has this representation, where P is a projector operator, like a Hilbert represent a Hilbert transform. This is the operator that we introduced. Even we proved that this operator P satisfies the Schaposki-Planner formula, where P mass, P plus, where p plus and p minus are the principal value, are these limits when we are here, and p plus is when we approximate in this direction, and p minus when we approximation in this direction. The showkoski prime formulae say those das these two equalities. If we add these two equalities, we have these two formulas. These two formulas. Even the Shokowski-Plimer formula helps us to represent our solution in this way. In this way. But even here we have a problem because the symbol Kp is equal to minus modulus PP, and this symbol is not. And this symbol is not analytic. And if we want to apply inverse Laplace transform, we must have an analytic function here. So in this step, we do the following. We have a problem here, here, and here, where we have the symbol. So we use these two results of complex analysis. If we have an arbitrary function that An arbitrary function that satisfies the Holder condition, this function can be represented in this form, like a construction of a function u plus with a function minus, where the definition of these u plus and u minus depend of the projector operator. So if you have a function that satisfies holder condition, even we can represent this. Even we can represent this function like a subtraction of two analytic functions. Even this lemma, lemma of index zero, gives us a representation of a function phi, like a quotient of an array function, where our the only condition for our for this function phi is that That its index must be zero. This is the variation of the argument along the imaginary line must be zero. These functions are determined by this formula. Even here appears the projector operator. And it's necessary that we have this equality, this condition equal to zero, because we need that the logarithm of... That the logarithm of the function must be well defined. With these two lemmas, we do the following. We denote kp like this, and even when consider an auxiliary function kp tilde, the idea here is analyze this equation. This equation only have one root on the right half line, have complex. Right half line, half complex line. So if we consider or we introduce these omega plus and omega minus, we note that this function has index zero. So by the index zero lemma, this function can be represented like a quotient of two analytic functions. So we can do this. Do this. We can do this. So, as conclusion, our symbol satisfies this equal G minus catilde P plus C. But this function is analytic on the right half complex plane. Except one point, like except this point, Kc. This point Kc, sorry, except this point Kc that is a solution of this equation. Okay, and these formulas are given by the zero index lemma. So, with this tool, we do the following: we rewrite our solution. our solution like a part this part contains the initial the initial condition and in this part we have the boundary duct here so these functions that appear in the representation are projector of are projection of several functions that appear in the in the representations In their presentations. Now, so we obtain that our solution for the linear problem has the representation, a part with the initial condition in a part with the boundary condition. At this part, all the tools are from complex analysis. Now, With this, we obtain an integral formulation for the non-linear problem in this way. The idea is to apply the contextual mapping to prove that we have only one solution to this problem. For this, we must to prove some estimates for the operator G and V. Later G and B. So sorry, what happened here? Okay. So if we have S between one in R, so let me second what happened here. Okay. With this condition, we can prove that GT U0 in H1. In H1 can be controlled by the norm of the initial condition in H1 plus epsilon. Even we have here a less of regularity in the solution. And the boundary condition H in H1 can be controlled by the norm of H in H1. With these two estimates, we can prove this proposition. If we consider the initial condition here, this is a H1 with L21 weight, and H in this space, H1 L21, with epsilon in this interval, this initial boundary value. This initial boundary value problem has a unique global solution that lives in this space. But our idea is proof that even the solution lives in a weighted sovereign space. For this, we use the approach of this paper of Fonseca and Ponce. In this paper, In this paper, they proved or they studied the initial value problem for the Benjamin equation in weighted sovel space. So, for this, we consider the solution. We prove that the solution U lives in this weighted solar space. The idea is split our solution like. Our solution like u plus b plus zeta, where zeta is the solution of the homogeneous linear problem. Here we have zero, like an initial condition, and here we have b, that is the solution of the non-linear problem with the initial condition. We can prove directly that the norm of zero is the normal. The norm of zeta in L2 epsilon can be controlled by the norm of H in our space zeta 11. But in order to estimate this, we use this approach, the approach of Ponsecan Ponse. The idea is the following: we consider a small node decreasing. smooth no decays in we consider smooth no decreasing function w n such that this derivative has this inequality and satisfies this is equal to one plus x if the norm is less or equal to n and to n if the norm is less or equal to t n equal to TN. We multiply the equation for this function and integrating and we obtain this representation like an energy estimation. The idea is control this integral and this integral in order to control this norm here. And this is the idea. Sorry, I must run because. Sorry, I must run because I have class in 10 seconds, 10 minutes. Sorry. Thank you, Mary. Any questions or moments? 10 seconds. Maybe you have to run to a class. Okay, I think we'll let you run the class. Ah, yeah. Ah, yeah. So, thank you. I guess you're okay. Yeah, goodbye.
