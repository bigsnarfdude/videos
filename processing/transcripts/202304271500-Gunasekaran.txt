So our next speaker of the session, Sharmila Go-Sakara from Fields Institute. And again, her title is on the slides. So. Yes, thank you very much for the invitation and the chance to speak here. This is joint work with Gary Bio, Harry Funduri, and Ed Bogart. So I would like to start with some Some perspective from GR just to put this quasi-Einstein manifold question in a bigger context. So let's think about solutions to the Einstein equations. I will just use spacetimes for those, though space-time learners enough more than this time. So there are only a few explicit solutions under symmetries, and so that naturally asks the question: can we classify them? Do we know? Can you classify them? Do we know those are the only solutions under these symmetries? So, and because there are these few explicit solutions, it also makes problems in astrophysics really hard. Do you use these solutions? Do you know the solutions that have to be used? And uniqueness of these solutions, and if you can prove uniqueness, like the no-hair theorem that James was talking about other data, it's useful in predicting the final state of the application collapse. So now we know that. Collapse. So now we know that if you have spherically collapsing matter, then it has to end up being a Schwarzschild black hole. And if you have matter with rotation, finally when it goes to equilibrium, it has to be a curved black hole. So this is one aspect where the uniqueness observations or space-times pops up. And it's also useful in making predictions for gravitational wave observations, where you have to predict the pattern of causing normal modes. And also, Remotes and also to predict the kind of images that you would get from the computer screen. So, all of these have nothing to do with external black holes. So, now I'll make a case for external black holes, which most astrophysics may not agree with. So, astrophysical black holes are almost external. That means they are they have almost maximum rotation for a given mass. There is a difference between almost external and external, but we never decide to understand it. But people never understand the limit of your parameters, right? So it's interesting to look at external black holes. And they also saturate external black holes, they also saturate various geometry unique lengths, like the mass angle and unique lengths. And the usual uniqueness theorems don't automatically apply here. So when you look at the uniqueness theorems, there's usually this condition, but you can write such uniqueness theorems, there is this condition of a non-degenerate auraxing which means extremely. Rights and extreme cases actually execute. But as we've heard from the previous speaker and also in the very first day, extreme black holes admit a notion of what is called a near-horizon geometry. So the motivation for us to look at Posi-Einstein manifolds is from that angle. Can that tell us anything about this? So the long-term goal is the classification of Is the classification of quasi-engine metrics. So these are triplets, which are solution to this equation for a positive finite m and a real lambda. But the primary interest, though, came from the vacuum near-horizon geometry use. So that is vacuum near-horizon geometries that arise from external black holes with a non-zero overall. But many results, you can easily derive them from the shape of the two, and that is as we just get. There are two questions that I'll address in the talk, two specific problems that I'll give answers to. One is: what kind of rigidity do we have when this one form is closed? So this would include the static case, that is, this would include the case where external black holes are static. So these near-horizon geometries would include those black holes. But then there are also There are also non-static black holes which can have a static memory in geometry. I don't know about any examples, but that's the case. Okay, so what kind of digital questions are we asking here? So if this is closed, can we say anything about G being an Einstein actually? The conditions are automatically implying that G is Einstein. And okay, G is Einstein. Then can we also say or can we conclude that it's true? Conclude that it's truly the Einstein, that is, it is one form actually balanced. So, we did some work here to get some conditions on when G is Einstein and when this is zero. And Bill Wiley recently completed this legitimate classification. And the second question, which is a work in progress, is the uniqueness of Kerr radius near Isin Geometry. So, this is obviously the Neumborizing Geometry. So, this is obviously a linearizing geometry that comes from an extreme third-inh black hole. So, this is a metric on S2, this is a solution on S2. And we are asking about, you know, we would like to know if this is a unique solution to S2. So, this uniqueness is investigated in the space of near-horizon geometries and not quasi-Einstein metrics in general. Now, there are bigger questions. So, these are the uniqueness of near-horizon geometries within. Geometries within the bigger space of quasi-metrics. And I didn't discuss this talk with her in advance, but I think there is an answer to that now. So I'm not going to address that here. And then there is also this question of what does the uniqueness or non-uniqueness of a certain NSG on S2, specifically the ones with the non-zero positive marginal constant, what can that tell you about the sub-scale extreme one? So I'll just review this very quickly and briefly. External black holes admit the following space-time description near the horizon, which is at r is equal to zero. And you can do this limiting procedure at the horizon that we spoke in detail about, and you get what is called a four-dimensional new horizon space limit method. So, this is still four-dimensional, and it is a solution to the constant equations as well. Well, so it's perhaps not a good idea to pay attention to this. So, you know, I wrote this after James L. Shady's talk, and then I realized my conditions are different, so this is absolutely different. So let's see about that. Okay, so the four-dimensional neo-horizon space-time metric solves the Einstein equations. So explicitly, with the condition that I have a closed one form, which is the... Flows one form, which is the static case, the Einstein-Field equations reduce to the following. So the only ones which tell us something new are the very first and second equation. I can derive the current both from these two. So I don't get any new information. And this very first equation is just a definition for this function y. So that's this slide. So that is an aspect of the four-dimensional metric. It's not really. Dimensional metric. It's not really something to do with the near horizon metric. So, you know, though it is a new equation, though it provides some information, it's not really going to be relevant for the neo-horizon geometry studies. So these are the two equations that would be interested in. Excuse me, static means homogeneous of the yeah, what you're writing. But static means sorry I was very sorry. Yeah, so uh like yeah, we're kidding how to feel this hypersurface uh So the horizon is homogeneous, or the phase type is homogeneous? Or both? They both have the killing field, but I mean only one killing could. Only one. But in particular, it really means that the closed of S of X sorry about that. Yes, so it is just called static because it is a condition that comes from the static of your original space dimension. Of your original space-time measure, that would imply that it's closed. So, this is the static near-horizon system. The questions we would like to answer are Menalese and STEACH-Einstein. And because we're also interested in the quality-Einstein case, just better question to ask is Menaldi's quasi-Einstein or Jesus Einstein? And well, if we are, then can we say anything about the fix zero that you're going to? zero that number should be against. So this the case for lambda equals zero was resolved by crucial real and thought where we proved that when you have a closed x then it automatically means that x is equal to zero and it's just which you flat. And they also claimed in the same work that this holds true for negative lambda case as well. Negative one that case as well. And this was also stated as the theorem with a beautiful growth of genes. And they also claim the same for positive lambda. Now, it is true, the statement is true for positive lambda, but there is a counterexample to second statement. Sorry, what is big XQL? Oh, so sorry. Okay, so I'm just using the. No, so it's just a Bakerian read. Okay, explain what we're literally. Okay, so the Q denotes M equals 0. Yeah, yeah, sorry, yeah. So they were looking only at the M Horizon geometry case, so anything to do not do. I'll say it's nothing but a straight geometry. Sorry, so which thing has a kind of use? Oh, the second one. But you say it's a theorem. Just a wrong theory. Oh, it's wrong in both places. Yes, so this was a claim here and stated as a theorem based on the claim here. A theorem based on the claim here. Okay, right. So this is the counterexample. So Alison wasn't really looking at just near Horizon geometry. She was looking at quasi-entient metrics in general. She was some sort of examples. And then, so this is a counterexample. Let sigma be a compact type volume manager. Be a compact type volume manifold, length of section curvature. And now let's consider this five-dimensional space-time. So, this is a BTZ black hole, three-dimensional black hole, and you know, product with this metric. So, this is my space-time, and this is an external black hole, and for the value of A for the one-on-one floor, you know, if you can look at what the near-horizon geometry is, A is just a parameter of the solution. I'm not really spacing here. So, I get the following. So, I get the following year horizon geometry, and x is just defined as 2 times dπ. Now, impose the above metric on S1 times sigma. So, you can see that this definition says phi is just on the s1. dx is equal to 0, but we know we need at least two coordinate patches to come on the s1. So, this is definitely not exact. So, this is an example for. So this is an example for m is equal to 2, but we can easily modify this for any n. So if this was, yeah. Is there hope that the zero is still true? Oh, if you correct it. If you correct it, I think she'll tell us. Yeah, yes, yes. Yeah, so there is a duty which calls, but yeah, obviously. Yes. Okay, so this. Okay, okay, so this is what we have, and okay, we have a counterexample for n is equal to 2, which can be generalized to Em. It's not a counterexample for EM because they need to be taken for Em. Okay, so let me go through the argument of Switzerland, Todd, and Real. And so this is their argument, and we can just see where there is a gap or a glitch when you have a narrow cosmological constant. So let's just start with the BMP identity. Start with the BMP identity, cover M with contractable domains. On each such domain, we have this. We can just locally find a function which is exact. So X can be locally defined this way. And on all these overlap patches, you have this, it's differing by a constant. Now, I use the BMP identity, so x is just this here. I use the BMP identity, and this is what I get. So this quantity is equal to zero, but it's equal. point B is equal to zero, but it's equal to zero on each such tree. And so this is equal to this quantity that you have, this is equal to mu times e the 2f over m on each such 2. So what really helps us here is the form of this right hand side here. So you have constant times something which is just forward. Now the left hand side Now the left hand side is actually, the left hand side has nothing to do with the F. You can just write it in terms of the X. So that is something that's just globally defined. It's not something that's specific to a domain. So because the left-hand side is globally defined, so should the right-hand side be defined. So we have this relation. We can equate it to such domains. And because of the form of this function, exponentials cannot be negative. Cannot be negative. So these both should have the same sign. So either they're all zero or they should have the same sign. So you can just choose, you know, these are not really fixed on these domains at the outset, which is free data. You can choose it. So you can choose this to be just a constant mu and you obtain a global function. So either your mu's are all zero, in which case there is no such f, or you can make a global choice. Or we can make a global choice and we get this. So now we have a globally defined f and mu, and we have this from the Bianca identity. And now let me integrate this over m. So m is close to one manifold. Let me integrate this over this. So what we can see is that for lambda bigger than or equal to zero, you cannot have mu is equal to zero. So let me go back here. So let me go back here. Okay, so either you have mu is equal to zero or you have an exact f. So it's actually exclusive. So one cannot have this, which means one cannot really have an exact f. And if lambda is less than zero, you cannot make the same conclusion. You have a negative quantity here, you have a negative lambda here, so you're allowed to have a negative, you're allowed to have exact You're allowed to have exact f. So this is equal to zero, with bx is equal to zero, but then x may not be exact. So what we get in this case is you get a partial rigidity. And I'll state the complete thing later on. So if this is not negative Einstein, then x is not exact, it's incompressible and has a constant norm. So I won't go through the proof of all the these, but then this is the rigid statement. But then this is the rigidity statement, and you have a vanishing oil of the characteristic and R. Now, so this is the full rigidity statement for Pasi-Einstein metrics. So let mgx be a closed manifold, which is quasi-Einstein for some m, and you're imposing this static condition. Then for lambda is equal to zero, it's Ritchie flat. You recover whatever Kush Lutt and Zutka had. Whatever Kushl Todd and Zutka had. This is just a slight improvement from the near horizon case to the Poisi-Enston case. And if lambda is bigger than zero, then x is exact. If either n is equal to two or r is equal to constant, then there's vanishing x. So what this does is it recovers the near-horizon geometry result for four-dimensional space-times or two-dimensional near-horizon geometries, which will be undeveloped. And for you know, this is the interesting case for lambda less than zero, you have either it's negative Einstein as this point, or x is non-trivial in homology, incompressible, and has a constant norm with a vanishing Euler characteristic constant which is killer. Now so and recently widely had an improvement so While he had an improvement. So, what we are seeing is the following. So, there is Chevy Lee Einstein, when dx is equal to zero, it gives you x is equal to zero. Then there's Allison's counterexample, and then we have a bunch of conditions, you know, a bunch of the GP conditions. So what Will did was we proved that, okay, the only kind of counter examples you can have for Richard Todd's Todd-Real's proof was examples of this kind. So, M, this isometric. This kind, so m this isometric. So it's either metri negative Einstein or it's isometric to a product metric, which is an n-dimensional metric. And so that completes the rigidity for static. Now we'll move over to the uniqueness of current ABS neomerizing geometry. So the very construction of a neomerizing geometry builds its information. Goes its information about the asymptotic structure of the corresponding external black hole. So, not just the two-dimensional, but what I earlier defined as a near-horizon geometry space-time trick itself loses that information. So, what it means is that you cannot make global uniqueness and conclusions from just the near-horizon geometry. But to know the uniqueness of the current near horizon geometry, was useful including the following, the current Proving the following term that was mentioned in the detail before. So you use this and it helps you to prove that the Kerr black hole, the asymptotically flat Kerr black hole, is a unique solution when you have the following conditions. So asymptotically flat, stationary, axisymmetric, black hole solution of the Einstein vacuum equations, and with a determinate for Einstein. Generic provision. So, what we were thinking is: okay, if you have an analogous uniqueness theorem for per ABS, then can you say anything about the uniqueness for the spotty platform? Okay, so this is the uniqueness of the axis image near Horizon geometry, which was useful in proving the uniqueness of the full space-time. Spacetime, full spacetime, full extraneous space-time. Now, here there is an assumption of axis symmetry. So, this is a unique near-horizon geometry if you assume axis symmetry. But the question is then, can you actually say anything without the axis symmetry assumption? So, this is a metric on S2. Can you say anything about the uniqueness of this new horizon geometry metric on S2 without the axis symmetry? So, a local result was proved. A local result was proved by Jazirski Kalinsky and Krushchov Sukka and Todd. So the result is the following: so let S denote the set of pairs on S2 satisfying the vacuum near Ising geometry equations. All this means is that this is an NSG solution on S2. Then they prove that in the neighborhood of the solution, every other solution, everything else that is a linearization, is only going to be another. Is only going to be another Kerr NSG. So, all this means is that this neighborhood, which is a linearization of Kerr NSGs, is again just a Kerr NSG. Now, there is a result for axis symmetric NSG by Hardy and James, where they proved that, okay, if you have axis symmetric NSGs on Axisymmetric energies on axisymmetric energy on S2, which satisfy the near-horizon geometry equation, but then for the non-zero lambda, then it has to be a Kerr ADS lambda or a Kerr DS lambda. It's true for both positive and negative lambda. But because of the inherent instability that ADS space-time has, it's not very clear if the corresponding conjecture. Clear if the corresponding conjecture for the extremal black hole is true. So it might be false. There's no evidence to support either. So the conjecture though is the following, that only four-dimensional stationary black hole solution of the Einstein-Backel equations with cosmological constant containing a connected degenerate horizon with non-toroidal horizon sections. This is because we don't have a horizon topology clear. Is the extreme variable solution? Now, the energy, you know, the very nature of taking an energy limit loses information. So, even if we are able to prove something about near-horizon geometries with a cosmic multiple constant, we are not sure if that will help this. But if there are instabilities in these energies, if it can prove that, okay, this is not the only unique energy, maybe that can tell us something about the non-uniqueness of. The non-uniqueness of this background curved alien solution. Again, this is very heuristic. There's no clear path. A lot of these lambdas equal to negative cases are very much open. But that was never the motivation for looking at the uniqueness of the Kurdish issue. Okay, so this is the conjecture. Every non-static near-horizon geometry of the form arises from an extreme. Arises from an extreme per alias black hole. Now, similar to the case for vanishing cosmological constant, addressing this for every near horizon geometry on S2 is hard. So we were looking at, okay, we were looking at proving a local result similar to the result for curved horizon geometry. That is, every near horizon geometry of the form which solves the linearization of the near horizon Linearization of the linearizing geometry equations about the specific Kerr ABS solution belongs to this phase of ABS4. And I'll outline the approach that we have, which very much mirrors the case for vanishing cosmological constant, and we have some partial results from the prediction. Okay, so first, this is the Kerr-ADS near-horizon geometry solution. It's, you know, as you can see, Solution. It's, you know, as you can see, it's a non-closed case. So dx is nothing but zero. And these are the ranges for the parameters and the coordinates. And these two parameters are related. A and R plus are related. And so this is essentially a one parameter family, which is not the case for the lambda is equal to zero curve. That's just a point in the space of solutions. And so this is. And so this is a solution on S2, and this one form X vanishes at the poles. So the approach is very much similar to the lambda is equal to zero case, but then the results you get are much less robust. There are more solutions in the kernel that you have to eliminate following the approach for AES. So let's define a quasi-ungstant operator and let this be a smooth And let this be a smooth curve of solutions to the quasi-ensign equation. And we define the standard linearization here. And what we want to do is, of course, rule out infinite definitions about the curved radius to minimize the geometry. Okay, now because it's a two-dimensional case, it's a two-dimensional metric on S2, there are a few simplifications. So by uniformization, any metric on S2 is conformal to the round metric, right? Conformal to the round metric, right? So we have this condition here that greatly simplifies the perturbations of the metric that you have to consider. And so the other perturbations that you have to consider are the perturbation to the one form. So this is the perturbation to the metric and alpha and beta are the perturbations to the one form. Now getting the linearization equations, it's six to ten pages, not very instructive, so I've just put in the schematic. I'll just put in the schematics here. And actually, this is not just true for the Kerr ADS NSG, though that seems to be the only solution that we right now know for that's the only NSG, non-tribute NSG solution that we know on S2. But this is nevertheless true for any walk product metric. The perturbation equations take the following small. So it's it's a set of two Laplacians and um an equation for the control factor. The equation for the control factor. And the presence of, so for the lambda is equal to zero case, this on the right-hand side is actually equal to zero. And somehow, the only perturbations you have to consider are the perturbations of the one-form. The conformal factor just decouples. It's completely determined by this. But for the ADS case, you have to look at all the three equations. And these linearly depend on the arguments. Now, the access. Arguments. Now, the axisymmetry of the background. So, we're not only looking at axisymmetric perturbations, these are just gentle perturbations, but the axisymmetry of the background enables a fuller analysis in the phi variable. So, what we have so far is that there is an upper bound on what your mode number is. So, for values above k max, you don't have any solutions. So, there are no modes for k. For K bigger than K max. And there are also no odd modes. So we can eliminate these two kinds of modes. But we don't have anything for even modes. And more importantly, we don't have anything for the axisymmetric perturbations, you know, which you would expect could somehow come out of this in a very nice way. But then there's also a result of Furry and James, where they prove that any near-horizon geometry, which Any near-horizon geometry which solves this near-horizon geometry equation with a cosmological constant has to be occurred in yes near horizon geometry. With axis symmetry. Sorry? Yes, yes, with axis symmetry. Yes. So any axisymmetric near-horizon geometry on S2 is to take care of this. Yes, so that takes care of this. We would very much like to see this from just the perturbation formalism, but Just the qualification formalism, but it's not there. So that takes care of it. So do you have a proxy value for Kmax? 9. Oh, there is a. Yeah, so there is a value for Kmax, but then it's also under this, you know, I mentioned it here, it's also under, you know, a restriction of the parameter. So this is a one-parameter family, and then, you know, so for a certain value of parameters, you can do For a certain value of parameters, you can do all this, but the method isn't robust enough to take care of everything yet. So, yes, nine is the number now. Okay, so now what is left to be done? And some open questions. So, to aim with the finitely possible, that is even modes, which we have not eliminated, give a counterexample to this uniqueness in the picture. We're not really sure about that. That and are there quasi-exit perturbations which are not NFG perturbations? So that would also allow for variation in this value of m. But yes, now that Hurry has a solution, maybe it's possible. Yeah, I don't know. Okay, so and then, you know, the bigger question that's more relevant to mathematical relativity: how does one go from uniqueness or non-uniqueness of this third ADS near horizon geometry? Her ADS neo horizon geometry to the uniqueness or non-uniqueness of this ambient space-time. That's also very much true. So, stop here.
