He's going to talk on relative subsystems and quantum frame, sorry, quantum reference frame transformations. So go ahead, Esteban. Thank you very much. First, I would like to start by thanking the organizers of this workshop, Flaminia, Lucien, and Rob. Thank you for putting this together. And I'm happy to tell you about my work done in collaboration with Ogmian Oreshkov in Brussels. So the title is Relatives of. So, the title is Relatives of Systems and Quantum Reference Frame Transformation. So, what we did, I think, can be said it's a different take on quantum reference frame transformation that focuses more on the algebras of observables rather than how the states transform to each other. And how these algebras of observables define subsystems, and how these subsystems relative to one observer or the other are linked together by these reference frame transformations. So, this So, this work is on the conceptual side closely related to what has been put out in this paper earlier this year by Hun et al. And we will have the opportunity of hearing about this paper later in the workshop, in the talk of Thomas Galli. So, let me start with a very basic, with the basics. So, what is a quantum reference frame, or what is a reference frame to begin with? So, in this talk, So, in this talk, what I mean by a reference frame is some physical quantity or some physical system that I use to define physical quantities relative to it. For example, here, this red flag can be depicted as a reference frame for position, because we measure the position of this green wave function relative to the red flag. And a quantum reference frame is one of these physical systems that can be given a quantum description with respect to some observed. Description with respect to some observer. So let me try to spell out clearly what is the physical picture that I have in mind when I mean I jump to the quantum reference frame of Alice and Bob. And doing this, I think I will start with an example that I think depicts one of the subtleties or some of the subtleties that this notion of jumping into a quantum reference frame entails. Quantum reference frame entails. So suppose we have Alice, this is Alice, and she can have a quantum description of Bob, Bob's flag or reference frame, and a green wave function, which is the system Bob is interested in. And suppose that in this quantum state, this wave function supposes the wave function in position, space, and Alice notices that in each of the amplitudes of this wave function, for every each of that, the distance. The distance between the position of the red flag and the wave packet is always the same, call it alpha. Then she asked herself, what is the description of the quantum state, the green wave function that Bob will associate having this red flag as a reference frame? And then it's very natural to say, okay, Bob says that the state is in the state with a sharp position given by alpha. Now, Alpha. Now let's try to play the same game, but now Alice will describe the whole physical situation in a momentum basis instead of in position. So she starts by writing down a quantum state that is expanded in the eigenstates of the momentum operator. And we play the same game. We look at the wave function in this space. We measure the distances, the relative distances between the wave function of the flag in momentum space and the system in momentum space. And the system in momentum space, we ask the question: what is the state that Bob would associate to the green system if we play the same game in momentum space? And it turns out that Bob would say the state of the system is maximally mixed, is proportional to the identity, which is, of course, a completely different picture than the one I had before. So, this is just to say, I'm not saying anything new. I think most of you who have thought about quantum reference frames are aware. Thought about quantum reference frames are aware of this. This is just to spell out clearly what is the physical picture that I have in mind. In other words, put more in a caricature. One has to be very careful when interpreting the observer as surfing the wave function, right? Or in other words, when one sees a reference frame, one has to take Reference frame, one has to take care to see jumping into a reference frame to state that jumping into the reference frame is nothing but using a physical system as a reference frame for a certain quantity or for a certain symmetry. So instead of thinking of Alice surfing the wave function in which I would have to tell you, of course, this wave function is the wave function in which kind of basis I will take. I will think about this. Importantly, the measurement apparatus is outside of the box of the things that I will consider. I will consider still the source board, which is the reference frame for a given group that Alice has. She has no other reference frame other than the sourceboard, and she describes a system. And she's only allowed because this source board is the only thing that she has in order to refer to the system. All what she can measure are the invariant degrees of freedom of this composite system that is made out of the source board and the atom. In particular, she will measure the relative degrees of freedom between the atom and the reference frame. So I will now spend a little time, a little bit of time, spelling out precisely what I mean by these degrees of freedom or by these ingredients here. So, what do I mean by the source board, or what do I mean by the reference frame? What do I mean by the reference frame? So, a reference frame for a certain symmetry group G is some physical system that can maximally break the symmetry of G. This leads us to define the reference frame or to picture this reference frame in an ideal case, in a perfect case, as the regular representation of some group G, in which each of the elements of the group are labeled by. Labeled by one, each of the kets, say, each of the bases of the Hilbert space, are labeled by one element of the group. And these elements are orthogonal to each other, so that if I translate the system, I can perfectly distinguish it from the situation in which it's not translated. Then, on the other hand, how does the group act? Well, it merely acts by left multiplication inside of the ket. On the other hand, for the system, I will assume that the system For the system, I will assume that the system carries an arbitrary representation of the group G. Now, something important that will play an important role for the rest of the talk is that the regular representation of a group G is not any representation of a group G. It's a reducible representation that breaks up into a sum of different charge sectors, one of which is the left regular representation, the other of which is the right regular. The other of which is the right regular representation. So, what do I mean when I say that Alice has only access to the relative degrees of freedom? I mean she has access to the degrees of freedom which are invariant under the action of the group. And the action of the group, I can picture it in a very standard way by I multiply with a matrix that is made of the tensor product by the tensor product of the group acting on the reference frame on the left. Acting on the reference frame on the left, and the group acting on the system with a unitary representation that corresponds to the system that we're interested in. Now, this way, implicitly, I've been using, say, the view of some external, hypothetical external observer that is able to say, okay, the group acts like this. And this is just as a mental picture in order for me to define what I want to define. I'm not assuming. Want to define. I'm not assuming that this external observer should necessarily exist. And since, in the end, I will focus only on the invariant operators, whether you would like to believe that this external observer exists is there or not. It will depend on the type of situations that you want to consider. The framework will be agnostic with respect to that. So, what kind of relative invariant observables or relative observables can we measure? An example is given by the An example is given by the relative observables of S with respect to A, the system with respect to Alice, which are the quantum controlled observables of this form. So you take any operator in the Hilbert space of the atom as defined by the, say, external picture, and you quantum control translate it by unitaries on this Hilbert space controlled on where the reference frame is. So for example, if I have Is. So, for example, if I have a reference frame that is at a fixed position alpha, and I would like to see how the position operator looks relative to this reference frame, this formula would give me precisely x minus alpha. We are measuring the relative distance between the reference frame and the system. Now, importantly, these are not the only invariant degrees of freedom. There are more invariant degrees of freedom because the reference frame itself is a The reference frame itself is a composite system. The reference frame itself, if you look at the source board, it has like a center of mass that I can translate, that I can rotate, but it also has internal components that I can shift around one relative to the other. This is what is encoded in the right regular representation chunk of the group. And these are also invariant operators. So, what I mean by the invariant degrees of freedom is not only this, and this will be very important later, it's also Very important later, it's also the right regular representation of the reference frame. So now we would like to understand what it means to jump into the reference frame of Alice in this perspective, in a perspective that puts as the primary object, let's say, the algebra of relative observables between systems. So let's see how the, and we will argue that a preferred reference frame is a reference. The reference frame of Alice amounts to specifying a preferred tensor probab factorization of Hilbert space, which is natural to Alice. So in the external point of view, which is this blue Alice, she will naturally assume that the system S is describing one tensor factor of the Hilbert space, and the reference frame is describing another tensor factor of the Hilbert space, and we have these relative degrees. And we have these relative degrees of freedom, which are explicitly written like this in this tensor factorization of the Hilbert space. Now, there is one operator. So, okay, sorry, I went ahead. So, as I said, the full Hilbert space decomposes as a sum over charges for the regular representation and another for the system itself. When I say that the group acts on this Hilbert space, I mean that it acts non-trivial. I mean that it acts non-trivially here and here. And this is the perspective of, say, this external guy. This is a perspective which is natural to her. Now, the relative degrees of freedom of the reference frame and the system, these type of observables are non-trivial in each of these chunks of the Hilbert space. I would like now to jump into the reference frame of Alice so that whatever is in the part of the system is now occupied by these degrees of freedom because these degrees of freedom. These degrees of freedom, because these degrees of freedom are the only means that Alice has to refer to the system. For her, the system is nothing but the relative degrees of freedom between whatever she has to measure the system and the system as defined by the external guy. So this is the operator that does that, which is similar to an operator introduced here. If you quantum control, but then reverse the action of the group, The action of the group, you will end up with a tensor product factorization that looks like this. Now, the action of the group will be encoded only in the left part of the regular representation. So, what I'm saying is, if you take mathematically, if you take the regular representation of a group and whatever other representation of the unitary representation of the same group, and you consider global group actions, there is a transformation that. A transformation that reduces these global group actions to acting only in the left regular representation, and this is true for any group or let's say reasonable group. Okay, and so now for her, these are precisely the degrees of freedom that Alice doesn't have access to, because she cannot say that the system as a whole is globally translated or rotating, right? So, the full game is going to be played here. So, for her, this So, for her, this is in some sense gauge. Now, the relative degrees of freedom of the system with respect to her reference frame under this map are mapped to this tensor factor. So I will write down when doing calculations, you will still write like A tensor, B tensor, C, but the meaning of A is different, the meaning of B is different, the meaning of C is different. Physically, now the meaning of C or the 10 third tensor factor in Hilbert space is just what Alice. It's just what Alice naturally would associate as the system, namely the system relative to her reference wave. And this leads me to the part that completes the puzzle, right? This is clearly another chunk that is also part of the invariant degrees of freedom. And this has to do with the fact that I can take my reference ring and move the reshuffle the internal degrees of freedom that compose my composite, complicated reference. My composite complicated reference frame around. And this, this, we call it the extra particle, let's say, for the case of, because it has a form of a particle formally, mathematically, for the case of the Galilei group, but in general, is S relative to A complement is whatever is needed to map one representation of the full invariant subalgebra into another representation of the full invariant subalgebra that is natural for Alice. For Alice. So, we would like to propose that this extra system is something that one should always carry around when one considers the description of physics with respect to a quantum reference frame. The reason why we normally don't carry around is because the reference frames are usually considered to be very sharp in one of these G states. And when this happens, all of what happens in this fact in this sector of the Hilbert space turns out to be trivial. In particular, the state. out to be trivial in particular the state turns out to be proportional to the identity in this part but in general this won't be the case and this will play an important role it's essential to to say unitarily relate different quantum reference frames so let me stop for a bit and let me be a bit more concrete because what is this regular representation what does it mean physically how do we realize it let's say in an experiment or uh i i won't i won't go as I won't go as far as that, but let's say just a bit of a more concrete taste of what I mean. Let's consider the centrally extended Galilei group, which is given in one dimension, which is given by translations and boosts. As we know, because the position and momentum operators don't commute, this doesn't end up being a true representation of the group, because there's a phase that appears, so it's a projective representation. Representation: The mathematical result that I showed how to reshuffle the tensor factors applies for true representations. So we consider the centrally extended Galilei group, which is in any case the important group for quantum mechanics when one treats Galilei symmetry. Instead of the normal, one considers the centrally extended Galilei group. This furnishes a true representation whose irreps are labeled by the mass, and then this theta can be. The mass, and then this theta can be considered as some translation along the mass. Okay, so what is this object? What is the like, say, the Hilbert space here? It would be the set of wave functions along these parameters. So, in particular, one can picture the, say, mass operator. It would be derivative with respect to this theta parameter. The momentum operator will have a slightly different form compared to the usual form it has. Usual form, it has derivative with respect to the position. It here is also something like derivative with respect to the position, but it also has some other part of the derivative with respect to theta. So this is just to explain what kind of object this regular representation is. But what is most important is when we realize this regular representation, what do we mean for the case of Galilei? And what we mean is if one looks at only one of the masses, one of these sectors, it turns One of these sectors. It turns out that what is left here that has contributions from the left and the right action of Galilei, this can be seen or this can be mapped to a system of two particles, each of which has half of the mass of the sector that labels the sector. Now it turns out when one computes everything, when one sees what are the relative observables of the system, when one uses this kind of object as a reference frame, it turns out that this in these two particle systems for the Galileo. Particle systems for the Galilei group, the relative position of the system with respect to the reference frame is nothing but measuring the relative distance between the system and one of the particles. And the relative momentum is nothing but measuring the momentum between the system and the other particle, not the first one, but the other particle. So it's like a two-particle for a given sector, a two-particle system in which we use one particle for position and one particle for momentum. This is something that arises kind of rather. This is something that arises kind of rather. It's not that we choose a reference frame to be that, it's just that it turns out to be that when you look at what the regular representation does. Okay, so now let me go back to the obvious question, which would be to ask, what about Bob? What if Bob also wants to find a tensor product factorization that is natural to him? That whenever he says, okay, this is the system, he would say, I will associate a chunk of the Hilbert space a tensor. A chunk of the Hilbert space, a tensor factor of the Hilbert space that is denoted by the relative degrees of freedom between the system and my reference frame. Another regular representation, a green one, which is not the same as the orange one, which is the one that Alice uses. Now, how do we relate to such tensor product decompositions? This is the question. And something very useful in order to relate those is to use this, what I call perspective-neutral logic. Perspective neutral logic, which was, let's say, introduced here in this perspective-neutral paper back in 2018, which is simply to say, okay, I know how to take the standard product decomposition in which the group acts in each of the tensor factors. I know how to relate this to Alice's reference frame by this U dagger of G hat. And I also know by construction how to relate. Also, I know by construction how to relate it to Bob. So I just merely have to compose these two actions and I will map in the full invariant algebra of observables, I will map the tensor product decomposition that is natural to Alice into the tensor product decomposition that is natural to Bob. Esteban, this is the 20-minute notification. Oh, thank you. So, this is what this transformation does. We have like explicit formulas of how exactly each piece is mapped when you change the tensor product, the composition, where according to the tensor product of the composition of Alice, this and this observable of Bob is non-trivial and so on. I won't show you the formulas because I think there's no point, but I will show you a picture. So, we see that this full invariance of algebra can be depicted by some sort of network. By some sort of network of sub-algebras. And this network of sub-algebras, where the say vertical threads correspond to Alice's tensor product factorization, and the horizontal threads correspond to Bob's tensor product factorization. So this thread will see what is the system relative to Alice. This is the reference frame of Bob relative to Alice. And this is this extra system that needs to be there in order to complete to the fully. To complete to the full invariant subsystem. And here, whenever two sub-algebras intersect, whenever we have an intersection like here, it means non-commutativity. It means that with respect to Bob, when he says, I'm measuring the system, and then looks, Alice looks and see in her tensor product decomposition, what is Bob actually doing? What is the subsystem that he is actually addressing? Then, according to Alice, he is addressing what she calls the system. Addressing what she calls the system, but also obviously what she calls the reference frame of Bob relative to her own reference frame. Okay, so this is pretty much all I wanted to say. I want to finish to how does this connect with the kind of initial approach to quantum reference frames? In this case, I told you that we have like a Hilbert space that decomposes into the sum of several charges. Charges. If it turns out that if we restrict ourselves, if we have only the zero charge sector, we reproduce the usual quantum reference frame transformations of this paper and of this paper, which is to say, instead of requiring that the operators commute with the group, I will require that the operators are annihilated by this. Okay, so with this, I Okay, so with this, I thank you for your attention. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. So we have a question from Trastav. Go ahead. Hi afternoon. Thanks for a nice talk. I just want to ask you about at some moment you had this kind of double reference frame, so to say. Double reference frame, so to say, one which you use for the relative position, the other which you use for a relative momentum. Now, so that this, so if I think about Fourier transform, which would be just a change of the basis, not of the reference frame, I could use the Fourier transform on the relative position. Relative position, this Fourier transform of relative position would not be the same as if I would perform the reference frame for the momentum. So if I want to at the end define what is the state with respect to the observer given some reference frame, what procedure I should take, and maybe related to this, I can imagine. Related to this, I can imagine like any quadrature of the X and P, which will be yet another distinguishable state from these two. Why should I stop on that? And so I'm trying to understand: can I have a notion of a state with respect to some reference frame? Reference frame. Yes, yes. So the procedure that you would do here is you would write down the in say one procedure in the external perspective, you would average over the group, and then you would apply this u-dagger of g hat on the state. And whatever is left is the degree, is the state of the system relative to the reference frame. Reference frame. And so it's, and what I mean by the reference frame is not relative to a particle. This is very important. And I think this is the point. It's not relative to a particle. It's relative to a composite reference frame that turns out to carry the regular representation of the group. So what I mean by what is the so there is a procedure to define the state with respect to a reference frame is just that it's different as jumping from to the particle. It's really defining. Particle is really defining it with respect to this complex system that is able to address different operators of the system. And you get only one state, like if I take these two possible transformations, it seems like is this one state or is these two states with respect to each of those reference friends transformations? Which two possible? No, I told you just one. You do that and you get just one state, I think. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Or I don't know if I understand the question. I mean, we can discuss this on the I will like to let other people discuss. Okay, so Flaminia. Thank you for the nice talk. So I think I will follow up with last question. So I'm also a bit confused by these two particles here. Here and this. So, can I understand this as taking basically two particles as a reference frame in the way we defined it in the original paper, but using one to define relative positions and the other one to define relative momenta? Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Okay. So, yeah. Yeah, I think. Do you not end up with two states then? One which is relative to position, once to the relative momentum. It's not one state. No, you end up with just. No, you end up with just one state relative to this composite system. But you have one state with two different relational degrees of freedom. Like one in one partition of the Hilbert space, you would have the position relative degree of freedom, and in the other one, you would have the relative momentum degree of freedom, right? Yes, yes. So operationally, what you would do is the following. If this orange Alice says, I am measuring the Yes, I am measuring the position of the particle. What Blue Alice would say is she is measuring this quantity with respect to A, sorry, A, where A is one of these particles. And then if she says, I am actually measuring the momentum degrees of freedom, what blue Alice would see is that she's measuring the relative momentum with respect to the other one. But this is normal. But this is normal. Like we can do this in the laboratory, and we have simply one state. It's just that we are using different kinds of pieces of material to measure different properties of the state. I think this is completely natural. It doesn't need to be all defined with respect to a single. Thomas, you have a question? Yeah, I think. Yeah, I think. Sorry, once they're going, I'm going to continue with Chaslab and Flaminia's line of questioning. So, just to make sure I understand, yeah, so you have, for instance, the position basis, you define it with respect to particle, which is well localized in position, your reference system. But then you also need to talk about the relative phases between the position eigenstates. So that's the momentum. And then you're saying, okay, I'll just choose a different particle to define the phases, essentially. That kind of the general procedure. So you pick a base. Kind of the general procedure. So you pick a basis and you use one particle to be referenced for that basis and then different particles for the momentum. And anyway, saying operationally, you might have different apparatus to measure position of momentum anyway. So you're using, yeah, classically, you're using different classical devices to define position of momentum anyway. If I understood correctly what you said, I think, yeah. So can I just add that? Because now we are at the verge of understanding. It's really last point. Okay, okay. If you make a relative position, you take. Relative position, you take the first reference frame and you ignore the second one. And I say, okay, this is the state relative position. Then on that, I make a Fourier transform. I change the basis. The state that you end up will be different than the one which we will get with the second reference frame. I think this is what we are kind of. Ah. This is not the same. Because imagine the EPI. No, it's not the same. It's not the same. No. No. And so. Same, no, no, and so when you refer to operational and laboratory, usually you take R, you take a new measurement apparatus, you measure in position. This means like a Fourier transform rather, in ordinary situation, not like defining a new reference frame in the second line. So, if I understand this correctly, I think the new apparatus, like using the new apparatus. Apparatus like using the new apparatus will be really choosing the other one. Like, uh, not, I don't know if doing the Fourier transform for me is more like a change of basis, but this is still, okay, so this would be still the particle that you use to measure the position. You're just representing it in the basis of momentum eigenstates, which you're allowed if you would like to, of course. But it's still kind of the sector of the reference frame that is. The sector of the reference frame that is used to address the position, not the momentum. Okay, so I think we should stop here. We can continue this discussion in the discussion session.
