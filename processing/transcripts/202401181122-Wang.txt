Equations are Zd. So, for example, we have the non-linear Schrodinger equation and the non-linear wave equation. The difference is that R on the left-hand side is second order in time. Okay, so where the previous equation, epsilon, delta are parameters in 0, 1. Parameter is in 0, 1, say. And Laplacian is the usual lattice Laplacian. It's nearest neighbor, and V is a potential. For example, V equals to Vj. It's a family of Vj is a family of IID random variables indexed by Zd with bounded nice distributions, all V is a quadi-periodic potential. So, in particular, in the quadi-periodic case, it's deterministic. Deterministic. The nonlinear random case has a longer history. The quasi-periodic case is a more recent development. As we will see, however, the phenomenon in the random cases does extend to the quasi-periodic one. At least in the problems that I look at. Next one. So let's start with the random case with the linear random short. Case with the linear random Schrodinger equation. So, this you have seen it several times already. We start from the linear operator h equals the minus epsilon Laplacian plus V with V random and the linear random Schrodinger equation. So, there are two cases. One, it's arbitrary D, and if epna is very small, so it's large disorder. Small, so it's a large disorder. H has Anderson localization, so that's Furlich Spencer and also van Dreivers-Klein and Isa Vochanov. And namely, the spectrum of H is pure point with exponentially localized eigenfunctions. So there are two consequences. Each eigenfunction phij is localized about some point Lj and has rapid exponential decay away from it. I know there are many. From it. I know there are many, many great refinements now, but let me, for the sake of this talk, let me just stay at this level. The dynamical consequence is that if you take u0 and initial condition, localize about the origin, and let mu j be the eigenvalue for phi j. eigenvalue for phi j, phi j is the eigenfunction, then the solutions to the random Schrodinger equation is localized about the origin for all time. So again, there are many refinements, but I'll just stay at this qualitative level. Third point is that the solutions are almost periodic in time, right? So if you just take one such term that is periodic, Term that is periodic, and you take many of them, it becomes almost periodic because the frequencies might not be commensurate. We should note, however, that the spectrum of age is dense, so that's one of the main difficulties. As you all know, lots of experts in the audience. The other case is one dimension. In that case, we may take f0 equal to one. You do not need. 1. You do not need large disorder. There is Anderson localization and 1, 2, 3 hold. The Lyapunov exponent is strictly positive. So this follows from the work of Firstenberg, Gaucha Mochana, Pastu, Kon Suya. There are some more recent work by these authors, Damanik, Danjitomiskayatu, Goetzau, and Gorodesky Klepsik. Gorodetsky Klepsi. So now we turn to the nonlinear random Schrodinger equation. So, what we did is we added this nonlinear term. But we still work on Zd, where V is random. It is natural to ask what happens to the dynamics in the presence of the nonlinear term, right? If we add this, what happens? This, what happened? Among the non-linear questions, there are the following two. One, are there still solutions which are localizing space and almost periodic or quasi-periodic in time? This is a phenomenon that we observe in the linear case. And the second question is: what about solutions to Cauchy problems? For example, for general initial data. Example for general initial data in L2, in the nonlinear case, recall that for the linear problem, this is the space that we're working, right? You have spectral theory. So it's natural, these two questions. As we'll see, these two questions entail different techniques in the nonlinear context. So you need different methods, okay, because essentially you no longer have spectral theory. You no longer have spectral theory. And let's recall that yesterday, remember, we heard Tom's talk about Cauchy problems for general potentials and data. So question number one, we look for quasi-periodic in time and localizing space, right? Remember that we start from Anderson localization and we want to see how much the linear phenomena we can consider. Linear phenomena, we can continue to the non-linear setting. So we look for quasi-periodic in time and localizing space solutions to the non-linear random Schrodinger equation. So again, there are two cases, arbitrary D, large disorder, and small nonlinearity, right? And the second case is dimensional one, epsilon one, arbitrary disorder. Disorder and small nonlinearity. So the nonlinear term is always small because we want to see how much we can continue the linear phenomenon. So delta is always small. And the difference is arbitrary dimension, you need epsilon small and dimension one, epsilon is one. The existence of localizing space and quasi-periodic in time. And quasi-periodic in time solutions follow from the work of Boga and myself in 2008. So, in arbitrary dimension, we proved that they're localizing space and quasi-periodic in time solutions. And there's also a recent improvement by Gunson and myself. It works in the so here a bit more technical point is. A bit more technical point is we work in the canonical basis of L2ZD, right? You recall the Laplacian, there's a small factor in front. So to zeroth order, it's a diagonal operator. So you can use the canonical basis. And we used the Lyapunov-Schmidt method and Green's function approach. The epsilon and delta terms are perturbations, which are dealt with using the Cartan theorem as. With using the Cartan theorem, a semi-algebraic set. So, this is the technique using this approach. We show that there is an abundance of space-localized time-quasi-periodic solutions. So, this is the case in arbitrary dimension D and the large disorder. So, that result dates back in 2008. And the second case is dimension one and And arbitrary disorder. Now, this is a recent work with OneTalue. The main difficulty and the difference with the arbitrary dimension case is that one may no longer use the canonical basis of L to Z, right? The Laplacian no longer small. Instead, one needs to use the eigenfunction basis. So, what it entails is that the linear analysis is more. Is that the linear analysis is more involved and leans on the state-of-the-art properties of linear Anderson localization? So we need to use almost all the very fine properties of localization, semi-quantitative or quantitative. Again, we show that there is an abundance of space-localized time-quasi-periodic solutions. So, in one dimension, in the linear case, we do not need large displays. Case, we do not need large disorder. In the nonlinear case, we do not need large disorder either. But you know, we use we lean on the properties of a linear Anderson localization. Here, I want to make a remark. The method in Liu and W is robust, and in particular, it's applicable to nonlinear random wave equations. Also, this is a work in progress. Essentially, that Essentially, that's because actually we rely on eigenfunctions, not that much on eigenvalues. So now question number two is what about general L2 solutions to nonlinear random Schrodinger equations? This one. In one dimension, in the work of myself and San in 2009, Sign in 2009, we showed that when epsilon delta is small, so here we really need epsilon delta small, an appropriately defined tail remains small for polynomially long time for any L2 datum. So if you take any L2 datum, it remains localized in the sense that the tail remains small for polynomial long time. Polynomial long time polynomial in epsilon and delta to the inverse power. So there is long time Anderson localization for the nl nonlinear random Schrodinger in L2. This is the space that we use for the linear random Schrodinger equation. So the counterpart in the nonlinear case is that we have localization for long time for arbitrary L2 data. For arbitrary L2 data, so we're working in the L2 space. The proof, as I mentioned earlier, it's a different technique. It uses Birkhoff normal form transform. It's a coordinate transformation. That method was initiated in the work with Boga in 2007, Bolga and myself, for related equal. Myself for a related equation. This result has been improved to longer than polynomial time in the recent work by Chong Shi Zhang. So that's in 2021. So there is indeed very long time and localization for the non-linear random Schrodinger equation. And now we want to turn. And now we want to turn to the nonlinear quasi-periodic Schrodinger equation. So we have this equation I d u d u d t where v is an arbitrary trigonometric polynomial in d variables. So in other words, we work in d-dimensional phase space. So instead of random, we take a trigonometric trigonometric polynomial in d variables in the quasi-periodic case. When delta equals to zero in the linear case, so when you do not have this term, when delta equals to zero, Baugham proved that for any fixed theta one, theta two, fixed theta, the linear operator has Anderson localization. Operator has Anderson localization for small epsilon in arbitrary dimension on the large set in the frequencies alpha1, alpha2, alpha d. In other words, Bougain proved that it's the analog of Anderson localization in the random case. You have that. And so there's previously in 2002, there's a work of Bogan, Gothi, and Schlag. Goldstein and Schlag. It applies to dimension two. And more recently, there's also work by Jito Miskaya, Liu, and the Suing Feng in arbitrary dimensions. Here, I want to mention that the results in the linear case hold more generally for analytic V. Okay, but for the nonlinear problem, I should restrict V to trigonometric polynomial. V to trigonometric polynomials, arbitrary trigonometric polynomials. Okay, so for this, we may therefore also pose the same two questions, right? It's the natural two questions in the nonlinear setting. Do you have existence of space localized time quasi-periodic solutions as in the random case? The random case was from 2008. From 2008. And the second question is: Do you have long-time Anderson localization for general L2 data? Right? Because in the linear case, we're working L2. Same two questions. Now we pose it to the quasi-periodic case. Now, it is well established that for both questions in the nonlinear setting, the ofantine properties of eigenvalues of the linear problem play an essential role. Maybe you know this, and if you're not aware of this, maybe you would accept. You need your fountain properties of eigenvalues of the linear problem. For the random problem, For the random problem at high disorder, so you have the epsilon in front of the discrete Laplacian, this can be readily established using the independence of the random variables, right? You just, in a way, drop epsilon, you just have IID random variables, which are just potentials vj at different sites. Okay, so you can make a deofanting, right? You basically can make a deal fountain very easily. They are IID random variables. Their IID random variables. In D equals in one dimension, and when epsilon equals one, it is already a lot more work. Recall that we have to use the verifying results from non-linear analysis, from eigenfunction, fine properties of eigenfunctions to do this. But we did manage in this work with Liu using fine properties of Anderson localization. Of Anderson localization. Now, when V is quasi-periodic, we still need to do the same thing. But the nature of the problem is entirely different. There are many fewer parameters than there are eigenvalues. You only have D parameters and you have infinite number of eigenvalues. Note that in the D one dimension case, One dimension case for arbitrary disorder in the random case, there are still the same number of parameters as eigenvalues. It's just the combination of random variables are probably very complicated. But in the quasi-periodic case, you have many, many fewer variables. So you basically want linear independence in some sense of the quadruperadic potential at different sites. Potential at different sites. So we use a generalized round-scanned approach. This work was initiating the work with Su Yingfen for the cosine potential. As it turns out, this approach is general and applicable to any multivariable trigonometric polynomials. So, that's more recent work with. So, we have indeed have the offoning properties for arbitrary trigonometric polynomials in the variables. As the first application with Shong and Shi in 2023, we proved that. We prove that there is Anderson localization on the large set in alpha and theta. We call that alpha and theta are the parameters for the quasi-periodic potential. Okay, so in the large set of alpha and theta, we do also have long-time Anderson localization in arbitrary dimensions, also for polynomially long time. And this, so it's like in the case for nonlinear random Schrodinger equation. So we have established that the same result, essentially a similar result, hold in the quadi-periodic case. So, also here, so the Diofantine result in the work with Su should also lead to the existence of space-localized quasi-periodic solutions to the nonlinear quasi-periodic problem in arbitrary dimensions. So, this is a work in progress. And this should give an answer to question one, which is and prove the analog of the Burga water. Of the Bourga-Wall result in the quasi-periodic case. So now I want to turn briefly to the wave equation. I would like to mention that the work with Shi, we constructed space-localized time-quasi-periodic solutions to the nonlinear quasi-periodic wave equation. So we can do the same thing for the wave equation on Zd. On Z D. So, in that work, the potential is a V is a cosine potential in one variable. So, we can do that for the wave equation when the phase space is one dimensional. But the same result would extend to all trigonometric potentials using the Diofantine result, the more recent Diofantin result. For the nonlinear quasi-periodic Schrodinger in dimension one, such results were previously known from the work of Geng Yuzhou in 2014 and also Yuan in 2014. The nonlinear quasi-periodic wave equation seemed, however, to have remained open until the most recent work. So for So, these two works, they use Km method. And for Km method, the wave equation seems to be quite different from the Schrodinger equation. But using the Green's function and also, you know, Cartoon theorem, semi-algebraic set method that I mentioned earlier, the wave equation is not that different from the That different from the Schrodinger equation. So, anyway, so we can also do it for the wave equation. Essentially, what we can do for the Schrodinger equation would translate also to the wave equation. So, maybe I'm going a bit fast. So, the conclusion is to conclude the talk, let me summarize the general problematic. The general problematics that we have been discussing so far is that number one, we work on the lattice Z D. The linear problem has Anderson localization. And the third property, the nonlinear term, has decays in space. And we investigate the persistence of linear phenomena such as time-quasi-periodic solutions. These are global. These are global in-time solutions and long-time Anderson localization in the appropriate L2 sense. The conclusion is that the nonlinear random and nonlinear quasi-periodic systems share similar dynamics, right? These are the two aspects: the quasi-periodic solutions, and what about general initial data in L2 sense. And right now, it seems that what Right now, it seems that what we have for the random case also extends to the quasi-periodic case. So finally, I would like to mention that in the recent joint work with Liu and Kashkovsky in 2024, we have provided a general scheme to solve the nonlinear difference equations using the Lyapunov-Schmidt method, replenishing all. method, replenishing almost all the technical details. Here I want to remark along the way that paper also constructed space-time quasi-periodic solutions on Z. R such solutions were previously constructed by myself in 2022. The problem here is fairly different from the main body of the talk that I talk. Of the talk that I talk just now. So, okay, thank you very much. I'm going a bit fast. So, any questions? In this last remark that you make, I mean, most of your talk, you needed a random or quasi-periodic potential in your interaction, right? You needed that. Interaction, right? You needed that, yeah, yeah. And this last one, you don't need that. Is that correct? This last one, we do not have a potential. That's yeah, right. So there's no potential, but you get the existence of some kind of quasi-periodic solutions. I get the existence of quasi-periodic in time and quasi-periodic in space solutions. So the yeah, it's both quasi-periodic in time and quasi-periodic in space. And for the main part of the talk, it's quasi-periodic in time, but localizing space. And the main difference is that, as I mentioned earlier, in this In this case, the nonlinear term decays in space because you start with the solutions that are localized in space. And for this space-time quasi-periodic solutions, the nonlinear term is not decaying in space. So it's a more difficult problem, actually. Thank you. Questions? No other questions, but thank you, Speaker.
