Thank you, Keith. Thank you, all the organizers, for this invitation to talk about this very, very recent work that I was working on with Gerhard Knipo just about three months ago. We were doing his job and I was visiting him in Bachum. So this is basically a continuation of what we have been doing recently about measure of maximum entropy with less assumptions, less hyperbolicity on. Less hyperbolicity on like no coverage assumptions. So, we recently have this results with Knipo and Krimanaga about the uniqueness of the measure of maximum entropy for surfaces without conjugate points. And this can be seen as a generalization of that type of results where here we will allow conjugate points, but we will just restrict to the minimal geodesics. These are the geodesics that don't. Geodesics. These are the geodesics that don't have conjugate points. So I will just go to the definition. So everything that I will be saying will be just for surfaces. Okay. A closed surface of genus at least two. So I want some positive entropy. Okay. So I'm assuming that I have the genus of the surface to be at least two. And then And then we denote by m tilde is a universal cover cover. And we, as usual, we have the projection from m total to M okay. And we define the set of minimal geodesics as M tilde. M tilde to be the set of I forgot, so there is one more definition I should put before that. So I denote by Sm or S M tilde is a unit tangent bundle, okay. Okay, now we have M total. We have M toller, which is a set of minimal geodesics in the universal cover. So these are the set of point V in S M total, such that the geodesic C V, so this notation C V is just a geodesic starting at V, okay? The velocity is V. So I only talk about unit speed geodesics, okay? It's globally minimizing. It's globally minimizing. Okay, and then you have the corresponding set on the unit tangent bundle of the surface, which is just you take the projection of M tilde. Okay. So, yeah. So, yeah, so the way to think of minimal geodesics is just. So, let me just maybe draw a picture here. So, if you have on the universal cover, if you have this type of picture, this is, so this is not minimal. This is not minimal. Okay. So, these two points you have these conjugate points. So, this is a picture in the universal caba. So, this So, this set M doesn't contain these types of geodesics. It is closed and invariant. So basically, I will just start to tell you what is known. So, on this setting, there is actually very, very few results. And the only results I know is this one, Dystore by Knipper. Creeper Uguyanjo He was a student of Kniper. He's from Benin, I think. And Shorel, he was also a student of Kniper. This was 2013, okay? So this was 2013. So what they proved is that So, what they prove is that the entropy, the topological entropy of the geodesic flow restricted to the minimal geodesics, is the full entropy, like is the same as the topological entropy at top of. So, okay, 50 here is a geodesic flow, okay? 50 restricted to M is just the topological entropy. Okay. Yes, yes, yes, yes. So yeah, so this is basically the only result I know on this setting. I mean, in high genius and for services. For surfaces, what they have is more general, like the term they have it for any dimension, and they have the manifold has to be hyperbolic type, a bunch of conditions that is true in dimension two. So I'm just stating the surface version of this. So with Gehnippo, what we were doing is to try to investigate now the major maximum entropy of the geodesic flow restricted to the minimal geodesics. So, and we have this turmeric. So, this is what I will present today. So, the geodesic flow restricted to M has a unique measure of maximal entropy as a unique MME. MME okay and that can be constructed that can be given by partition similar measures Can I try a question here for someone who doesn't know anything? Sorry. Can I try a question for someone who doesn't know anything? Is this MME the same as the MME before you restrict to the minimal measures, minimal geodesics? So I don't hear very well. So my question was here. Okay, thanks. Here, your minimum, your measure of max benefit is restricted to the minimal GOD6. Do you get the same MME if you look at all Geodesics? Ah, that we don't know. We don't know. We don't know. We don't know. We don't know. Yes. Thank you. Okay. So yeah, so I will be presenting a proof of this, a proof of this diorem today. And so what I will do, I will just do the Patterson-Servant construction of the measure and after prove uniqueness. So I want to first. So, I want to first to sketch the proof of the construction of the Palison-Solomon measures when you don't have conjugate points. And I will show you the points which needs to be improved when you allow conjugate points. Okay, so I will just recall. Recall. Sorry, I did not mention, but there are many results of this type. Are many results of this type, you know, with other assumptions like no focal points? There are results by Catherine and Rafael Gero. There are also other type of results. So I did not mention that, but this is a type of generalizing all those results, also the non-conjugate points results. So recall construction. Of VS, but it's an Suleiman, okay? So, um, uh, so yeah, so I will just I will just recall the main properties of the Person-Sullivan measure that that are key in proving that is entropy. So it starts with defining the pointer series. The pointer series. You have two. Okay, it should be. So I take points P, Q on the universal cover and then S in R. So you define the point carrier series. You just look at the orbit. So gamma is a group of isometrics here. So I'm just recalling this is the standard construction P. Construction P gamma Q. Okay, now what happened is that this is converging when S is bigger than the topological entropy. There's something I forgot to mention. In this setting on minimal geodesic, also, we have also the entropy is also realized by the volume entropy. The entropy is realized by the volume growth. Okay, as the same as the Manier, Frere Mannier. Same as the Mannier Freire Magnier's result, okay. And then and then you defined uh so fix if you fix X in M tilde P in S, let's say S bigger than the entropy and P. Yes. I have a question about the needle. So can you hear me? Can you hear me? Yes, I think green light now. I have a question about the result of Nipper in students. So they show that the topological entropy on the minimal geodesics is all the topological entropy, but the complement set has a strictly lower topological entropy, or it could be equal as well. It could be equal. We don't know. Okay, thank you. We don't know that. We don't know that. So P in M toller, you have the user construction. I'm just doing this construction in order to show the points that you have problems and how to solve this problem in the setting of general setting. So you define this frame. So you define this family of measure, which is okay, you normalize. Sorry for, you know, because most people in the audience are know this probably much better than I do, but I'm just recalling here of P gamma X delta of gamma X. And then, okay, when you have, when you consider a sequence that is decreasing, SK that is decreasing to the topological. K that is decreasing to the topological entropy, you will have a weak limit, nu p, which is defined as a limit when k goes to infinity of new p x s k. Okay. And then this measure has these three properties. A is that new p in I'm tell that is gamma equivariant. Is gamma equivariant gamma equivariant and B is that this is a very important property the fact that I mean the fact that it tells you that the densities are Bozmann function do nu Q of xi equals exponential so I did not h b p q B P Q Xi. So I will tell what these quantities are for almost every xi on the boundary. I will say what these quantities are. C is that this measure is fully supported for all P in M Tor. So both three properties are used for different things. Like you can expect the first property A to First property A to construct a measure that is invariant. The second property is used to estimate the measure of bone balls, which will give you that this is a measure of maximum entropy. And the last property tells you that the measure is fully supported. Okay, now, okay. So M tilde, this is the ideal boundary. M tilde is the ideal boundary, and B P Q Xi is the Bozmann function attached at the geodesic joining P to Xi. There's a joining p to xi. So b p q xi is Boozman function attached and the geodesic joining P P to psi. So I should tell you, like, let's try. If you try to prove, let's say, just the property B, which is more problematic when you have conjugate points. So how do you prove B? To prove B, you do the following. So sketch of B. You do the following. What you look at, you rewrite this definition. write this definition which is one over p s x x the sum along gamma of exponential of minus is of distance between p gamma x delta along the orbit of x okay so the idea of proving v is to use here a type of triangle in a use here a type of triang inequality to introduce the point q you do the following so this is like one over p s x x the sum gammas of exponential of minus s d p gamma x minus d q i i'm introducing here the point q okay and then Okay, and then I subtract what I added here minus s distance between should have given myself more space here. Let's do this. Distance between Q and gamma X. Okay. And then this is a direct altar at gamma X. So from this two line, what I So, from this two line, what I did, I just add and subtract the distance between Q, gamma, Q, and this sum. So, what is the important property that you have from no conjugate points is that so for no conjugate points, you use the fact that at the this guy here, the accumulation point of this action is the ideal boundary, you have this property. You have this property, like the distance between pz minus the distance between qz, this guy is converging to the Bozeman function at p q xi. This as z is converging to xi. Okay, so this is what you have. You have here, you have Um, here you have P, you have Q here, and then you have this point Z, which is like gamma X that is going to accumulate on the boundary. It is converging to a point xi on the ideal boundary, and you have always the difference of these distances. Okay, this is going to converge to the Bozeman function if you know you don't have conjugate points, but look at the so. but look at the so this is what gives this is basically what gives this is basically what gives to this is what gives b sorry this is basically what gives b because this will be the bozman function and what is left will be the the uh the partisan silicon at q okay so this property is what gives b and b is crucial in proving that this measure is a measure of maximal entropy okay now uh Now, so if you have conjugate points, what can go wrong? So, this is a picture you might have. You might have a point. So, you might, if you have P here and Q here, you might have this point that is converging somewhere. And then, if you look at this guy here, like the geodesic, so this is Z. So, this is Z. The geodesic joining P to Z might not be unique. That's the problem. Like, you might have another geodesic joining P to Z like this. Let me blow it with another color here. So, you might have another guy joining equally on this guy, also. So, you might be in trouble. So, this is a problem. So this is a problem we have. So the way we solve this problem is we add more converging sequence to the boundary. Like we define what is called this Fuzzmann boundary. So I will go to that. So or Horrow boundary. So yeah, so this is the problem you have to when you have conjugate points. So I will Have conjugate points. So, I will define here what is our Busman boundary, which is a generalization. I mean, if you have no conjugate point, this will coincide with the grom of boundary. Okay, so this is how we do it. Let me see, where are my notes? Yes. So. Yes. So, first of all, we define what is the holo function definition of holo function. So, if we say a n like a sequence of point q n. Sequence of point Qn is a sequence of point in M tilde converges to infinity or we will define a point in the boundary if for P in M tilde fixed we have that the distance okay let me go to the nether line so the distance Okay, let me go to the nether line. So the distance between p and q n is converging to infinity as n goes to infinity and the limit, the following limit, which is called h q which is the limit when n goes. When n goes to infinity of the distance between p and q n minus the distance between q p, sorry, q, yes. So this limit exists. Okay, so let me put this in full screen to see this definition. This is in full screen to see this definition. So basically, we say that this sequence is converging to infinity. In some sense, it's going to define the point in the boundary. If, you know, if you fix a p, it's going to infinity. And also this function exists, this limit exists. So in that case, this function h is called a horror function. Okay. H is Hadim. We have a question. Yes. Hadim, what is Q in this definition? So Q, because the function will be defined on M tilde. So P, this is a function that is defined on M tilde. So is Q an arbitrary point in M tilde? Yes. Yes. Thanks. Thanks. Yeah, so so this oops, sorry. So this is a generalization of a Buzzman function. It's called or of function. Yes, I'm good at this time. And what what is this time and what what is what is happening here is uh so uh okay um i should okay so really we we don't call this a horror function v but we call it an equivalence class so we define we say that two functions h1 that are given by a sequence h1 is equivalent to h2 if and only if h1 minus h2 is a constant Minus h2 is a constant. Okay, these are two functions, is a constant and empty of them. Okay, now we define the equivalence class is called, sorry, I should have said here the equivalence class is also called the horror function. Now observe that a remarkable is a very simple. Now, observe that a remark is at nose implies that every horror function is a Buzzman function, the usual Buzzman function that we know. Every horror function. So this is adding more convergent sequences to your boundary, like you're allowing more flexibility on the definition of the boundary here. So now let's come back to this. If we come back to this point here, this problem. Back to this point here, this problem that I was telling you here, you will have this difference will converge to the horror function at q, okay, respect to the to the sequence. So here, but you might have, you might have, you might have, okay, sorry, I should stay more time before I go to there and go back to that proof. To that, go back to that proof. See that for every another remark here, I have this other remark, which is also important, is that this function Q gives the distance between P, Qn, given a sequence, any sequence, distance between Q and Qn. In QN, this is one lipschitz. This is one lipschitz. So in particular, for every sequence, you can have a conversion sub-sequence using as probably as a type of result. So for any sequence that is going to infinity, you can have a converging subsequence. So if we come back to this, To this, if we come back to this, where is that? To this part here that I was telling you, because yes, I'm interested to prove the density. Like the Patterson-Sullivan measures are absolutely continuous with respect to each other, and their density here are given by Horo function instead of Boostman functions. And it's not exactly Horo function, but it is bounded above and below by Horo functions. Okay. So a proposition or a lemma that you have is that, so the part B is can be rewritten as that the D node P over D node Q this guy is This guy is less or equal to the exponential of minus h. Sorry, I use a very bad notation. I did not pay attention. Sorry, I use a very bad notation here because H is a topological entropy. is a topological entropy and and i have i have in my notes i was also using h at the as a horror horror function so let's call it let's call it l okay so uh sorry sorry for for this flat notation l is just too light a horror function okay attach at at Touch at at so okay, this is at xi. So this guy will be P Q Xi for some horror function L okay, because a horror function will come as a sequence, okay? So this sequence is a sequence. Okay, so this sequence is a sequence that is going to xi. Okay, but but you might have many horror functions for a sequence. Okay, but what is good is that these horror functions, their difference is always uniformly bounded. Okay, for given sequence, you might have many horror functions, but what is good is that their horror function is uniformly bounded. So you can think of what we have in this lemma to be just the super. To be just the supremum or the infinimum of this horror function. Like they are all comparable with a constant. There's a constant bound the difference between the horror functions. Now, if we have this, so yeah, so do you see that here? Okay, if I come back, this lemma, the proof is just the same here, the same idea here, where this. Where this difference of the distance is bounded by a horror function that is along the orbit of x. Okay, the horror function that is associated to the sequence given by the orbit of x, gamma x. So, in other words, here l the whole function l L is associated to the sequence gamma X okay to the orbit of X now So there is this point that is different from no conjugate points to this when you allow conjugate points. So you might have many horror functions associated to a sequence in no conjugate points. Every sequence will have a unique Bozman function. So the density is given by one Bozmann function. But this is not too bad because it is good enough to tell you that the entropy of Tell you that the entropy of this measure will be full because what you have here is a constant that doesn't depend. The difference of two horror functions for a given sequence is uniformly bounded. Okay, that's why it is. So let me now what I want to do. So this is what you get. This is a property that is different from no conjugate points. You have that the density is The density is just bounded by poro functions with the entropy, like this, above and below. Okay. Above and below. And yeah, so let me try to sketch before I go to uniqueness to sketch the proof of, to just tell you how why this is good enough for this measure realizing the entropy. So if you remember, so. Remember, so um so why is this for MME okay so this is the idea is the following the idea is the following so if you remember I don't know maybe you you haven't seen it but let me just tell you the main point of of proving that the major UK Of proving that the measure you get is a measure of maximal entropy. The key point is to evaluate this following. So if you have here a ball on the universal cover, let's say you have here a point in the boundary. Let's say this is a boundary you have here xi, and here you have the other side. You project this set. Sorry, I so when you do this projection, also you use you use um just the point that are joined by minimal geodesics, okay? So this is a ball and this set here, the set that you get here is called P R xi of. So let's say this is X of radius rho of B X rho. Now, the key idea of proving the measure of maximum entropy, this major realized entropy is to have this type of estimate that nu P of this projection V X rho this guy is comparable. I can have it somewhere. Okay, yes. So this is roughly exponential of minus h b p xi x so in no conjugate point, this is the key property that point this is the key property that that that you need to to estimate the the the the measure of bone balls okay this is the key estimate you need to measure the the the the to estimate the measure of bone balls okay but here you will also have it thanks to to this to this lemma here this property here you will have similar estimate where Will have a similar estimate where instead of a Bozman function, you have a Horror function there. Okay, so when restricted to the set of okay, okay, I'm just checking the time to. Okay, okay, I'm just checking the time to the set of minimal geodesics. We use the same, we just have the same estimate where the Buzzman function is displaced by Horror function. So as I said, Horror function for one sequence, there are many, but these many, they are just, their difference is just bounded. It's just uniformly bounded. That is, yeah, maybe I should talk about. yeah maybe i should i should talk why is that true or maybe if i have questions but that is using a morse lemma that is using a morse lemma because we we have more morse correspondence here between the minimal geodesics and geodesics of metric of negative curvature that we have okay the the same idea that also was used in previous papers we have the same estimates Estimates for horror functions. So here, instead of having a Guzman function, what we have a horror function, and that is enough to prove. I will not do the complete proof because this is a one-hour talk. I'm just telling you the points that need some. That needs some modification, and this is one of them. So, to prove that the density is given by Horof functions, so you just use the function that the density of the Patterson signal measures is given by Horror functions, which is here, which is this level. Whereas here, you have an equality here, exact equality, but here, as I said, because of many sequence can be. Can be given by many horror functions. One sequence can give rise to many horror functions in these definitions. So for the rest of the talk, I want to, so I do not discuss, so this is a measure on the boundary. We use the same method to project this measure onto the This measure onto the unit tangent bundle, and it will realize entropy. As we this part is the same as in non-conjugate points, I just needed to show you that we need to generalize the Bozeman function to Horror functions here. And about the uniqueness. So when we were doing this, it was in March. I was in Bachum and we were thinking we could use something different. Thinking we could use something different than Clemen Hager-Thompson for uniqueness. Because here, so at this stage, one could just, because we have specification in the minimal geodesics, we have entropy gap was also proved by Gniper and Uguianjo and Schroeder. So we are ready at this stage to use Klimanaga-Thompson to get uniqueness. Okay. Okay, after we have this measure, we can, because the minimal geodesics is just given by minimal geodesics and metric of negative curvature. So one could use one can use CT Limanaga-Thompson to get uniqueness. To get uniqueness. But since we have this construction of the measure via partisan solvent measures, we were able to prove actually Ergo DCT directly using a reason by this. So let me just play now, everybody city here. So here we use a result by So here we use a result by a recent results or ideas by Remy Coulomb and Google. These people from Jura again Barbara Shapira. And Risha Sharp. Okay, I'm not very consistent. Sometimes I'm writing full names, sometimes I'm just writing. And Samuel W. Sorry, I should be more consistent. So what is the idea here? What is the idea of proving everybody's city? Okay, the usual idea is just to do a half argument. Is just to do a half argument. And to try to do a half argument here, you have a problem because you don't have contraction on this stable. The points will have the same feature. You don't have contraction on horosphere. Even though here we don't have horospheres. That's a problem I forgot to say. Because we don't have Boozman function here, we really don't have horospheres. Okay. But what we were able to do is to able to do is to so this is the idea so if you take an invariant function f be an invariant function phi t invariant phi t invariant so um there's a way to go back and forth from the function on the unit tangent bundle to a function on the boundary and vice versa so Boundary and vice versa. So there's a nice correspondence between. So if you have L1 on the boundary of M total, so with a measure mu times a measure to L one S M told a M tilde with the measure also that is so this I should call it nu here and here I could call it mu yes so which is if you give me if you give me a function f new two functions okay new is not good here sorry So, this is k is a function on R. You can define a function that is f nu, f, sorry, fk of xi eta, which is given by f psi eta times new k t. Okay. So, and then So, and then, you know, from also from this type of function, you can generate a function that is that is even like if you have f hat. So this is fk. And in their paper, they have this fk hat. I'm just going to write something that is the main proposition. They call it a contraction lemma, which gives, which makes the half-argument working in this setting. The comment in the chat from Richard Sharp is that he was not an author of this paper. Okay, so okay. Okay, okay, sorry. Okay, okay, yeah, okay, yes, so yeah, he's in there. Yes, so it's yeah, okay. So this is F. Let me just maybe say what is the idea here, what is going on here. You have a function, you have an invariant function on the unit tangent boundary. So since this function is invangient, you can push it to the boundary. It defines a function on the boundary. A function on the boundary. And if this function defines a function on the boundary, there's also a nice way they do it to bring, you know, to take it back to a function on the unitarian bundle. What is the trick here? The trick is that if you have a function for which you don't have a nice exponential contraction on points that are on the same feature, what you do is that you project it on the boundary. It on the boundary, and if this function satisfies certain property, if this function satisfies what they call exponential decay on the boundary, you can take it back to the unit tangent bundle to a function which has contraction so that you can apply the usual half-argument. Okay, so let me just say where is that reaction? Yes, so here, so they have this proposition in the paper. Okay, I proposition. I don't know which version I'm using, but in the version I'm using, it's proposition 4.8. In the paper, that is called a contraction level. Contraction level. They have that if you have a function f that satisfied, that is defined from the boundary. The boundary to R and this function satisfies what is called exponential decay as exponential decay in a sense that you have f xi here. This guy would be less or equal to exponential of Exponential of minus H minus a constant. So here they just use a constant A. So this A in this in this setting would be our entropy of L P Xi eta. Here Xi and eta L P is also a horror function in our setting. I'm writing this in our setting. In our setting. So, this is called this function has exponential decay. So, if you have a function that has exponential decay, then there is a plot and I have it here. Then if V W have the same feature, like they are asymptotic. Feature like their asymptotic have the same feature. Okay, then this function, if you go from r plus to plus, which is defined by you take t it goes to the integral from zero to t of zero to t of f hat compose f hat is the function that is okay let me just write everything and then phi t v minus f hat compose phi t w this guy dt is bounded is bounded. Is bounded. So, yeah. So, f hat is, you know, when you have a function that is defined on the boundary, f hat is the projection to the unit tangent bundle. I mean, this canonical projection to the unit to the unit tangent bundle. So this. So this actually is type of exactly what makes the Hoff argument work. This is what you want. You want the contraction for point that have the same feature. So what they do here is that if they have a function on the boundary that has the exponential decay, they can project it back to the unit tangent bundle. Unit ended bundle to a function which makes, you know, which satisfy this contraction. And so one point I need to talk about is when you have when you have a function that is on the unit tangent bundle that is invariant, it projects to the universal cover, it projects to the boundary. Project to the boundary, okay? So the proof of Ergodicity would be the following. So proof of Ergodic City would be like this. Okay, this is just sketch. So the proof of our good theory will be the following. You take F, that is in L one. One, the measure that we constructed, the measure of maximum entropy on Sm, okay, the unit tangent bundle, M tilde, let's say, and then that is invariant, phi T invariant. That is phi T invariant. So what you do, this function project to the boundary because it is invariant along the geodesic. So it projects to the boundary. F projects. Projects to the boundary of m total. So as a function, let's say F infinity. Okay? You have this function that is defined from to R. Now, just need to check that this function satisfies the exponential decay here to be able to. To be able to prove that this because you want to prove that this function is constant. So f so here. So here to prove that f infinity has exponential decay, we use the Morse lemma. Okay, so we use Morse lemma, Moss correspondent to prove that f infinity has F infinity has exponential decay and then we apply we have that this function we construct from f infinity we go to f hat which is this f hat is given here this way here And then you can prove that this f hat is constant with respect to the measure. And if it is constant, and they have the same, it has the same projection as F to the boundary. So F hat, F hat and F have the same projection to the boundary. This This is something that really rely on the fact that this measure is given by a pattern-silven measure that has the product structure in the boundary. Otherwise, you would not be getting anything here. So, if I have the same projection, so if f hat infinity is constant almost everywhere by this contraction lemma, okay, the usual half-argument. lemma okay the usual half argument f at infinity is constant almost everywhere on this so this tells you that f infinity is constant almost everywhere on the ideal boundary and in particular you have you will have ergodicity uh you will have ergodicity for uh for uh for the geodesic flow restricted to the minimal geodesic so and after the the proof of uniqueness After the proof of uniqueness, it follows the usual argument. So this is the main difficult part to prove uniqueness of the measure of maximum entropy, like to prove algorithmicity. So we did not want to go when we were doing it, we didn't want to use the type of condition that we use in Klimanaga-Thompson, even though this is just for surface, but we didn't want to use this relation to the finite. Usually, finite condition, like to go to a finite cover to satisfy the entropy gap, and so on. We didn't want to go into that condition. That's why we wanted to do a direct proof that uses just the construction of the measure via Patson-Sullivan measures. So, I think I'm just trimming it. So, this is what I wanted to say, and I'm open for questions.
