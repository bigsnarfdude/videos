I'm going to talk about some joint work with Matt and Chris and Alex who already gave talks on other things and left me to talk about this. So let's see. And it's really related a lot to what Chris was just telling us about before. And it kind of stems from this analogy between mapping class groups and climate groups. And Kleinine groups. So a Kleinian group is a discrete subgroup of isometries of hyperbolic space, hyperbolic space, or whatever. And I guess the analogy here is you think the mapping class group acts on type molar space. You pretend that's like hyperbolic space and it's acting. Okay, so motivated by this analogy, Fargo Mosher back in 20 years ago. 20 years ago, came up with this definition of convex co-compact. So they said G in the mapping class group on the surface is convex co-compact. So Chris just told us what that was, but I'll just remind you. So here for finding groups, you say a group is convex, co-compact. If it acts co-compact beyond some convex things. On some convex signals. Okay, so you just try to take that definition and port it over through your analogy. So they said if acts cocombact me on a quasi-index set K inside of type Muller space T of S. Okay, and here, since you don't really understand the fine geometry of type Muller space, you don't know Geometry type molar space, you don't know what convex sets look like, so you can just say quite convex instead. And it's equivalent to just say that the orbit is a quasi-contract set. So that was their definition. And that's very nice. And it turns out it has... You say the orbit is quasi-complex, you mean with the scripted angular metric? Yes. So it turns out there's other formulations of this. So that's was their definition. Here's another definition. Here's another definition, which is that the orbit map from your group into the curve complex of the surface is a QIN edited. Okay, and that was not, that was a clear improvement to be equivalent to this. So that turned out to be equivalents. And that was done by And that was done by Chris and Otto, as Chris just mentioned in his talk, and also by Hamstead. Okay. Okay, so that's one other way to look at convex co-compactness in terms of the action on the curve complex. And there's a third way, also, as Chris was just mentioning to us, that the associate extension Which I'll call gamma sub G, is Roma hyperbolic. Okay, and this was done by, as Chris said, by Fard and Moser did one direction and Hammenstadt did the other direction. Okay, and then there was also another proof by Mahan and Sardar. Oh, and I should maybe clarify here that this is in the case. This is in the case when S is closed, that you get a normal hyperbolic extension here. And if S has punctures, then it's relatively hyperbolic when S has punctures. And that comes outside of Mahan and Sarah. They talk about that case. Okay, so I want to kind of present this. Oh, maybe let me just remind you what this is. Let me just remind you what this is. It was just in the clock. This is class. So you have the verb and exact sequence, which you have your mapping class group. You fix a point P. This maps onto, by forgetting the puncture, onto the mapping class group of the closed surface. You have a kernel, which is the fundamental group of the surface based at P. Oh, I didn't have enough input arrow. Okay. So, and this extends. So, and this extension is just inside of here. You have your group, and you just take the pre-image. So, that's the extension. Okay, so every subgroup of the mapping class group naturally gives rise to a group extension like this, group gamma sub G that fits into a short exact sequence. And the theorem is that that's going to be a Roma hyperbolic group exactly when G is constant. So, this is kind of three different. So, this is kind of three different perspectives on the idea of convertible compactness, I want to say, in terms of the geometry of type Ruler space, in terms of the geometry of the curve complex, and in terms of like the geometry of the extension groups. And this is now a very nice story. It's a well-studied concept. There's kind of lots of things known about these convex co-compactors. I don't want to write them all down, but things about when these extensions are. When these extensions are quasi-isometrically rigid, things about their limit points in type molar space, things about stability or quasi-convexity inside of the mapping class group itself, and lots of things. It's all very nice. And there's also many constructions and ways that we know how to build groups like this that are Congress broken back. But so far, Like this, they're combined to them back. But so far, all of the known examples, as he's telling us, examples are virtually free. Okay, so it would be nice if these groups that we just talked about happen to be convex. In fact, we'll be the first examples of non-vergently free groups. Okay, so what I'm going to talk about today is this idea. What I want to talk about today is this idea of geometric finiteness. So, in the theory of Kleinian groups, we have this notion of convex cocombact acts co-compactly on a convex set. That's really a special case of a more general thing, what's called geometrically finite, which roughly, you should think, is that it acts co-compactly on some convex set after you remove an invariant family of four of all. Okay, so I have a block space, I cut out some families of four volts that are invariant under certain parabolic subgroups, and then I want the co-group to be complicated. I want the coconut to be common. And the Nucleinian group setting, that's kind of a much broader class, and it's also nice and has some nice properties. And so there's a question of whether that idea carries over this analogy and there's some corresponding theorem here. So the question, this was raised by Moscher in his problems paper from 2006, which is basically, I'll phrase it like this. What could What could a geometric finance look like in math class groups? So that's maybe just an open-ended question. And so I don't know, I guess. So I'm going to kind of propose some possibilities and tell you a little bit of what we know so far. And let me approach it again by these kinds of different perspectives on convex co-compactness and how they should maybe generalize to a broader class. So, for example, you could think about from the perspective of maybe from our three options. So, one, from Teichmer space, maybe you would ask instead of Instead of it acting co-compactly on a quasi-convex set, maybe I would like for it to act co-compactly on a quasi-convex set k minus an invariant family of thin regions. Finally, J, which I'll call maybe H sub alpha sitting inside of Teichmüller space. Okay, so in Teichmüller space, if you pick some curves or multi-curve, I could look inside of there as the region where those curves are short, short of an epsilon or something, and I think of that as like an analog of a orball. So maybe I would like to have in my group some kind of set of parabolic subgroups and associate to those some multi-curves, and for each of those, I'll have. Those are multi-curves, and for each of those, I'll have a thin region like this that will be invariant of the actually my group. And I want to have some quasi-convexes that I want to remove those things down, which are the same. So, the mapping class group itself would be such an example. The mapping class group, I guess, itself could be such an example. So, that's one possible way that this could look. Maybe I'll go from the perspective of the curve complex, what might it look like? What might it look like? So here's the definition. So let's call, and I guess this Brian Udall. So let's call G reducibly geometrically finite, which I'll abbreviate RGF if Uh if uh G is hyperbolic relative to a family H of reducible subgroups. So these will be subgroups inside the G, and a reducible subgroup is a And a reducible subgroup is a subgroup that the whole group fixes a multi-curve. So there's one multi-curve that the whole group fixes that multi-curve subgroup. And I'm all micro hyperbolic relative to these things. And when I talk about relative hyperbolicity, what I do is I take the cambig graph for G, and I cone off these cosets, and I get something that's supposed to be hyperbolic. And I want that to QI embedded in these cosets. Such that the coned off Cayley graph QIM DES and so that's one possible suggestion of a definition. And maybe this would be, as a special case, I could put other conditions on the subgroups rather than just requiring them to be reducible. So maybe you could say it's parable, I think. Geometrically finite, which I'd call a PGF, if the HI are virtually multi-toests. Okay, so each HI consists exclusively of multi-tooists. So, and that's because you think, when you think about the action on type motor space, the things that act parabolically. On tightening space, the things that act parabolically are the alternative screens. So that's like a stronger condition on parabolic symmetric. Okay, so that's another option from the perspective of curve complexes. And then we put, well, a third here. Our third perspective here was from the social, from this geometry of the group extension. And since we're all here studying hyperbolic spaces, maybe the right generalization of hyperbolic here should be hierarchically. Here should be hierarchically hyperbolic. Okay, so that's a suggestion. So, this is from extensions. Maybe I would require that the extension group is an HG. So that's a suggestion or the landscape of what geometric might look like in mapping class cube, maybe three possible conditions. And at the moment, I don't know any implications. And at the moment, I don't know any implications between these. Okay, so over here, these are all equivalent. Over here, I don't know. So that would be an interesting thing to think about. Are there some implications? But I will tell you kind of what we know is starting to get a landscape of some examples satisfying some of these different properties and kind of giving us an idea of what the theory might look like. So that's what I want to talk about going forward. Any questions so far? Are there examples of the second case that aren't? Are there examples of the second case that aren't just a group? They were recently genocide finding it's not fair model. Sure. Yeah. And I think Brian's going to tell us. Okay, like a surface stabilizer. Yeah, somehow reducible. Yeah, Brian has a construction, kind of a general construction, a way to build book that's pretty cool. So anything he's going to tell us about. Okay. So yeah. Okay, so yeah, so as I said, we don't have any implications. So let me just put a big question mark here because I don't know. So instead, I'll talk about some examples. Okay, so first one I'll mention is Junior Russell that extensions Extensions of multi-curve stabilizers are hierarchically hydrobolic groups. Okay, so if I pick some multi-curve on the surface, call it alpha, and I look at all of the elements in the mathematicians that fix that multi-curve, that's the stabilizer subgroup, and then I perform this extension, then Jacob proves that's a higher concern. Okay, so that's maybe a nice example. Okay, so that's maybe a nice example. A lot of classic things that you count as geometrically finite. Another example, due to Loa, is that if I have multi-curves A and B, and if these are far apart in the curve complex, okay, so they each are some diameter one sumset of the curve. Each are some diameter one subset of the curve complex. And what it proves is if they're sufficiently far apart for some constant, then the free product of the multi-twist groups is PGF. Okay, so here I mean I have a multi-curve, and I'll look at the subgroup consisting of. And I'll look at the subgroup consisting of all the Dane twister and all those curves, for example. Okay, so that's a subgroup. I also have HP, that's a subgroup. When the curves are far apart, the free product will be parabolic to you. PGF remains which one of the PGF? PGF is this like a restricted case of this definition, where I restrict the subgroups from being anything reducible to just consisting of all direct lists. Here, the, you know. The parabolic subgroups in the PGF are exactly these two. And they're conjugates. Yeah, so that's another example. And then Udall, Brian Udall has, as I mentioned, this combination theorem that RGF RGF, I'll summarize it like this. RGF is preserved under a certain amalgamated product. Okay, so if you have some RGF groups and you form some amalgamated product of them in a particular way, then with some assumptions, then the result again will be RGF. So it's a way to build many examples. So, it's a way to build many examples of these things, and he'll tell us more if he still has about that is it. So, let me just summarize it like that. And then let me just mention one more. So, Chris mentioned these constructions of running of our concept groups in mathematics groups. That's something I've been talking about with Tariq Agab, Harry Gray. Harry Gray, Anna Hoganson, Sarah Maloney, and Brandis Whitfield, which is basically looking at the question about which writing Lartensum groups are RGF. RGF. Okay, so basically, these constructions of various running and learning subgroups, and we were thinking about the question of under those constructions, when will the output be path satisfied with? Okay, and lots of times it works, and there's some conditions and so on, but that's still kind of in progress, but it's getting close to me. The point is they're like never convex coping packages. These are never convex coping packages, Chris. Well, yeah, they're never convex coping packages. So, okay, so this is maybe. So, this is maybe meant to highlight this thing that I was written here that was erased, which is that all the examples of convex go back things are virtually free. And maybe by broadening our perspective to some class of geometric finance, we get a lot more examples of the finance things. So, a lot more behavior come up with the same options. So, you didn't give any of the examples of the first segment. Oh, that's right. Yeah, so I don't know. I just kind of threw this out. I don't think anyone's thought about this that much. I don't think anyone's thought about this that much, actually. I just wanted to parallel my other perspective. So I think it could be an interesting thing to think about. I thought maybe that was Lee's idea or something like that. I don't think Lee... Lee proposed a definition which was not this one. And it was not quite this one either. It was, yeah. Why did you say these are the direct sound foots or never gotten compacted? Compact and why can't you have like a three zoo guys? Oh, sorry, they could be convex. Yeah, sorry, they could just be yeah, they would be, yeah. Other was there a question? Yeah. And just on the third one, do you know if gamma GPAT is the segments GPR or people's turns? I don't know. Yeah. And maybe let me, I guess I should also add here. I should also add here. So, yeah, you might want to have more conditions. As Jul mentioned, the whole mapping class group would satisfy this. Maybe that's fine. The whole mapping class group also satisfies this, because its extension is the mapping class group of the function surface, which is an HHG. So maybe you're happy with that, or maybe you want to impose some extra conditions. And for example, here, if you're specifying certain subgroups, maybe these subgroups you specify should be related to the UT. Specify should be related to the UTT structure you build on by what's in the middle of your question. No, it's not there's not a lot of stuff you get into generating the top system. Those are fine, but for like a pain twist or multi-twists, that do it actually exists and not hyperplosic connects. Okay, so that's some. Oh, sorry, yeah. I was just gonna ask about one. Oh, sorry, yeah. I was just going to ask about one. Yeah. What's to stop you from just taking every gen? Just all of them. Right. So yeah. Is there some extra restriction you want to put in? I think you probably want to put some extra restrictions. Yeah. Has somebody proposed extra restrictions? I don't think so. I don't think anyone has proposed this. I just threw it out here. But I think it's worth, you know, trying to formulate something sensible there. I don't know. I don't claim that that's the best formulation. All right, so what I want to do now is, so here are some examples. Now I want to go and focus on one particular class of examples called MeToops. And these are, in some sense, the prototypical examples. That to me are very motivating for how the theory should go. And for these things, for each of these, I just mentioned one of the perspectives or something. And these we'll see is going to satisfy all the predictions, all of the predictions. So they're some sort of nice examples. So what is a V troop? So you start with a quadratic differential. Q on the surface. And you don't really need to know what a quadratic divergent is, so I'm not going to tell you what it is, okay? But basically, you should just think that this is the same thing as a half translation structure on your surface S. Okay, so a translation structure is at my surface. I cover it by charts, and on each It by charts, and on each chart I have a map to the plane, the complex plane, and I want the transition maps between different charts to be translations. So that's a translation surface. A half translation surface is where I allow transitions to be translations with a flip. So I'm allowed to multiply by minus one. So that's a half translation surface. And somehow that data is encoded by something called a quadratic differential. So you fit your quadratic differential. And this gives you, in particular, this hash translation surface gives you. Translation surface gives you a singular flat metric on your surface, which in fact defines a point in type Muller space. So there's this map from quad space of quadratic differentials down to type Miller space that looks at the underlying singular flat structure. And I guess it's a half translation structure on S minus a finite set of singularities, so has bulging. Has bulging. Okay, so your quadratic differential, you have this flat metric here. And now what you can do is you can deform by the action of PS of SL2R, so deformations by SL2R. So how does this work? So I think of my path translation structure. That's like I have my surface and I have all of these maps to, let me draw a little picture here. Here. So I have on my surface some region, and then I'm mapping it to a region inside of the plane here, and I have my flat structure with my two formations, et cetera. And I point that back here, so this is what it looks like. And what I could do is I have all these maps, and here I can just act by SL2R. So I just change my sets here, I just apply a matrix here, and I just adjust them all by that. Matrix here, and I just adjust them all by that, and then I get a new flat transition to flat structure. So I can deform this flat structure by SL2R, and that gives me new singular flat metrics, and this produces for me what's called a type matrix. Which I'll call D. It's defined in terms of the quadratic differential, and it's sitting inside of the tiger space. Are we acting on all the charts at the same time? Yes. Charts at the same time? Yes, all charts at the same time. Yes, so you pick one matrix and you use that to apply to all charts at once, numbers. Okay. The name disk, is it like a disk really in tech merge space? Yes, so that's hence the name, yeah. So it is. In fact, a totally geodesic copy of the hyperbolic plane embedded in Titan Speak. So this is D is totally geodesic. Totally geodesic, it's convex and it's isometrically embedded copy of hyperdolic framework. So it's really a disk. And it's a convex set, and these are kind of like the only convex sets that are known. So type 1 space. So type 1 space, actually, convex space. Okay, so great. So that's, I have a quadratic differential that produces this type Muller disk. Now, a Viet group is, let me define it as follows. Finitely generated subgroup. A subgroup G of stabilizer of disk inside of the mapping close group. Okay, so I have this disk, technical disk inside of Teichmuller space, the mapping clutch group acts on technuller space, and I have the stabilizer, and I'm just going to pick inside of there any phylogenetic circumlines that I want. Okay? So that's the definition of each group. And this is a And this is a stupid question, but is it clear that the stabilizer is non-trivial? No. Yeah, so this could be. Yeah, so it depends on the quadratic differential you choose. Sometimes the stabilizer is big, sometimes it might be very small. Good question. Okay, so yeah, why is this nice for our thing? Well, here, the group, it acts on all of Tangular space, but since it preserves the disk, it acts on the disk. Okay, so here I have T acting. Here I have G acting on the disk, which remember, we think of as a copy of the hyperbolic plane. So, really, this is a group acting on hyperbolic space. So, it's a Kleinium, that perspective. So this, I think this is H2, is a Kleinium, or a Fuchsian group in this case, because it's dimension 2. And the quotient, disk mod T, is a hyperbolic surface. Is a hyperbolic surface. Okay? And since I required my group to be finally generated, this is a finite type hyperblock surface. And in fact, this is a geometrically finite function. Okay? This is a hyperlock surface. And G is geometrically finite as a kind of Okay, so from our perspective of the first thing, perspective when we're typing the space, that tells me that this should count as geometrically finite from the perspective of S. So G is geometrically finite from the perspective of type Moore space by the Temple. Because I have this quasi-convex set of actually convex set of D. And if I remove, since it's And if I remove, since it's just fine here, if I remove this collection of oral balls, then of course, let me draw a picture of what this looks like. So here I have tightened more space. Inside of it, I have my disk. And here I have the potion, which is some surface. It might have some kind of topology here, might have some cusps. Here, might have some cusps. So, I think I have some cusps here, and I might have some kind of flaring end, so that's what the topology would look like. And basically, if I take these subsets and I remove them, I'm going to get some horoballs up here for cusps, removing the cusp between the hora balls, and removing these things will give me kind of half spaces like this. So, I have this picture of the hyperblock plane happening here. Mapping here, and I'm removing this collection of geodesics and core balls, so on. And I look at this region, and the quotient is my space. If I remove all those things, it's compact, so that's a geometric final. So that's like maybe the first reason why you should think that these qualify as geometric final. So that's the first perspective. The second perspective we talked about was from the perspective of the curve complex. So, are they geometrically finite from that perspective? And again, the answer is yes. So that's a theorem of Robert 10, Robert 19, that G is parabolically geometrically finite with respect to the parabolic subject. To the parabolic subgroups HI inside of G, corresponding to the cusps of this hyperbolic surface, T by G. Okay, so that was what Robot came from. Okay, so they checked that box from the perspective of the curve complex. And, okay. And okay, so now I want to add a definition. So, this was a beach group, it's just any finitely generated subgroup. I'm going to call it a lattice if this hyperblock surface has finite volume, finite area. So definition, G is a lattice feature. If surface DMI. D mod g has finite already. Okay. So in that case, the stabilizer has to be big for that to work. Yeah. So you intangularly bad to GOLS? No. It doesn't find any fine objects. But I could take a type of Java script. Then the then there's no then there's no subdued. Oh, oh, I see. Oh, oh, I see. So it's not, I'm not looking at the whole stabilizer. I'm just picking some, and you find the generated subgroup. Yeah, it's kind of a, usually beach group means the whole stabilizer. But this way it was efficient for setting up all my statements. Okay, so that's the case of a lattice. And yeah, the main theorem I wanted to talk about today. So end with Matt Durham, Chris, and Alex from last year is when G is a lattice. Of each group, the extension gamma of G that you get is maybe two things. One, first of all, it's an HHG. So it's a hierarchy hyperbolic group, okay, which says that from the third perspective about the geometry of extensions, this also satisfies that kind of goal. So these are kind of nice particular examples, they satisfy all the things you want. Particular examples, they satisfy all the things you want. And then a second thing is that it's also quasi-symmetrically rigid. Okay, which let me say briefly what I mean by that. Okay, so by that I mean gamma as finite index and it's Qi of gamma. So I have my group, I think of it as a metric space, I look at the group of all quasi-isometries of it, that's a group, and gamma maps into that because it acts by itself by left implications, and in fact, the image is finitely. Left implications. And in fact, the image is finally exist for the theorem. And also, another consequence is that if gamma prime is some other group quasi symmetric to gamma, then in fact, gamma prime and gamma are actually isomorphic. Okay, which means that up to taking a quotient by a finite normal subgroup and passing it to a finite index subgroup, they actually are isomorphic. So that's going to bring So that's a very strong form of algebraic EG. And that was something I mentioned earlier. One of the things known for the convex co-compact case, Barbara and Mosher proved in, yes, in the case where the convex-compact group is free, that the extension is quasi-specific. And let me also mention here that Elliot Bonjivani. Bonji Bunny. And it's nice to put dates. So this was on Friday. Remove the lattice assumption. Okay, so he has a theorem, the same conclusion, where you cross off lattices. And he's going to tell us about that later on his activity. So that'll be good. So that would be good. And I'm very interested to see how it goes because we use the lattice conditioning very heavily, so I don't know what you would do like that. Okay, and let me mention, so that's the main thing. Let me mention something else in progress. So this is again with that in place of Alex. That the lining you read Combination groups. Combinations have HHG extensions. Okay, so yeah, I don't want to get too much into the details of what these are, but basically, as an example of this, I could take. As an example of this, I could take g star h phi n g phi minus n, where h inside of t is a parabolic. Okay, so one of these ones corresponding to a cusp of the surface. Okay, so I take one of those and I take V as a mapping class group that's partial syndrome. That's partial syndrome and commutes with H. So I have this pair block subgroup. It's up to fine index generated by a multi-twist. So I take a partial certain oscillator that computes with that multi-twist. And if I take my group and I conjugate it by a high power of that thing, and I form the amalgamated free product over that parabolic subgroup, then that's an example of one of these conjugations. So basically, yeah. Basically, yeah, what we're working on is to prove that these kinds of things also give rise to hyperbolic extension groups. And that's kind of nice because this includes closed surface examples. And these are also examples of geometrically finite in a second sense in terms of? I think so. That's like part of. I think so. Is that that's like part of your oh okay. Oh yeah. Um yeah. So uh yeah so that's um something. Okay, so yeah, so that would be an example of surface subgroups. They wouldn't be purely pseudonasa, but they would be and they wouldn't be complex or quebec, but they would be close in this kind of sense. That we've been talking about. Is the top level of the robotic space and dangerous? Yeah, uh I don't know. You think so? I guess, yeah, okay, that sounds believable. I'm not, I don't, I haven't really thought about it, but it could be okay, so yeah, any other questions? So, I want to spend the rest of the time telling you more about the structure of these beach groups and trying to explain some of the ideas that go into the and interest of time, let me just focus on the first part. On the first part here, the HHG conclusion. Let me say the quasi-isometric rigidity uses the HHG structure in a very strong way. In fact, we use these quasi-flats theorem of Burst, Doc, Hagen, and Sisto. Basically, the HHG structure that we have is very explicit. You can understand what the top-dimensional flats are. If you apply any quasi-isometry, their theorem tells you that it has to go near, you know, kind of basically those have to be commuted by those things. And then using that structure, All those things, and then using that structure, you can kind of pin down more and more things until you know that your quasi isometry basically comes from that owner strategy. So I'll try to tell you the idea of one. And let's see. So remember we have our flat structure on our surface s. On our surface S. Okay, and on this flat structure, each direction, alpha on S gives rise to a foliation called F sub alpha by straight lines in direction alpha. Okay, so I'm just on my surface, I have this, like I'm in a local chart. My surface: I have this, like I'm in a local chart, identify with the plane. I just go in direction alpha with some slope, and I just keep going straight, and I can just go that forever, and it gives me a foliation where all the leaves are in direction alpha. Okay, and I think of this as a foliation. Well, foliations, if you know about Tichomolar space, that's like the boundary of Tichemuller space, the projective measure of foliation. So I think of this as being something in the boundary of Tichomolar space, and in fact, in the boundary of the Tichmuller disk living inside of PMF. So I have my type motor disk embedded and the exfoliation is some point n. Now we have this important ingredient called the beach dichotomy proven by beach that since she is a lattice each this foliation alpha is either it's called unucleary ergonomic It's called unucleary ergonomic, which basically means that if I take any half leaf and I just go on forever, it'll dedense in the surface. So that's true for every leaf. Or, so it's either that, what's called completely periodic. Okay, so every leaf, except for front of the mini, closes up into a circle. Okay, and this gives rise to a cylinder decomposition. To a cylinder decomposition on my surface. Let me try drawing a picture of that. Yeah, so I might have, for example, some singular leaves that would look like this. So these are singularities in my collesion, and everywhere else. And everywhere else is just volated by cylinders in these cylinders. This one goes like this. So, cylinder here, etc. That, and the same thing over here. So, just these are cylinders, my forward. So, that's an example of a completely periodic direction. Okay, and the feature dichotomy says that for every single direction, one of these two things happens. Yeah, and so I'll be good. So, I call these. Call these parabolic directions. And let me denote them P of differential sitting inside the value. So those are the directions where I have this position. Okay, so you should think of these as being like the rational points in the boundary diagram type, or something like that. So now I want to tell you some structure that you get for every parabolic direction. For every parabolic direction. Each parabolic direction gives some data. So I have the lifted foliation. Okay, so I have my surface I lift to the universal cover and I just lift the foliation to that. And I just lift the foliation to that. And here, this foliation, I mean, if you just imagine this picture, these cylinders will lift to strips, and these kind of other singular things will lift to something what we call spines. So it's a foliation this by strips. So those are the lifts of the cylinders and spies. And what I can then do is take this. What I can then do is take this copy of the universal cover with this foliation. I could collapse all the leaves down. And when I do that, I get a tree. And that's the Bass Serre tree, dual to this decomposition of these cylinders. So I get a Bass Serre tree T alpha. So this is equal to the lapse, the leaves of this variation. Region. Okay, and this is dual, so the vast symmetry dual to the core curves of the cylinder decomposition. So I have my cylinder decomposition. Inside of it, I have these core curves of the cylinders. This one here, this one here, and this one here. If I look at the Bastaire tree dual to that set of curves, that's what this tree is. What is this tree? Great, so I have that data. And here, so the vertices of this tree correspond to the spines, and the edges correspond to the scripts. Okay, so the vertices V correspond to spines, and I call the spines like this. So for every vertex, there's a spine theta superscript V, and the edges Correspond to the strips. And those don't get any space. Who cares about that? So these completely periodic directions correspond to certain points. Correspond to certain points in the boundary. These points are fixed by associated parabolic subgroups of the beach group. So, if I think about it here, one example of an element of the beach group is the dame twist, the multi-twist around the cords of the cylinders, that acts by a shear and spins, and that's affine, and so it preserves the flat structure as an affine map, and it gives you something in the statements. Okay, so every completely periodic direction, in fact, has this significant subgroup generated by. Sigmund subgroup generated by a multi-twist, and that subgroup of each group and it fixes this one. So for each alpha, I also have this stabilizer, G alpha inside of G, which is the stabilizer of this point at infinity, and the boundary. So if I think about the group G acting on the type 1 disk, the stabilizer at this point on the boundary is G alpha, and this is virtually generated. Virtually generated by a multitrist of tau alpha about the core, the core of the centers. And then I also have, let me call, B alpha inside the disk, a for a ball invariant. Uh, invariant by this stabilizer. So for each one of these pair of all subgroups, I'll pick a whole ball. And I'll pick them equivalently. Okay. So, so that's the structure. Now, yeah, the last few minutes, let me try to tell you about the bother. So, I have this model for my extension group gamma as follows. I have a flat surface bundle E over a disk D, which I'll call pi. So as Call pi. So as Chris explained, every subgroup, the mapping class group, corresponds to some surface bundle over some thing. In this case, it's a surface bundle over the surface D mod G, the hyperbolic surface. And if you lift that up to universal cover, you get, in fact, a plane. This is a, here the fibers are copies of like the plane. Because the universal cover goes are detected like this. So you get this flat bundle. We get the fibers, you know, so here. So here, if I have x, and here I have expiber is equal to s tilde with its flat structure. Okay, so that's this bundle. And the group gamma acts on E. Is there a question? Is this for the closed case or for the Is this for the closed case or for the. It could be for punctures. Puncture kind of one, you're considering what's the just go to the universal cover of whatever your surface is. Add some flat structure. Yeah, I don't know. Like for us, we were just thinking about that. For us, we were thinking about SP and Clifford's fiction side. Yeah. Okay, so I have this bundle, and my group acts on E basically by G on the base D and by deck transformations I1 of S on these fibers. Okay, so the fibers are copies of the universal cover, but my extension has this kernel inside. Of my extension has this kernel inside it, which is the fundamental group of the surface that's acting by detectors. So I have this action of my group on this whole thing. The action is not co-compact, basically, because the quotient of d by t is not compact, because it has this constant. So what if I do, if I look inside and I let, I say gamma does act co-compactly on E bar, which is E. Which is E minus the union for all of these parabolic directions of the four balls that I chose before, and I look at their preimages. So I take downstairs, I have my typical disk D, over a point here, X, I have this fiber, this is EX, and I have a core ball here, B alpha, and then above it I have this kind of pre-image. kind of preimage. And I remove those and that's what E bar is. And then once I remove those, then it acts co-compactively. So the upshot is that gamma is Qi to E bar. It's an act geometrically done. So let me now just try to say what the hierarchical structure is on this model. What's the metric value? What's the what metric? Oh, yeah, so. What's the what metric? Oh, yeah, so the metric is basically you so this E is like kind of foliated by horizontal things that look like technical disc and vertical things that look like fibers, and you put like the product metric. You can put any metric to one, but that's just any invariant thing. All right, so the HHG structure and And yeah, probably I can't tell you the whole thing, but I can at least tell you the top level space is, we call it E bar, and it's basically E, sorry, it's E hat, it's E bar with the boundary of each component. So I have these horror balls downstairs, and I'm taking their pre-images, and I'm removing all of them. So for each one, I have some boundary component, which is like a copy of a place. So I collapse each of those. To the tree. Okay, so there's some nice way of doing this where I cut out all these things, I have these planes, and each plane I somehow collapse it in a slot way onto a tree, and I bring this tree out of that plane. And if you do that, the theorem is that you get something hyperbolic, which is kind of a numerical, I think, how it works out. It's how it goes. There's an alternate combinatorial description. Description. Okay, so E hat is equal to the union of all the trees T alpha. So think about, forget about all the inside here, these computers. So just think about the trees on the bound view. So I just have these trees, one for every parabolic direction T alpha, and then I join oc V. V in T alpha and W in T beta. So I have two different trees corresponding to two different parabolic directions, and I want to join them by an edge. If the following thing holds the horrible and B beta. B alpha and B beta are close in the disk, so that means you're going to pick a constant, so you can have a constant and declare what close means. And the spines theta v and theta w intersect. Okay, so they're both spines. There's some things sitting inside of the universal cover of my surface, and they may or may not cross. So if they cross and the horror balls happen to be close, it'll bring an edge. That I'll put an edge. And that defines some graph. And that's QI to this space. And we proved that it's hyperbolic basically by guessing what the geodesics are. So you have two vertices, and you want to say, how do I get between the two of them? So they both correspond to some spines. Basically, you have your two spines. In the flat structure, there's like a unique geodesic joining the spine. Imagine the spine's no cross, like you find the shortest path in the flat structure. Like you find the shortest path and the flat metric between them, that's a concatenation of saddle connections. Each saddle connection itself lives in a spine, and you kind of go between those spines. Those spines tell you vertices, and that kind of guides you about a little path. Let me just say it like that without getting into the details. And the miracle is that that kind of works, and those preferred paths form thin triangles. And the last thing I'll say: so that's the top-level space. The other spaces. Is for each V in any one of these trees. I have a quasi-line. I'll call it K V. So for every V, I'll have a quasi-line and a quasi-tree, which for whatever reason we call psi. Okay? So that's what I'll call it here. It's a quasi-tree. We ran out of the. We ran out of lunch. Those are too many different things. Those are too many different things. And so you have a quasi-line and a quasi-tree for each of these. And those are all the spaces. And then there's, maybe I won't write down the nesting of transverse relations. But anyway, the maximal quasi-flats, the maximal number of orthogonal things is two. So the maximum dimensional quasi-flats are two, which you use in proof of quasi-isymmetric that I mentioned before. Okay, so I think that's a good place to start. As soon as you get a graph like it corresponds to these horribles, like is there anything like the description of it didn't know like pilot of the C or anything? Oh what graph? This you got this you c you say when you have um you join two things together like the horrible is a close end. To get the horribles at close and whatever. And the spines intersect. Right, right, so there's some kind of graphical. Yeah. There's some nice description of this all. I don't know, I thought that was pretty nice. I know what you say about it. Um, I know. I mean, it's quasi-symmetric to this thing where you collapse those boundaries to the trees. It's hyperbolic. Yeah. Oh, can you realize it is a subgroup of the curve? Yeah, it's maybe related to some subgraph of the curve complex. I think I think related to your stuff like that. Thanks so much for time. Let's talk about one here.
