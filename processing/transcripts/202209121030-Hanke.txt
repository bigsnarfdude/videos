Um, so I have to stress that this is a topic which I um dealt with many years ago. During the last years, I did other things, but this has the advantage that I could spend the last couple of weeks studying my own paper and trying to understand which what is in it. And so I can now try to tell you about my findings. Um, so I will, in this talk today, uh, give you a very brief. Give you a very brief introduction to those aspects of rational homotopy theory that can be used to study the Toro-Rank conjecture. And I really try to give the most direct way and just to concentrate on those aspects that are needed in order to draw the conclusions that we are interested in. So as a motivation, Let's concentrate on the group on an actual torus of rank R and X a finite free G C W complex. And now the questions or the conjecture, the Halberg conjecture says that. Conjecture says that the dimension, the total dimension of the rationals of the commodity of X must be bounded below by to the R. Okay, so let's study this question. And so one approach was And so, one approach was indicated by Alec Hano in his talk already. Our approach is as follows: We study the Borel space. And because we are dealing with a free action, this space is actually homotopy equivalent to the quotient, which is a finite. To the quotient, which is a finite CW complex. In particular, the total dimension of the homology of this complex is finite. And so we can try to use this fact in order to draw conclusions about the homology of H of X with rational coefficients. So, we try to study the understand the relation of the rational cohomology of the Borel space and the rational homology of X. And of course, we know that we can. And of course, we know that we can do this using the spectral sequence for the Borel vibration. But so, in general, this is not sufficient to draw the required conclusion about this lower bound that we see here. And so I go one step back and now I study the general problem. Problem of algebraic topology, or one of the general problems, if x is a space, how do we compute its rational homology range? Because if we understand to a good extent how this homology ring is computed, then we may have a good grasp. Have a good grasp about the relation of the homology of these two spaces, and maybe we can draw some conclusions. And indeed, this will be sufficient to prove the Torre-Rank conjecture if X is a product of spheres. Of course, a very special case. And then tomorrow I will also show you how the same methods or similar methods can be used to prove the The Halpering conjecture, the Torrell-Rank conjecture, if X is a product of spheres, but as a group, we take an elementary abelian p-group where P is large compared to the dimension of X. So now this will be a very general introduction to certain methods in algebraic topology to approach these spaces. This today, in some sense, it doesn't have much to do with group actions, but I really try. But I really try to kind of transfer the spirit to you how this works, and this is the use of commutative co-chains in order to understand the space. So, recall if we have a group pi and a integer larger than one. Larger than one, then we study the or we have the Einberg-McLean space, which is up to homotopy equivalence uniquely determined by the property that its kth homotopy is isomorphic to pi and all the other homotopy groups vanish. Then we get the path vibration. Then we get the path vibration saying that kind of the iron-beck-mclane spaces for consecutive K are related in a very specific way, namely the K's iron-back-McLane space appears as the fiber Of a space of a vibration with total space which is contractible. So, this is a path space over the Eilbeck-McLane space for degree k plus one. Okay, and now I use. Okay, and now I use these, or we try to use these as building blocks for understanding our space. And for this, recall if x is simple, by which I mean that x is path connected, and the action of pi one on higher homotopy. On higher homotopy groups is trivial. In particular, pi one has to be abelian. Then we can study the space by means of its Postnikov decomposition. And this is the sequence of fabrication, so this is sort of basic algebraic topology, but maybe. Basic algebraic topology, but maybe not well known to all of you. Namely, we take the space X and we try to build it step by step by spaces whose relation to each other is well understood. Namely, the space x0 is just a point, and then we have spaces x1, and in general. x1 and in general xk to xk minus 1 for this evaporation we have maps out of x to all these spaces and the map phi k has to be a k equivalence and these spaces that appear here are actually Principal vibrations, so they are pulled back vibrations by the path loop vibration like this. So, this is the path loop vibration that we saw earlier. And so, the homotopy types of these spaces, xk, they can be constructed by. They can be constructed by attaching cells to X, which kill all homotopy groups above dimension K for obtaining the space XK. And now the good news is, so recall, so this is a vibration with this fiber. And the good news is that the rational homology of these spaces, of these building blocks inside this. Building blocks inside this Postnikov decomposition, they can be computed. This is a result due to Cartan and Searle from the 50s, namely if pi is a finitely generated group, then we can compute. We can compute its homology of this Einbeck-McLane space with rational coefficients in the following way. I will explain the notation in a second. Sorry, I have a question. Sorry. So this is. So, this is like this, and we take the homomorphisms of pi to q in the degree k. Let me just explain the notation here. So this is the homology ring of this Einbeck-McLean space with rational coefficients. This is a vector space, the homomorphisms from pi to q. And I view this as a graded vector space. View this as a graded vector space concentrated in degree k. And this means this lambda star that I take the three graded commutative algebra over these generators in degree k. So in particular, if k is even, then this is a polynomial algebra over a basis of this vector space. If k is odd, then this is an exterior algebra. And so this means we understand these bases very well. Spaces very well that appear as consecutive fibers in these Postnikov decompositions. And the only thing that remains is that we need to understand the so how these spaces are built together and what happens at each step when we pass from Xk to XK plus one. Sorry, is everything fine with this case in the plastic tower? Plastic tower. So it remains to study the following problem. This is the problem that remains to be studied. So this is this diagram here. And the problem that we have to The problem that we have to study is the following. Let's take a vibration of this kind of laying space k plus one, a pullback vibration with this very of this very specific kind that appears in the Posnikov decomposition and then Then we would like to understand how the homology of the base and the homology of the fiber that we understand well are related to the homology of the total space E and in this way we kind of And in this way, we kind of break down this original problem to a sequence of problems that are maybe simpler to solve. And so there is a very nice answer or very efficient way how we can compute the homology of E in this way. And this uses the methods of rational co-chains. And so let me recall the Sullivan-Piran comparison theorem. How do we compute the homology of spaces? So if M is a smooth manifold, then recall that we can compute its real homology as a ring as the Ring as the homology of the Diram complex, which is the complex of differential forms on M. The multiplication is given by the wedge product, and this is greatly commutative on the co-chain level. And now, if X is an arbitrary topological A topological space, then Sullivan constructed a similar algebra that computes the rational homology of X. And we call this algebra script A. And the idea is really to it's And the idea is really inspired by the complex of differential forms of manifolds. And in some way, the abstraction works in the way in a similar way as we define singular cohomology. So we replace geometric objects by a little bit more abstract objects, like singular chains or singular simplices. And let me briefly indicate how this works. One defines Defines abstractly an algebra that is meant to be the algebra of polynomial forms on an n-simplex. And so we have variables t0 up to tn we have their differentials. We take the exterior algebra where these have Theorea algebra where these have degree zero and these have degree one divided by the ideal that is given as follows so we divide out this ideal and we view this algebra which so Algebra, which so this is now a differential graded commutative algebra, where the differential is really this E, which also appears, which already appears here in this description. So this is the algebra of polynomial forms on the n simplex. The n simplex del n, which are the points t0 up to tn in Rn plus 1 with the additional condition that 0, all these coordinates are between 0 and 1, and their sum is equal to 1. So, in particular, we view the We view the one simplex like this. So, this is T0, this is T1, and this is the one simplex. So, these are kind of our atoms, how we construct this algebra. And now we have inclusion maps and phase maps of this simplex, namely we can write We can write the inclusion of the n minus one simplex into the n simplex. So there are several inclusions. And the one that looks as follows is called the So, this is the I-phase inclusion, and we also have a projection, namely this is given as follows. We add the ith and ith plus first coordinate. Up to Pn plus one. So this is the I degeneracy map or I've collapse map. And via these maps, via these two inclusion maps that exist for several eyes, we can pull back. We can pull back the forms on the n simplex onto the n minus one simplex or the n plus one simplex. And in this way, actually, this t star becomes a simplicial differential grade of commutative algebra. And now for topological space X, we define this algebra that appears here as given by the morphisms in the category of simplicial. Sets from the singular simplicial set of x into this simplicial differential-graded commutative algebra. So this singular set sink X, this consists of singular n simplices in degree n. So, in degree n, this is nothing but the set of singular n simplicies, which are the continuous maps from del n to x. And now we have a map from h star from a star x through the Singular code chains with rational coefficients, and this map is actually given by integration of forms. So, you should think of elements in here as a collection of polynomial forms with rational coefficients on the singular simplices of x, which are compatible with each other in the sense that restrictions to the same singular simplicity. Restrictions to the same singular simplex should be equal. So, this is what this means here. And so, this integration map induces an isomorphism of algebras, namely we get this isomorphism of the homology of this differential algebra with the cohomology of x with rational coefficients. With rational coefficients. This is not very difficult to prove, but it's actually a very amazing result. So we can describe the rational cohomology of X by the cohomology of a differential graded commutative algebra. And so this is a very kind of good to handle algebraic object, as we will see in the next chapter. Okay. Okay, so now let me come back to studying this problem in terms of commutative co-chains on these objects. And before I do that, I erase the blackboard. So, this is this gives a solution to this question here in such a Here, in such a situation, how are the homology rings of the fiber and the total space and the base related? And the general theme is what we call Hirschlemma. In order to formulate it, I give this map a name, namely F. And so this map F. So, this map F induces a map of co-chain algebras because this A star X is contravariant. And we already computed the plus first homology of this space with rational coefficients. And therefore, I can write down a map. I can write down a map which I call F sharp, which goes from the homomorphisms of pi k x to q. Actually, we are not dealing with a space, this is just pi. I should really talk about pi here. I should really talk about pi here. This is the general situation. So we have the homomorphism from pi to q, which is the same as the k plus first homology of the eigenvector lane space, which appears here different coefficients. And then we can go to We can go to the k plus first co-chain group of b with rational coefficients. So this is just a cold chain representative of F with this map F, and we have an induced map. And we have an induced map of homology groups. This is this map here, but the image of this map, um, so I lift it to the co-cycles of the algebra AK plus one, co-channel representative of f. And now I give the basic definition that is important here, namely, if I have If I have a code chain algebra, a graded differential differential graded commutative algebra. And I have a vector space V graded vector space in degree. K, let's say K at least one, and I take a map tau from V to the K plus first chain group or co-chain group of B satisfying. Satisfying that the differential of B composed with tau is zero. So once I have given these data, and this is exactly what we have here. So this is then the necklace base V. And so this will be this coachhain algebra BK plus one. So, but this is just a general definition. So then we construct Construct a new differential gradient commutative algebra, which is denoted this way. So we take the tensor product of this differential graded commutative algebra and of the free graded commutative algebra generated by V, which sits in degree K, as I wrote here. Here, and we put the following differential on it. So, this is just the tensor product of these two algebras as graded commutative algebra. And the differential here is given as follows: elements of the form B tensor one, it is equal to the differential in B. In V and applied to elements in V, it is given by this twisting map. Okay, and we call great differential grade commutative algebras of this form three versions. Three notion extensions. Can you repeat how the went from HK plus one to AK plus one was obtained? I mean for every, so this is a vector space which is dual to the rational vector space pi tensor q and you just take a basis of this. And you just take a basis of this vector space, you take the basis vectors, they are mapped to K-first homology classes of this algebra B, and then you take co-chain representatives of these classes. But then this, there's a choice there, right? Sure. Yes, fair. There is a choice, and this is unique. This F sharp is unique up to co-boundaries. Co-boundaries inside here. This is clear. And now the theorem says that so this is the surge lemma. There exists a map which I call gamma f from this. From this free extension to the in this situation, I should write H star A star of P so let me formulate the theorem correctly. Formulate the theorem correctly. I'm sorry, I have to quickly erase that. So I'm now referring to this situation here, and what we get is a map of the commutative chains of B and then I. And then I take the free extension with this twisting map along the homology with rational coefficients of the fiber, which we have already computed. Namely, this is the homomorphisms of pi to q concentrated in the group K. And this map goes to And this map goes to the commutative co-chains on the total space E, which induces an isomorphism in hormonology. Okay, so why is such a theorem important? To illustrate it a little bit, recall. Recall that we can compute the homology of the total space by means of the Leriscer spectral sequence. Here we have the homology of B with rational coefficients. Here we have the homology of the fiber. Pi k with rational coefficients. So this was already computed. It has generators in degree k, then it has elements in 2k, degree 3k, and so on. And here we have a transgressive differential, which is nothing but The map in cohomology in degree k plus one induced by f. And so now we can go on and compute higher differentials in the spectral sequence to understand the comology of the total space E. But as we know, it's so the first thing is that in general, it's not so easy to compute higher differentials and And secondly, this only computes the homology of the total space up to an associated graded object to a filtration of E or the homology of E. And yeah, so the infinity page of the spectral sequence, so the objects in there, so these are quotient modules which come from a filtration. Come from a filtration of the total space E. And this does not directly give the commodity of E. But it should be isomorphic if we were homologous, right? Yeah, additively isomorphic. And so this Hirsch lemma, this is this theorem here, this kind of makes it up. Of makes an upgrade and gives a cold chain model or kind of a representative of this situation on the cold chain level on the level of a differential grade. Of differential graded commutative algebras. And now, I mean, we also have a filtration on the homology of this algebra coming from the filtration of the space B, of A star of B. And if you write down the spectral sequence, the E2 term looks exactly this way. So, these terms appear in the fiber. So, these are the So these are, this is the free algebra generated by the vector space homπq sitting in degree k. And here we have this transgressive differential, which is exactly given by this twisting map in the co-chain model. But this is a much better situation because here we have a map on the nose which is multiplicative and which induces a An isomorphism in cohomology. And so, in this way, we get really a good description of the cohomology of E in terms of the homology or the co-chain algebras associated to E and the fiber. And now let's use this statement. Sorry, just to a very simple question. So if F is just identity, just to play around a bit. Just to play around a bit. Then E should be contractable, right? Do I see food from this lemma? F the identity. Just in this diagram, just set F. Just diagram we just array. So the fullback should also be contractible, right? No, no. All right, no, no, it's yeah, so there's always the fiber, so the Polback bundle is always a vibration with fiber and I lane space of type pi k. Yes, but but the total the total space was a pass space, which is contractible, right? Yes. I see. You take uh so the map F is just identity, then E is contractable. So do I see it from? Yes, yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah, okay, so this is a tricky situation, actually. I didn't think of that, but. Actually, I didn't think of that, but you are right. So then, I mean, okay. Interesting. So, this listing should give you then the contractable thing, right? Yes. Let's not think too long about that. Maybe I go on and then we think about that case later. But you're certainly right. Later, but you're certainly right. If we take the identity, f is the identity, when the pullback bundle is again the part of the fabrication and the total space is contracted. This is true. And actually, I wrote a proof of this Girls lemma. And basically, the most difficult step in it is to define the co-chain. And the problem is that. The problem is that, I mean, it is clear that we, on this part, we take the map which is induced by the projection of E to B, but it is not so clear what we make, what we do with these elements. The problem is that these elements are not co-closed. Or they are not closed. So because the differential is given by F sharp. And in general, this is different from zero. So we really have to do something. So we really have to do something on the code-shaped level here, on the algebraic side. And if you look in the literature, there are several solutions to this problem. And for example, in the book by Griffiths Morgan, they have a kind of elaborate discussion about how this map is defined. And actually, I have prepared lecture notes which I can distribute to you if you wish. And there I wrote kind of I wrote a kind of, I think, rather short proof of it, but it's a little tricky to define this math here. But I think we can take this as a black box and kind of this is an algebraic mirror on the K on the in the context of commutative co-chain algebras of this situation of a fibration with a fiber K, an eye-equipped plane space of type pi k. Of type pi k. And now I can use this in order to construct a model for my space X along a postenc decomposition. This is part four, and this is called Sullivan models. Models So, recall that we take a path-connected space such that pi k pi1 acts trivially on the other homotopic groups. And we also assume that pi k Pi k, all these groups are finitely generated. This is, for example, satisfied if X is a finite complex. And these homotopy groups are finitely generated, and our theory works. So we have the positive decomposition. Namely, we have our spaces xk, phi k, and our projections pk. So these phi k's go from x to xk. xk approaches x up to homotopy degree k, so this is a k equivalence, and these maps pi k from xk to xk minus 1. So these Minus one. So these are fibrations with fiber pi k of x k. So this is the Postnikov decomposition. And now I can apply the previous result, namely these. This Hirsch lemma in an inductive manner, in order to construct a co-chain model which computes the commodity of X, but which is much smaller than the Saliban-De Laam algebra. So we so this is our goal we construct A small replacement of the core chain algebra A star X by induction over the Postnikov. The possible decomposition using the Girls lemma in each step And what we get from this is a sequence of commutative differentials. commutative differential differential rated commutative algebras and so they this is a differential great commutative algebra and we get maps to the code chain model of the kth state Stage in our Postikhov decomposition. And okay, so this thing induces an isomorphism in homology. Then I call these maps Psyche, for example. Sorry, these are maps we know by each level, right? Yes. Yes, in each step. So I start with the code chain model of a point. And of course, we just can take the algebra Q sitting in degree zero. And the kth algebra is constructed by taking the kth minus first algebra and then we And then we take the free extension, free Hirsch extension on the homomorphisms of the kth homotopic group of X to Q sitting in degree K along a map torque which is induced by K, by F induced not by F. Not by F, but by this map by um no, um, yeah, so this is induced by the classifying map of these uh vibrations here. So this is um induced by a map from k minus one to IK. I k x k plus one. And so these are the classifying maps for these vibrations. So the k space is constructed by this. And we also have a commutativity property, namely that so from here I have an inclusion. I have an inclusion from the kth minus first algebra in my process. And let's see that I do not okay. I draw a commutative diagram as follows. We have the map from MK star. k star to a x k and here we have the canonical inclusion of the kth minus first algebra into this algebra and here we have the kth minus first space in our postnikhoff decomposition and here we have the map which is dual Have the map which is dual to the kth projection map, and here we just have an inclusion. So this diagram commutes and actually so this map or this sequence can really be constructed along the Postikov tower by using the Hirsch lemma at each step. There's just one technical issue at one point since in the One point, since in the Hirsch lemma, we have these co-chain algebras of the base. And so if we write down the Hirsch lemma, then we see the co-chain algebra of the space xk minus one. But by induction, we know that we can replace this co-chain algebra by the co-chain algebra that we have already constructed. And so this is where we arrive here. And the nice thing. And the nice thing about this algebra or this model, which I can construct in this way, is that we get an induced map to the co-chain algebra of X. So this M star, this is just the coliness of all these algebras here. And this is what we Here, and this is what we call the minimal Saliban model of X. And one thing that we have to keep in mind is that it is inductively built by adjoining new generators to an algebra that we have already constructed. And the new generators correspond to a vector space. A vector space which is related to the kth homotopy group and then tensored with q. So this means the generators of this algebra here, they correspond to generators of the rational homotopy groups of x. By rational, I mean the homotopy groups of x tensored by the rationals. And this gives a very close relation between the homotopy groups of x. Groups of X and the homology of X, because this algebra in the end computes the cohomology. And so this brings us a little bit closer to our initial goal where we wanted to understand the cold chain, the cohomology ring of a space in terms of the space itself. And now we have a good model, a relatively small co-chain algebra, which is actually also three as an algebra over. As an algebra over generators which are related to the homotopy groups of X. And okay, so this is actually all I need for what I'm doing now in rational homotopy theory. One studies these algebras also from an algebraic point of view. And there is an abstract procedure how from such an algebra we construct what we call a minimal algebra in the sense of Sullivan. But all these notions are not needed for what I All these notions are not needed for what I'm doing. So, this is a very pragmatic point of view. Here, we use the Hirsch lemma to write down this algebra here, and we know that this algebra has a map to the co-chain algebra of X, which induces an isomorphism in homology. And we also can remember how this algebra is constructed using these homotopic rows. And using And using this insight, I can now compute homotopy groups of the spaces that we are interested in, namely of spheres, and also of classifying spaces of tori. This is a nice game that we can play now. Maybe some examples. The first example is if n is even, then I can try to understand what is the minimal Sullivan algebra of an N. And now let's play that game that I where the rules were explained. We start writing down. We start writing down the Postikov decomposition of Sn, and we know that the first generators of homotopy groups appear in degree N. This is because we can use the Hulivic theorem. And so we know that the N homotropic group is equal to Z. And so the rational n homotopic group is equal to Q. And this means we certainly have a generator. A generator in degree n. But what happens next? And now let's see. So this is the nth approximation to our sphere. So this is then equal to lambda star of tau. And now Now, okay, we have to keep one thing in mind. If we are in the postnikov decomposition, or if you are looking at such a vibration, E to B, and then here we go to an Eilenbeckner-Lane space, K plus one, and here we have the path space. If the k plus first If the K plus first cohomology of the space B that we see here is trivial, then the map F induces the trivial map in cohomology in degree K plus 1, because we don't have any cohomology here. And this means that in the minimal push extension, we create a new generator in homology that can never be killed by. By further steps in the Postnikov decomposition, because the further elements that can be killed at next steps have to sit in degrees higher than K plus 1. And this gives us a clue to understand what these minimal models must look like in higher degrees. Namely, so this cannot change in degree n plus 1 and so on and so on. On and so on. But then one thing happens: this generator, so this is so the cohomology of mn star is equal to this free algebra over tau. But then we have a new cohomology class, tau squared, in degree 2n, which doesn't exist in the cohomology of sn so this has to be killed, and it is killed by the chomology or the The chromology or the induced methane chromology by a math F, which goes to the sum Einmagnett Lane space in degree 2n. And so the new generator that we have to adjoin here must sit in degree 2n minus 1. And so this means that these algebras are equal up to degree 2n minus 2. Minus 2, but the algebra in degree 2n minus 1 must then be lambda star of tau and a new generator, which I call eta. This is in degree 2n minus 1, such that the differential of eta is equal to tor squared. And so we get this new generator eta. We get this new generator eta in degree 2n minus 1. And we also know that now the cohomology of this algebra, of this differential algebra, is already the cohomology of Sn and so this implies that this process must stop. We are not allowed or we in next steps all these maps F must be so there cannot be further groups here because these would create new homology. These would create new homology which cannot be killed anymore. And so we mean that we see that necessarily this minimal algebra must have this form. And this also implies, kind of in hindsight, that the kth homotopy groups of Sn tensor with the rationals is equal to q in degree n and 2n minus Degree n and 2n minus 1, degree n and 2n minus 1, and 0 else, apart from k equals 0, but I'm not interested in that. So this is how this game works. So by building this minimal algebra, we can kind of in the end understand the rational homotopic groups or rationalized homotopic groups of our space. And if n is odd, then Is odd, then in the same way we can compute its minimal algebra. It's then a free algebra in one generator of degree n. And the last point is that if we take the classifying space of the group as one to the The group as one to the R. Okay, so the first homotopy groups appear in degree two, where the homotopy is equal just to a Dirac sum of R copies of Z. So the rationalized thing has the same generators. And so the second Sullivan approximation is An approximation is equal to the free algebra over generators t1 up to tr, where all these generators have degree two. So this is just a polynomial algebra. But now it turns out that in the second step in this approximation, so this is actually the end result because the homology ring of this algebra is already the correct. Algebra is already the correct homology of the space that we are interested in. And therefore, this process must stop at this point. And right, so these are actually the basic building blocks, these minimal summit algebra of spheres that will help us to resolve the Halperin conjecture or the torrent rank conjecture for products of spheres where the group. Products of spheres where the group S1 to the R is acting. And because you are also interested in exercises, so one little exercise that you can do is prove this Cartan-Ser theorem for the case of an Eilenbeck-McLane space for the group Z in degree K with rational coefficients. So this must be isomorphic to. Must be isomorphic to the free algebra generated over Q, or one copy of Q in degree K. And you can do this by induction using the path loop vibrations for Einbechnet lane spaces and then analyzing the spectral sequence together with its multiplicative properties. So, and then you will see that this is really a fairly elementary calculation. But this is Calculation. But this is really one of the main building blocks of the theory. So, this is the calculation of these groups, which is classical. And the second building block is the construction of these minimal or these algebra script MK, which model the kth stages of the Postnikov decomposition of X by an algebra which is well understood in terms of the X. Which is well understood in terms of the rationalized homotopic groups of X. Okay, and tomorrow I will start explaining how this setup can be used to study the Torre-Wand conjecture, and then I will also explain what we have to change in this approach if we pass from the group S1 to the R to an elementary Belian P group. And this will then lead us to. And this will then lead us to the result that we can compute the or estimate the toral rank or the stable P rank of products of spheres. This is the result that was mentioned by Alejandro. So I would like to stop here and thank you for your attention. Thank you, Bernhard. Maybe we start with your local audience. Are there questions from there? The audience, are there questions from there? This doesn't seem to be the case. So, are there questions from here and back? Yeah, I had some questions. This is James Cameron. Is there some general condition where I know that the minimal Sullivan model agrees with one of those finite approximations, like it does in those two examples you gave? You gave I mean a general criterion? Oh, it's a little hard to figure out because this is a little, I mean, there's a little ad hoc what I did here, I have to admit. I mean, sure, once the homology of some space M star K is the homology of X already, I mean if it's the complete homology. I mean, if it's the complete commodity, and the process stops at this point, so we cannot go further because then we would create new generators which cannot be killed later on. I would really phrase it in these simple terms. This is the criterion that we can use here. Actually, I was a little confused about your question. If we take the identity in this, the identity map. Identity map. We should look at this. I mean, we have a few minutes. Let's do a little exercise and study the case, and then let's see if I explain to you some nonsense or everything makes sense. Actually, a good example okay, so let's study the Hirsch lemma for the following situation. We have the path loop vibration for pi Here we take k pi k plus one of the table the same space is here. Here okay, and we see that this base is contractible, and so this must somehow be modeled by the um in the Hirsch in this um Hirsch lemma. So, this tells us that we can compute the co-chain algebra of E must be isomorphic to the co-chain algebra of pi of the space. Pi of the space k pi k plus one with irrational coefficients. And then here we get the free algebra. And so this is now in the homomorphisms of pi to q in the p. To Q in degree K. And for simplicity, maybe we just take the groups that is already interesting enough to study this case. So this is then nothing but a cold chain algebra which is generated by one element in degree k. K say, and here we have a twisting map, and this twist map hits a generator in degree k plus one of this algebra. So, okay, so the homology algebra of this thing in degree k homology algebra of the day. Homology algebra of the base is we already computed that this is the free algebra over a generator in degree k plus one and this twist map sends y to x or sends y to a co-chain representative To a co-chain representative of X. So this is a co-chain representative. And this exactly models the Leurissaire spectral sequence if we compute the total space here, which is contractible. Here, which is contractible by the path loop vibration. So, here we have the homology of the base, which is equal to lambda star x k plus 1. Here we have the commodity of the fiber, which is the free algebra generated by one degree in degree k. Here we have y, here we have x, and we have. Here we have x, and we have this differential. And then, if you study this causal algebra, then you see that its cohology vanishes. So, the cohology of this algebra indeed vanishes. And so everything is fine. But this is an important special case. I completely case that we have to study first. One question to the organizers. So I have. So, I have written a lecture note.
