Explaining why we are interested in this type of technical sounding problem. So basically it comes from studying the asymptotic stability of kink solitons. So those arise in one-dimensional scalar field theories. So there we have a field phi that depends on times and one space derivative, one space coordinate. One space coordinate. And possibly one of the simplest Hamiltonians you can write down here is just the integral over the kinetic energy, RGT phi squared, plus the potential energy given by a scalar potential V of phi. And so then the equation of motion becomes a one-dimensional. A one-dimensional wave equation. So partial p squared minus partial x squared phi is equal to phi minus more generally negative b prime or phi. So 1d wave equation with nonlinearity coming from the scalar potential. And for instance, interesting dynamics occurs if this potential is a double well potential, so something like this. Something like this, where you have two variable minimas, say negative one and positive one. So for instance, a concrete choice here would be to take the potential to be one quarter times one minus five squared squared. This gives rise to the prime example here, the phi to the four model, which Which sort of has the equation of motion, partial t squared minus partial x squared. Phi is equal to phi minus phi cubed. Okay, and so now here to have finite energy solutions at spatial infinity your field has to assume on the values negative one or positive one. Otherwise you'll integrate up infinite energy. So certainly just staying at negative one or positive one. At negative one or positive one, are trivial finite energy solutions. But then, so for instance, in the five to the four model, there's also an interesting static solution that connects these two endpoint behaviors. And this is the, well, goes by the name of the static key. So it's explicitly given by the hyperbolic tangent of x over square root two. x over square root 2. The name just derives from its shape. So it nicely connects between negative 1 and positive 1. Of course, you can also look at spatial translations. Or if you apply a Lorentz boost, you get a moving pin. And so now, heuristically, this kink is expected to be asymptotically stable, just coming from sort of the topological construction. Of the topological constraints imposed by this potential landscape. Now, to prove that, you'll have to look at perturbations and prove decay for those perturbations. And so, if you look at the kind of equation you get, so say you write field phi as just the static pink plus the small perturbation u. That depends on time. Perturbation view, that depends on time and space. Like ignoring any modulational issues, so just looking what happens around this static thing. And so then you get the following equation for the perturbation. Okay, so this turns out to be a Klangord equation with mass term 2. We have linear potential and then there's going to be quadratic and cubic nonlinearities which also come with variable coefficients. And so in that sense, although this looks rather innocent, I'm actually proving decay here is sort of comes with a number of challenges. So on the one hand, on the linear side, this, well, the This well, the linear operator has a positive eig value below the continuous spectrum, so an internal oscillation mode that you'll have to deal with. And then on the right-hand side, so there's quadratic and cubic nonlinearities in 1D due to the slow decay of time-order waves. They exhibit long-range effects. And well, their analysis gets compounded by the presence of variable coefficients. And so, nevertheless, a few years ago, So, nevertheless, a few years ago there was a remarkable result by Kovalchik, Martel, and Munoz. So they proved the asymptotic stability of this king under odd perturbations of finite energy. So specifically what they proved was that the energy locally decays to zero for solutions to this equation. zero for solutions to this equation. So this was the local energy decay to zero for odd finite energy perturbations. So here the oddness assumption played a crucial role. Um in the general case this is actually still open, proving the asymptotic stability. Improving the asymptotic stability, and also it would be desirable to get information about sort of sharp decay rates and asymptotics of small perturbations. And so, this kind of problem of understanding sharp decay estimates and asymptotics in such a setting is what we're interested in. Of course, we are not dealing with all the difficulties here at once, so we are ignoring the linear potential and would like to look at the long-range effects in the presence of. In the presence of variable coefficients. So, in that sense, we are looking at the following model problem: just the free Tlangoran operator, and now quadratic and cubic nonlinearities where Where sort of alpha0 and beta naught are just fixed constants. So these are constant coefficient nonlinearities, and then alpha at x and beta at x are variable coefficients. And for the moment, we assume them to be spatially localized. So not yet such a king-type coefficient. And so here, for small solutions, global existence. Solutions, global existence just follows from the conservation of energy. Now, when it comes to decay and asymptotics, so the two aspects I'd like to sort of tell you in the following is on the one hand how local decay estimates for the Klangorden propagator are a very simple tool to deal with some of the difficulties sort of caused by the variable coefficients. And then secondly, I'll speak about sort of a striking resonant interaction. Sort of a striking resonant interaction in this variable quadratic nonlinearity. And so there's a resonant interaction between the spatial oscillations of the coefficient and the temporal oscillations of the solution. So that has interesting consequences. Okay, so of course first I should say that in just the constant coefficient setting, this of course has a long history and is already understood very well. Understood very well. Decay and asymptotics here for small solutions. So in one space dimension, you have the difficulty with the long-range effects caused by the slow decay rate. So it's one over t to the one-half in one space dimension. And so this leads to long-range effects in the following sense. If you say you take the cubic nonlinearity, so due to the 1 over t to the 1/2, you can To the one-half decay, you can view this as sort of a potential of order one over t acting on your solution u. This is not integral at infinity, and so in that sense, you can't expect your solutions to sort of behave like free solutions in the long run. Rather, there's some modified scattering. And so, what happens is that there are some logarithmic phase corrections. So, here So here just referring to the constant quadratic and constant cubic case. So those nonlinear solutions still decay like t to the one-half, but they have a logarithmic phase direction. And so this was first established by DeLore in 2001. In fact, for much more general quadratic quasi-linear type than non-linearities even. Then Avi and Hans sort of came up with Sort of came up with a simple physical space proof in the cubic case. And afterwards, there were, of course, many more contributions, in particular by Hayashi and Naunkin, and many others. Of course, also in the closely related 1D cubic Schrodinger equation, there were works, even earlier works, starting with I think Dif and Zau. With Dijon Zau, Hayashi Naumkin, Javier Hans, Carl Puzato, Terry, Yifin Tatao, just to mention a few words. Okay, but so now where is the difficulty if you start adding in variable coefficients? So just very roughly speaking, among the various approaches to capture the logarithmic phase corrections, there's usually There's usually some ODE argument to capture the right asymptotics, and then some energy estimates for weighted vector fields. So for Klein-Gordon, so the only, in 1D, the only weighted vector field is actually the Lorentz boost. So we have Z, which I'm going to denote by Z, so it's T times partial X plus X times partial T. And so if you want to derive energy estimates for that, and you, well, you'll have to let And you well, you'll have to let it fall on your variable coefficient, nonlinearity. So if it falls, say, here on beta at x, this produces a term t times beta prime at x times u cubed, plus of course beta terms. But so it produces this fairly divergent factor of t, which at least at first sight might at least make it difficult to sort of get good energy estimates. Of get good energy estimates, and good in the sense that they are only slowly growing. And so, nevertheless, a couple of years ago, Abby and Hans and also Scherns obtained the first decay result for the variable qubit case. So they've proved um dk for the well, constant quadratic and then a constant cubic together with a variable coefficient cubic non-linearity. And so the main point or the main novelty in that, in those works, was that they came up with a new type of normal. With a new type of normal form, to delegate normal form, which basically turns this variable cubic term into a variable quartic term. And so once you're at the quartic level with that type of decay, you can kind of easily take a hit by one Lorentz boost. And so this is a very nice, relatively delicate approach. And so now we realized that using local decay estimates for the Klein-Golden propagator, Propagator, we have a much simpler approach to deal with this variable cubic term, which avoids any normal form and is really quite straightforward. And so, this is sort of the first theorem and without sort of proof I'd like to tell you about. Right. And so before that, let me also say that in the related, so for the cubic NLS in 1D, there were, so with the variable coefficients, there were some results. Um 1D variable cubic analysis there are results by There are results by, so in the case where the coefficient is even and you have odd data, there's results by DeLore. And very recently, Chen and Pussatieri. But I want to emphasize that in those works, the main focus is on including a linear potential, not optimizing the variable coefficient. Okay, so now our Okay, so now our first theorem here. I'll need hyperbolic coordinates to give a proof. So I'm going to denote them by rho and y. So they're really just a means to pollate the interior of the light on by such hyperboloids which are which are the space-time points tx that lie on the hyperboloid t squared minus x squared is equal to rho squared. So then you can write x as rho times coordinate sinh y, t becomes rho times cos y, and the Lorentz boost just becomes the coordinate vector field, coordinate derivative part to y. Okay. So then So then the theorem you get is following. So we let u at t be a small regular solution to the constant and variable coefficient. Constant and variable coefficient, cubic tango. And so then we obtain sharp decay estimates in the sense that in the exterior of the light cone, you have arbitrarily good polynomial decay, while in the interior, you have the sharp one over t to the one-half decay. Moreover, Moreover, we get asymptotics. So there exists a limiting amplitude. So that the leading order in the long run is given by 1 over t to the 1 half times the imaginary part of e to the i rho minus 3 beta naught over 8. 8 A of y squared times the logarithmic phase direction, logaro. And then plenty of vector. So here in this result, of course, it improves over the fire wand in the sense that we actually get a sharp decay rate and asymptotics, but the main point is rather sort of the very simple method. Point is rather sort of the very simple method which I'd like to sketch out now. And I should say in that paper, we could have easily included a constant quadratic with Shata's normal form, but just to illustrate the method, we stick to this model. All right. Alright, and so I'm going to sketch out how to proceed in the interior following first a briefly sketching a physical space approach by Adi and Hans. So this relies on first passing to a new variable w, which is t to the one-half times u, and then in hyperbolic order, And then in hyperbolic coordinates, rho to the one-half, cosh to the one-half, y times u. And so proving decay corresponds now to proving a uniform boundedness of w. And so this approach relies on the very nice observation that if we pass to hyperbolic coordinates here, so basically your equation becomes the following. So you get this kind of linear operator and well and the cubic nonlinearities and some milder terms. And so the nice observation here is that well those y derivatives come with a lot of rho decay and so it's tempting to just put them on the right hand side which turns the equation into an ODE, large row squared. ODE, partial rho squared then plus one w is equal to suitable coefficient divided by rho, wq, plus plenty of integrable terms. And then from this ODE, you just tell infinity ODE estimates, you get boundedness of w, and you can also extract these asymptotics. Now of course this relies on getting control on these y derivatives, at least sufficiently slowly growing control. Sufficiently slowly growing control. So, this remains integrable. In the presence of variable coefficients, you certainly don't want to take two y derivatives, so two Lorentz boosts. In fact, you can frequency localize here, only to the low frequencies, which really matter. And then you'll see you only need control of one lower squad. So, what you need is a slow growth bound and one y derivative of w. and one y derivative of w in some hyperboloids, so that this is bounded by some epsilon times rho to the plus w. So slow growth. So now this is the key point or key difficulty here. And yeah, let me illustrate now how to get this slow growth bound. Slightly in a slightly simpler setting, sort of in rectal linear coordinates. So if I operate on the bootstrap assumption that my L infinity norm in x is bounded by epsilon divided by t to the one half, I'm now going to derive a slow growth bound in 2x of one Lorentz boost of this solution here. And so the well the main And so the well the main idea can then easily be up can be upgraded to control on hyperbola. Okay, and so the idea here is to just decompose the solution u into two components, u0 plus u1 at t, where u1 sort of sees the effect, or sees the contribution of the variable coefficient. the variable coefficient nonlinearity on the right hand side. So here we have beta at x times u cube on the right hand side and it comes with zero data. So the rest is, let me call this u1 rather. The rest uh stays in u0. Um and so now we wanna the difficulty is really to control a lower The growth of a Lorentz boost for this U1 component. And well, there we really just take the standard Krain-Gordon energy functional. So it's one half times the spacetime derivative plus one half times V squared. And well, we compute the growth of the energy. Of the energy of the Lorentz boost of this u1 component. So, well, that's going to be the integral of ox plus 1 acting on zu1 times partial t zu1 dx. And so here we will be hitting the variable coefficient with a Lorentz boost 70. So the most difficult term is going to be t times. difficult term is going to be t times beta prime at x times u cubed times those derivatives. And now, well, we have to compensate t, so we have to pick up as much decay as possible. So we put all u's into L infinity. So this gives us t to the 3 half decay. t to the 3/2 decay. That is certainly not enough yet to compensate. It's only 1 over t to the 1/2. But now the key observation is that this U1 component, actually those derivatives of it, are amenable to a nice weighted energy estimate with extra decay. So if we place it in x to the negative two um partial t z d one in L to x. In L2x. Then we can show this has an additional decay of t to the one-half. Those weights we can then nicely put onto the variable coefficient, since it's spatially localized. And so overall, well, there's other terms, but overall we get a 1 over t dk. And so once we integrate it. And so once we integrate, it's only logarithmically growing. So that's a very nice slow growth estimate. And that's already it. So, I mean, the key point is really just proving these decaying weight energy estimates. And, well, there we use the following local decay estimates for the Klein-Born propagator. So if you take inverse spatial wave. So if you take inverse spatial weights, possibly some derivatives of the Klan-Gorn propagator, then you get e to the one-half dk times some weight on your data in L2. And well, in the presence of derivatives, you get more decay. Those to prove is just elementary Fourier analysis. As far as I know, these types of local heat estimates go back to sort of Wau and Kartrigensen from the late 70s and several others in the context of Schroding operators that also can also allow for the linear potential. The linear potential. But so, yeah, so here this is a nice tool and gives rise to a very simple proof. So, well, now having such a simple proof, it's the variable cubic case, it's time to try to understand the variable quadratic case. Maybe let's start with that over here. Um yeah, so the variable quadratic. So here, first I just want to take a look at the pure variable quadratic nonlinearity. Nonlinearity on the right-hand side. And so basically, here due to the spatial localization, what matters is really only the contribution of the solution u at the origin. So basically, what we really have to understand is alpha at x times the solution u evaluated at the origin. Um and so let's take a look at, say, in Doula Melpha. Look at, say, in Doula-Mel form, the contribution of this piece. So then you'll have the retarded evolution of this variable coefficient. And it gets integrated in time against the solution evaluated at the origin squared. And so let's say Our non-linear solution, let's say, just behaves like a free solution at the origin. So if it behaves like a free solution, this means it oscillates like e to the plus minus i s and decays like s to the one half. So then certainly, I mean, I just crudely bound this uh this integral well. Well, that would be 1 over t minus s to the 1 half times 1 over s integrated, and this behaves like log t over t to the 1 half. Of course, this is very crude, and we hope that the oscillations are going to prevent the buildup of that logarithm. So, now if you take a look, so the oscillations in S. So, if you take a look. So, if you take a look, what you get here, so say all the oscillations in S, and so say we look here at the interaction of just the plus waves. And so, it's particularly easy to see on the Fourier side that we'll have e to the plus rs. So, we get a 2 from this squared, and then minus Squared and then minus well bracket c. And so then clearly we run into a problem if 2 minus bracket c is equal to 0, which happens exactly when you are at plus or minus square root of 3 frequency. At that frequency, there's no oscillation at all in S. And so if you then, for Klein-Gordon, And then for Klein-Gordon wave packets, at those frequencies, they travel along the rays square root 3 over 2 times t. So if you then track what happens here along those rays, you will see that, well, for small f but sufficiently long times, your overall phasiness is really constant. And so you can't prevent the buildup of suck. You can't prevent the buildup of such a logarithm. So, there will be a logarithmic slowdown of the decay among those rays. Well, while I just took the three asymptotics to get started. And so then, the key point or key work here was that we could show that the nonlinear solution has exactly at the origin these asymptotics of the free solution. Of the free solution. So that's the main lemma now. So that our non-linear solution at the origin, the long line really just behaves like a free flank Gordon wave. So it's going to be e to the Well it's going to be e to the plus the imaginary part e to the plus I t divided by e to the one half times some um small amplitude A naught plus lots of terms with more decay. And so the main ingredient for that proof was again local decay estimates for Tlangorn propagator. More precisely that we obtain very good local decay of the time derivative of phase filter of the phase filtered components of our nonlinear solution. So this comes with an epsilon over T dk, which basically just allows you to do a lot of integration by parts in time near the origin when you need it. And so this overall, this then gives rise to the following theorem. So So if we let EOS T now be a small regular solution to um the pure variable quadratic Vangordon equation. Van Gordon equation, then we have the following two cases. So in the non-resonant case, if our variable coefficient Spourier transform vanishes at plus and minus square root three, well then we switch off that resonance and we can obtain the usual The usual one over t to the one-half. And asymptotically, the solution is going to behave like a free wave, free-flangball wave. So, and UOT scatters to a 3D angle wave while in the red wave. In the resonant phase so as soon as one of those frequencies is switched on. So then, well in M infinity, so we can only get log t over t to the one-half decay. And so this is sharp in the sense that along those rays, so u at t plus minus square root three half t. T. We get the following asymptotic. Namely, this is going to be plus minus the imaginary part of e to the plus i t half times Fourier transform of alpha at negative square root three. at negative square root three times amplitude, small amplitude squared, times now the log t over t to the one half plus, well, it comes with the beta 1 over t to the 1 half. So there's indeed along those rays this logarithmic slowdown of the decay rate. So this is a sharp estimate. Along all other rays we Along all other rays, we get the usual t to the one-half decay. So we have sort of this picture that along those square root three over two rays, we have the slowdown. Everywhere else, we have one over t to the one-half decay, only that, of course, deteriorates as we approach that rad. This is at least for my This is, at least from my experience, an interesting phenomenon. So the proof strategy is really what I just sketched. So the core part is first to extract these asymptotics at the origin, and then you can track what happens, in particular, along those rays. And yeah, maybe just to conclude, so a bit on work in progress, so now, of course. Progress. So now, of course, we would like to add in all other terms of sort of this model. So, in particular, the constant cubic term. So, in the non-resonant case, this seems to be possible in the sense that here we can sort of construct a normal form that only subtracts off sort of this dangerous term, so alpha edx at u at t, zift, so evaluated at the origin. Evaluated at the origin. So, with that type of normal form, we basically subtract that part off and get sort of variable cubic time terms, which we can then control in a manner, as I sort of in the previous theorem I told you, since variable cubic is really kind of easy now. So that's that seems possible. And well, here it's gonna get interesting to de deal with logarithmic slowdown. So I think, yeah, that's So I think yeah, that's uh what I wanted to tell you. With a quick term, did you see that the only thing that really mattered was that the read that the of the the alpha of x was uh integral? Sorry, in the which cubic methods that was on the left. In the cubic when you treated the cubic term, that was x times u cube. So you mean usually I beta x cube cube? It seems that it was only beta prime integrable that really matter. Only da prime. There only beta prime matter. Yeah. Um I but I pointed out to you there was this um the sort of the key ingredient was then to The key ingredient was then to sort of in this energy estimate to prove that this one component of the solution that sees the variable coefficient on the right-hand side that it had this L2, weighted L2 estimate, which came with extra decay. To prove that at this point, To prove that at this point, I sort of so I don't know how to deal with a coefficient that is not spatially localized. So there it comes in. So you see not a beta to be like over contacts? No, not at so clearly beta for the kink beta prime is nicely localized, um beta itself not, and actually for that proof I didn't show you how well I didn't go into the details there, we needed it. Details there, we needed them. It's also one of the interesting next things for modified KDE. There are some stability results for keys because of the integrability. Is there something similar for the sine goal? So sine Gordon is also an integrable case. It also has yeah it has the arc ten of R10 of e to the x or something, something like that. In terms of stability results, there I'm not 100% sure at the moment. I think there's also breezes coming in, and I think in this paper by Kovalczik, Matel Munius, where they pointed out that would not work. Um that would not work for the Sein-Gordon case. Preetas are large somehow. Prefers are non-linear, large non-linear objects. For stability then might be able to ignore them. I'm not sure. Well, okay, in that sense I should say I'm also not sure. Maybe we can discuss afterward. I can point you to one. But I can point you to one comment I read. Principle there was for Sangord it would be nice because Z coefficients are specially localized. So for the stability of the kink, alpha of x was tash. So that's something that is not of the form constant plus alpha of x. Sort of. Oh, maybe I didn't emphasize enough. So here all the coefficients were spatially local. All the coefficients were spatially localized. In this model problem, alpha edx, beta x were always say Schwartz functions. Ah, okay. So the next step would be functional and final u squared plus that of x. So in the sort of the 5 to the 4 model, the coefficient would be x tang of x over square root of 2, which morally you can view as, well, it's plus constant plus 1, plus spatially localized as you move to the right, and negative constant, negative. And negative constant negative ones, spatial of it to the left. So as you have maybe going in that direction, you should see this. Thank you again. We will reconvene at 11:30. Of course. So like what? So here it seems like you see that you can install.
