Thank you very much, Anna. I am again jumping a little bit out of Unarkoff and Riemann Hilbert, but I'm not sure about the latter, because my talk is about solving problem with discontinuities in function, which is Riemann-Hilbert problem. But I will present a different method, also classical method, and give two applications: one rather standard application and three. Standard application in fracture mechanics, but with a little bit new twist and numerical solution. And another one would be for relatively new applications, somewhat related to what Gennady was giving in his talk, interfaces, etc. So in fracture mechanics, there are a lot of problems with conditions and jump conditions and displacement. It's practically a problem of fractures, and they characterized by, they can be. Characterized by they can be, you know, in man-made material in nature and various processes. And jump conditions in those problems are jumps mostly in displacements. And sometimes they express varietions in general by non-linear regulations, and there is a need to model it. In mechanics of composites, there are problems which involve so-called imperfect interfaces or thin interface layers or Layers, or more recently, materials reinforced with very thin reinforcements. And another class of problems which involve function with jump conditions is problems of with practically SLB inclusions with eigenstrain. And most of this type of jump conditions are various of various types. This is a famous classification of thin layer by Denise de Miller for two. By Denise de Miller for two dimensions, and you could see that it starts from jump displacements and ends in jump contractions. And they identify seven interface regimes. And these jump conditions could be very complex nature, involve differential relations, etc. So there is a need in tool to model those jump conditions. I will work with a case of elasticity. So, this is my Navia equation. And I present everything for isotropic material, but of course, the main ideas could be developed for anisotropic materials too. So, I will start with Green's function. You're all familiar with that. But because elastic potentials are less known than harmonic potentials, then I will make kind of Potentials, then I will make kind of a relation between harmonic and elastic potentials. So, Green's function for elastic problems is tensorial fields. It is displacements due to the point force. And because both displacements and the reaction is vectors, then it is a tensor. And as in harmonic problems, there is a notion of a single-layer potential, which is just. Single layer potential, which is just distribution of a source over the surface line, then in elasticity, there is a vector single layer potential, which is distribution of point force over some surface line. This slide you all familiar, it's classical. Um, unfortunately, I u uh supposed to have a different uh file, but it didn't work keynote, so I have some black boxes which Some black boxes, which the properties of harmonic potentials are very well known. Single-layer potential is continuous when surface is approached from both sides. But if we will investigate normal flux, normal flux is a flux via some line or surface characterized by some normal. Then this flux undergoes jump, and if the surface is smooth, then the Is smooth, then the drum conditions of this nature, the free term emerges, and depending on which side we approach the surface, we will have either plus or minus term. Similarly, in elasticity, the theory of elastic potentials and elasticity were developed much later. We have a lot of people representative of the Georgian school, and they all know that it was a group of Viktor Kupradze who started. Viktor Kupradze, who started it in the 1940s, and this culminated in this book, Potential Method and Theory of Elasticity, 1965. So single layer elastic potentials, potential and analog of normal flux in elasticity is traction vector, because tractions are also can be evaluated of some line of surface characterized by normal vector. Characterized by normal vector and displacements are continuous if one approaches the line of surface from both sides and traction undergo jump. But if we would subtract value of traction from one side, from the values of traction from the other side, if material from both sides is the same, we will see that the meaning of this density function is jump interactions. That is why this single That is why this single layer potential is a fantastic tool to solve problems with jump interactions. Double layer potential is similar like in harmonic problems. Double layer potential is kernel double layer potential is actually normal flux via the surface. And the drum conditions for these potential is given by a very well known formula. By very well-known formula, and this free term has different sign minus for one side and plus for another side. Normal flux is continuous over the surface. All this theory of harmonic potentials were developed just to prove existence of solution of Laplace equation, not for numerical purposes. And enormous effort was done that the resulting integral equations would be of red. Integral equations would be of red home type. That is why Liponov developed the theory of Liponov surfaces, etc. In elasticity, double layer potential, remember in the harmonic problem we had flux via the surface. Here we have a little bit, it is traction because traction operator is analog of a flux. But here we have a switch in indexes i and j and xi and x. J and xi and x, and physical meaning is a combination of various force dipoles with moment or without moment. The property of double air potentials similar as those for double air potential in harmonic problem, it is discontinuous across the surface. But if again we subtract the value from one side from the value of another side, we can see. Of another side, we can see that the density function has a meaning and drop-with displacement. So, if you want to model problems with drumpling displacements, it's too good to use a double-layered potential. Fractions are always continuous. And the problem why theory of elastic potentials also developed to prove existence of solutions for the boundary value problem of elasticity was that all besides single-layer potential. Besides single layer potential, all the remaining equations are either singular or hypersingular. That is why the theory was created much later. Okay, of course, we can solve in two dimensions. We can solve elasticity problem by using calls of Mossili-Shvili formula. And probably we can, using this idea of distributed force, we can create another complex analog of layer potential. Layer potential. But another way of doing it is just to perform some algebraic manipulations. We can start, for example, from single-layer potential with jump interactions and do various complex combinations, transformation formula, and we arrive at this representation of single-layer potential, absolutely in complex form. And it has only two kernels, very simple. Kernels, very simple kernels, and we can also evaluate tractions, and tractions also involve the same kernels. This is work I did in collaboration with Alex Lingov long, long ago. The same is for problems with displacement jumps. We can also create various complex combinations, and at the end, we will obtain complex displacements and complex tractions. And complex tractions which are related to the double layer elastic potentials. If we have problems dropped with two fields, we can always combine this double and single layer potential. This is more famous combination, which is Semilian displacement identity, which is an analog of Green's formula for harmonic problems, which is an involved combination of single and double layer potential. And knowing this displacement using regular This displacement using regular chain, we can apply arrive to the equation for tractions. And it also can be written in a complex form. So now we have all these instruments for solving problem with discontinuity in the fields. And I will show you a few applications. One application is three-dimensional. It is done in collaboration with my former PG student Vitrinikolsky and some other people. And it is modeling of And it is modeling of fractures and in sometimes near borehole, etc. But I'll give you just a brief description of the technique where we introduced a little bit new twist based on complex analysis. So, I consider more general case when we have both potentials, single layer and double layer, and we have traction. And we have traction identity, and we can even have body forces if we want to involve complex physical processes. And our numerical approach was new because it involved complex analysis. So in fact, it was surprising that complex variables work fantastic for solution of three-dimensional problems. The feature of this approach was to use complex variables to represent in plane elastic fields and also. Elastic fields and also geometrical parameters. And with that, a very efficient technique to solve integrals involved approximation is polynomials. So this is the combination. So we used planar triangle elements. For the point on the plane, we introduced complex combination for the fields. And like this is complex traction, complex displacement, complex normal, complex point. And in the third direction, it was. And in the third direction, it was just H is a scalar. What happened? If we look at the structure of integrals involved, the use of complex variables allows significantly reduced number of integrals involved because a lot of integrals would be just complex combination of the integrals on the right-hand side. All these integrals due to these kernels. However, moreover, all the integrals belong. All the integrals below, there are various derivatives of just one integral over this scalar h. So it is very efficient. So one needs to evaluate just one integral. And this integral of that type. And for this integral, we use Alcachi-Pampere formula, which allows to reduce integration of the area to integration of the surface. And because the contour in our case, because we have To control in our case, because we have a triangle, then we have a straight line. And on this line, tau and tau conjugated are expressed by rational relations. And if one uses polynomial approximations, only all integrals are evaluated analytically. So, this technique allows to evaluate stresses at any point, or all fields, in fact. And I will just show you one example where we have. Show you one example where we have two coaxial cylindrical cracks. We took the high aspect ratio in order to look at the central section and compare solution with known solution for plane strain problem where you have two circular cracks. And indeed, we were able using, you could see that constant approximation was not really good, but increasing order of approximation, we were able to approach. approach solution for two-dimensional problem. It's of course also arbitrary because we have infinite, I mean we have just finite size in this direction. Now I will switch to other application of complex potentials. Yeah, I forgot to say that for solving this problem we used either similar identity or if you have cracks Identity, or if we have cracks, we use double air potential. Now, for composite for problems which I described, we have mostly jump interactions because we wanted, I mean, you could have various jumps as I explained this classification. But this example is focused on our recent work with Anna and Julian Hankhos here, when we have a very thin reinforcement or thin layers. Or thin layers, which are very stiff. Then displacements are continuous, but fraction undergoes jump. Moreover, these layers are not closed layers, not like shown here, but rather have a boundary. So we need to address steep conditions as well. And to model these materials, we used theory of material surfaces. Gennady a little bit introduced, talked about the Gorton-Murdock model, but there is another model developed by. Another model developed by Steigman Ogden. This model models as thin layers as distinct surface, which has its own elastic properties and also surface tension. And the complete boundary value problem consists of bulk Navier equation for bulk material. Displacement are continuous across this thin. Across this thin reinforcement. They are continuous, but traction undergoes a jump. And in addition, if you have tip, we have tip conditions. These tip conditions are just manifestation of equilibrium of total problem. So it's equilibrium of forces and moments. To see better how this boundary value of problem looks like, what drum conditions look like, we resort to planned strain case. Resort to planned strain case with split displacement to tangential and normal component. Stress tensor, we can disregard this term because it's in a different direction. Stress tensor has two components, sigma s and omega s. These stress components are expressed via various derivatives of displacement of the first order. And if we substitute to drum conditions of the Gortian-Mordech model, Conditions of the Gortian-Mordech model, we can see that boundary conditions contain derivative of displacement up to the second order. Steigman-Ogden model is more sophisticated. Here we have drum conditions which contain derivative of the displacement to the fourth order. So, to solve these problems, we can involve this single-layer elastic potential, which gives us jump interactions. And because the problem is two-dimensional, we can involve. Because the problem is two-dimensional, we can involve employ complex integral representations. So components of surface stress tensor, sigma s and omega s, can be expressed as combinations of real part of u prime and imaginary part of u prime, which u prime is a derivative over the surface. It's not complex derivative, but derivative over the curve, I'm sorry. Or the curve, I'm sorry. So, if we start with the representation for the single-layer potential and evaluate this derivative, we get an expression for omega prime. And by substituting this expression, we can obtain sigma s and omega s. And taking the limit, it can be shown that this derivative is continuous when one approaches the surface. We obtain the boundary integral equation. Let's look for. Let's look for simple cases. For example, we have this surface along a line, surface which is like a thin layer. We can dimensionalize involved parameters, like surface stress, pre-stress, this elastic parameter, all geometrical parameters, all stress components, and from the manipulation with the single-layer elastic potential. Single layer elastic potentials, we obtain the coupled system of real variables because we separate real and imaginary part because sigma s and omega s are real scalars, decoupled system of hypersingular equation. Interesting case is when this layer is very stiff, so μ s and lambda s tends to infinity, then gamma tends to zero. And gamma tends to zero, and we could retrieve this particular case which is very well known, it's called rigid stiffener, for which analytical solution exists. A more complex case is a complex case of circular arc, for example, there are curvature is involved. In this case, parametrization is a little bit different, dimensionalization, what I mean. And boundary integral equations are coupled. Now, sigma s and omega s are involved. Sigma s and omega s are involved in the same equation. But for the Steigman-Ogden problem, it's also a similar system, but instead of omega s, we have this expression involved. To solve these equations, we need to use the problem with the hypersingular equation is that the density should be very smooth, so it cannot be just continuous, so you cannot use. Cannot use regular numerical technique like boundary element method, you need to use lines. So we used global approximation when we approximated sigma s and omega s straight segment by series of Chiboshov polynomials of second kind. And for steigma-nogden, we approximated by the same series, but instead of omega-s, we approximated this combination. And because we have this weight function, And because we have these weight functions, our tip conditions either were automatically satisfied. In the case of Gorten-Murdack problem for Steigman-Ogden model, some of them were automatically satisfied, but some were used to define unknown constant, which resulted from solution of differential equation. So, for circular approximation, is more complex, we approximated by series of Of trigonometric functions, also multiplied by square root functions. And again, this approximation allowed us to automatically satisfy the tip conditions. Because we use this approximation, we had to evaluate a bunch of integrals. Most of them were regular, which could be evaluated by typical formula Gaussian quadratic. Gaussian quadratures, but there was a bunch of singular integrals because you could see that one minus cosine to t is has singularity. And these integrals were evaluated by subtracting and adding a part. And this is hyper singular integral, which can be evaluated analytically. This is singular integral, this is singular integral, but those we decompose in series subst-eliminated dimensions. Substitute eliminated divergent part and use Gaussian evaluation. These techniques can be extended to solve problems with multiple reinforcement, for example, multiple surfaces along straight elements, as shown here. Here, it's also unlike the case of straight segment, which led to decoupled equation. Here they would. To decoupled equation here, they would be coupled because of interactions. I don't present it. Unfortunately, I cannot show you because I wanted to use keynote. I had an animation here when you can see that when two surfaces get closer, how stress fields look. So, we looked at various configurations of collinear-oriented cracks, and here you can have distributions of omega s, sigma s, I'm sorry. Sigma S, I'm sorry, for various values of parameters. We did also parallel configurations and we use epoxy matrix with graphene oxide sheets, but we got parameters from some literature. Also, more complex configuration when you have various loadings, various arrangements. Loadings, various arrangements. So, these problems all can be effectively solved with this complex variables technique based on a single layer potential. The interesting outcome which surprised us was when we studied the case of circular arc, and we knew that for straight line, if we increase the stiffness of the layer, we will extract. Obtain case of rigid line. So we found a solution for rigid circular arc, but our solution was never reducible to this one. First, we were thinking we have a mistake, so we're trying to fix this mistake. But eventually, we found out that was the paper we use stress distribution that region, but eventually what we found out that Gurti-Murdak problem. Uh, Gurti-Murdek problem never reducible to rigid arg because, of, if you remember this classification of Benwinist and Miller, then conditions, drum conditions of Gortian-Mordech model are never reducible to rigid because rigid is the very end in this classification. So it's a completely different type of boundary value problem. While for Gurtin past. For Gortin Pasteman-Ogden model. So that was Gortin-Murdak model. Black one was rigid. And eventually, for Steigman-Ogden, we can approach a rigid solution, but we really never did it. This is for jump in normal traction. For jumps in tangential, it seems that more or less with increasing rigidity. Rigidity, elastic rigidity, and bending parameters we can mimic. And I'm about to finish. I have to conclude that many important problem of fracture mechanics, mechanics of composites can be modeled at elasticity problem with jump conditions. And potentials are a perfect modeling tool, and you can. Then you can adjust appropriate potential based on what type of jump condition one has. I presented everything for the case of an isotropic case, but this could be generalized for anisotropic case by using appropriate fundamental solution. You can also alter fundamental solution to simulate a case of half-plane, bonded half-planes, elastic. Half-planes, elastic potential is the same, only Green's function changes. So you can solve a variety of problems. And the example, and in two-dimensional, we all know well that complex variables could be very beneficial. And examples, I presented just two examples just to demonstrate capability of the method. And in conclusion, I already acknowledged some of the collaborators, but multiple line inclusion was. Multiple line inclusion was done by collaboration with my PhD student. I am grateful for NSF support and I make some advertisement. We just published with Steve Crouch a book on boundary element methods, which has this a little bit in more elementary form, this elastic potential. And I'm grateful to John Chapman for being a reviewer of this book. This book just appeared. Of this book, this book just appeared in August. And thank you for your attention.
