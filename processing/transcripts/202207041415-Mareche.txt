First, I'm going to thank the organizers. Thanks for inviting me and for giving me the opportunity to speak. I'm going to tell you about critical digital percolation and key decay constraints of those universality results. It will be the sequence of the talk of I developed this morning. He told you about what's called the universality classification, which means the models can be sorted into Models can be sorted into supercritical, critical, and subcritical. He told you a lot about supercritical models, not that much about sub-critical models, but roughly everything that was known, so we can't say a lot more. And he said, for critical models, that's from Nicaea. Now I'm going to tell you about critical mutual correlation and critical kinetic constraints. and critical kinetically constrained models kinetically constrained models i'm often going to abruptly by kcm it's much shorter to say so it's kcm is just kinetically constrained models also if you have questions please ask them critical bootstrap percolation and kcm it's it can be quite ugly when you go into the details of the definitions so please if you have questions do not hesitate to interrupt me Do not hesitate to interrupt each. First, a few reminders of the talk of this morning. On the whole talk, we're going to stay in dimension two. I also remind you what a stable direction is. You take a direction, U, and you take, hu is the half pane opposite to you in blue on my picture. Well, imagine it's a half pane, an infinite one, part record, an infinite half pane. Parent or pregnant and infant health pain and disorder. To know if you is stable, you feel hence the opposite health pain with infected sites and put healthy sites elsewhere. If you get no new infection, the direction is stable. And it means that the infection cannot propagate in direction u, even if I have a whole half plane. Otherwise, u is unstable. He also told you that the model was He also told you that the model was critical if there is no open semicircle of unstable directions that would make the model supercritical and it's not subcritical and that means that there is an open semicircle with only a finite number of stable directions. I chose to denote the law of the amateur initial configuration mu instead of pi. I did not Instead of pi, I didn't know what he would use there. And the probability of a site to be initially infected, I called it Q rather than PCL. So site initially, the law is new, sites are independently infected with variety Q. The infection time, I will call it Tau Bp for booster percolation. It will be Tau KCM for the KNSCLE constraint model. I prefer to use to write my results with the median tau dt T B T C for example the theorem Ivailo already said he said that for any critical constraint tau is exponential of one of our q to a property a constant and he said that there is a constant such that with high priority tau is above it's a little complicated It's a little complicated, so if you know the notion well, no problem. Imagine instead of CBT, the tau dp, and it will always be valid. Otherwise, just we use the median, it's a good indicator of the size of T tau E D. Are there questions yet? So now I'm going to go to the interesting part. To go to the interesting part, that was the theorem Evaluated of Bolivar, Smith, and Musel. It's not very precise. It gives the behavior of critical booster preparation, but it's not very precise. And I'm going to tell you more precise things. But in order to do that, I need to introduce quite complex definitions. So if you have questions, please interrupt me. The first definition is called the difficulty, or rather, the difficulty of a direction. Yes, the difficulty actually is quite difficult to grasp. So take a direction u, in difficulty AU will be first if the direction is unstable, the difficulty is 0. If it is stable and belongs to an interval of stable direction, I say the difficulty is infinite. I say the difficulty is infinite. It can also be stable and not in an interval of stable directions. Then believe me, it's always isolated. No fancy, complicated things. Either it's an interval, it's in an interval or it's isolated. And if it's isolated, well, remember that when you have the half-plane opposite to you that's infected, you get no new infection. But maybe if you add a few more. But maybe if you add a few more infected sites, you can get creation of infections. Actually, the difficulty of you is the smallest number of sites you have to add. So you have an infinite number of new infections that get created. Are there questions about it? Yes? So you could use that last definition for directions that block. Directions that belong to an interval of stable directions, right? Yes, actually, the third definition is also right for the two other cases. Other questions? I think it fails a bit on saying isolated statement. Yeah, that's true, but don't make things. Don't make things even more difficult because now you're going to see the difficulty of a constraint, of a model. For any open semicircle, we said the difficulty of the semicircle, I write it alpha c, is the maximum of the difficulties of all directions in the semicircle. And then the difficulty of a constraint that I call alpha is the minimum of all difficulties of all of the constraints. Of all difficulties of all open semicircles. An example, right now, a model, the picture of a difficult, this picture of stable directions. So here the red ones are the stable ones and the white with a black outline the unstable ones. So this is the picture of a natural model that's called the dwarfy model and that I developed. So here I have an interval of stable directions with infinite difficulty because it's an interval. I have unstable directions, they have difficulty zero. I have an isolated stable direction, it has difficulty, something else. Hey, it's one. How do I get the difficulty of the model? I look at the difficulty of the semicircles. If I have a semicircle that's not a semicircle on the right, it intersects. Circle on the right, it intersects the semicircle on the left, and so gets directions with infinite difficulties. And so, the difficulty of the semicircle sitting in the back of the difficulty of the directions is infinite. If I am not the right semicircle, if I am the right semicircle, then I get directions with difficulty zero or one. So, the difficulty of the semicircle is one. Now, the difficulty of the model is the minimum. Of the model is the minimum of on all semicircles, so minimum of infinity and one is just one. Now I can state the result. The result of Bulgar's Mini Kapal Morris and Schmidt is that for any critical constraint, T D P is exponential of one of our periQ to the power of a constant, but we know the constant. Remember the constant. It's alpha PC and O1. I wrote when Q tends to zero. I could have written when Q tends to PC, but actually PC is zero for critical models, Evaluo told you. So we are indeed at PC. Are there questions after now? I'm going to give you a heuristics. Why do we have that? Remember, Remember, alpha is the minimum of the difficulties of the solar circles, which means that each cell circle has difficulty bigger than alpha, and so has a direction with difficulty bigger than alpha. And so this implies that there exists a set of directions of difficulty bigger than alpha whose convex envelope contains the origin. Besides the multi picture, I have three directions of decisive. I have three directions of decification alpha. They're endpoints from a triangle that contains the original. Actually, you can try it. If you can't find such a picture with either three or four sable directions, then necessarily you will get an open semi-circle without direction alphabetically bigger than alpha. Either you trust me or try, but it's true. And so, what do I do with such a picture? Let's say. Let's say I have an initial set of indetectals. With the interjection, go bottom the horizontal line. We need to go below. Well, the dormal direction is stable. So even if I have a whole height plane above the horizontal line, I won't get new infections. And here I have much less than the height plane. So no new infection. But wait, but not the only. But well, not below the horizontal line actually. And since I have two other stable directions here, I can do the same with them. The infection won't go to the left of the vertical line and it won't go to the top of the diagonal line. It's stuck in the triangle. So it's stuck in a relatively narrow space. If everything is healthy. If everything is healthy otherwise. But management configuration is not healthy everywhere else. There are infected sites, a sites infected with rabbits. And so, what will happen? Remember, the downward direction has difficulty bigger than alpha. So, if I have, if I want to propagate significantly the infection, I need to find a group of alpha sites if I want to propagate. Ather sites, if I want to propagate the infection in the downward direction. Is that right? So I need to find the group of alpha-infected sites near the horizontal line or any of the other lines since all directions have the t bigger than alpha. And if I want to find a group of alpha ejected sites, I need my triangle to have size roughly one group. To have size relatively one aggressive to the power alpha because a graph of alpha integrated size has priority q to the power alpha. And so if I want one, I will find it on the size of one over q to above alpha. So my initial group of infections have to have the size of one of our cubes above alpha if I want to propagate the infection from it. Other questions, Anita? It's very important to ask. It's very important to ask them. It's not easy, but she came. It's hard to fitting name. So if I have a group of infected sites of size 1 over 2 alpha, I will be able to propagate the infection, let's say, to the right. It's one privileged direction, not necessarily the right, but in this talk I will always say it's the right. It actually depends on the model. But it's easier to say it's always the right. Easier to say it's always the right. So, how will the region get infected? Well, somewhere at the left of the region, there is an initial group of one of our QFI infected sites. And then from this initial group, the infection, we reach the region. How long does it take? The infection travels roughly at constant speed, so the time it takes is roughly the distance from the initial block to the From the initial block to the original. And this distance is roughly one over the probability that a given block is infected at. The distance to the nearest block is roughly one over the probabilities. So I guess that the time it takes to infect the origin is one over the probability of the block to be infected. Just compute this priority and it will be fine, but this priority is q to the both the size of the block, one over q. top the size of the block one over q alpha so it's roughly expansion of minus q one over q alpha if it takes a one so t one over t is expansion of one over q to the alpha decided o1 which extends the scale are there questions about good source operation so let's go to scale constraint models k7 i wrote the infection time in k7 i write The infection time in KCM, I guarantee tau KCM. Actually, the expectation of tau KCM is always as easy as big as TD, the infection time before bootstrap percolation, when technically it's media transfer thing, the infection time. It's as less as big as the infection time in bootstrap perpetration. Because if I can infect the site of the kinetic L constraint model, its constraint was satisfied. So bootstrap perpetration would have infected. So bootstrap preparation would have infected it with variety one. So in shape I can inject something in the KCM, I will inject it in the bootstrap, hence the infection won't propagate much more quickly in the KCM than in the bootstrap part. So I always have this lower bound. The expectation of tau KCM is at least on the order of T. T I know it. So I get the expectation of tau KCN. expectation of tau kcn it's at least expansion of one over q at right reset all one that's nice but that's only a lower bound it doesn't admit if it's the right behavior and we already saw for super critical models that behaviors even if it's the same behavior in button corporation behaviors could differ in the case and it will be the same here sometimes it will behave like a button and sometimes not Booster and sometimes not. So I have two possibilities. So instead of one class as in Boustral percolation, one universality class, the critical one, I have two classes. Believe me, if the constraint has a finite number of silver directions, the expectation of tau kcm is exponential of one over q alpha plus third O1. So same behavioral construct. So same behavior as a construct. And otherwise, if there is an infinite number of stable directions, the expectation of tau k stn is exponential of one verb q so goes two alpha to stable one instead of alpha as input sharp. Well, so it's a divergence that's much sharper. So the proofs for a finite number of stable directions, we didn't have to work for the lower bound, it was the one of them to start. The upper bound. The upper bound was due to, well, they're all here, everyone is here, so it's due to Ilaio, Christina and Fagio. The upper bound for an infinite number of stable directions is Fagio Romoris and Christina. And the lower bound for an infinite number of stable directions, I did it with Flavio and Christina. Well, yes, I want always to. Always turning initially. It's always fissing up, but I think there is not a lot of that. So, why do we have such a difference? I told you that in bootstrap corporation, when you have a block of 100 Q alpha sites, it can propagate infection to the right. So, it can put infection in a near-identical block on its right. That's true in two. That's true in the bootstrap procreation, hence that's also true in the KCM, because everything I can infect in the bootstrap proportion has its constraints at the side, and so I can also infect it in the KCM. So in the KCM, if I have a block here, I can put a block on the right. And now there are two possibilities. Either the constraints are such that I can heal the infection on the block on the left. On the block on the left and remove it all the way around. And when I have two blocks, the block on the left, it stays here. What? What's that? The computer would let me talk. So, believe me, if there is a finite number of stable directions, Number of stable direction, it's possible to heal the zero of the infections. Sorry, sometimes I say zero instead of infection. So I will try to say infections as much as possible. But if I say zero, it's the same. So believe me, if I have a finite number of stable directions, it's possible to read the infections of the block of the net. That's not easy to understand why, but I'm going to give you some explanations later. And then there is a block of infections somewhere at the left of the origin. I can put infections on the right, a block on the right. No, I can heal the block on the left. And that's as if I make a step to the right. And I take continuum, heal. Oh, sorry, first infect the blood on the right, then heal the blood on the left, infect the blood on the right, heal the blood on the left. On the right, he's the blood on the left, in fact, the blood on the right, etc., etc., and he reached the origin. And there, I think you may notice that it resembles something we saw this morning with what Eliot called one neighbor kinetically constrained models. And that's also called FA1F for Freylexon and Daxon when it's been facilitated. Since I did not know how he would call it, I always wrote FA1F. And I was able to infect the regime by going through configurations which had only two blocks of zeros. Configurations that had roughly priority, the gravity of two blocks, so the gravity of a block squared. Before going through a configuration which has such a priority, it takes roughly a time that one above the probability, so one above the probability of a block squared. probability of a block squared. I wrote probability of a block squared, the probability of the configurations. I wrote it was an energy barrier because it's within a barrier for the dynamics. Before reaching the point where the origin is infected, it has to go through a barrier where a configuration which has no probability, which prevents the dynamics from entering it for some time. And that means that the expectation of terror caseme here is one of our probability of block squared because of the alpha mechanism. And the probability of block, we know it is exponential minus one over Q alpha plus third O1. So when you make the constitutions, you get the exponential of one over Q alpha plus third O1. And that's why you get such a scale. So that's when that. So that's when there is a finite number of stable directions. But if there is an infinite number of stable directions, it's not possible to hit the block on the left. What you can do is when you have one block put the block on the right, and clinically constraint models are reversible. Because if I infect a site, the constraints are satisfied, so I can also heal it. Every move I can do, I can undo it. I can do, I can undo it. So, since I am able to infect a block on the right, I am also able to heal a block on the right. So, what I can do is, if I have a block on the left, put or remove a block on the right. And that sort of certain thing you should recognize because it's the same rule as the east rule. So, the block has a least dynamic. Well, it's a heuristic, it's not exactly true, but the heuristics. But the heuristics give the right idea. And as this morning, for the dynamics to cross a certain distance, we have to use a number of blocks that rotate the log of the distance. Because if you have n blocks, you can go to distance two to the power n. So when I have to cross the log of, when I have to When I have to cross the distance between the origin and the closest initial block, as I have, I mean a number of blocks, that's log of this distance. So it's log of the distance between the origin of the closest initial block that I need. That is the number of blocks I need. And this distance, I know it's one about the probability of a block. So I need n blocks where n is one about the priority of a block. Is one above the priority of a block. So I have to go through configurations that have priority of a block to the core M. And the time it takes to go through configurations that have such a small priority here is one number of the it's making things hard for me. So the if he doesn't like people. So, the time it takes to go through a configuration with such a private decision, it's one about the probability. So, the expectation of logic m is one about probability of a block to the core. Hence, what about the probability of a block to the core, another one about the probability of a block? Not very nice, but if you do the computations, you do get the expansion of one over q to the world, two and five is taken over one. Other questions? You understand everything? Wonderful because it's going to get harder. That's also nice and interesting results. But actually, the good circle creation theorists obtain something more, more precise. I told you. I told you expansion that TBT was expansion at one over Q alpha plus is the one, but they got more precise results. And to give to you, I need more complicated definitions, of course. So these reprocolation models, a critical one at least, are called balanced if there is a closed semicircle in which direction the difficulty is smaller than alpha. Smaller than alpha. There is always an open semicircle in which direction has difficulty smaller than alpha. That's the definition of the difficulty, the minimum of the difficulty of the semicircles, the open semicircles. But the closed semicircle with difficulty smaller than alpha is not always the case. It would be much better if I could see the whole slide, because here I wrote what the models were. And you can't see it because you are yes, it's not that the screen that you chromize. Yes, that's that's not me. That's not given on your side. That is not metal. Ah, yes. Yeah, much better. That doesn't mean there are too much too many things on my side, so Too many things on my size. So, the dwarf the mobile, which we already met, has this difficulty picture, and I told you the difficulty was one. Is there a closed semicircle in which direction the difficulties were than one? Well, if you take anything else than the right semicircle, it's not, because we intersect the region of difficulties. And look at the right semicircle. Look at the right, Mr. Ko. Actually, the unstable directions are open regions. Ivano told you, I also tell you, the unstable directions are open regions. So the vertical directions are both in the region with infinite difficulties. So we know that even the right closed circle has infinite difficulties. So, no close semicircle with difficulty one or less. So, the dwarf model is unbalanced. If it's not the case, if there is a closed semicircle in which the election has difficulty smaller than alpha, one example is the L82S model, which you know, there you saw the constraints this morning. Constraints this morning. Believe me, the difficult picture is this one. Then, any semicircle you take has difficulties more than one. Closed, open, everything you want. And the difficulty of the model itself, it will be one precisely because all open submicirons are difficult to one. So, FA to F is balanced. And now that I gave my definitions, maybe, but just maybe, I can tell you the results, the complete results of Berber essentially. They prove that if the constraint is balanced, T V T is the exponential of one over Q to the power alpha, no plus little power one, just alpha. And if the models are unbalanced, T V T is the balance of the balance. are unbalanced, similar to this expansion of 1 over q alpha log of 1 over q squared. So actually, critical models, if you look at the logarithms, you see two universality classes, not just one, they're actually two. And you can also see that it's not the same partition as the one you found for we found for pre-treated teleconstrain models. Models palette can have a mean fit or a finite number of stable directions. Finite number of stable directions. And same for unbalanced models. So the questions: if they have logarithmic precision for bootstrapper creation, can we also have good logarithmic precision for KC and not? And what will it give us? Are there questions for all? So let's see. Let's see. Let's see first model with an infinite number of stable directions. I told you the expectation of stole KCN is one of our cube number to LFL O1, always. When we go to logarithmic precision, we get two possibilities. Either the models are balanced, and the expectation of third-gase is the expensure of one approach of 2 alpha, no little O1, or the models are unbalanced, so the expensure of third-party 1. Here I would say that's not a big surprise because it's the same partition than in bootstrap percolation. As for the proofs, the upper bound for unbalanced, we would use the one that The one that already worked for all models in an infinite number of stable directions, the one of Fabio, Antonis, and 50 knots. The proof for balanced models, the upper bound is due to Ivai-Loch. Ivailo did a big paper, really big paper. Something like 70 pages I got, where it proved a lot of meaningful programs with regular precision. So it's this paper and the lower bounds. I improved them with Eli Lautou. Also, it was a paper with all the lower bounds with algorithmic precision. For balance model, we could have used the proof that almost was there for all models with an infinite number of stable directions, but actually it gives us total. Actually, it gives us two proofs that's better than one. So, why do we have that? In our talk conduction, I'm first going to give you the heuristics for logarithms with booster preparation. I told you that when I have an initial set of infected sites of size 1 over Q alpha, I can propagate the infection. The infection. I was not very precise. Actually, you don't need a block of size one over Q alpha full of zeros. You need a structure. It looks a little like what Veio told you this morning about FA2F. But this structure is quite hard to draw, so here I drew it with. To draw, so here I drew it with hinges, it's not really hinges. The thing that is really important is there need to be enough infected sites in the structure correctly organized to be able to infect the whole block of one of our QI alpha infected sites and from the whole block to be able to infect anything. The structure is not the same if we are in balance or unbalanced. we are in balanced or unbalanced families. For balanced families, the structure with quality one over expansion of minus one over q alpha is enough. And so T, it's one about the quality of the structure. It's expansion of one over Q alpha. For all balance challenges, the difficulties are a little higher, at the words. Infections propagate less well. So we need more infections. So we need more infected sites in the initial structure zeros of infections. And the probability of a structure is thus a little smaller. Exponential of minus one over Q alpha log of one over Q squared. So T is one above this probability. Exponential F one over Q fine log of one over Q squared. Actually, for kinetic constraint models, it's the same problem. Is the same problem. I told you the blocks full of youth had this dynamics. It's actually the structures. So I had a formula for the expectation of logic CM, one over probability of a block to the one over the probability of a block. Just telling the probability of a structure inside of a block. And move on. So for balance studies, the probability of a structure is exponential of minus one over q alpha. of minus one over q alpha hence when you do the computation the expectation of third case m is the exponential of one over q alpha without logs because there are no logs in the probability of a structure in the second case unbelievable means the probability of a structure is expensive of minus one over q alpha log of one over q square and when you do the computations it gives you expectation of topic is one over q to the power of two alpha log of one over q to the power of four. Of an appropriate work for so, as I said, it was not a big surprise. It's not, well, once we understood how it worked in an infinite number of stable directions, the passage to logarithmic precision did not give us a lot of new things. What will happen for models with a finite number of several directions? Will we have the same Have the same classic subdivision between balanced and unbalanced. Well, I think you know that if I ask the question, the answer will probably be no. If I have models with a finite number of stable directions, I need to introduce another definition I want to understand. It's called rooted and unrooted. It's not the same thing as rooted and unrooted for separate critical models. It's the same idea, but it's not the same definition. A critical constraint will be called rooted if there are not two opposite directions of difficulty strictly given alpha. Otherwise, it's unwitting. Then, if I take a KCM with a finite number of stable With a finite number of stable directions, and that's also unbalanced, it can be either unrouted or rooted. If it's unrouted, are there questions maybe? That could be. I think it's quite complicated. If it's unrouted, the expectation of top KCM is expensive of one over Q, alpha log of one over Q squared. Then it's the same behavior as bootstrap corporation. Behavior as bootstrap percolation because for unbalanced models, that's the behavior of bootstrap percolation. But if the models are rooted, the divergence is just a bit faster. It's expensive of 1 over q fn over power of log of 1 over q, so 3 and not 2. So the upper bounds for routine models, we could use the upper bounds of Elio, Fabio and Crystal. Crystal that's that works for all models with a finite number of stable directions. The outer upper bound is due to evaluation. For the lower bounds, the bootstrapper percolation lower bound here is enough, so nothing to do. For routine models, it's in the paper I deal with ILO with all the logarithmic lower bounds. Now I'm going to tell you why we have such a distinction, if I can. If I can, we didn't have such a distinction for an infinite number of stable directions. But here, what happens? I told you, if I have a block full of zeros, it can put the infection on the right, and especially with a finite number of cyber directions, it can heal the infections on the block of the left. The inflections on the block of the left. First thing, if I need to understood the logarithmic precision, instead of the block, I need to look at the structures. If I have two structures, I can read the detections on the structure the next. I see Laiota looking at me. I no, I'm not going to d go into the much d into the all the details of the CSM or anything. Details of the C step or anything. I'm going to give you something quite basic that's already hard enough, I think. And that's heuristics. So if I say things that are wrong, it's for the sake of explanation. So first thing, we look at other resemblance. Here I have a very sad. Here I have a grace, a grain cycle. Green means that I don't know the difficulties of the directions yet. It's a critical model, so it has an open survey cycle with difficulties smaller than alpha. Here I draw it from green. I hope you see great difference. Greens means all the difficulties are smaller than alpha. I know that the model is unbalanced, so there is no closed semicircle. So there is no closed semicircle with difficulty smaller than alpha. So at least one of the extremities of the green semicircle has difficulty bigger than alpha. I draw it in black, bigger than alpha. Actually, if the other extremity doesn't have a difficulty smaller than alpha, I would have a little more than the semicircle that's difficult smaller than alpha. If you want no closed semicircle with difficult close semicircle with difficulty smaller than alpha you need to have both extremities that have difficulty bigger than alpha so that's because the model is unbalanced now i also said that it's unroutine so no non opposite directions have difficulty bigger than alpha that means that all directions here have to have difficulty smaller than alpha so they are green So they are green. And what do I see? I see two semicircles with difficulty smaller than alpha. The semicircle on the right that allows to propagate the infection on the right, but there is also a semicircle on the left. And the semicircle on the left will allow to propagate the infection on the left, just as well as it does on the right. So when I have a structure of infections, I can put Functions, I can put an identical structure on the left. And as I said, KCMs are reverse slope. Every time I infect something, I can also heal it. So I can remove when I, so it means that when I have two structures, I can heal the infection of the structure on the left. So I can heal the infections of the structure on the left without too much trouble. And so the mechanism that I told you was called FFMF by putting by making by structure forcing my group to do steps on the right, it works, no problem. And so the expectation of calcul is one probability of a structure squared given by the F-1F mechanism, since the probability of a structure. Since the probability of a structure is exponential at minus one over Q alpha log of one over Q squared, when you put it in the formula, you get expectation of del KCN is one over Q alpha log of one over Q squared. Are there questions? Because now I go to the hard case. The hard case is the rooted one. It's still unbalanced. It's still unbalanced, so you have this picture for the difficulties. But no, it's rooted, so there are no opposite directions and difficulties strictly bigger than alpha. The vertical ones are opposite, so I need another direction with difficulty bigger than alpha. Somewhere I put it on zero, on the right. It has to be on the left sonic hole because on the right, it's all difficulty smaller than alpha. And so how can I leave the infection on the left? Since it's reversible, it's the same question as how can I propagate the infection on the left. I know how to propagate the infection on the right form. If I have a structure, I can propagate the infection on the right. On the left, it will be harder, but there is the mechanism. I hope the upward direction has difficulty strictly bigger than alpha. Let's call it beta. The male structure has size roughly 1 over Q alpha. So there is no group of beta infected sites near the structure. And it's the group of beta infected sites, I can also only find it on the scale of one over q or beta, much bigger than the scale of the structure. Much bigger than the scale of a structure. So there isn't one close to the structure, but maybe there will be one on the right. Well, not maybe, there will be one on the right above. And this is not roughly one of our key words. And what I'm going to do, since I can propagate the structure to the right, I can propagate with this mechanism. Putting a structure on the right, putting the structure on the right, now removing the structure on the set. Now removing the structure in the center, which I can do since the central structure has a structure in the center. And putting the structure on the right, etc. Until I reach the detailed sites. Normally they're much farther, but it has that control. And now that I'm here, what do I do? The outward direction and difficulty data, that means that if I have a whole half plane of Half plane of infected sites plus beta infected sites, the infection will propagate. Here I don't have a whole half plane, but I have the top of my structure. Locally, it resembles the half pane of infections. More or less. And since it resembles the whole half pane of infection, I can propagate the infection along the top of my structure also. So now the ACMs are reversible. So if from beta size I can propagate the infection, then I can heal the infection as long as I leave beta sex. So I heal the infection, leave an infection here. It's more than beta sex, so I'm clear. Now I'm going to reverse my ETH dynamics. Remove the droplet on the structure of the rad, for example. The right example put back the structure of the center. Now, on the top of my structure, I have more than data sites. So, I propagate the infection. And now I can heal as long as I live at least data sites. So I heal thus. And I continue reversing the East dynamics, removing the structure on the right, removing the structure on the right. The structure on the right. So, what did I do? What I did was propagate the infection a bit to the top. I knew only how to propagate the infection to the right. I know able to propagate it to the top. And with the same mechanism, know that I can propagate it to the top. I can propagate it to the left. But using the same kind of mechanism with local with its dynamics, etc., etc. With this dynamics, etc. etc. But I won't. I can provide the infection to the left node. So I am able to heal the infection on the left. But at what cost? What I have to do? What I have to do is to reach my beta-infected site, I have to do a mist dynamics. On a wide scale, I had to push the distance at what E was one hour Q to beta. One over q to beta. So to pass such a distance, I have to go through a configuration with at least n logs, where n is the log of existence, log of one over q beta. So roughly it's log of one over q. So you can have to go through a configuration with n blocks and with privity, privity of a block power n, so privity of a block, support log of whatever kit. Since the probability Since the probability of a cup, or rather a structure, is exponential of minus 1 over Q alpha log of 1 over Q squared, I get expectation of tel kcm is exponential of 1 over Q alpha log of 1 over 2 squared 3. I get one more log. Are there questions from this routine dynamics? So there is a last case. We need all engineers stable directly. We did all infinite stable directions and we did the finite number of stable directions that were also unbalanced. It remains the case, the finite number of stable directions and balanced. It's a bit more complicated. Here there are not two possibilities, but three here. So, first possibility, no direction of difficulties with filigrama. Then it's called isotropic, and the expectation of the CM is the expansion of one over Q alpha, no longer cool. And then the bootstrap propagation behavior, because we are in the balanced case. In balance case, this is the bootstrap behavior. Second possibility, exactly one direction of difficulty bigger than alpha. Then it's called semi-directed as the expectation of ACA with expansion of one over Q alpha. Exponential of one over Q at half, log of log of one over Q. This log of log of one over Q is quite surprising. It's specific to KC. There is no such thing in booster perforation, no log log. So case. At least two directions of difficulty bigger than alpha. These models are necessarily rooted. I'm going to explain you why later. And the expectation of tau k 10. Here it's expectation of 1 over q alpha. So the upper bounds, they are all due to Evalua. Indeed, a lot of upper bounds. There are a lot of upper bounds to look for. And the lower bounds, I improved them with evaluo, except the upper bounds for isotropic model, which was good, sorry, the lower bound, the lower bound for isotropic model, it was butter preparation lower bounds on the network. Well, no need to work for us. The booster preparation theorist, it's something that like 80 pages of paper. So now I'm going to give you a heuristics and after that I will stop boring. Well, three heuristics because there are three cases. First, the isotropic case. No direction and difficulty still bigger than alpha. So all directions are difficulty smaller than alpha. Than alpha, and you start with alpha both alpha, and you see that there are three circles on the right and on the left with difficulty smaller than alpha. So you can propagate the infection as well on the left and on the right, and actually on the top or the bottom, asever you want. It's wonderful, it works. So, in particular, you can heal the infection of the left without the complications. So, you can do your So you can do your FR1F or one-libre dynamics with your structures without complications. And this gives us the formula expectation of tau KCM is one over probability of a structure squared. We need balanced case. So the probability of a structure is exponential of minus one over Q alpha without closing. Hence, the expectation of L K C M is exponential of one over is extra in shallow one of our cubes the whole alpha without x i'm not saying that it's easy to well i said it's easy and there is there are no problems but i see the people who actually worked on the pro bound the from yuga yes proving it that was hard i earn it no problem so Now let's see the case with at least two directions of difficulty bigger than alpha. I say the model was balanced, so there is a closed semicircle in which direction has difficulty smaller than alpha. So actually I have more than an open semicircle of difficulty smaller than alpha. It's a little more than a full semicircle. And I also said I have And I also said that they have at least two directional difficulty beyond an alpha. They have to be in the remaining gray part. And you see that they cannot be opposite since they are in the gray part. So you have two non-oppositive directions of bigger than alpha. Hence, the model is routine. It's exercise the definition. And to get the scaling, you actually The scaling, you actually use the same mechanism as for multi-models that were unbalanced. You see the heat mechanisms to reach the data sites. You have to do it again. And so you have to do a new dynamics and the scale one over two to the constant. And hence, you get to go through configuration with private the probability of a structure, the log of one over Q. Now the probability of a structure is expansion of minus. of a structure is exponential of minus one over q alpha so the expectation of L K Cn is exponential of one over Q alpha log of one over Q you gain one log because of its dynamics finally for semi-directing models there is exactly one direction of difficulty here than alpha I could say that it's wonderful there is a semicircle and the There is a single circle on the left and a single circle on the right, basically, but it's smaller than I five, and it works. It's true. When you have two structures side by side, you can remove the structure on the left without doing these dynamics with the structures. But it's still a little more complicated than that. You actually have to do an ease dynamics inside the structure itself and not give you the I'm not giving you the details because it's complicated. You have to go through configuration with a bit more infections, with probability expansion of minus one over Q alpha log of log of one over Q and then text boots of such a configuration is exponential of one over Q alpha log of log of one over Q. The inverse of the probability of the configurations. So to conclude, we To conclude, we met a lot of energy barriers at different scales. For solidarity constraints, you saw the ease dynamics was inside the structure. For rooted constraints, you had an ease dynamics locally around the structure on polynomial scale. And for the constraints with an infinite number of stable directions, we have a globally static sum. So, because of this dynamics, of these energy barriers everywhere at different scales, we get a universality classification, classification of behaviors that's much, much more complicated than for bootstrap population. For bootstrap populations with logarithmic procedure, you have two cases. And if you actually count for KCM, you have seven. So, KCMs are much more complicated than operation. I also have a slide for perspectives, but Ilayo already said it all. We have the results in dimension two for now. For higher dimensions, if we want to understand KCL, we first need to understand Bootstrap. Bootstrap was published last spring, so in the future we may be we won't be bored. Thanks, sorry, Johnny.
