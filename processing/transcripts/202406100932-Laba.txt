Okay, thank you very much for the invitation. It's a great pleasure to be here and also it's a new kind of experience to speak in a building named after I station. Okay, so I want to talk about introvert tilings. About integer tilings, and this is going to include my work with several people. I want to give you an overview of the main concepts and definitions. I want to talk about Semmons and work and then finish with a couple of connections to harmonic analysis. Let's start with the basic definition. Let's say that we have a finite set of integers. Finite set of integers. There are also tilants by infinite sets, but I'm not going to go in that direction. So we're given a finite set of integers. We're going to say that A tiles are integers by translations, if we can cover the integers by pairwise disjoint, translates opposite. So for example, if I take two points at, say, 0, 2, that's going to cover the integer. That's going to cover the integers because I can take the set, place a copy of it next to the original copy, so it's going to be 1 and 3, and then I can keep repeating the pattern. Same is going to work for any two element set. If I take the set, let's say 0, 4, 8, Say 048, then I can do the same greedy kind of tiling. So my next copy is going to start here, then here, and then keep repeating that. Or I can also do something different. Observe that this is a complete set of residues, mod 3, and so I can start my copies with 0, plus minus 3, plus minus 6, and so on. And that's also. 6 and so on, and that's also going to be a tile. A set like 0, 1, 3 is not going to tile because there is no way to close the gap at 2. How do we determine whether a set tiles the integers? If I have, let's say, three numbers, and that's especially if it's like three numbers between 0 and 10, then that's easy to figure out by just sort of looking at. By just sort of looking at it and mixing and matching. If I give you a set of, let's say, 30 numbers between 0 and 10,000, then that's going to be a more complicated problem. So we're going to want something that works a little bit more efficiently. Let's start with some reductions. First of all, it's well known that all timings by a finite set are periodic. are periodic. This is due to Newman. And one of the things it does is it reduces the problem of tilings of the integers to tilings of finite signal groups, Zn with addition mod n. How we choose the m is a separate question that I'm going to get to a little bit later. For now we just For now we just need to know that finite groups are a good setting to work. There is another reduction that's due to Covin and Maierbis based on a theorem of Teideman, which says that we might as well assume that m has the same prime factors as the cardinality of a. If I give you any integer tiling, then I can. then I can manipulate it a little bit using Teideman's theorem on dilations and then I get a different tiling where the time factors of m are the same as for a before we continue I want to introduce some basic tools so that we have an appropriate language to talk about all of this. About all of this. We're going to need the Chinese Riemannian theorem so that we can have some geometry. We're going to need mask polynomials and then we're also going to need pseudonymic polynomials. First of all, I'm going to use the Chinese remainder theorem to represent the tilings of the integers as the tilings of multidimensional lens. Tilings of multi-dimensional lattices. If M has a prime factorization like given here, then I can represent Zm as a direct sum of cyclic groups of order PJ and J where the PJ are the prime. The pj are the prime factors of n. And then I can also use an explicit coordinate representation of each point inside n. Geometrically, this is going to be a d-dimensional periodic lattice with multiple scales corresponding to the powers of each prime factor. It's going to be important that the periods in different directions are the powers of distinct primes. Of distinct lines. Here's how we represent numbers in that representation. We pick the directions, we label them with the different prime factors. The picture here shows only one scale in each direction, but additionally you're also going to have multi-scale lattices where here I Lattices where here I add a bunch of fine lines and I do that in every direction. For example, an arithmetic progression like this is going to be represented this way. I left out the last point because that's where the lattice wraps up. This is, as I said, that's kind of like a two-dimensional lattice. These are going to be And these are going to be the kinds of patterns that we're going to look for in tiles. Any tiling of the integers can be lifted to a multi-dimensional tiling along these lines. But we also have to note the periodicity conditions. And that means, for example, that For example, that the correspondence does not quite work in both directions, so given a tiling of a d-dimensional lattice, I cannot always take that and map it back to a tiling of two pictures. In that representation, here are pictures of some tilings with A having two distinct primes. Having two distinct prime factors. Some of them look very regular, almost sort of lattice-like on various scales. Some of them are more messed up. The general principle is that if you try to keep if you keep one of them regular, then you have more freedom to mess up the other one. So these are some examples of how you can do that. Okay, the next tool that we're going to need is cyclomic polynomials. This being a harmonic analysis conference, I'm going to introduce the definition. The S synchronomic polynomial is the unique monic The unique monic irreducible polynomial whose roots are the primitive s roots of unity. In other words, it's the minimal polynomial of e to the 2 pi i over s. An alternative way to define them is using the formula here inductively. So we factorize x to be n minus 1 and see what comes out. We start with x to be 1. We start with x minus 1, that only has one trivial factor, so that's going to be my final one. And then we continue with, let's say, x squared minus 1. That factors into x minus 1 times x plus 1. x minus 1 was phi 1, so x plus 1 is going to be 5. Similar for x cubed minus 1. for x cubed minus 1. I can write it as x minus 1, that was phi 1, times x squared plus x plus 1, so that's going to be phi 2. A slightly more complicated example is x to the 6th minus 1, so I can also factor that. I did it here in two stages. We have phi 1, we have phi 3, and we have phi 2 that we identified previously. So that last one there is going to be 5, 6. And then you can continue with that. I'm also going to need to define mask polynomials. If A is a finite set of integers, by translational invariance I can assume that all of them are between are non-negative, and then I can define the polynomials a of x and b of x. a of x and b of x as shown. Then my timing condition is going to be equivalent to saying that the product a of x, b of x is equal to this mod x to the n minus 1. That's by just multiplying the two polynomials and looking at the exponents. And then an equivalent way to say that in terms of polynomials is that the cardinalities multiplied to m. And also that each of those synchrotronic things with s different from 1 divides at least one of A and B. Each of them has to divide this, so it's somewhere in there, and because they are all irreducible, they have to divide either A or both. There are conditions for tiling that were proposed. for tiling that were proposed by Coven and Mayerohins about 25 years ago now. I'm not actually going to state those conditions because they are a little bit technical and this is the first time you see them. But a short description is as follows. The first one is a relatively simple counting condition. It basically says that the second part of the sentence here is Of the sentence here is compatible with the first part of the sentence. The second condition is deeper. It really goes into the structure of the timing and it's equivalent to saying that each of the factors in the timing separately can be replaced by one of those nice lattice-like tiles that I showed you before. So if A tiles with some possibly complicated tiling complement, then it also is supposed to tile with a very nice lattice-like complement that can be constructed as this. They proved that T1 holds for all tiles and that T2 holds for tiles whose cardinality has at most two distinct prime factors. Prime factors. And they also prove that if those two conditions are satisfied, then you do have a tile. The conjecture that T2 holds for all finite tiles has become known as the Covin-Mayor conjecture. They did not actually conjecture that in the paper. They kind of wrote it carefully so as to avoid doing that. doing that. But that's what people have been calling it anyway. And that has kind of become the main open problem in the theory of integral times. Let me just give you an example of how those conditions are supposed to work. In the first example, we assume that phi2, phi3 divided a. These are those simple polynomials that I showed you previously. And let's also assume that a has no other prime powers of. has no other prime powers for functional equations. Then those two conditions say that A tiles the integers if and only if A has prime value 6 and phi 6 divides A. In other words, if you try to figure out what this actually means, it means that A should be a complete set of residence muscles. And that's proved in the common Mayo display. In my second example, I'm going to add second example I'm going to add a 55 to that so now I have three of them again let's assume we have no other prime powered silotonizers then the T1 and T2 conditions say that if A tile set then you should have something similar A should be a complete set of residence models and that we do not what we can prove and this is joint work with Tai Long and this is joint work with Thai Londoner, is that there is a result like that if we make assumptions on the cardinalities of both A and B. So if n, the time period is a product of three distinct primes squared, three primes and two scales. That's the simplest case that cannot be reduced to the two prime case. To the two prime case using methods that go back to Covin and Mayorowitz, then A and B both have to satisfy it. In addition to that, we basically have a classification of all timings of that period. Some of our methods extend to more general timings. There are some basic definitions and concepts. There are some basic definitions and concepts and things like that, and some general structural results. But to complete the proof, we also need geometric arguments that are specific to three primes or three dimensions in our geometric formulation and also to two scales. There are many things that can go wrong if you have If you have more prime factors, and just to illustrate some of the things that might go wrong or might not, we don't know, let me introduce a completely different problem. So there is a well-known question concerning cube tilings in high dimensions. If you think about cube tilings, about cube tilings you probably start by thinking about the usual lattice tiling you just pack cubes side by side and that's your tiling you might try messing it up so like put the piece on cubes in layers and then shift some of the layers or shift some cones or something like that and for a long time people sort of thought that that's as messy as that can get so that there was an auto So there was an old conjecture due to Keller, saying that in any tiling of R D by translates of a unit cube, you have to have two cubes that share a full d minus one dimensional phase. And actually Keller also conjectured something a little bit stronger, that you in fact have a full column of cubes that share entire dimensions nine-dimensional faces. That's true. That's true for beam at most 7. For dimensions 6 and lower, this was proved by Perram. Then it was disproved by Lagaris and Shor in dimensions 10 and higher. Then McKee brought down to 8. And then a different team verified the conjecture in dimension 7 using a computer search together with some With some reductions that they defect. What does that have to do with integer timings? Turns out that there is actually a similar property that you can define for integer timings, and it's actually very much relevant to the work I talked about. You can formulate a sort of a curl-like property in terms of the divisor set of of set of the tentative tile. Suppose that you have a tile in A plus B is set N, define the divisor set of A and similar definition for B. Is it always true that for some prime dividing M, the number M over P is going to be in one of those sets? If you go back to the Chinese representation, go back to the Chinese representation theorem, Chinese remainder theorem representation. This is basically the equivalent of two cubes sharing a face. For M having three distinct prime factors, this is true and that was actually used in And that was actually used in our proof. We in fact proved a stronger statement about columns when you have three primes and two scales. In a more recent paper with Ben Bruce, we considered that kind of questions for more prime factors. We have partial results, some positive, some negative. some positive, some negative, but in general the question is still open. But one of the things that follow from my work with them is that the same methods that we used for three prime factors are just not going to extend to the general case. Here's one more question I want to mention and that's a minimal time. and that's the minimal time period. Let's say that A times the integers and D is going to be the diameter of the set. So the maximum length and minimum. You can ask about the minimal timing period for A, and there are actually two questions that are similar but not quite identical. One is given a timing by A, what's the minimal by a what's the minimum period of that timing? And a different question is among all possible timings of the integers by A, what's the time that has the smallest possible Q? The periodicity result by Newman says that any timing of Z by A has period at most 2 projecting. That can be a pretty big number, even if A Pretty big number, even if A has smaller than 90. So we would like to do better. And I'm going to say more about that on the next slide. Just going to point out now that there exist tilings of period something like this. That construction is due to Steinberger. It improves on an earlier example by Colin Sakis. It actually is pretty difficult to construct timings of period even that big. Never mind that. And moreover, both of these constructions introduce prime factors in M that were not present in A. Is there something that we can do about that? So I have some work in preparation. I have some work in preparation with Dmitry Saharov which addresses that in part. So one of the things we can prove is that A has a tiling of period at least that much. And also we can construct Also we can construct tilings of period at least e to the 3 over 2 up to epsilons with A and M having the same prime factors. However, if A satisfies T2, that's the common layer of this conjecture, then it also has to admit a time with period at most twice the diameter of day. twice the diameter of A. And the optimum example is actually a two-element set 0 and D. So if this is true, then any set that tiles the integers also admits a time with a very short. Okay, let me finish with a a short mention of some connections to harmonic analysis. connections to harmonic analysis. The first question I want to mention is Bleda's heteroset conjecture. The conjecture says that if you have a subset of Rn of non-zero and finite bed measure, then that set tiles are Rn by translations if and only if the set is spectral, meaning that the L2 space on it admits an orthogonal basis of exponential functions. The conjecture is false in full generality, with country examples due to various people in various dimensions and different directions. But it's true in many special cases of interest. For example, when the transaction set is a lattice, the context sets in Rn, and there are also analogues in finite analogues in finite groups that are being worked on. In dimension one, the conjecture is still open, and that's the part that's related to integer times. Specifically, the timing implies spectrality can be reduced to consideration of integer times. That follows from some past work by myself and Navarius people. and various one. And there is also a sort of a converse due to Dutch and Lie, which says that if T1 and T2 hold for spectral sets in the integers, then every bounded spectral set on the real line tiles the real line by translations. So there is that connection. There is also a connection to the Favard length problem. This is a problem where you want to estimate the rate of decay of projections of a self-similar set. You iterate that, you take the average projection of En where the average is taken with respect to the angle. By a classic result of Basikovich, that has to go to zero as n goes to infinity. You want to know about the rate of decay. about the rate of decay. There is a lot of work on that by many people, some of them here, in various directions. I want to focus on the relationship to timing. So the class of sets that's relevant here is product country sets. We start with a square, we divide it into congruent squares, we pick L of them according to our choice of digits. To our choice of digit set in each direction, and then we iterate the construction. So, one example of that is the four corner set. That's where L is 4 and the digit sets are 0 and 3 in both directions, but you can also make that more complicated. For that type of sets, there are results due to Results due to, because going back to the paper by Nassarov, Perez, and Volberg, and then other improvements, including my work with Zai, with Bonnet Volberg, and then with Caleb Marshall, where we prove bands sort of looking like this. And a common theme is that you use information about the use information about the roots of the mask polynomials a of x and b of x on the unit circles. And then depending on what kind of information about them you have, that's the kind of result that you're going to get. The mass polynomials come up when you compute the Fourier transpones of the projected measures and then And then to study those, we need to study synchrotronic divisors of A of X and B of X. The methods that we use for that are very similar to those that are used for integer times, and there's a good chance that there's actually a deeper connection between the two problems. Thank you very much. Well, thank you for the nice talk to be with questions. Could you talk a bit about, so cyclotomic divisibility on these finite grids has certain geometric interpretations. Could you talk a bit about the difficulty in moving from like two to three to four dimensions and like what that looks like for each? And like what that looks like for each of these problems. So, like, building up, like, for example, I know there's like fiber representations. Yeah, well, in two dimensions, you had the fiber representation where if, let's say, M divides A, then you can represent A as a sum of simple sort of simple sort of alphabetic progressions. In three dimensions it gets more complicated and in four dimensions basically the geometry starts going haywire. So it's there are several different levels of difficulty and e e each time you increase the dimension you You increase the dimension you add to it. Is there also something known about the inverse problem that when you're not trying to find complete tiling, but you have a set, maybe sufficient conditions for your subset that you cannot tile? Oh, yes, we have several of those. So for example, we can indicate configurations that cannot be present in ceptile. For instance, if you have fibers in each direction, that sort of thing, and nothing else in that grid, then something like that would not tile. So these are geometric configurations that you cannot have in a tile. Great question. So you mentioned a conjecture about the in-digit tiling version of the Lagarius that short result of sharing no environmental dimensional phases. May I ask if suppose we can find such a contact sample in integer tiling, does it mean a T to contract false? Or does it find something about T? I have a recent paper with Ben Bruce about that. I don't know if. That I don't know if that's what you're asking. So that's the conversion of color type examples to integer tiles. To some extent, you can sort of copy the examples of Agarias and Schorin and just sort of implement that in the setting of integer timings. But that can only take you so far because of the periodicity constraints. Of the periodicity constraints. So you have to do some non-trivial work to do the adaptation, and then there's a point where the adaptation just sort of breaks down. But that's kind of how it takes. Maybe on that topic, so do you have... I see you want to save Keller's conjecture by adding more constraints inspired by integer tilings. Is there any hope for this? I mean, does your work on integer tilings give you ideas? With the integer tilings, give you ideas on what the correct version of Keller's conjecture should be. Well, Keller's conjecture is pretty much resolved by now. So people know in which dimensions it's true, they know in which dimensions it's false. And that's basically all you can say about that if that if you're asking about whether that there's some different conjecture about cube timings that might actually be true in high dimensions, then we don't know. So for example, if you try to add periodicity conditions that would imitate the setting of integer times, then that one version of that might have a chance of being true. So we really don't want it. Wide open. There's not any further, let's thank you to have a back in. We'll have a coffee break now until half past. John, have you got a few slides? Yeah, take quite a few terms.
