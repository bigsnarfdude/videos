So you're gonna have my screen button. What is the screen? Right, we need to that's what we need to be talking about. But if it's not too much sufficient, we're like trying to find an active investigation. Our next speaker is um Arthur Nimpa, who's a PhD student at Blackboard University, Niagara. That would be interesting idea. I'm converting its research perspective. Thank you very much, and thank you to the organizers for giving me the opportunity to speak here. So I will connect to Valter's talk on Monday about this spectral perspective on non-commutative geometry and especially finite dimensional truncations of it. But I will start with a little bit of history, which I don't claim any proficiency about, but I found it quite entertaining repeating on it. So, this is the story about two mathematicians. You see Morge on the left and Kantodovich on the right. They're about two centuries apart. And Mors in the 18th century considered this problem of optimal transport. This is motivated from mining, and the story roughly goes like this. So you have some distribution of piles of sand in one place, and you want to transport that to another place. That to another place. Maybe really think of it as like multiple pilots that you want to transport somewhere. Say they are normalized, maybe it's one unit of mass that you want to get to that other place. And the question is how you do that. Well, you need a plan, and to every such plan would be associated a certain cost of transport. And the goal of Mones was to optimize the cost of transportation. Cost of transportation of such a transport plan, which would be this, and to be slightly more formal. So, these piles of sand will be modeled by probability measures on some metric space. This row is just the metric on that metric space. It's a slightly simplifying assumption. In general, it could be a more general type of cost function, but for me, in our setting, it's enough to assume that, for instance, it's the same cost to go from one place. The same cost to go from one place to another as it is to go back, which, of course, in the general setup, this could be more general. This transfer time pi could be a measure on the product space, which has marginals, new and new. So this is one perspective on the problem. And then, as I said, a couple centuries later, we're in the 20th century now, Cantorovich said, yeah, you can also look at this from a dual perspective. Can also look at this from a dual perspective in the sense that you don't do the transport yourself, but you let someone else do it. And if you let someone else do it, they would buy your sand in the first place at the place mu and would sell it in the place mu. And the difference would be their profit. And rather than minimizing the cost, they would try to maximize their profit, which is a dual perspective somehow. And the formula that you get, or that Kantorovich proved, and I think. That Kantorovich proved, and I think in this version it's rather due to Kantorovich and Grubenstein, so it's kind of a follow-up work. This is what you get. So you can express this optimal transport cost also by considering Lipschitz functions and really evaluating the measures in these Lipschitz functions. I would like to compare this to the distance formula by Kuhn, which Walter. Formula by Kuhn, which Walter mentioned on Monday. So, this is saying that you can recover the Riemannian distance on a Riemannian manifold from the Dirac operator on that manifold. So, the point here is that commutator with this function f, this is exactly the Libschnitz constant of that function. And these formulas are, of course, the same if your point measures. And this is kind of the And this is kind of the starting point of or you can take inspiration from that to develop something which is called compact quantum metric spaces. This is due to Mark Riefel. And these would be modeled in operator systems. And you would then try to give a kind of generalization of a Lipschitz constant for operating systems. What should a Lipschitz constant be? Lipschitz constantly. The Lipschitz constant Li. Lipschitz constant is, of course, a semi-norm. But here comes back this now, this Mauschman-Trotovich distance. This is really what it's called in the literature. It gives you, for every such semi-norm, it will give you a distance on the state space of the operator system. You can actually do this from matrix space. Just a little bit of terminology. So that subspace. That subspace where that semi-norm is finite, and we call the domain. And now come a few conditions which should ensure that L is a reasonable generalization of a Gibson's constant. So the first condition is that the domain should be closed. The second condition is it should not see whether you're taking adjoints. And the last one is that the kernel should exactly be the constant, which just reflects the fact that of course the Libs constant of constant functions. Constant functions. This is still not quite enough for L to be a reasonable generalization of the Gibson's constant, but you would additionally want this Mosch-Kantodovich distance to matrix the weak star topology of the state space. It's actually enough to require this for the state space, it will be automatic for the matrix space. This package then of an operating system with a lit norm would be called a complete quantum metric space. What is S of X? You had Sn of X, but S of X is S1 of X, so just a state space. Classical compact metric spaces you can compare in something which is known as Gromov-Hausdorff distance. This works like this. So if you want to compare two compact metric spaces, you embed them into some Raging metric space. Space and there you take the Hausdorff distance. And then you take the infimum over all such embeddings. This actually amounts to just looking at metrics on the disjoint union of these two metric spaces, which restrict to the metrics. This idea you can use for compact quantum metric spaces as well. So if I want to compare two of these, I should kind of explain what a reasonable way is to put a metric on this joint. to put a metric on the disjoint union, the disjoint union would here be given by the sum because we have a global setting. And there I call it it from admissible if it well induces the dip bumps on the summons. And then you can define a notion of complete chromophosphorov distance. Actually multiple versions of this have been proposed. I really like this one because it takes the whole matrix order structure into account, which I think will be appreciated by this audience. Refill's proposal is quantum grammar. Riefel's proposal is quantum Grimmofaus of distance, so in his version, this would just be far to state. So, what you do here, you take all these admissible lip norms, and then you still compare these metric spaces, these complex metric spaces, in an Auschwitz distance. And then you sort of have to take into account supremum overall matrix amplitude. It's not hard to see that this could. It's not hard to see that this compact, a complete Grimm-Hausdorff distance, is upper bound for the classical Grimm-Hausdorff distance of the state spaces. But as a remark, but they're actually not equivalent. So this is, we really get something different for this complete group of household distance. It has some very nice properties, which is, I think, also the reason why this is a good proposal. Reason why this is a good proposal if you're working with operating systems. So, one is if you define isometry of complex quantum metric spaces suitably, then this complete Brown's house of distance will be zero if two quantum metric spaces are isometric. If it will, and also the whole family of isometry classes of quantum metric spaces. Classes of complete quantum metric spaces will be a complete metric space. So I think that's a good coincidence that we call it the complete common class. Here's a criterion how you can check it. So if you, yeah, so in practice what you would want to do, if you have to contact quantum metric spaces, you can try to find maps which go between them. These should be UCP maps and they should be dip norm contractive. This is really just saying there are more of these in the category of More often than the category of quantum metric spaces. And their compositions should approximate the identity with respect to the complement. Then you get good control of this complete chromatosphere distance. Necessary condition as well? I don't know. Looking at it, but an amper. I hope so. But so far, this is the only one that's been used usually. And I want to show you this at work a little bit. So, Weiltre talked about spectral triples and spectral truncations. I'll recall this very briefly. So, a spectral triple is just a C-star algebra acting on some Herbert space where it meets with an operator D, which plays the role of the Dirac operator. And if you try to work with this in practice, or With this in practice, or yeah, to take a more practical point of view, you'll realize that you will never have this full operator D available, but there will always be some kind of restriction on the availability of spectral data, which might lead you to considering a spectral projection for this operator and compressing all the data in your spectral chip. This first one, this PAP, this will be an operator system because that projection one usually. Because that projection will usually not sit inside the C-star algebra, so it's really just an operator system. But you can still take commutators with this compressed operator, take the norm of them, this will define you the SIP norm. You still should check in practice if this actually defines your lip norm. So if this matches if the induced motion controller, which distance matches the start hypology. But if that's the case, you can ask whether you get convergence. You get convergence when you take more spectral data into account. Then this is a reasonable question to ask in the setting of complete processes. Looked at this in a very particular case, in the case of the Taurus. This is the spectral triple for it. This is actually, Byter went into this in a little bit of detail in his talk for. A little bit of detail in this talk for the tutorials, um, so I won't repeat it all. I'll just um mention that you get a these spectral projections might kind of lead you a wrong path if you look at them too hands-on, because somehow if you take all the all the part of the spectrum in an interval, you will find that the projection is in such a way that for every lattice point in a ball of the radius is. A ball of the radius is lambda, you get a one-dimensional eigenspace, and that's what we have to project to. So at first, we thought we might have to count these lightest points, which is of course very hard. But using slightly different techniques, we were able to show that these spectral truncations converge. And what's nice about this is that it's quite concrete. So these two maps that go between these, well, between the operator system and the function algebra, The function algebra, but you can write them down in this example very explicitly, and you can even make pictures of what you get. So, on the right here, I plotted the torus, so the square, then here's the torus, and then up here, each point indicates the distance of that point to the origin of the torus. And using these VCP maps between these operating systems, you take callbacks, you get maps between state spaces. Get maps between state spaces. Of course, these points on the torus will be pure states on this algebra. And they will become states on these operating systems. And you can just compute the motion control of which distance in this kind of though in taking very, very low-dimensional travations, you can already see that you take a little bit of slightly more spectral data in the point. This is kind of an illustration of the kind of convergence that you get. We can be a lot more general, so you can acquire a bit of connotations of compact quantum groups. It's a little bit of a different setting because I don't have a Dirac operator around, but the only thing that I require is a dip norm on that quantum pointer, which you always have available. There's some general design query for that. DIP norms are available. And you can make them invariant. This just reflects the Just reflects the idea of invariance of a metric on the constant. The projections you can consider then, or you can consider if you don't have a spectrum of a Dirac operator around, it's just you take the betrobial decomposition of this complex quantum group and take some subfamily of irreducible corepresentations of this complex quantum group and subject to whatever you get the detail about decomposition from that. You get a complete value composition from that. Maybe think of lambda as being some finite. Not necessary. Then these are the projections. You can compress your C-star algebra with that to get an operating system. And this operating system has some nice properties. This is actually quite general. So usually these types of truncations preserve a lot of symmetry. And this also happens here. So you show that you get a co-action on this operator system. Co-action on this operator system, which will be ergodic and is just the arrow that makes this diagram commute. You have to check where it's well-defined and so on, but it works and it's ergodic. That's an important ingredient. So we have our quantum group, which is a compact quantum metric space because it comes with a lip norm. We have the operator system. We still have to put a lip norm on this operator system. And it turns out that you can just And it turns out that you can just do that by using this regarding coalition. Semi-normal, first of all, but then there Hanfen Li did quite some work to show in a similar setting that you can that such a lip-based lip norm. Semi-normal actually lip norm. And this also works in this setting, so there's some checking as well. And with that package, you can again ask about convergence, and this will work. Convergence and this will work. That's kind of the second theorem I wanted to show you. One technicality I should mention is that I have to require, just for some technical reasons, that these lip norms are bi-invariant, which I'm not too happy about, but this is current status. It would be nice to get very much. So, what questions can we have for us?
