Okay, well, thanks. Thanks so much for the invitation to speak. And I dearly wish that we were in person in Oaxaca, but here we are, and maybe next time. So everybody's been well introduced to the topic of collective cell migration. So that's great. I don't have to introduce you to why that's important. I'll just tell you about some work we've been doing on the collective cooperative. On the collective cooperative cell contact dependent migration of border cells in the Drosophila ovary, which you can see here as they're moving in a structure called the egg chamber. So just to give you a little bit more anatomical context to where this is going on, this is a picture of a fruit fly ovary inside the animal. It would be shaped more, you know, in an ovoid way, but we spread it out at a microscope slide. Um, we spread it out on a microscope slide, it looks like this, and it's really made up of these repeating units, these strands. And so, we're going to zoom in on one of these strands where at the tip of the strand, we have two kinds of stem cells. We have germ-line stem cells, and we have somatic stem cells. And the progeny of those two cell types assemble into these little ovals called egg chambers. So, the organization of the egg chamber is that there are Chamber is that there are 16 germline-derived cells in the center, 15 nurse cells, which have these giant nuclei, and one oocyte, which is the cell that will become the egg. And then this is surrounded initially by a pretty uniform cuboidal monolayer of epithelial follicle cells. And then as development, as this egg timber grows and matures, the follicle cells undergo some shape changes. Most of the cells stack in a columnar episode. Cells stack in a columnar epithelium in contact with the oocyte. A few cells stretch into this thin, flat, squamous layer in contact with the nurse cells. And then there's this group of six to ten cells at the very anterior tip that just do something very different. They detach and squeeze in between these nerve cells until they reach the anterior border here of the oocyte. And that's why these cells are called border cells. Border cells. And so, yeah, there's the follicular epithelium, and the border cells delaminate from that epithelium and migrate to here. Now, if the border cells don't migrate, then several things go wrong. The female is completely sterile. So it's important that they move. So if we look at this at high resolution as the border cells are exiting this epithelial layer that they were part of, and here the nuclei are in white, the extracellular matrix. White. The extracellular matrix, the basal lamina surrounding the whole structure is in magenta, and then actin is in green with lifactin GFP. We can see that they actually exit this epithelium as a group. And we can see just as Alex McGilner told us about the Siona cells, the pair of cells, I love that, the collective migration of just two cells. The cells start out side by side and then. Out side by side, and then a couple of cells start extending protrusions, and one of them becomes the leader cell. The whole cluster kind of turns so that they end up like one cell in front and the other cells behind. Now, different from the Siona situation, because Alex told us how in that case, the protrusions come later and they think it's differential adhesion that causes the rearrangement. Here, the protrusions always come first before the whole cluster. Before the whole cluster kind of turns. And then the other thing you'll see is that there are these two cells in the center of the cluster. The nuclei, they're called polar cells. Their nuclei are labeled red here. And they are actually not migratory at all. So there were three really weird things about this migration when we started studying it, you know, decades ago. The first is that most people studying cell migration were studying individual cells migrating on glass. And so here we were. Um, and so here we were studying this group of cells. So, at the time, that was odd. Um, two different kinds of cells: migratory cells, and then these passengers, these polar cells that don't have the capacity to move at all, but get carried, and yet they signal to tell the other cells to carry them. So they're mutually dependent upon one another. And then, so it's a group of cells, it's two different kinds of cells, there's migratory cells and non-migratory cells, and then they're squeezing in between the nerves. Cells and then they're squeezing in between the nerve cells. So they're not migrating on the extracellular matrix. In fact, they're detaching from the basal lamina of the extracellular matrix and walking away from it. So how can we think about how do cells delaminate from an epithelium, leave an epithelium as a group? Because we know that for a long time, you know, the major way of thinking about how epithelial cells acquire the ability to migrate has been the epithelial to mesenchymal transition or the EMT. And the idea here is that. And the idea here is that epithelial cells are mortared together with adhesion molecules, and that these have to be dissolved and gotten rid of, and apical basal polarity has to be dispensed with to generate individual mesenchymal cells that are then capable of migrating. Clearly, now we know as we look deeper into developing embryos and tissues and healing wounds and all kinds of things, we know, and you've heard of lots of examples. And you've heard of lots of examples of collective cell migration where cells don't necessarily lose all of their epithelial characteristics as they migrate. And so border cells are one example of that. And we know that these are widespread in development, regeneration, and in cancer. So here's an example. So here, these are border cells, right? That I showed you this border cell cluster. And here you can see from work from Annie Ewald's lab, a cluster. From work from Annie Ewald's lab, a cluster of cells that have metastasize in a mouse. So, this is an actual metastasis in a mouse. And we can see that our border cell cluster is composed of these central non-migratory cells that are carried by these migratory cells. And we can see here in this invasive strand from a breast cancer, again, there's these motile cells that are pulling along these non-modile cells. And in the case of the cancer, these are going to be the proliferative. Case of the cancer, these are going to be the proliferative ones or the ones that are not migrating. So, sometimes, at least, cancers can spread in this cooperative way as well, more than one cell type. Okay, so border cells have been able to teach us a number of interesting things over the years. And I'll just mention one in particular for this group that I think is interesting, which is that, you know, sometimes the mechanisms of collective cell migration can be quite distinct from those of individual cell migration. And so, whereas in the Individual cell migration. And so, whereas in the EMT paradigm, one of the things you have to do is get rid of cell cell adhesion, and adhesion molecules like E.Cadherin are considered to be like anti-migratory. In some cases of collective cell migration, E.Cadherin can actually promote the migration. And we found that there were actually three different ways in which E-cadherin was promoting the migration of the border cell clusters. And subsequent to that, Andy Ewald found that E. Cadherin was a very strong cell. Found that E-cadherin is also required for the metastasis in multiple models of breast cancer. So, let me just tell you what we found in the border cells. This is long published, so I just want to review it really quickly. And that is that because the border cells are migrating on other cells, E-cadherin at the leading edge is kind of substituting for what endogrin would do when cells are migrating on matrix. And it participates in this positive feedback loop that's amplified. Positive feedback loop that's amplifying the chemoattractant signal that the cells are following. So there's this feed forward between the chemoattractant receptors, EGF receptor and the PDGF-EGF receptor homolog, and actin polymerization, adhesion, and RAC. And this forms a feed-forward loop to amplify the protrusion in the lead cell. Lead cell. And then the lead cell, through chitherin-mediated adhesion with the following cells, inhibits the back cells from trying to go off in a different direction. And then cadherin between the polar cells, which are in the center. They're called polar cells because there's a pair at each pole of the egg chamber, but they're in the center of the border cell cluster. And it's e-cadherin. And it's e-cadherin at the surface of the polar cells that's really holding the cluster together. And so, if you just knock down cadherin from the polar cells and from nowhere else, the cluster splits apart. Okay, so these findings led us to this sort of model. This is my idea of a model, my idea of this very formal mathematical model of, you know. Of, you know, the lead cell is mechanically coupled to the following cells, and this is keeping everybody moving in the same direction. Okay, so E. Cadherin serves at least three different positive roles in maintaining the cluster as a group, allowing the cluster to extend a forward directive protrusion, and keeping everybody moving in the same direction. Okay, well, thinking about mechanical coupling got us thinking about myosin. And we started, we went back and started looking very carefully and dynamically at what was going on with myosin in the cluster. And we noticed something we hadn't really expected. And then on the one hand, it might seem completely obvious. And then on the other hand, it made us completely rethink the role of these forward directed protrusions in the migration. Protrusions in the migration. So, let me just tell you what we noticed and then how our thinking evolved. So, these are time-lapse images of a cluster labeled, simultaneously labeled for actin with LIFE ACT TFP and for the regulatory chain of non-muscle myosin II in magenta here. And what we noticed is that the lead cell would extend this protrusion in the direction of migration. This protrusion in the direction of migration. And when that reached its maximal length, we would see an accumulation of myosin. So myosin is not there or not abundantly there when the protrusion is extending. But then when it reaches a maximum length, myosin accumulates at the base of this protrusion, and then the protrusion retracts. Okay, so what's not too surprising about that to people who think about myosin is. That to people who think about myosin is that you know myosins involved in contractions, and so here's this you know very nice negative correlation between protrusion and myosin accumulation. So here's the normalized myosin intensity, and we can see that it's highest actually immediately preceding retractions. Well, what was a little bit surprising to us about this is that is that while Is that, well, I'll get to that. Let me just show you that if we express a constitutively active myosin, we get these constitutively contracted border cells that are very round and they make this sort of like clover-like shape instead of the more extended and protrusive morphology that we see in the control. Also, consistent with the idea that one of the roles in mySin is to retract protrusive. Is to retract protrusions. Is that if we knock myosin down, either by knocking down the light chain, knocking down the heavy chain, or expressing a dominant negative version of the light chain, we get ectopic protrusions and we get longer-lived protrusions and longer protrusions. So, this is protrusion length in the control versus the knockdown. So, we get longer, longer-lived, and ectopic protrusion. So, all of this points in the direction of myosin being. This points in the direction of myosin being involved in retracting protrusions, which I'm sure does not surprise anyone here. But it did surprise us because the predominant model people had for what protrusions were doing in the border cells specifically, but I think more generally, is that they were kind of functioning as these like grapples, that the cell would extend this protrusion, grab the substrate. Protrusion grab the substrate and then pull itself forward based on that. But given that 90% of the protrusions that we observe actually retract, that's not really consistent with this grapple model for what the protrusions are doing. Because if the protrusion is going to adhere and then pull this out, you shouldn't expect the protrusion to retract. You should expect the whole cluster to move forward into the protrusion site and join up with the leading edge of the protrusion. Leading edge of the protrusion. And you would also expect that the migration speed would sort of be fastest when the protrusion was the longest, right? But what we found, in fact, was that the migration speed is really independent of protrusion and retraction. You can see it here in this movie. There's the protrusion and the cells are crawling along. And then whether the cells, whether there's a dominant protrusion in front or not, the cells are migrating at this pretty constant speed. Pretty constant speed. And you can quantify them. And we just don't see any particular difference in the migration speed depending on whether the scleed protrusion is extending or retracting. Okay, so what that means is that we had to revise this model. So the old model was the scrapple and pull model, and our new model is more like the foot in the door. And so what we propose is that protrusions are really sensory structures. Are really sensory structures that extend and probe the environment and then retract. And the cells move in the direction of the most favorable, and they're extending protrusions and retracting them as they go. And they're sensing the environment. Okay, so what then are the protrusions sensing? Keeping in mind that the border cells here are migrating in between nurse cells, not on an extracellular matrix. And so this. Matrix. And so, this cell-on-cell migration or cells migrating in a contact-dependent manner, this is also just to make clear, not something that's just particular to the Trosophila ovary, but here's a mammary gland undergoing normal development, and you can see this cell migrating in between the other cells of the gland. This is a beautiful movie from Peter Friedel's lab showing human tumor cells orthotopically implanted into a mouse. Implanted into a mouse. And you can see the tumor cells labeled in green here are migrating all over each other, as well as on the mouse muscle. And there's many other examples. In the development of the nervous system, cells migrate directly on the surfaces of other cells. When immune cells infiltrate a tumor, they migrate directly on the surface of other cells. So, and here's some examples of that. Okay, so how did cells actually How did cells actually choose a path between other cells? And what we've known for a long time, and I've already alluded to, is that there are secreted chemoattractants, which activate receptor tyrosine kinases. The receptor tyrosine kinases are expressed on all of the follicle cells, including the border cells. The chemoattractants are expressed in the germline. And the two receptor tyrosine kinases that function somewhat redundantly are the Drosophila EGF receptor and the PDGF. EGF receptor and the PDGF BEGF receptor homologue. And there's multiple ligands involved in this. But we wanted to know if this would fully explain the selection, the pathway selection that the border cells take. So remarkably, because we've been studying this really a long time, we noticed something fundamentally that we should have realized a long time ago, which is that there are really two components to pathway selection for the board. To pathway selection for the border cells. This is the lateral view that we usually show, and the border cells migrate from the left to the right. So, from anterior of the egg chamber to posterior. But if you take a slice through the egg chamber and turn it 90 degrees, what you also see, this is the tip of the border cell protrusion here in this particular example, is that the border cells always migrate straight down the center of the egg chamber too. They don't take these lateral paths, even though we've counted up that there's more than four. We've counted up that there's more than 40 different paths that they could take off to the side, but they always stay in the center. So there's really two components to path selection: there's choosing to go posterior and there's choosing to stay on the central path. So if we look at these 40 paths from the point of view of the border cells, so here we're going to sort of move through the egg chamber from the border cell perspective. So this is at the anterior tip of the egg chamber, and this is the border cell cluster, and these are the two polar cells. These are the two polar cells. And now we're going to look at the egg chamber as they would see it. So here are the first, there's three nerve cells at the anterior end of the egg chamber. Here's the tip of the border cell protrusion. And there, and then this is what's in front of them. There's all these different paths that appear and disappear as they move, and yet they always choose to stay in the center. So, how do they choose the center path? So, how do they choose the center path? Well, one question we had was: well, maybe it's these same secreted ligands that we've known for a long time or are helping guide the way. Maybe they're distributed not only in a gradient that's higher posterior than anterior, but maybe they're also in some kind of mediolateral gradient. So to address that, we HA tagged several of the different ligands and CRISPR in those tags and tried to see the extracellular protein. The extracellular protein. And nobody had really ever been able to do this. We'd never been able to see the extracellular protein. So, this involves, in this case, staining a living egg chamber with an anti-HA antibody without fixing and permeabilizing it. So, you first add the antibody. The antibody gets outside the cells, but not inside the cells. Then you fix and stain and look at where it is. And here, we were able to detect this ligand called Karen, which is one of the ligands for the EGF receptor. Receptor. And if we measure, we can actually detect the anterior to posterior gradient in Karen concentration, which was very gratifying. But when we measured the medialateral gradient, we did not detect any gradient at all. So there doesn't seem to be a medial lateral gradient, but we were not actually able to detect all of the ligands because some of the tags just didn't work. We tried N terminal, Z terminal, some of the tags. Terminal, some of the tags, we just couldn't detect the protein at all. But what we could do is knock down both receptors at the same time. So we're basically eliminating all of the chemotractant signaling that we know about. And what we saw, and frankly, we've known for quite some time, is that when you knock down the activity of both receptors, the border cells fail to reach the oocyte, so they don't complete their posterior migration, but they actually rarely. But they actually rarely deviate from the central path. And so, if we can quantify that, we can say, well, there's always a posterior, incomplete posterior migration, but there's rarely, you know, maybe less than 10% of the time, any kind of deviation from the central path. Moreover, we can ectopically express these chemo-attractant ligands. And that's shown here where we've ectopically expressed the ligand in this little patch of cells. And we can see this is a live imaging experiment. And we can see this is a live imaging experiment: the border cells migrate toward that patch sometimes. But when they do, they still, once they get there, they still go, they deviate and go to the central path, even though a more direct route to the oocyte would have been to continue along this lateral path. So they still prefer the central path, even when there's more chemoatractant on the side. So this led us to think that something other than ligand receptor chires and kinos signaling must be received. Receptor tires and kinosignaling must be responsible for the majority of medial guidance. And we were what causes the cells to choose the central path. So one trivial explanation would be if there was some kind of big opening down the center, you know, that would on the order of the size of the border cell cluster. But I've already kind of shown really isn't any kind of tunnel. The nurse cells are coming together in this. In the center of the egg chamber. So, what is special about the center of path? And our next thought, and Alex McGilner referred to this as well, is that differential adhesion might really be the thing that would be keeping them in the center path. And it's true that of all the loss of function mutants we've ever analyzed, there's only one that causes a defect in center path. And this is a movie of that condition. That's where. Of that condition. And that's where we knock down E-cadherin, but only from the germ cells. The border cells still have cadherin, but and the other follicle cells do, but the germ cells don't. And what happens is with very high frequency, these cells migrate in between the follicle cell layer and the germ cells. So maybe there's some kind of haptotactic gradient of E-Cadherin. Okay, so this is just showing you that result again, where normally the border cells migrate in the center, and this is the E-Cadherin. Migrate in the center. And this is the E-cadherin staining in black here, in gray. And when we knock cadherin down just from the germ cells, we see the border cells go off to the side, and we can quantify that. And there's this very profound medial lateral guidance defect. So is there an E-Cadherin gradient that provides a haptotactic guidance cue? So we wanted to very carefully measure the concentration of E-Cadherin on medial and lateral nerve cell surfaces. And so to do Cell surfaces. And so, to do this, Jim Mondo in the lab turned to light sheet imaging. And there he could segment out each of the individual nerve cells and he could measure the quantify the amount of ecodherin. There's the NERS cell follicle cell interface right there. And then here's each side of the NERS cell, whether it's medial or lateral. And basically, we found no difference in the concentration of E-cadherin on the medial paths that the border cells. On the medial paths that the border cells take versus the lateral paths that they ignore. Moreover, Joe Campanali in the lab did FRAP experiments and asked, well, is there some kind of difference in the lifetime of E-Cadhirin or the dynamics of E-Cadherin between the medial paths and the lateral paths? And again, he found really no difference between the medial paths and the lateral paths in the mobile fraction or the lifetime of cahern or anything like that. Hearing, or anything like that. And then Wei Dai, postdoc in the lab, did this experiment where she mosaically overexpressed Cadherin on some nurse cells, but not others. And so here we're creating an artificial gradient of E. Cadherin expression within the egg chamber. And we got no examples of the cells migrating off the central path. So E-Cadherin is not in a medial lateral gradient. And even if you Gradient, and even if you artificially create a medial lateral gradient, cadherin differences in cadahrin concentration are really not capable of redirecting the cells. And we take away from this that E-cadherin is a permissive traction cue, and we have data that I don't have time to go into that shows that it provides traction. So, this is actually a little bit different from what Alex McGilner was telling us about those two cells in Siono, where he thinks. Two cells in Siono, where he thinks that differential adhesion governs a lot of the sort of rearrangement of those cells from side by side to front-back, and then the forward movement of those cells. And I think that's a super cool system. And I think it goes to show that there's multiple ways to like lots of knobs to tune to alter the arrangements and the behaviors of cells. And we heard that from Brian. The behaviors of cells. And we heard that from Brian's talk earlier this morning. And I'll just say that I've put forward some of these ideas in a couple of review articles, one from a number of years ago in Science and one this year. The idea that if you tune these knobs of contractility protrusion, cell cell and cell matrix adhesion, we can generate a lot of morphogenetic diversity in cell arrangements and cell behaviors. Arrangements in cell behaviors. But okay, back to the question at hand. What is going on? Why are the border cells choosing the central path? And so is there anything different about the central path? And so here, what Wei Dai did, who was a postdoc in the lab, who really initiated this project. I had never really wondered that hard about this question, but she really initiated this project. And so she very carefully reconstructed every cell in the egg chamber in three dimensions. Cell in the egg chamber in three dimensions and asked, Is there anything different about the central path versus the side paths? And I don't have time to describe everything that she did, and I'll say there are lots of things that are different between the center and the sides of the egg chamber. It's just that most of them don't matter. So let me cut to the chase and tell you what does matter. The central path is a place, and you can see it very obviously right here, where each nerve cell is colored in a different color, is that it's a place where multiple nerve cells are... Is that it's a place where multiple nurse cells come together, whereas most of the side paths are places where two nurse cells are adhering to one another. And so what Wade did was to reconstruct all of the two cell interfaces, which appear here as these planes, all the nurse cell contacts, and then all the three cell interfaces, which are shown as these filaments here, and then places where even more than three cells come together. Even more than three cells come together, which are these magenta dots that you can see here. And so here are the three and more than three cell junctures of nurse cells. And then here are the two cell nurse cell interfaces. And we can look at that in this animation where she shows you the full reconstruction of the two-cell, neural cell interfaces, and then And then the three and more than three nerve cell junctures. So the three cell junctures are the filaments, and the more than three cell junctures are the magenta dots. And so what's really interesting is if you plot the density of these different interfaces, you can see that three cell junctures. That three-cell junctures are more concentrated in the center of the egg chamber than the outside, and the more than three-cell junctures are even more concentrated in the center. It's almost as if there's, whereas there's an anterior posterior gradient of the chemo-atractant, there's a media lateral gradient of these more than three-cell junctures. So, what's the meaning of that? Why does that matter? Well, it turns out that there's slightly larger. Slightly larger extracellular spaces where multiple nurse cells come together. And you can see that in this image right here, where she's dunked this living egg chamber in fluorescently labeled dextrands, which can fill extracellular spaces, but don't cross the plasma membrane. So they show you extracellular spaces. And what you can see is that there's more dextran in places where six cells come together than where three cells come together or two cells come together. Or two cells kept together. So here we turn to Yuan Chen and Wooderjan Rappel at UCSD to help us understand this. And of course, just on first principles of geometry, there are going to be slightly larger spaces where multiple cells come together. And here you can see where four pool balls come together. There's a bigger space than where three come together. Space than where three come together. And so Yuan Shen and Wooduryan could formalize this and actually showed that the more cells that come together, the bigger the spaces would be. And they could do this in two dimensions as shown here or in three dimensions as well. And if we were tag teaming it, this is where I would turn it over to them so they could describe that calculation in more detail. But I'm going. Detail, but I'm going it alone today. So I'm going to show you here that the prediction of the free space in a juncture of increasing numbers of cells in the contact, the model predicts what's shown in the red circles here and the actual measurements made from an egg chamber is what's shown in the blue dots. And so they are very concordant. Important. Okay, but this is a tiny amount of space, like relative to the size of a cell or a cluster. This is like a very small amount of space. So what is that little bit of extra space doing? And what we thought was it might be doing is the following, that where two neural cells come together, they are actually adhered to one another via E-Cadherent interactions. But when there's even a tiny amount of space, And there's even a tiny amount of space, even the amount of space as big as an e-cadherent extracellular domain, so that those coherents can't bind, that little bit of space is going to create an energetically more favorable place for this, for the border cells to protrude into because they won't have to be breaking the nurse cell-nerce cell adhesion bonds. And so, we think that this might create a situation where even a tiny amount of space lowers the energy barrier. Energy barrier. And so, even tiny crevices, much smaller than a cell, reduce the need for protrusions to unzip the cell adhesions and create this central path of at least less resistance. So one prediction of that idea is that if we were to knock down cadherin from the nurse cells, we would see more space open up. And that's in fact what we saw if we do the dextrin labeling experiment on an egg chamber that has EK. On an egg chamber that has E. Cadherin knocked down from the nurse cells, now you can see this deck strand filling spaces between the nurse cells that are not filled here in the normal case. Okay, so we propose that geometry favors protrusion into multiple cell junctures. And we think that this is, you know, this tiny bit of space is much smaller than a cell, but it's on the scale of. On the scale of the size of the protrusions that the cells are extending. So, is that really the case? And so, what Way did was to carefully look at border cells as they would encounter, let's say, two cell interfaces and three cell junctures and more than three cell junctures. And so, what you can see is that the cells normally protrude more frequently into three cells. More frequently into three-cell junctures than into two-cell interfaces. Even though, remember, in the reconstruction, the two-cell interfaces are massively overrepresented. Like most of the space of the egg chamber is two nurse cell interfaces. But the border cells have a strong preference for these three cell junctures. And then what Wetway did was she watched border cell clusters as they encountered choice points where they could go. Where they could go one way or the other. And so here's an example. So here's an example of a cluster encountering two different paths, each of which has more than three, has three or more nerve cells in it coming together there. So these are like two of those filaments in the filament projection. And so there's two cells protruding. One cell is protruding into a place where, you know, four NERS cells are coming together, and the other one's protruding into a place where three NERS cells are coming together. Place where three nurse cells are coming together. And in all the cases that she looked at, the cell that was protruding into the space where more nurse cells came together, always one, and that would be the direction that the cluster moved in. Okay, so again, yes, that's showing you that they choose the multiple cell junctures, even though the two cell interfaces are represented much, you know, more of the. You know, more of the egg chamber. So then we wanted to know: okay, in principle, then, is the combination of these posterior-enriched chemoattractants and this topography of there being more multicellular junctures in the center of the egg chamber, is that sufficient to explain border cell path selection? So, here again, I would turn it over to my collaborators, Yuan Shan Kao and Wooder Jan Rappelle. Uh, repel. But anyway, this is the model that they came up with where they were modeling the border cells as a point particle representing the center of a mass that moves in a 3D geometry. And according to, you know, these two terms, the topography and the chemoattractant. Now, and it was interesting because this predicted the movement of the border cells. Predicted the movement of the border cells, but at this point, the output of this model was like a point moving on a Cartesian graph. But we wanted to really ask in the context of the egg chamber anatomy, you know, what exactly would the model predict? And so here we actually turn to collaborating with my son, Brandon Montel, because he's a computer scientist and he was working at the time on Google Earth, but he was just about to change jobs and go. Um, but he was just about to change jobs and go work for Pixar, and he was getting kind of interested in animation. And so he helped us out here by making the output of this model that Yuan Chen and Witterdan had come up with imposed on egg chamber anatomy. And so here's the egg chamber with the nurse cells, and then the border cell cluster modeled as a point particle. And here's the path selection that they take on those three. On those three and more than three nerve cell junctures, and this is the output of one simulation. So the modeling and simulation were by Yuan Chen and Witterdon. The animation is by Brandon, and so that makes me hashtag proudmom. But anyway, he could have made the border cells look much fancier with like protrusions and things like that, but those were not incorporated in the model and our physicist friends wouldn't. The model and our physicist friends wouldn't allow us to do that. So we had to be true to the model. Okay, so then we could run. And so basically, if we just take representative traces, this is the path selected in the control. We could model what happens in the absence of chemoattractant and the border cells stop short of going to the posterior, which is experimentally validated. We could model what happens if we take out the geometry or the topological preference term, and then this all. Preference term, and then the cells migrate, they don't stick on the center path. And then we could ask what happens if we take out both, and then they just migrate kind of randomly. And we could run these simulations many times, and we could see the paths that the border cells would take. And you can see that in principle, these two terms do predict the trajectory that the border cells typically take. It very well represents. It very well represents what happens when we remove the chemoatractant. Now, of course, we can't actually experimentally remove the topographical preference. And so these are simulations that we can do, but we can't really do an experimental validation. But we did want to validate the idea in some way. And so we wanted to know: well, how do we know it isn't? So it could be this preference for multicellular junctures plus chemoattractant. But how do we know? But how do we know it's not something else, right? It could also be something else that we hadn't thought of yet. And so we wanted to try to address that question. And this is hard because manipulating the geometry of the tissue in a living organism is like pretty challenging. But Sharon Gogh and Wei thought up, they figured out a way to do it. And so what they did was find mutants that had disrupted. Mutants that had disrupted cell division in the early, or they had an extra cell division in the early development of the germline. And this caused there to be egg chambers with 32 germ cells instead of 16. And 31 of them are nerve cells. And what happens when there are 31 nerve cells is they pack differently than the normal 15. And so you can find examples. This was very hard to get though, because most of these egg chambers don't really develop to the stage where border cells migrate. Migrate, but and the egg chambers themselves are very, very fragile. But nevertheless, they were able to obtain examples where there was a two-nurse cell interface smack dab in the center of the egg chamber. Because the question we're trying to ask here is, is it something about the geometric center of the egg chamber that's favorable, not necessarily these multicellular junctures that happen to be concentrated at the center? So, in this situation, the multicellular So, in this situation, the multicellular junctures are not concentrated at the center, they're actually off to the side. And what they found was that the border cells always went, in this case, to a four-ner cell juncture, even when it was off the central path. And this could also, we could run the simulations on this anatomy, and we got the same result that we got in the experiment. And that's a quantification of that. We could also see that when we knock decadiaherin down from the germline, remember the border cells go off to the side, and when they go off to the side, they actually follow these grooves where multiple, where now the multicellular juncture is two nurse cells and the follicle cells overlying it on top. And so they prefer these grooves to a straighter path that would just. That would just be between one nurse cell and the follicle cells. So, again, these multicellular junctures where there's a little more space, as you can see here, is the preferred path in that situation. And then there was one other situation we could find where when we knock down the chemotract and guidance signaling, sometimes in a small fraction of cases, the cells go off to the side. So they're not at the geometric center anymore. And whenever they do that, they go to a multicellular juncture. So even when the multicellular juncture, even when the When the multicellular juncture, even when the cells are not in the center, they're preferring multicellular junctures, which we think nicely supports the idea that the multicellular junctures are the thing that's normally making the central path favorable. Okay, so now we made one other very interesting observation, which is that Observation, which is that near the end of migration, the topography cue actually weakens. And at the same time, the chemoattraction cues strengthen. And what happens is that the border cells move off the central path. So you can see this sort of, this is a normal trajectory of a border cell. It would be of a border cell cluster. It would go straight down the center path for most of the migration. And then at the very end, it veers off to the dorsal. Veers off to the dorsal side, and these are tracks of actual movements. And what happens, you can see here in these filament tracings, is that these more than three nurse cell junctures, these dots right here, there aren't any more dots here. So there's these two three nurse cell junctures that are going all the way to the oocyte, but the more than three nurse cell junctures, the dots, Than three neural cell junctures, the dots are not here anymore. So that means that, and remember, the more cells come together, the stronger the attraction to that spot or the lower the energy barrier to going into that spot. So what basically happens is the topography cue is strongest right here, where there's all these multi-nerve cell junctures, and it weakens here. And at the same time, the chemotractant concentration is getting higher, and there's a chemotractant. There's a chemoattractant called gherkin, that's one of the ligands receptor, that's actually present in a dorsal gradient. So it's produced in this part of the egg chamber specifically. And so there's actually a dorsal bias to the ligand concentration when you get close to the oocyte. And sure enough, that weakening of the topographic cue and the strengthening of the chemotraphic cue caused the cells to veer off to the dorsal side. Veer off to the dorsal side. And when we add this extra ligand into the simulation, the same thing happens in the simulation. And then here's if you run the simulation 100 times. Now, what was fun about that was that it explained an old observation that we had made. So many years ago, we had used the photoactivatable version of RAC and expressed it in the border cells and showed that when you shine a light on a particular border cell, the border cells move in that direction. Border cells move in that direction. And here's the same cluster. When we shift where we're shining the light, we shine the light on the back of the cluster, and now the cluster actually moves backwards, which is wild. But what Xiaobo Wang, who had done these experiments, noticed was that in the center of the egg chamber, he could really only steer the cells, the clusters, forwards and backwards. They did not want to go off to the side. Not want to go off to the side. But when he got close to the oocyte, he was able to steer them off to the side. And so this, we didn't know what it was about the egg chamber at that time that created this kind of central bias here and relieved that central bias when closer to the oocyte. And so, this observation on the tissue topography helped us understand that. Okay, so much of this work. Okay, so much of this work was published in a paper last year, but I do want to point out that science forced us into a very short format, and there were 21 supplementary figures. So, in case you missed any of that, I thought it was worth going through this story again. And so I want to, I'm not quite done because I want to touch on two other quick subjects, but I just wanted to summarize what I told you, which is that border cells integrate these orthogonal chemical and physical cues, the chemical cues. Chemical and physical cues. The chemical cues drive posterior migration, and there's a anterior to posterior gradient of the chemotractant. The physical cues form a mediolateral gradient and direct the cells to the center. And so normally these two things work in concert to keep the cells moving in a particular direction. But the combination of experiments and modeling provided insights into how the cells integrate those cues and prioritize them to choose. Prioritize them to choose one path amongst many. And so we could separate out the contributions of the ligands, the cell adhesion molecules, and the multicellular junctures. And very gratifyingly, we found in the literature that there's at least one other example of that, and that's intercalation of cells in Xenopus skin development. And you can see this beautiful example here where when the cells are coming up from beneath. When the cells are coming up from beneath this layer and intercalating into the layer, they do it at places where many cells come together. So cells preferentially insert at multicellular junctures. So these were the people who did this work. Jim, Way, Sharon, and Joe from my lab, Nir Gov, who I met at this very bear's meeting like eight years ago, Wuderdan, Guan Chen, and Brandon. Okay. Okay, so I want to remind you of our new model, which is that, you know, that protrusions are serving this sort of foot in the door kind of idea that, and our hypothesis is that protrusions probe the environment for chemoattractance, for adhesion and traction, for physical space, and that protrusions are actively prying the nurse cells apart to allow forward movement of the cluster. Cluster. Okay. So this raises a question, which is, you know, how does the nucleus contribute really to movement through confined space? And here's, you know, this impressive movie that shows that, you know, if you have an artificial micro device, microfluidic device, the nucleus gets stuck there for a while. The rest of the cell moved through this space very easily. But once the nucleus moves through, then the rest of the cell can. Moves through, then the rest of the cell can the cell can follow. And this suggests that nuclear stiffness impedes confined cell migration. But of course, in this scenario, these pillars are not able to move aside, which would be more the case in an in vivo environment. And there are really multiple possibilities for the role of nuclear structure and stiffness in confined migration, and all these different things have been proposed. The nuclear piston model, which The nuclear piston model, which I think we may hear more about, is one idea where the nucleus allows a pressure gradient to form from the front to the back, and therefore nuclear stiffness is actually facilitating migration. But then there's the idea that nuclear, that some cells degrade the matrix in front of them in order to accommodate the nucleus. So the nucleus doesn't have to change shape very much. But in other types of cells where maybe they can't degrade the matrix, They can't degrade the matrix, being able to deform the nucleus, so having a less stiff nucleus might actually facilitate squeezing through tight spaces. So postdoc Lauren Penfield came to my lab wondering about this question, you know, what's the role of nuclear stiffness and do nuclei resist or do they propel movement of the border cells? And again, this is something I just never really quite wondered about myself, but she's been doing some nice experiments where she Some nice experiments where she's documenting the shape changes that the nuclei, the border cell nuclei undergo as they move. And as you can see in this movie and captured here in these still images, the nucleus of the lead cell tends to deform more dramatically than the nuclei of the following cells. And the nuclei of the polar cells in the center of the cluster seem to be the least The least they change shape the least during the migration. Now, lamins are intermediate filament proteins that impart stiffness to the nuclear envelope. And so Lauren wanted to know what the role of lamins might be in border cell migration. And at least in some circumstances, when lamin concentrations are too high, it prevents cells from moving into tight spaces, whereas a lower level of lamin. Whereas a lower level of lamin allows the cells to squeeze through the nucleus to change shape and deform and squeeze through a tight space. And too low of a lamin level will cause the nucleus to rupture and this impedes migration. So Lauren asked, well, she found that there are two different, broadly speaking types of lamins that form two different filament networks, and she found that both types of lamins are actually. Found that both types of lamins are actually expressed in border cells, not surprisingly. And remarkably, she found that it was this B-type lamin that, when she knocked it down by RNAi, caused quite a severe impairment of border cell migration and specifically of border cell initiation of movement. She noticed that when she knocked this lamin down, she observed a striking rupture of the nucleus. So here's a nuclear DS red that. Here's a nuclear DS-red that's spilled all out into the cytoplasm of these cells. And so, our working hypothesis here, and I just presented this because I thought, you know, it'd be of interest to this group interested in mechanics, is that border cell nuclear stiffness is actually promoting rather than impeding movement because when she knocks the lamin down and she decreases the nuclear stiffness, the border cells don't initiate movement normally. Don't initiate movement normally. The lead cell nucleus may provide a cork to allow the protrusion to grow. So, we're wondering: this is what you can kind of see here is like the nucleus seems to fill this constriction at the base of this protrusion. And so, perhaps that's facilitating in some way the growth of this protrusion. It's possible that it's functioning as a piston. We don't actually know that yet. And she did notice that the protrusions usually retract, as you can see, it like if the nucleus moves into the protrusion, the protrusion subsequently seems to retract. And so, so we don't know what that means. And if you have any thoughts on this subject, we'd love to hear them. So Denise, sorry to interrupt, but it would be nice if we can leave some time for questions as well. I will. I will skip straight to the end here and. Acknowledge the people who've done this work, and which I think I've done as I went along. And I will stop right there and take questions. Hi, Denise. Alex McGiller here. Fantastic talk. I really loved it. So my burning question is: I always was struggling with this border cell cluster. So how does it move physically? How does it move physically? I understand your work on how is it finding the path, but how does it move as a whole? So I understand that not everything is known, but what would be your favorite hypothesis? Yeah, well, so what I can tell you is that all the cells are contributing to the movement of the cluster, not all the cells, not the polar cells, all the outer cells are contributing to the movement of the cluster. So they're all crawling. Cluster. So they're all crawling. Okay. And we know that because if we make mosaic clusters where some cells lack the ability to crawl and other cells don't, we see a migration defect in proportion to how many cells can't crawl. So we think all the cells are contributing. The cells seem to be competing to be the leader, and the cells are not different from one another fundamentally. So a rear cell can overtake a front cell. Overtake a front cell. It doesn't have to happen, but it can happen that the rear cells, we think they're equivalent, the outer cells, that they're competing, that the lead cell is inhibiting the rear cells from setting off in a different direction. And we have mutants where that impedance stops, you know, where the lead cell doesn't interfere and each cell tries to go in its own direction or whatever. But yeah, we think all the cells are crawling and the outer cells are scooping up the polar cells and completely. The polar cells and completely encasing them and carrying them along. And so, by crawling, you mean they interact mechanically with the cells around them? I mean, yes. By crawling, well, you could see it in the movies where the cells are, you know, the lead cells protruding and retracting, but the whole cluster is moving forward. You can kind of get the idea that they're all. Yeah, that's exactly what I'm asking. So, do you envision like a Yeah. So, do you envision like at the sides of the cluster there's some forces trying to squeeze through the surrounding tissue? Yeah, that's a good question. We've been thinking about because we have observed some of these cryptic protrusions, you know, where one border cell is protruding, you know, is cupping the cell in front of it. And so then the question is, what are they migrating with? Like, you know, if, and, and what, yeah. So we just. So we think they're migrating on the nurse cells because they can't migrate if they don't get that traction on the nurse cells. So they must be, I guess it could be, yeah, we think they're migrating with their basolateral surfaces that are in contact with the nerve cells. Thank you very much. I think Hans had a question and then Paul after that. Yeah, two quick ones actually. ones actually. Why does the protrusion retract? What is the advantage of that? So yeah, why does well, why questions are hard, but so the protrusion, we see it as like the protrusion is sampling the environment and then retracting. I think it retracts because there's a limit to how far it can extend. So I think that mechanics. Okay, so I think that mechanically there's a limit to how far it can extend, and therefore it retracts until the cluster until the cell catches up to it, essentially. So one idea would be, and we don't, you know, I haven't, it's an interesting question that you asked it that way, because we haven't really posed that question and addressed it experimentally, but that's the notion that we get is that there's a maximum extension to what the protrusion can achieve, and then it retracts. Achieve and then it retracts back. But what's happening is myosin is getting recruited to the base of the protusion, and that's causing the protrusion to retract. So if you take myosin away, they can't, the protrusion can get longer. I don't, you know, I don't think I can answer your question. I don't know. Do you have an idea why is it better to retract the protusion? I think because it can continuously sample in different directions, maybe. Maybe. Yeah. Second question is: why this elaborate? Is why this elaborate procedure for getting signaling from one end to the other? Is it a timing issue or to this elaborate procedure? You mean moving the cells? Yeah, yeah, why not move that group forward? Why not just have them differentiate someone? Yeah, I don't know. I can't answer that question. And certainly it's not the case in all, like, even in. Case in all, like even insect egg development, some you know, the structure that the border cells help to build can be built, you know, differently. So it doesn't have to be. It's one of those weird things that happen during evolution. Yeah. Thanks. Okay, Paula. Yeah, that was a beautiful talk. Thank you. So you talked about the sensory role of the protrusion. Might it have a dual role to interact with the nerve cell? To interact with the nerve cells to cause a down-regulation of maybe desmosomes or something other that enhances the sort of lumen it's creating. Ah, okay. So just one thing to keep in mind is the nerve cells are actually not epithelial cells at all. So they don't have anything like junctions. We call them junctures because it's like the interfaces where the cells come together or whatever. The nerve cells are not epithelial in character at all, and they don't have any kind of. Like at all. And they don't have any kind of really tight junctions or any kind of junctions that would, you know, it's really just ecadherin mediated adhesion and it's pretty uniform along the nerve cell boundary. Could, yeah, so I do think that the protrusions when they extend are wedging open space. Like, I think that's one of the things they're doing. So the space that's there is very tiny, and the protrusion is now wedging that open further. And that's That open further, and that's that's helping the cluster to move forward. I do think it's serving as a wedge. Do you have any idea what how it's doing that? Because the neural crest cells, we tried to say bulldoze their way through the mesoderm, and we got a lot of pushback on that because we didn't really have a good explanation mechanically. Well, so I think I could offer something pretty simple, which is that border cells express a higher concentration of E.cadherin than the Concentration of E-cadherin than the nurse cells do. So, if they can get their protrusion in there, they can out-compete. You know, there is an energy gain to border cell nurse cell adhesion relative to nurse cell nerve cell adhesion. And since the border cells, or at least it's, no, I mean, it's going to be neutral, but in terms of energy, but the border cells have a higher concentration of ecodahurins, so they could presumably out-compete it. And that would be one way they might be able to. Way they might be able to increase their area of contact with the nurse cells and displace nurse cells from one another. The problem then is that you have to break those bonds at the back. But that's a problem all migrating cells have.
