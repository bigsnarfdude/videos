I want to talk about a project, a part of a project that's ongoing and has many parts and keeps, yeah, there's many different parts to it, joint with Kento Osugo at the University of Tokyo. So here I'm just going to talk about mostly the free energy aspect, but I'll give some background on what we did before with the refined topological recursion. Um, so just in case someone is totally not paid attention all week, uh, there's this thing called topological recursion introduced by Chekhov in our Orontan, uh, used to study, used in the solution of matrix models to solve the loop equations. Uh, but it turns out many people here are aware that it has rather spectacular applications in enumerative geometry and. And from another perspective, in the study of so-called quantum curves, it also has very close relations to ODEs and WKB analysis of ODEs, of Schrödinger equations. So there's a lot of nice stuff, and hopefully many of us here appreciate that in the original topological recursion formalism. But what's much less studied is the so-called refined variant, in which instead of In which instead of trying to study matrix models, you study an alpha-beta ensemble, which is kind of like a matrix model. It only has some matrix interpretation in some cases. But you take an arbitrary one-parameter deformation by some parameter beta, which is a complex number. And this was studied in various approaches by various permutations and subsets of these three people, as well as a paper by Brini Marino-Steven. As a paper by Brini Marinho-Steven, Manabi Sukowski. And then what Kento and I did was to write down, in the case of degree two curves of genus zero, so a very specific, special case, we wrote down a pure geometric theory that doesn't refer to beta ensembles at all, kind of as an analog to the ANR or on-sen theory. But indeed, before us, there were several approaches and they do. And they do, they take different ways of doing this, and there are advantages and disadvantages to all of them. Related to this workshop is the so-called, this is the approach of Chekhov Nar Marshall, I think. I think, yeah. So they use so-called non-commutative spectral curves, and they have some very difficult formalism, which I think works in theory, but it's extremely hard to compute with, from what I understand. understand. And so we wanted to kind of bypass that and do a very, very kind of in our antennas style formalism and computation. So that was our motivation. Well, that was one of our motivations. My real motivation was that I want to generalize a certain formula that it's a formula interpreting the free energy in the unrefined case for certain genus zero spectral curves. Geno-zero spectral curves. This is a formula I wrote down with Kohei Iwaki, and it has to do with Donaldson-Thomas theory or conjectures of relation to Donaldson-Thomas theory. And the question is whether we can refine that as well. But I probably won't have time to talk much about that. But let me tell you the setting. So remember, I said I'm talking in a very special case. In particular, I'm always working with, okay, I guess not anyway. I'm working with a class of nine special examples, basically. You can think of them as examples. They're essentially exhaustive of degree two genus zero spectral curves. So in this equation here, the m's with the subscripts are just some complex parameters. Maybe they shouldn't vanish or something like that. And yeah, y and x are coordinates in c. And if you take the parameters to various limits, then you'll get other examples. Limits, then you'll get other examples with different geometry. But what we did in the most recent paper is that we computed the free energy for several examples in this list of examples, but not all of them, unfortunately. I mean, we know what the answer is. We computed the answer. We have a conjecture, but the proof is actually a bit difficult when you have something like second order poles. So this is actually not, this is the grand example, but this. This is the grand example, but this is actually our proof doesn't work for this because it has second-order poles on the right-hand side. Um, yeah, and again, I won't have probably won't have time to talk about this, but we write down the formula in terms of a so-called refined BPS structure, which is related to Donaldson-Thomas theory. So, yeah, this is what I mean by spectral curves of hypergeometric type. So, I'll put it in maybe a more recognizable form. I'll put it in maybe a more recognizable form later, but it's just this list of examples. Again, if you demand that Q is, sorry, that this curve is genus zero, then you will get this list. But I want to focus on the ones that I can actually compute rigorously, which is so I'll write them down here so that you can keep them in mind. Sorry. The Weber curve, which is corresponds to the GUE matrix model, if I know if my terminology is correct. And right, so I gave subscripts to there's a bunch of parameters in each one, but since I only have one parameter for the ones I'm interested in today, I'll just denote that by M. The proof that we give, well, I guess it's stronger than we need. But for these two examples, actually, you can also do the computation. And the answer is just zero. So I won't talk about that too much. But indeed, yeah. So the bottom four examples are tractable. examples are tractable at present uh so right so i'll i'll keep those you should keep those in mind and um right m is non-zero uh and yeah i said that right okay so let me remind uh about the topological recursion again in case you forgot uh so a spectral curve in the sense of topological recursion is four things so i have a compact Riemann I have a compact Riemann surface. Actually, I guess sometimes you guys like to use non-compact, but let's say compact here. Together with two functions, which should be not constant, and their differentials should not vanish simultaneously. I think Maxim was telling us how we can loosen these conditions, but let's stick with the traditional one for now. And then there's a bidifferential, which is a meromorphic section of this thing with some properties. This thing with some properties that you're familiar with about the pole along the diagonal. I'm not, I don't specify them because I always work in these examples. We work with P1. So there's just a canonical choice where this bi-differential is given in any coordinate by this specific expression. So I will mostly forget about this guy for the rest of the talk and focus on x and y. Right. And we Right, and we view X as a ramified cover of P1. So we will denote the ramification points of that cover by curly R. And some of you, yeah, so maybe some people are slightly uncomfortable with me writing them as like algebraic curves. You can always give some parametrization in these examples to get a familiar kind of spectral curve in the sense that you might prefer. Might prefer. For example, if I take P1 with the coordinate zeta and I take x and y to be these specific expressions, then I will get a parameterization of this Whittaker curve. And I can calculate the ramification points. They're zero and infinity. And in fact, because I had a y squared, I have a global involution. Oh, sorry, that should be, there should be no sigma there. Sigma of zeta equals minus zeta that fixes x and ellipse the sine of y. The sine of y. And the same is true for all the other examples. I just won't write them down. Okay, so now you know what we usually do. We write down omega 0, 1 and omega 0, 2, which we define to be y dx and the bidifferential b. And then we do a recursion where we write this illegible formula, which is taken as a residue over the ramification points of the Points of this kernel function times this thing that we integrate against the kernel. So yeah, in this formula, the kernel is explicitly given in terms of the initial data, and sigma here denotes some local conjugation near the ramification point. So I'm assuming here that the ramification points are simple. Again, you don't have to with Again, you don't have to with situations in various other situations. I guess it's bouchar enar, is it? So yeah, I'm making stronger assumptions than might be necessary. But for our refined case, we stick to simple ramification. So yeah, sigma is just then the local flipping of the sheets near the ramification point. Right. And so there's a picture that goes with this formula. So this formula is really just telling you this kind of sum. Telling you this kind of sum. Okay. And so the number that the thing quantity that I'm the most interested in is the free energy. Maybe I write it. It's just given by taking one more residue after computing omega g n. You take just omega g1, which is a one form, and then you can multiply it by a function. Oh, sorry. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, a function. So you can multiply it by a function phi, which is just any. By a function phi, which is just any primitive of y dx, and then take the residue of a one form and sum over the ramification points. So take the residue at the ramification points and sum over. That gives you a complex number. So, okay, so that's some sort of interesting invariant or it's a number. So, a few years ago, maybe five years ago, Iwaki Koikiantake made an explicit calculation for these hypergeometric curves. They found Hypergeometric curves, they found explicitly what the free energy is for all of them. And they found in the two cases I'm talking about here, explicit formulas like this: where you have a universal pre-factor Bernoulli number 2g over 2g minus 2 times this m parameter to some power with a numerical coefficient, an integer coefficient. And this And this actually should be interpreted, or we would like to interpret this as a Donaldson-Thomas invariant or some sort of Euler characteristic of something. So that's where my interest in this came from. But there's a nice formula that shows this kind of uniform behavior for all nine of the examples. Okay, so let's talk about refinement. Okay, so let's talk about refinement. Okay, so we want to generalize all this. And there have been various approaches. We certainly take inspiration from them, but we write everything down in a clean geometric formalism without any reference to matrix models or non-computativity or anything. Okay, so yeah, before I proceed, is there any Yeah, before I proceed, is there any question, or is that okay, actually? Sorry. So, yeah, so we fix a complex number, beta, and I'll always use this letter curly q to denote beta to the half minus beta to the minus half. It appears everywhere. In fact, the recursion will only contain q rather than beta. Beta appears separately when you do, when you introduce a wave. When you introduce a wave function, which I might not get to. So let p prime denote the poles and sorry, poles and zeros, yeah, of y dx. Sorry, the poles, not the poles and zeros, just poles, of y dx, excluding the ramification points. And okay, the first thing is the initial data. So, what's the initial data? It's almost The initial data. It's almost the same as what we had originally. So it's a degree two genus zero refined spectral curve will be the same data as a spectral curve plus this extra little thing. So, right, so a spectral curve with the constraint that we want it to actually be of genus zero. So the function q should be rational and the genus of this curve that this defines should be zero. So we're demanding. zero. So we're demanding that x and y satisfy that kind of relation. And furthermore, we'd like a decomposition of p prime, which remember excluded ramification points. So that means that we have this double cover by x, and we can divide p prime into the positive and minus parts. So every point has its conjugate by the global involution. conjugate by the global involution. And we just select one, select one representative and call that P plus. And to each of those points in P plus, P prime plus, I associate a parameter, an arbitrary parameter. So there's some freedom. And you'll see where this appears in a second. But I can choose a parameter for every point in P prime plus. Right. Right, and we have the decomposition works because we have an involution, a global involution here. So we can write this as a divisor if we like, a complex divisor where we just weight the point P by the weight mu. Okay, and these are actually interesting because they don't appear in any of the previous work. I think to get the matrix model setting, you set this to one or minus one or something. You set this to one or minus one or something. So it turns out that you have this freedom and you can just introduce these parameters and all the proofs go through. So we included them. Minus the ramification points. Yeah. Unramified poles. Okay. And we put various assumptions that you might find obvious. Might find obvious. So the function field should be generated by X and Y. The ramification points should be simple. Here that's automatic because the whole, it's globally a degree two covering. We don't want gramification points to actually collide in the image by X. And right. Y dx should not vanish away from the ramification points. Away from the ramification points and has at most a double zero at the ramification points. So, this is all this is formulated without referring to the examples, but all the examples satisfy this. So, if you want, just throw away the niceness and just think of the examples. But okay, so now what is the recursion from this initial data? So remember that first we had this zero one and zero two. 0, 1 and 0, 2, but we need one more piece of initial data or initial one form to run the recursion. And so we introduce omega half one, which is just defined by this formula. And in particular, this is where mu shows up. So in principle, if you like, you could set mu all to zero and just say that this is omega half one, or set mu to one. That's one or minus one. One or minus one, I don't remember. That's that's the matrix model setting. But in fact, you can just put anything you want here, and everything will go through. So, and we aren't entirely clear on what these parameters mean. Right. So, this is the new initial one form that you have to add to run the recursion. And, oh, sorry, yeah. Ada here means the unique. Eta here means the unique differential on p1 that has residue plus one at p and minus one at sigma of p. Okay. Sorry. P0 is just, I'm just saying omega at P0. Yeah. P is running over P prime plus, and P0 is the actual variable. Okay, so now. Okay, so now, right. So now we let g denote a half integer greater than or equal to zero. Sorry, greater than zero. No, what? Ah, sorry, g is a half integer greater than or equal to zero, and n remains an integer. It's the number of, you can think of it as a number of boundaries and some surface. But the omega g n are now indexed by half integers on g. So So that's one of the main differences between the refined and the unrefined case. And we'll see in a minute that when you pass the unrefined limit, all the half integer omegas just vanish. Okay, so we define omega gn by the following formula. So in the original recursion, we took the residue over the ramification points. Now we have to do. Now we have to do a bit more because this thing turns out to have singularities in other places. So, in the original TR, you're familiar that omega always has poles restricted to the ramification points and nowhere else, omega gn. But that is not true here. And so, in particular, what I need to do is to calculate omega of p0 and then a bunch of other p's, I should take the residue at the I should take the residue at the sigma, the conjugate image of all of the other points, and also at p prime plus. This thing only ends up affecting like the first at like level one or level zero. So this usually doesn't actually contribute for most of the differentials. But this is always necessary, very important. So the key point is that in addition to the ramification, That is that, in addition to the ramification points, you have singularities at sigma of the variables. I don't remember the calculation, but just have that usually thousands. Yeah. No, I don't remember the reason, but it doesn't matter. Right. Okay. So, so, okay, so integration. Right, okay, so integration against a kernel, and the thing we have to integrate against is this. So it looks slightly different from the usual TR situation, but in fact, if you were to take this and set Q to zero, you would recover the original DR. So here I've just denoted delta omega zero two to be. denoted delta omega zero two to be oh sorry this should be p p and p j p i to just be this quantity here and right so you can see this is this is the familiar the main familiar part where you take the sum over all the all the different genuses genuses and punctures and then this is the main new addition which is that we have this derivative term okay so previously there's no derivatives involved in the no derivatives involved in the in the recursion uh and this is this indeed this kind of expression appears in in those papers that that i mentioned earlier uh but not necessarily in this exact geometric form okay exactly in the same place that that i need to take the residue they're all here the anti-diagonal So it's that it's that sigma of pigeon, yeah. They won't have balls on the diagram. Yeah, globally. Yes, yes, yes. So otherwise, if I didn't have sigma globally defined, then yeah, I wouldn't know what to say, what this means, right? Yeah. So yeah, the whole formulation relies on. Yeah, the whole formulation relies on a global involution. Kento has done some additional work when you introduce higher genus, but again, that relies on having global involution. So we have nothing in the absence of a global involution. Okay. So, right. Okay. So the first thing that you do when you write this down is that you check that this actually reproduces the unrefined omega gm. The unrefined omega gm. Okay, good. So it's something. Okay, and then we have the interesting properties that we were able to prove in our first paper, which I'll just cite here. So for the satisfying the niceness assumption, degree two genus zero refined spectral curves, we have, okay, first of all, the important one is that all of these things end up being symmetric. The poles. The poles, the pole structure is, oh, sorry, this should be R. Well, okay, this means ineffective, sorry, effective ramification points, but you can just pretend there's no star there. Okay, so they lie in R together with the conjugate diagonal. So, right, so the poles in any given variable like P0 must be at sigma of P1, sigma of P2, dot, dot, dot, or the ramification points. Points. So, in particular, there are no poles anywhere else, including the diagonal. It has the standard residue-free property that we like, which allows us to integrate things. So, every point where there is a pole, there's no residue. And you have this equation that recovers the lower omega g n from the higher ones. So, okay, the key point, I think. And the key point, I think, for now is that there are additional poles on the conjugate diagonal. This complicates a lot of things, and this is what makes our proof much more difficult and much more, well, we haven't even solved all of the cases yet. So yeah, it's much more subtle because of this. Okay. So let me talk now about the free energy. Let me talk now about the free energy. So, because we have the residue-free property, there's no problem defining everything the same. So, phi is a primitive of y dx, and there's no residue, so it's independent of which one you choose. So, the free energy is defined in the exact same way. And to state the results, so I remember I had the Bernoulli numbers. I had the Bernoulli numbers before, but I actually need to use the Bernoulli polynomials now. Sorry, not just the Bernoulli polynomials, the higher, the multiple Bernoulli polynomials, in particular, the double Bernoulli polynomials. So there's this, this is the definition for arbitrary integer n of the multiple Bernoulli polynomial. I care about the double pernability polynomial with the following parameters. So a1, so there's an a1 and an a2, and I want minus beta to the half and beta. want minus beta to the half and beta to the minus half. And I'll use the shorthand b22g to mean b22g with those parameters. Right. Which square root? Oh, no. Well, in fact, it doesn't even depend on like it doesn't. Depend on like it depends only on q on beta to the half minus beta to the minus half. So I guess it'll be a sign as a yeah, it doesn't depend on. Okay, so the theorem that we have for now, this part is proved, is that we have an analogous expression to what I showed you earlier from Iwaki, Koike, and Take. Earlier from Iwaki, Koike, and Take, where the free energy now has this B22G expression where, right, so here I need to explain the notation, which is just that, well, it's just the shorthand. So remember, I had mu p associated to p in p prime plus. So I'm just So, I'm just denoting that by μ here because there's only one parameter. So, I have mu and I have m. Okay. And actually, this is well, okay, so you remember that mu was defined, or mu had the property, it's the coefficient of eta p in omega half one. So, that's that's where mu appears. Remember, mu appears in omega half one and then propagates elsewhere to the rest of the different. Elsewhere to the rest of the differentials. But yeah, so you notice that, okay, so there's a single term here like we had before, but this time we actually have two terms. Very strange. And in fact, you might even notice that what are these two terms? It's this term shifted by q to the half in one direction and in the other direction. q over the half. Q over two, sorry. And this is not a coincidence. So, this is reflective of the so-called PPS structure involved, which we'll see if I get to that. And it's not hard to show that, furthermore, for the other two examples, to Jenner-Bassel, and Ari, that the free energy vanishes. And we have an explicit expression for all of the hypergeometric dead curves. We've checked experimentally and we. Experimentally, and we know it's going to be true, but we have difficulty proving it, which I'll explain why in a second. Yeah, okay. Okay, so how should we prove this? The technique is similar to that of the original Iwaki Koykitake paper. So you have to consider something called the Voro. You have to consider something called the Voros coefficient. And the word there, I'm not explaining what a Voros coefficient is, but the word there comes from WKB analysis. So in this whole thing, you can set up, you can define a wave function and ask for the quantum curve which kills that wave function. And that's going to be some Schrödinger operator with a potential depending on h bar. But when you have a Schrödinger operator, depending on h bar, you can apply. Depending on H-bar, you can apply WKB analysis, and then it turns out that this quantity is an important invariant called the Boros coefficient. So the definition is just the following. So you might imagine that this kind of quantity without the derivative there, this kind of quantity is what would appear if you wanted to define the wave function. And indeed, if you set beta equals one, you'll see that that's exactly the thing that appears in the wave function in the usual TR. The exponential. The exponential of that. So, in the refined case, you just get this beta to the n over 2 at the bottom and proceed, continue to proceed. And here, this infinity minus infinity plus means, right, it means that I'm just taking the pre-images of under x of infinity. So, remember, I had my x and my y were parameterizing these curves. These curves. So x equals infinity means, depending on the parameterization, I guess. So in the case that I showed earlier, which was like, I don't remember what it was, but it should be plus and minus one, I think, because the ramification points were zero and infinity. And the, yeah, then infinity plus minus will be minus one. And sorry, I'll go from minus. One and sorry, I'll go from minus one to one, plus one. Um, and yes, sorry, this this is sorry, this is a typo. So because I've only done the one integral with the one parameter m, I actually don't have so many parameters here. In general, it would look like this, but actually, I just have one. Sorry, two. I just have Okay, so I just don't have to worry about all those new p's. It's just there's a new infinity plus and a new infinity minus, and I will define. minus and I will define later on I will use new to denote new infinity plus minus nu infinity minus so these are some arbitrary parameters as well these these parametriz the the quantum curve so in fact the there's you can define the wave function and any value of will give you a different wave function and you can ask the question of can Ask the question of: Can I find a quantum curve for that wave function? And the answer is yes. But the point is that you will get that many quantum curves. So you have a continuous parameter, a continuous family of quantum curves corresponding to the different choices of new. The integral over D. Oh. Sorry. Yeah. So integral over D of something is going to be Is going to be sum over yeah sorry from P to Z yeah sorry yes that's important okay so okay so so the proof Okay, so the proof relies on the following relation. So, first, define F to be the total free energy. So, it's this h bar to the 2G minus 2 times the Fgs. I omitted the definition of F0 and F1, but those are also there. You can define them. Sorry. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. There will be an F half, yes. So, right, and but you can see here, okay, so this was a formal series in H bar with an infinite series, and this is a formal series in H bar. And in fact, it turns out in the unrefined case, it's known by a wakikoikitake that this kind of relation holds. So, as formal power series, the coefficients in H bar of this, of both sides of this expression, they're equal. Equal? Sorry, lower order. Sorry. Sorry, low order. What I mean is that there's like maybe something like at the H bar to the zero and H bar to the one or something, but the rest is perfect equality for the higher H bar. Okay, sorry. So this is an equality of formal power series. So this is a formal power series. This is a formal power series. This is a formal power series. Series, this is a formal power series, a formal power series, and this is like h part of the zero and h part of the one or something. Yeah, yeah. Sorry, maybe I should have said that, said that better. So is it clear? It's just a couple of terms corresponding to h part of the zero, h part of the one. But then if you go to h part of the five, then it's just, it's just this. I just, it's just ugly. I didn't want to write it down. So, okay, so this kind of relation holds in the unrefined case. And once you have that relation, you can do something, you use something called the classical contiguity equations for various classical ODEs to show, which tells you that Voros coefficients for one. For one parameter, one value of are related to Voros coefficients of a different value of. And that allows you to relate, to get a four-term relation between F. Okay, so you get a difference equation for F by using the relation between V. But before you do that, you have to establish this kind of relation. And we find that, in fact, there is this one in the refined case, but only. Refined case, but only when you do something simple like the Weber and the Whitaker. So this is not true when Q of X dx squared, don't worry about that too much, whenever this Q has a second order pole, then I'll run into trouble. And this actually doesn't hold. So there's got to be some correction term. And even when it is true, then there are complications in what I'm going to tell you next. And what's what I'm going to tell you next. So, why? So, I didn't introduce the wave function, but roughly speaking, v is like taking a limit of this kind of object here. So, when you write down, when you write down v, you have to do a bunch of these integrals, sum them up, and take the exponential. But. But this is actually not necessarily continuous. Okay. So that means that when I want to calculate this thing, right, I want to take the limit, like I want to use the fundamental theorem of calculus, and I want to just take the limit. I want to take infinity plus and infinity minus. I just want to insert them in where z is, okay, right. But in fact, I can't do that because the limit does not actually commute. So in this Whitaker case, we can imagine Q, we can take something like Q0 equals, yeah, we can take the Qi's to be something like minus one. So that's like infinity minus. So in the case where Qi's are all minus one, so you want to take the integral from minus one to Take the integral from minus one to p and take the limit as p is approaching one and compare it with this, and it's just not true. So it's more complicated. The actual expression is more complicated, but the following toy example tells you roughly what's actually happening here. So it's the following phenomenon. So imagine that you want to integrate this multi-differential, okay? Imagine that this kind of thing is going to happen. In practice, what you're going to do is you want And in practice, what you're going to do is you want to integrate omega half two. But this is a toy example. So imagine that you end up with something like this. And you can see then the pole structure that this has the structure that I mentioned earlier. So you have poles at zero and infinity, the ramification points, but then you also have the pole at this conjugate diagonal. So zeta zero equals sigma of zeta. equals sigma of zeta one. Right? Okay, so if we try this out on this toy example, we see that integrating from minus one to one, we get zero. And yet if we integrate from minus one to z, we get this other expression here, which in fact, when we take the limit as z goes to one, is minus one. So the limit doesn't commute. And you can see kind of why. And you can see kind of why, which is that if you were to just take an arbitrary a here instead of with a not equal to minus one, then the expression is actually looks like this. And what happens is that if you set a to minus one, then you have this kind of cancellation here. And this thing, which previously was not contributing, ends up giving you other minus one. So this sort of phenomenon happens. This sort of phenomenon happens, and this is what we're trying to stop, and what indeed doesn't happen for these examples. Yeah, so this bad phenomenon happens when we run into second-order polls. And so, in order to proceed, then we just were stuck. So, it's not a very good solution, which is to just consider the ones where it works. Uh what do you mean well it relies on I mean the proof relies on having to to to evaluate this and you want to evaluate yeah why I mean like Why? I mean, like, I guess I'm trying to explain that this is why. I don't know how else to explain it. I mean, okay, the other way to explain it is that the proof involves having to show that a limit commutes with an integral. And so what we end up having to do is that you need to show that the integrands are uniformly bounded and then apply the dominated convergence theorem. So, surprisingly, I had to do analysis in order to do this. And And yeah, it was very painful. It was a very painful experience. But yeah, so the answer is that it's just not uniformly bounded. Treating Z as a parameter, the integrands are not uniformly bounded. You can check this if you want on a computer. If you want to plot it, you can see what happens. Right. So, right. And then, as I said, once you've established that relation. Once you've established that relation, then you can just use the relations between Boros coefficients to get a relation for f. And in particular, you get this. So, oh, I should write this down. So, the notation here is that epsilon one is h bar beta to the half, epsilon two is h bar beta minus h bar beta to the minus. Minus h bar beta to the minus. So, right, in the unrefined case, this collapses to a three-term relation, but here there are four terms. And in fact, you get a difference equation like this. So, delta of f is equal to log of m plus this mu thing. And likewise, for Whitaker, you get the same thing with two terms. And so now. Two terms. And so now you can guess why there's two terms that appear in the two Bernoulli Bernoulli terms that appeared in the free energy for Whitaker. Right. And then from this thing, you can solve this difference equation. And so finally, yeah, so that brings us back to the main theorem. So the theorem is that for the Weber and the Whitaker, we have the explicit expression like this, and for Aerie, we have zero, fg equals zero. Zero, Fg equals zero, Arian vessel. And I'm gonna, oh, I have lots of time. Okay, so I was gonna say, I was gonna say, just mention things that we might study in the future. So certainly we need to complete the other cases. And we need to think about how to generalize this to higher genus, particularly to higher degree as well, when we don't have an involution on our hands. On our hands. We are trying to understand the relation to Donald's and Thomas theory, which has, you can see my work with Nick Williams to see that it doesn't quite work as we hoped, but yeah, we'll report on that, more of that later someday. Certain Riemann Hilbert problems formulated by Bridgland, Barbieri, and Stupa. It seems that we should be able to provide a solution to that. Provide a solution to that, either that or some closely related Riemann-Hilbert problem using these results. And I would like to say that this is just the first thing that I've studied with the refined formalism. So more generally, there's all sorts of things that I would like to study and that I would like people here who maybe know more than I do about other things. I don't know that much about the classical applications of TR, like these enumerative applications and things like that. So I'd like to study all sorts of whatever. study all sorts of whatever we can about the refined case and extend extend those kinds of results. I still have time, so let me try to let me see what I can manage to extract from this these bonus slides. Okay, there's like a million of them and I don't think they're in order, but let me okay. Yeah, let me try. Let me try to get something out of this. Okay, right. So, so a BPS structure. Okay, so let me just switch topics now. So I'm going to now, I told you the computation of F and I told you some explicit expression, but I would like to interpret that as something nice, something interesting, you know, just, I mean, it's just an expression on a page. But like, what is it, you know, is there some geometric? You know, is there some geometric interpretation of that? The answer is yes. And it involves BPS structures. So this basically involves, this is the structure that appears in 4D n equals to quantum field, supersymmetric quantum field theory when you want to study BPS particles. And the same structure appears at Donaldson-Thomas theory. So somehow it seems to be very Somehow it seems to be very important structure. It appears. So, yeah, I would say I would attribute it to both Konsevich Slobelman, Bridgland. So, Bridgland defined it actually, but the ideas are also present in Geltomornsky, Konsevich Soibelman. And yeah, Ridgeland. So, okay, so the data of a BPS structure involves three things. So I have a lattice gamma, so I call it the charged lattice. So it's a finite rank freebeling group with an anti-symmetric pairing, together with a homomorphism, which in practice for us would. Which, in practice, for us would end up being given by something like. Okay, so this part is like not properly structured. So let me say that for us, gamma would be something like the first homology of the spectral curve punctured where there are poles, where there are poles of y dx, and z of a homology class. Z of a homology class would just be integration along z of idx. Okay, and then in addition to this data, then the non-trivial part is that I have a map of sets, which takes a point in the lattice and gives me some element of Of the rationals, the polynomial in some formal variable that I call L to the half. I'm sorry for that, but it's just a formal symbol. And I think of these coefficients omega sub n as, you can think of that this map omega is just a list of coefficients, omega sub n, one for every gamma. And it should be symmetric when I flip the sine of gamma. And there should be this thing called the support property, which says that this central charge map doesn't become arbitrarily small. Sorry, central charge divided by norm doesn't get arbitrarily small for vectors with non-zero omega. I got to keep track of the time. Okay, so there's some words. These gammas that have non-zero omega, they're supposed to be correspond to BPS states in the physical picture. And I often use the letter Q, which is minus L of the half. Okay, so one way to interpret what part of what Galto Mordonitsky did is that they gave a construction of BPS structures. So, and they did it much more generally. So, and they did it much more generally, where you have instead of like double covers, you would have higher degree, higher degree, and all sorts of complicated phenomenon. It's very, yeah, it's very hard to understand the higher degree cases. But choose something called a meromorphic quadratic differential. So, whatever q of x dx squared is, it's this type of object. And if And if this has a simple pole, then I want to fill it in. So I don't want to take the punctures, I don't want to puncture it at all of the poles, but just at the ones that don't correspond to simple poles. Right, okay, this is kind of what I wrote there, but a little bit different. Just ignore it. So, okay, so now given this Q of X. Given this q, I can define a foliation of the complex plane, or of p1 rather, given by the following equation, which determines a bunch of trajectories of some given phase theta. So if I pick a real number and call that a phase, then I get a foliation for every possible value of theta. In practice, what it looks like is like things like this. like things like this. So if q of x was some constant over x squared, I would get a bunch of trajectories. So the green would be like theta equals, I think theta equals zero, and the blue is theta equals pi over two. You get pictures like this near a second order pole and pictures like this near a simple zero, simple pole, and these higher order poles. So, right, so the q of x determines some sort of geometric structure infoliation on p1. And in fact, there's it's known that exactly five things can happen. So, sorry, normally I draw this on my tablet, but it's not it's not here. So, so exactly five things can happen for the leaves. So, either you have Have either you have a so-called saddle saddle is a trajectory that goes between Between either simple poles or simple zeros of Q. Okay, so a saddle connects to zeros or simple poles. A separating trajectory does. A separating trajectory does start from one, but it ends up somewhere else on a pole. The generic trajectories, which are in fact most of the ones that you saw there, those go from some pole of Q to another pole of Q, excluding the simple poles. And then there's closed trajectories. And then those closed trajectories, which look like that. And then something that don't worry about it. It doesn't happen in these cases. Yeah, so there's a classification of trajectories. And right, so in fact, every saddle or closed trajectory has a canonical lift. So these pictures that you just saw, those are drawn. Pictures that you just saw, those are drawn on the X projection of P1. But I can actually lift those up to the original spectral curve itself, up to a sign. And the way I do it is if I see some picture like this in the foliation, so this is a branch cut to depict the cover, but this is say two zeros. I take the curve encircling that. Encircling the saddle, and then I just lift it upstairs and to either sheet, and that's perfectly well defined up to sign. As long as well, yeah, that should be well defined. This should maybe be, this should be actually anti-invariant. I should take the anti-invariant cycles. Okay, and so this is a generalization of the BPS structure determined by Gautama Ronitsky and by Bridgeland Smith, where sorry, did I write that? Yeah, okay. So remember, I wrote q to the half is minus l to the half, but so I'm saying that omega sub l. the half but so i'm saying that omega sub n omega sub one uh is non-zero here and here omega sub two omega sub zero and omega sub minus two are non-zero here and here omega zero is non-zero and omega uh plus one uh is non-zero so uh i claim that that this is uh this is the correct uh Correct refined VPS structure to introduce. And if you notice that if you send Q to one, sorry, if you send Q to the half to one, then you'll get the number plus one plus two plus four minus one minus two. So, right, so those are recognizable as Dominus-O-Thomas invariants. But this refined case is sort of done partly by guesswork by me and Kento in order to make this formula work, which I'll show you in a second. Which I'll show you in a second. So the geometric interpretation is not entirely clear. And just before I show you the formula, let me give you just a simple example of the BPS structure that you would see for Weber, which is you take, so you have Q that looks like this, and then you rotate theta. So this is for some value of theta. This is for you shift theta a little bit until you hit this kind of critical value, and then you keep moving and you see this kind of picture. See this kind of picture. So, most of the time, you see this kind of non-degenerate picture where you just see these separating trajectories. I've just drawn the separating and saddle ones here because, yeah, secretly, these are there filling up most of the rest of the space, but these are the important ones. So, the separating trajectories kind of fly off to infinity here, but in this critical picture, they collide. And that is exactly the point where I'm supposed to. the the the point where i'm supposed to give you the i'm supposed to take the canonical lift get a get a homology class upstairs and declare that it's uh that it has bps invariant non-zero equal to one right and that actually is why you should that corresponds exactly to the fact that you had that bernoulli uh b2g in the in the original formula of iwaki koike take you had b2g there with a plus one With a plus one next to it. And then, if you remember, the Whitaker had a plus two. And that's because, well, basically, because from geometry, that this should be plus two when you have the same kind of collision in the Whitaker case. The Whitaker case, well, the point to note is that this is a simple zero and this is a simple zero of Q Weber. Okay. In the Whitaker case, Okay, in the Whitaker case, you don't have that, you have a simple zero and then a simple pole. So it's some kind of different kind of collision. And when you get a collision between simple zero and simple pole, geometry says it should be plus two. Right. And then this is the main example where you have actually seven up to sign, seven collisions. Collisions. And this is exactly the inspiration for the original formula that I wrote with Koiwaki, where so they showed in their original paper their grand example was this one. And you see exactly here the seven terms in the free energy corresponding to these seven pictures. Okay. So the idea is that the terms in the free energy correspond to the degenerate, the saddle trajectories in the quadratic differential. In the quadratic differential. So we wrote this formula like this. So they had an expression for Fg, but then we managed to show that it actually satisfies this formula. So it can be interpreted in this way, where the BPS structure omega and Z is defined through that procedure that I just mentioned. So that was our previous result. That was the one we were trying to refine. And this is our theorem rewritten. This is our theorem rewritten, which we claim holds in general. I think that's the last slide. Yeah. Okay.
