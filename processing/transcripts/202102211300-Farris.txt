Thanks so much, Parker, and thanks to all the organizers. I'm really delighted to be here. I've very much enjoyed the conference so far. It really does seem like a place where people come from many different kinds of backgrounds to share ideas in a very kind and supportive atmosphere. So I'm really delighted. I think that we all need a feeling of community these days. And this has made me feel like, yeah, I'm here. Made me feel like, um, yeah, I'm here among my tribe, many of whom I didn't even know before. So, I'm going to begin my screen share and show my slides here. I'm going to be telling you about wallpaper patterns from looping strands with an emphasis on the layer groups. And since gear includes education, art, and research, I want to, here's my sort of summary of what I'm going to do in the talk. In the talk, and I'm having trouble advancing to the next slide. There we go. So, many of you might be maybe teaching students about wallpaper patterns or using wallpaper patterns in some kind of artistic practice. And I think the takeaway from this talk is that anything that you can do with wallpaper patterns, you can generalize it to three-dimensional patterns, like the looping pattern here, where if you ignore the over-under crossings, you might think of Under crossings, you might think of this as a wallpaper pattern if you were to squash it flat. But with these over-under crossings, the correct way to talk about it is a pattern invariant under one of the layer groups. So then before we begin, I did have a couple things that I wanted to say. I wanted to provide the Santa Clara University land acknowledgement to acknowledge that we are working on the land of the Ohlone and the Muekma Ohlone people who have Ohlone people who have lived in this area for thousands, you know, more than 1,500 years. And so an acknowledgement is good, but if you feel moved to do something about it, our environmental sciences department has made us aware of the Protect Juristak project. This is a project of the Amamutsen band of the Ohlone people who are trying to prevent their sacred lands from having a gravel and sand mine developed there. So, if anyone is interested, Developed there. So, if anyone is interested in there's a protect Juristac, all you have to remember is the name of Juristac. I also want to say that here we are in the golden section of the MAA, which is the section of the Mathematical Association of America with the best name. And the golden section encompasses Northern California, Nevada, Hawaii, and Guam. And we're having a section meeting next week. And really, anyone can come. That's the amazing thing about our pandemic. The amazing thing about our pandemic times is that anyone can attend a conference anywhere. You can register and attend for free. We're going to be both on Zoom and in a platform called Gather Town, which is sort of like a mashup of a video game from the 80s and Zoom. So you can see and hear people, but only when you're near them. So please go and register for that. So I wanted to start by talking about an earlier project from last year, which was Mathematical Chainmail. Here are two examples. chainmail. Here are two examples, and I think that people familiar with wallpaper patterns might read these as wallpaper. I'll tell you a little bit more about that. You can read this paper from Bridges from last year. And this got me into thinking about woven objects. And maybe weaving is not exactly the right word, maybe looping or linking or something like that. But this was my first work in a sort of a three-dimensional version of Sort of a three-dimensional version of wallpaper patterns. And I have to say that when I wrote that paper, I didn't understand a key point about the layer groups that I'm going to share with you today. So, and this is all because I was fortunate to spend the fall 19 semester at ICERM, the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics. They had an illustrating mathematics semester, and I was able to be there for all fall. When you are in their lecture hall at the top of a building, you can see. The top of a building. You can see out. This is toward the Brown campus. The tower in the back left is their science building. When you give a lecture, this is your view. That's the Rhode Island Supreme Court there. And Glenn Whitney got us doing a math installation there. It was a wonderful time. It was so inspiring. It was really kind of like this conference, only as if it had gone on for a whole semester. So at that conference, Dave Bachman, whom I want to thank, taught me how to use grad. Think taught me how to use Grasshopper as a Rhino plug-in. And so, what do those words mean? Rhino is an architectural program designed for architects, but Grasshopper gives a method so that mathematicians and other kinds of programming users can control it. So, in order to make Chainmail, I would view a screen like this one where I would see the links over on the right, and the code that I would use to make those links is over here on the left. So these boxes. Over here on the left. So these boxes contain formulas, and you can see that these are exponential formulas. These are making links out of e to the i theta kinds of formulas like that. And then I have little sliders here that allow me to control some of the parameters of these. So it's really easy to write down formulas for things that have the right symmetry, but what I really needed for the chainmail project was the ability to wiggle all the little parameters in those formulas. In those formulas. So that's how I did all of this. Then last summer, I saw this quilt, or I don't know, a little comforter pattern. My sister-in-law had brought this to a place we share in the Sierra Nevada. And I looked at that and thought, oh yeah, I guess I could make that. So yeah, here is my model of that thing. And then that gave me the ambition to really try to investigate how I could make all things like this. All things like this. And so that's the talk I'm going to give you today. So the question is: what is the correct language to talk about the symmetry of this pattern? Because you might say it's a wallpaper pattern, but if you classify it as a wallpaper pattern, you might miss the idea about the over-under things here. So to say more about that, about why wallpaper is not exactly the right term here, I want to go back to these chainmail examples. Examples. So let me draw your attention to this would-be mirror axis. So this is a three-dimensional object. And as you look at these individual links, you see that they are the same on both sides. And so that here where it's down on one side, it's down on the other side. So I would say that this mirror axis has been extended to a three-dimensional mirror plane. A very different thing happens over here. thing happens over here, where what was up on one side of the mirror axis becomes down on the other side of the mirror axis. So this thing that was a mirror symmetry of a wallpaper pattern has now become a rotational symmetry where those links turn over. And in a way, this is the punchline of the talk. Anytime you have a mirror in a wallpaper pattern, you can either think of it as an actual side-to-side mirror or a turnover. Mirror or a turnover. So then, since these are not really wallpaper pattern actions, you know, you can't talk about a wallpaper turning over really. Maybe you can, but the correct terminology is to say that these are invariant under layer groups. I'm going to give definitions for these terms for people who might need them, but first let's talk a little bit more about them. So, wallpaper symmetry is for plane patterns. So, here I invite you to look at this pattern and enjoy it. You to look at this pattern and enjoy it and ponder how the pattern at the top was somehow made from the photograph on the bottom. And it's a little bit of a sore point for me when someone like an editor will say, well, why don't you just write a sentence about how you turned that photograph into that pattern? And leaving me to say, I can write you a 10-page paper about how I did that, but to write a sentence about that is very, very challenging. Anyway, there is a relationship between those. Is a relationship between those things. So, when I look at this and try to explain its patternness, the conclusion is that it has symmetry group PG. Let me explain. It's not parental guidance. It's for primitive cell with a glide in it. And to help you see that, I'm going to draw this axis and say, yeah, this pattern does not have mirror symmetry across that axis. But if you flip across that axis and slide down, then the pattern falls into coincidence. Pattern falls into coincidence with itself. So, this has sort of a flip and slide motion. You reflect and then pull down. There's also a parallel glide axis here. So this is vocabulary that I really like to encourage people to use correctly, is to say, what is a symmetry of a pattern? It is a transformation that leaves the pattern unchanged. If you look at the collection of all those transformations that leave the pattern, Those transformations that leave the pattern unchanged. That forms a group because that set of transformations is closed under composition. And then the amazing thing, which I imagine people know, is that there's only 17 of these things. But you can't say there are 17 groups. You have to say there are 17 isomorphism classes of wallpaper groups. So again, wallpaper symmetry is for plane patterns. And here's an example of a, let's see, what is this? Oh, yeah, there's a horizontal glide X. There's a horizontal glide axis now, but all that is present here is translational symmetry and this glide symmetry with that axis and then another parallel axis. And this was one of the illustrations for my paper called Vibrating Wallpaper in 1998. That's communications in visual mathematics. And you can see that my visual style has evolved quite a bit since then. This is a pattern is not exactly pretty, but it was the best I could. Exactly pretty, but it was the best I could do in the context of the technology of the time. And so I was surprised to see that when I went to look up the term layer groups, which I had heard of, they cited this article from 1998. So showing me that in fact, I had written about the layer groups somehow without knowing. So I thought that was really a screen. That, you know, what, was there some other episode in my life where I had written about it? Episode in my life where I had written about layer groups? Well, the answer is that there's a connection between layer groups and something that I have written about. So these 3D patterns have layer group symmetry. So to show you an example of that, I want to show you, now that we have that group PG in mind, I want to show you two different layer group extensions of the wallpaper group PG. So here is one. Have a look at that. Let your eyes find the symmetry there, find the things that. There, find the things that are the same. I see a translation up and down. I see a large translation side to side. Here, you might do the same. Now, when I translate down, I have to go farther. That's interesting. But when I look side to side, let's get pictures. Let's get these glide axes here. On the left, when I flip and slide, what was What was an undercrossing or a down becomes an up there? So here, this glide symmetry has been implemented as a flip and slide, which actually is called a screw motion. So that's a screw motion there. Whereas in the right-hand pattern, that's been implemented as an actual glide. There's mirror symmetry here. If you were to do a perfect mirror of this across the white axis and slide. Cross the white axis and slide, then the pattern would match. So here I've taken that glide and I've implemented it as a thing that stays the same as a mirror or a thing that flips. Let's develop some better vocabulary for how to talk about those. So here's the vocabulary. Just to be clear, a wallpaper group is a group of Euclidean isometries of the plane whose translations can be generated by two linearly independent translations. And as I said, there are several. Translations. And as I said, there are 17 of these. What is a layer group? It's a group of Euclidean isometries of space whose translations can all be generated by two linearly independent translations. And from that condition, you can prove that it must have an invariant plane. So there is sort of a bottom there, you know, a place where you could think of it as being sort of like wallpaper. But with this new definition, there are now 80 of these things. And it's always true that if you have a layer group, Always true that if you have a layer group and you ask, oh, layer group, what are you doing to that invariant plane? Then that has to be a wallpaper group. So somehow the layer groups sort of are extensions of wallpaper groups to space. So here's some notation. I want to write individual transformations with complex notation. Apologies to anyone to whom that's not familiar. We won't be using that much. But the glide reflection in our examples is you conjugate and then slide. So I'm going to. And then slide. So I'm going to flip and slide. So that is captured by the formula z-bar, which is the flip, and add a half in the real direction, which looks like that. So, and then I'm just going to say notation-wise that the groups are named by the International Crystallographic Union symbols. For instance, one of those chain mails is properly called P3M1. And if you love orbifold notation, you can always translate into that other notation. That particular one is star 333. That particular one is star 333. So let's think about extending transformations to space. If you have one of these wallpaper transformations, like that sigma sub y, you can always extend it to space by doing nothing. So here I'm taking coordinates where z is a coordinate in the plane, that's x plus iy, and I'm just doing something in the plane. And here this w is an upward variable, and I'm just leaving that upward variable the same. So that's called the trivial. The same. So that's called the trivial extension. Another thing you can do is to compose that with a flip where I take the w-axis and just negate it. So I'm going to call that a flip extension when I take my wallpaper transformation, like maybe that glide, and compose it with this flip mirror. You can count the 80 groups now pretty easily. Each of the 17 wallpaper groups has what's called the trivial extension. You just take everything in it and you let it act on. Take everything in it and you let it act on space. Each of the 17 wallpaper groups has a double extension where you allow all the transformations in the group and you put that mirror in as well. So let me show you an example of these two things. I took that PG pattern and I flattened it out. This was made of pipes and now the pipes merrily pass through one another. And suppose that these pipes were now round on top, but actually flat. On top, but actually flat on the bottom. Then I would call that the trivial extension of PG because all you can do is move things without turning over. If it's round on the top and bottom, then that would have a mirror symmetry relative to the xy plane, and that's the double extension. So those are sort of the easy trivial things that you can do. And so that's 17 plus 17 is 34. And when you take 34 from 80, what's left? Those are 46. What's left? Those are 46. Now, people who work in wallpaper, the number 46 is very special. This is exactly the same as the number of ways of counting different types of color symmetry. And that's why the Wikipedia article thought that I had written about the layer groups, because I have indeed written a lot about color symmetry. So let's think about how we think, how we count these layer groups. To extend a wallpaper group, you're going to leave. Group. You're going to leave in a non-trivial way. You're going to leave some of the elements with their trivial extension and some as their flip extension. So some you're just going to do and some you're going to turn over as you do. But the thing is that if you do one as a mirror and another as a mirror, then the composition of those has to be leave the W axis right side up. So the composition of two flips has to be irregular or a trivial extension. trivial extension. So this means that we get a homomorphism from our group to the group 0, 1, where the 0 stands for don't flip, the 1 stands for do flip. This is extremely beautiful and it mortifies me to go over it very quickly, but you extend these elements by the element G in the wallpaper group goes to composing that G with this symmetry. Like for instance, oh yeah, this is the flip, the mirror flip. mirror flip and you either do that or don't that don't do that according to whether g is tagged with a zero or tagged with a one it turns out one of those famous phrases in mathematics that there are 46 equivalence classes of such homomorphisms that's why there are 46 layer groups so you can read about it in this book that i would like to commend to you although if you do buy my book please be aware that there are typos and you need to download my errata page Download my errata page, more crept through than anyone would have liked. But I really do go through an explanation of this fact about why there are 46 color group type or color symmetry types. So let's work through an example to get toward closing. Here's a pattern that I find beautiful and pleasing, and I'd like you to look at it in stages. So first look at just the gold strands, and in fact, if you'll focus on one horizontal if you'll focus on one horizontal gold strand, you'll see that it simply has repeat symmetry. So there repeats to there. Okay, so that is the symmetry of one of these bands is simple repetitive symmetry. Then I've taken four of those bands, for instance, and positioned them around a center of rotation here. And then I've repeated those infinitely so that I now have an infinite array of gold bands. And if I think Gold bands. And if I think about the symmetry of those gold bands, the symmetry group is P4, because I have now a grid of centers of fourfold rotational symmetry. Even if the silver strands aren't there, this is a center of fourfold rotational symmetry at the center there. There are centers of two-fold rotational symmetry there, there, there, and there. That group is P4. Now, I'm going to take this mirror axis and turn the gold strands over to create. Turn the gold strands over to create the silver strands. Notice that this changes every overcrossing of gold and silver to an undercrossing of silver and gold. So when we do that, the new symmetry group is an extension of the group P4G, which has this diagonal glide or diagonal mirror in it, is how I think of P4G. The Coxeter notation for this type would therefore be P4G over P4. For people who P4. For people who love group theory, the fact is that P4 is a normal subgroup of P4G, and that's another way to count. How many ways can one wallpaper group be a normal subgroup of another wallpaper group? The IUC notation for this layer group is P42 sub 1, 2. And so you can imagine that the 4 is for fourfold rotations, the 2 is for the actual two-fold rotations, and the 2 sub 1 is for a screw motion. Is for a screw motion. If you take a vertical axis like this and flip and slide, like literally flip and slide, then that is a screw motion that is denoted by the two sub one. So it's just would be impossible for me to show you too many examples, but oh, here is a chainmail pattern that has exactly the same symmetry. And I just love this pattern, so I couldn't resist showing it to you close up. The way these weave with one another is just Way these weave with one another is just so completely beautiful to me. So, as part of my paper for bridges, I'm providing a table to translate among these terminologies. And you could put I'm going to post this, I think, someday to Wikipedia so that I would like to improve the page on layer groups so that it actually does have some more useful information than to refer to a very old article of mine. So, here's one more that I just wanted to show. Each of the and to say I'll just Uh, each of and to say just a very little bit about how I made these things. Each one of these strands is made from a Fourier series that has the desired symmetry. So my whole shtick is to make things out of Fourier symmetry. This starts as a curve and then it gets expanded in Grasshopper with Rhino, Rhino with Grasshopper to be a little pipe. And I might call that a rod symmetry. Oh, that's a subject for another investigation or talk, because this really sort of wants to have Sort of wants to have P1M1 symmetry, which is the symbol for a freeze with a vertical mirror, except that that's not really a mirror, that's a turnover symmetry. So I might call that P1M1 over P111. And then I move those out by rotations by 120 degrees. And then the only other thing is I start with a formula that has the symmetry in it, and then I wiggle the parameters until the pattern weaves itself. So I would love to see you at Bridges in 2021. This is going to be the topic of my Bridges presentation, but of course at Bridges, there's always too many talks to go to. And at that, I'm going to emphasize more the artistic aspect. Today I wanted to focus on things for educators and for working artists who might use these ideas to think about their own creations that are based on wallpaper. Wow. Thank you. Wow. Thank you so much. That was an incredible tour of the subject and so fast, so well delivered. Do we have any questions for our speaker? Yeah, you mentioned crystallographic groups. And so my undergrad degree is in chemistry, and we thought a little about these sort of finite cells, and you turned them into crystals. Is there a difference between extending to To these layers versus extending fully to a crystal, a 3D crystal? When you typically, I mean, these are crystallographic groups. So there is a concept of a crystal that simply has just extension on all, you know, up and down directions. So these, like you might think of this as an object where the, like you've cut out a layer from a crystal. You've cut out a layer from a crystal. That's why they're called the layer groups. But the more general groups, the crystallographic groups that are not layer groups are ones that have repetitions in a third direction. So not just repeating in two directions, but repetition in a third direction. The mathematics is the same, and it seems to me that our two communities of chemists and mathematicians and artists might do a better job communicating, and I'm trying to be part of that. And I'm trying to be part of that. Yes, and when you see these patterns sort of weaving in Islamic art, then you might think of it as a three-dimensional thing where that strand really does pass over. And you want to think about, does the transformation turn the overs to the unders, or does it leave the overs and the unders the same? So when you think about something that really does have repeat symmetry, but appears Repeat symmetry, but appears to have over under crossings. You could use this mathematics to classify it, thinking about the layer groups. Does that answer the questions? For instance, in the pattern that is still on the screen, I could imagine sort of flattening that out by hand and broadening the bands. And broadening the bands and really making that look like something that is, you know, maybe instead of the perfectly smooth curves, I might turn those into angles, something like that. What else? So, I think this was addressed in the talk, but these are like proper group extensions. So, yeah. For group extensions. So there's a version of all this, all this layer group classification that goes by like group cohomology, group extension theory, that kind of thing. Yes. Okay. I'm not, that's not my strength, but yes. Go ahead. I think this particular design would look nice if you made the loops a little bigger and you could have them linked like across the triangles. Do you see what I mean? Yeah. Do you see what I mean? Yeah, because, and I, you know, with each of these, the pattern that I'm showing you is the one that I thought, yeah, that's about as good as I can do before I have to stop and go eat dinner or something like that. So with every one of these patterns, definitely things could improve. And I could imagine, like, as you're saying, that these come up into this negative area and link with one another in an interesting way. Yeah. Yeah, and the same goes with the color choices and with really everything. My intention here is to create illustrations of the symmetry types and, you know, admit that probably somebody else is going to make a more beautiful one than I know how to make. I did have one more image, not to interrupt questions, but let's see. Whoops. There. Oops. There. This sort of came to me out of left field that this is knots instead of the looping bands that I talked about. But here, think of this rhombus as a fundamental cell of a torus. And because every one of these knots links with six, the other six colors, this is a way to show that you definitely must have seven colors in order to. Have seven colors in order to color a Taurus. What else can I help you with? Well, if you have questions that didn't get answered, I'd be happy to talk with you offline. We're probably now getting ready to switch over to the next talk in this room. Yeah, so let's thank our speaker once again. That was absolutely wonderful, Frank. Once again, that was absolutely wonderful, Frank. Beautiful. Thank you.
