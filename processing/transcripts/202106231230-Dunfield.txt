Surface is in my manifold up to up to isotope. Well, before let's think about this in a few basic examples, right? So sometimes, of course, there can be infinitely many such surfaces, right? In the case of the three torus, any essential surface is going to have to be a two-dimensional torus because. Dimensional torus because the fundamental group of the three torus is, of course, Z cubed. The only essential surface is therefore the two torus because subgroup would have to be z squared. And on the other hand, for every non-trivial, sorry, every primitive class in H2 of the torus, you have represented by an essential torus. Represented by an essential torus. So, in this case, here, every essential surface has genus zero, and there's infinitely many of them. So, I guess that's count, infinite. You know, if we instead have a manifold whose fundamental group is finite, then it can have no essential surfaces at all. So then the count is always just zero, which is easy enough. And there are plenty of complicated manifolds, though, which have no closed. No closed essential surfaces. For example, Hatcher and Thurston proved if you take the exterior of any two-bridge knot, those are typically nice hyperbolic manifolds like Dave was talking about last talk. Those still have no closed essential surfaces. So let's look at an example. Maybe first after making a definition. So if our manifold So, if our manifold is atroidal, that is to say, it has no essential tori, then it goes back to Haakon and Waldhausen that for a fixed genus, there are only finitely many surfaces, essential surfaces of that genus up to isotopy. So, one of the main things we'll look at in this talk is this number AM of G. So, it's just the number of genus G essential services in. Genus G essential services in M up to isotopy, moduloisotopy. And of course, except in some sort of degenerate cases, you know, you should think of this as being some hyperbolic manifold, although the hyperbolic geometry will play actually no sort of overt role in this talk. But that is certainly what we're thinking about here is these numbers in hyperbolic manifolds. So let's look at an example. At an example that fits into the theme of this workshop, namely not exterior. So we can take this as the Conway knot and look at its exterior. And it turns out we were able to count the number of essential surfaces in this thing for genuses from one up to 100. So, summarized in this little table. So, there are no essential surfaces of genus zero. That is to say, this is an ateroidal manifold. There are six essential surfaces of genus two, nine of genus three, and so on and so forth, all the way up to 444,038 surfaces of genus 100. Genus 100. So, presented with this list of numbers, well, one natural question is: how do we compute these numbers? And another question is, you know, what's the pattern that these numbers have? And the second question is, actually, I have no idea. So you can take these numbers, you can enter them into the online encyclopedia of integer sequences. It will come back and say, never seen it, no idea. No idea. So, this, best of our understanding, this is just some kind of weird sequence of numbers. I should say, I should have said, you should please interrupt me at any time with questions. You can just start speaking. That's fine. So, these numbers, we don't know what structure they have, but it turns Don't know what structure they have, but it turns out if you count these slightly differently, then the answer does have a sort of quite fixed structure. And let me explain that. That will be our main theorem. So before we were looking at this, which was counting the number of surfaces of a given genus, let's not restrict to surfaces that are connected. That are connected. Let's allow ourselves disconnected but still embedded essential surfaces. And look at this alternate quantity. So this is just the number of essential surfaces whose Euler characteristic is minus n, again, again counted up to isotopy. So for example, if we looked at B of minus four, You know, one thing that contributes to this, so surfaces of oil characteristics is minus four, is surfaces of genus what. Anybody know what surface has oil characteristic minus four and is orientable? Three. Thank you, Dave. So, one thing that contributes to this. Is this previous number a m of 3? Another way we could have a surface of Euler characteristic minus 4 is we could take a surface, a genus 2 surface, and take two little parallel copies of that genus 2 surface. That would have Euler characteristic minus 4. So another term that contributes to this count would be the number of genus 2 surfaces. And then the remaining contribution Remaining contribution would be the number of sort of pairs of disjoint genus II surfaces not isotopic. That would be the third way we could get a surface of Euler characteristic minus four. So we're just going to now go ahead and allow ourselves to have. Ourselves to have these surfaces that are disconnected. And in that case, for the Conway naught here, it turns out we get a very nice formula for the answer. In particular, the number of surfaces of Euler characteristic minus 2n is given exactly by this expression, which is basically a polynomial. Which is basically a polynomial in n, except for the constant coefficient, which I guess is one when n is even. And otherwise, it's three quarters. But it's basically a polynomial. And it turns out that this is not specific, this kind of structure is not specific to the conway. Is not specific to the Conway naught. And in fact, it holds for any atroidal manifold. So this kind of behavior where you have a polynomial where some of the coefficients kind of maybe oscillate modulo n is what's called a quasi-polynomial. And so our main theorem is that for an any ateroidal manifold, the sequence The sequence Bm is a quasi-polynomial. And so, one formal way of saying that is if you look at the generating function for this sequence of numbers, which is the formal power series, then as a formal power series, you can write it as a rational function in two polynomials, rational coefficients, where the denominator. Where the denominator here is a product of cyclotomics. So this is just saying that somehow, more concisely, this sequence is a quasi-polynomial. Which just means that there's some period, like two in the case of this, and there's a list of polynomials, one for each number. For each number, modulo, the period, and your value is take your input, mod the period that tells you which polynomial to look up. Then you plug in the value we're given, and you get this. Nathan? Yes. I'm still a little bit baffled by the three quarters. What does that mean in this context? Well, so that means that if I take an odd number and I plug it into this formula. Number and I plug it into this formula, then I'll get an actual integer out of that expression, which is not obvious. Oh, I see, of course. There are fractions. There are fractions on the other ones as well. Yeah, so this is kind of typical of these things. It's like it's not at all clear looking at this that if I plug in an integer, I'm going to actually get an integer from this polynomial. But in fact, you do. Yeah. Got it. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Thanks. Other questions? Sorry, Nathan. Yes, Mark. You've been saying ateroidal. Do you also need irreducible as well? Otherwise, you could have like a genus 4 surface and a sphere? Yes, so all my manifolds in this talk are irreducible and orientable. Thank you. And all my surfaces are orientable as well. And I'm excluding basically manifolds where there are non-orientable surfaces, which is an interesting question, but not one. Interesting question, but not one that we understand. So, this kind of quasi-polynomial count actually shows up a lot in algebraic combinatorics. It goes back to the 1960s. It shows up counting lattice points in polyhedra, which is how it will actually connect with the story I'm going to tell today. But it appears in lots of other contexts. So, in addition to this sort of structure theorem that says all the counts are always have this kind of simple-ish form. Of simple-ish form. We also, in our paper, which you can find on the archive, produced an algorithm which, given the triangulation of the manifold, actually finds this generating function, finds the polynomials p and q. And so we actually implemented this, and it's what outputs this formula. And for any fixed Euler characteristic, we can actually enumerate. Can actually enumerate all the surfaces of that Euler characteristic, exactly one represented per isotopy class. And if you give us some other essential surface, we can tell you which in our list it is. Are there questions about that? This is like the main theorem. Just quickly back to the formula: BM, when you plug in n equals zero, you get one. But is this manifold not already? Yes, yes, it is a cheroidal. So, so yeah, so n had better be at least one in all this. So, the count is for positive n. The count is for positive n, absolutely. Because as you're right, so this formula here does not, for n equals zero, of this manifold is ateroidal, so we have to get zero. And this formula doesn't work for that. Right, thank you. Yeah. Right, thank you. Yeah, yeah, so implicitly, I'm going to always be thinking here n as positive because I'm thinking about ateroidal manifolds. And so we already know the count for zero. Thank you, Jov. Other questions? Nathan, negative, is it counting something? No, not to the best of my knowledge. Thank you. Thank you. There will be, I should say, to hint at, especially for you, Saul, where this is going to go. These things are related to the work of Mirzakani in counting curves on surfaces by length. So there will be some interpretation of this answer in terms of sort of a space of measured laminations in this manifold. And there is sort of a topological meaning. Well, I mean, there's some topological meaning. Meaning. Well, I mean, there's some topological meaning to, like, for example, the order of this lead term, and it's defined in terms of counting something, but that turns out to be like the dimension of some space of measured laminations. It's one of the things I'll talk about towards the end. All right, so let's say a little bit about, so that was the main theorem. The main theorem. And the next thing I want to tell you about is where this theorem comes from. And then I want to show you some fun examples. We've computed this for, you know, 60,000 manifolds. There are all sorts of interesting patterns and conjectures and things we don't know that I'll talk about in my last 15 minutes. The middle part of the talk is just going to explain where does this come from? And it's going to come from the And it's going to come from the theory of normal surfaces. So remember, a normal surface, so here we have, you know, we have some triangulation of our three-manifold. And then a standard way to come up with algorithms to study surfaces or other things in our manifold is to look at these normal ones. Look at these normal ones, the ones that have a specifically, particularly nice form in terms of the triangulation, namely, they meet each tetrahedra like a union of planes slicing through that tetrahedron. And so there's actually seven ways a plane can cut through a tetrahedron. You can cut off one of the corners. So sort of four little types of triangle that you have, or you can be sort of what's called a quadrilateral. Called a quadrilateral that separates a pair of opposite edges. Like here is another quadrilateral, which intersects the first one. So there are these seven different, what are called elementary disks. And then to keep track of a normal surface, to describe the picture in the tetrahedron, really all I have to do is write down how many disks of each kind I have. Many disks of each kind I have. Let me maybe remove this one here because it gets kind of confusing. You can't have more than one quad at a time. So I can just write down some numbers. Maybe I'll even get rid of this one here. So I can write down seven numbers to describe what my normal surface looks like in a given tetrahedron. So if we have S here normal, this gives us some vector. Some vector in n to the 7t. So here n is the non-negative integers. We get a vector here which describes the surface. And really, this is a bijection up to sort of normal isotopy of our surfaces. So we can then think So, we can then think of these normal surfaces as being encoded by these lists of numbers. And these numbers, these lattice points, they actually live inside a certain polyhedral cone. Because not every, if I just write down a bunch of numbers, non-negative integers, they aren't going to define a normal surface. Because you're going to have conditions, like if this is supposed to be a normal sense, Like, if this is supposed to be this face of this guy, right? We see here this picture where in this triangle, there are two arcs here, one arc here, and two plus one arcs here, three. The two is coming from the triangles, and the other one is coming from the quadrilateral. So, if we had some other tetrahedron. Over here, which is glued to this face, then we have to see over here. We're going to have to see three things here in this corner, and two things here in this corner, and one thing here. And those things could be provided by either quadrilaterals or triangles in this other thing. And you end up, if you think about these as like, Think about these as like having variables like xi, xj, or something for the different numbers of normal disks, your coordinates that you write down are going to satisfy equations that look like this, where this is the number of a particular quad type and a particular triangle in one tetrahedron. This is the triangle and quad type. This is the triangle and quad type that it matches with in an adjacent tetrahedron. So you get this system of homogeneous linear equations that describes a hyperplane, hyper subspace, a subspace in r to the 7t. And then we're interested in the places where the coordinates are non-negative. So it's like you take your positive orphant. You take your positive orphant in r to the 7t and you intersect it with that hyperpline. And when you do that, what you get is a polyhedral cone, which I've tried to draw in this picture. So the setting then is in terms of these normal surface equations, we have this polyhedral cone, that's the blue thing in my picture, and then we have all these lattice points. All these lattice points in this cone, each of which corresponds to some normal surface. And I mean, these equations are homogeneous. That's why you have this cone structure, right? If I take any point, for example, lattice point, I scale it out, it's still going to satisfy these equations. Geometrically, this corresponds to taking your surface and say taking two parallel copies. And say taking two parallel copies, copies of the surface. So, often to visualize this, because drawing this cone is kind of difficult, we could take a slice, like maybe this is where the sum of these coordinates is one, and we could intersect this with the cone. So, that's this triangle cross-section. So, the way I usually be thinking about it is: here's my cone. The way I usually think about it is: here's my cone p of t, but it's the cone over some compact polytope with some number of vertices. And then we'll think about our surfaces as lattice points. Are there questions about this so far? So, reason these normal surfaces are so useful for proving theorems and for creating algorithms is that, for example, Is that, for example, any essential surface can be isotoped into normal form. So we're trying to count essential surfaces. So this is saying we can count the essential normal surfaces. The problem is that any particular surface might be able to be put into many different normal forms. It's almost, it's rarely the case that the resulting normal surface is unique. And so we have all these lattice points, and some of them correspond to essential surfaces, some of them don't. Some of them correspond to the same essential surface. And so we need to figure this out in order to count the essential surfaces. So, one way we can cut down on the ambiguity a little is to look A little is to look at the weight of the surface, which is just the number of times it intersects the one skeleton. You should think about this as like the combinatorial area of the surface. And so, one thing we can do to cut down on the ambiguity is we can look at the least weight or LW surfaces. Or LW surfaces. So these are just the essential normal surfaces that are least weight in their isotopy class. So that's certainly a natural surface to pick out out of this big collection. It's still not always unique. So that it doesn't completely solve our problem of identifying which lattice points we want to count, but it helps a lot because there's this work from Tolfsson in the 90s. Work from Tolfsson in the 90s, building on work of Ortel the decade before, that says that the set of least weight surfaces is highly structured. So maybe we think of our last. In our last thing, we have this space P sub t of this polyhedral cone in which our various lattice points corresponding to the normal surfaces live. And what this theorem here says is that it's not the lattice points that correspond to least weight surfaces are not some willy-nilly collection. Are not some willy-nilly collection of these lattice points. So the least weight surfaces all come on these least weight faces, which are faces of this polytope where every lattice point is a least weight surface. So this theorem says in particular that if, for example, this guy is a least weight surface, that means that everything That everything in the face that contains that is a least weight surface. And then this thing is what I would call a least weight face. And then maybe there's a second least weight face. Maybe this is another least weight face. So it's not at all clear that least weight faces. At all clear that least weight faces exist. This is coming out of Ortel's theory of using branch surfaces to understand the possible essential surfaces. But this turns out to be the case. And moreover, Tolson understood when two least weight surfaces can be isotopic. In particular, they have to belong, if they're isotopic, they have to belong to the same least weight face. Face. So, like these two surfaces, these guys are not isotopic because they're on completely different least weight faces. It might be that, you know, say this guy and this guy are isotopic. When that happens, though, there's some kind of structure here where everything that's sort of on the same sort of a foliation of this thing, everything's on the sort of a foliation of this thing everything's on this sort of some differ by some fixed slope in some sense um is is the same i'm mostly going to since this is a talk i'm going to basically ignore the issue of isotopes um but the the key thing for proving the theorem is that they're they're really understood um so we can understand completely um when these guys are isotopic okay so so now what this theorem So now, what this theorem tells us is it tells us that the surfaces we want to count, they're the ones in these least weight faces. We just want to count the ones in the least weight faces. We don't want to count anything else. There aren't any non-essential surfaces in these least weight faces. So, that counting lattice points and polyhedra is very well studied. This beautiful theory of Earhart. Earhart from the 1960s. Excuse me. So, a question. So, two least weight surfaces which are not isotopic can have the same weight? Oh, yes, yes. Definitely, definitely. Yeah. Yeah, the weight is not, certainly doesn't determine the surface in any sense. It just helps get rid of some of the, there's some redundant. Rid of some of the, there's some redundancy, you know, so you have the same surface, and there's many normal surfaces which are isotopic to it. Of course, there's only finitely many surfaces of bounded weight. And we tend to just the nicest ones are the ones that where the weight is smallest and they have the least, the least, the nicest properties. They're sort of, they're like minimal, so they're like taut and this kind of thing. Other questions? So, there's this beautiful theory of Earhart, which tells you how to count lattice points in a polyhedron. And so, then the rough outline of our theorem, which I've kind of summarized here again, is that for an ateroidal manifold, this count is a quasi-polynomial. Because you turn it into a question about counting these lattice points in these least weight faces, that has this quasi-polynomial. That has this quasi-polynomial form. This is back where quasi-polynomas arose originally. And that's where this is kind of coming from. So maybe pause for questions. And then I'll talk a little bit more about the proof. Sorry, how do you recognize least weight surfaces? Oh, well, that's a yeah. So, you know, one of our results is there's an algorithm. You know, one of our results is there's an algorithm to compute the quasi-polynomial. And that, in particular, means we have to do things like provide an algorithm. So we have an algorithm to compute the least weight faces. And that's certainly not trivial. Certainly not trivial. And in fact, we can do the computations, as you saw with the example of counting the 440,000 genus 100 surfaces in the Conway knot. But that's, yeah, I haven't gotten to the point where that's, yeah, I haven't said anything about that yet. Well, thank you. Yeah, so I mean, it's well, like one of Hawkins' original things. So, well, like one of Hawkins' original things is like testing whether surfaces are incompressible. So, like, one of the things that you do to start this is you start by figuring out certain surfaces are essential. And then you need some method to decide if two essential surfaces are isotopic. And that's actually one of the new components, new ideas that I won't really have time to talk about. Have time to talk about, but for deciding when things are isotopic, and also sort of we have a new way. I mean, I guess that thing is probably well known, but we have a kind of a new way of deciding when surfaces are essential. So our sort of test for some surface being essential uses almost normal surfaces. Uses almost normal surfaces that were introduced by Chaim Rubinstein, studied by Abby Thompson, among others. Our test for that and for deciding what isotopic uses these almost normal surfaces, and that's the method that we use to compute these least weight faces and identify the least weight surfaces. Oh, okay. Thank you. Are the spaces necessarily maximal dimension? Your pictures are. No, they're definitely not necessarily maximal dimension. And they can have different dimensions. We'll see some interesting examples at the end of kind of the range of phenomena we've seen so far. So, and again, Nathan, you've got these least weight faces, and some, well, I guess some of the lattice points in those least weight faces actually correspond to connected. Faces actually correspond to connected surfaces, right? That's right. The things that are being counted by AM. So I don't know. Would you is the problem then that you just don't really know any way in which those connected lattice points are distributed or anything like that? That's why that's the question. So, yeah, so what Mark is saying is a good point that so we have like this least weight face, and some of these are connected, like maybe. Connected. Like maybe this one is connected, this one is connected, this one is connected, this one is connected, this one's not connected. And so, like, the way we computed those numbers for the conway knot is we found the least weight faces, and then we just went through the lattice points. And we said, oh, is this one connected? Nope, disconnected, throw it out. And we get these numbers. And so, as I'll show later, there are some examples where we can identify the structure that the lattice points that are connected have. Have and conjecture, or in one case, my student Shayvan can prove an actual count of the connected ones. But in general, it's not clear what structure, what structure they get. Okay. Other questions? So, just to say a little bit about more about this, a little bit about this proof. Bit about this proof, and in particular, where the hypothesis of a toroidal comes from. Thank you. Well, that didn't get rid of all of it. Good enough. So let's look at just one of the least wave faces. So I don't want to draw the whole Faces. So I don't want to draw the whole polyhedron P. Let's just look at a single least weight face. And on a single face like this, the Euler characteristic of the surfaces is a linear function in these coordinates. So I'm going to make it minus the Euler. I'm going to make it minus the Euler characteristic. So that I can draw it like this. So there's some linear function. This is just, you can compute the number of two cells, one cells, zero cells in terms of these coordinates and see that it's a linear function. So if we look at our cone here, this polyhedral cone, there will always be a lattice point on each of the edges. On each of the edges of this cone, because the polynomial, the linear equations that we started with had integer coefficients. So, you know, maybe this surface here, this corresponds to a genus 2 surface. So maybe the Euler characteristic here is 2. And maybe the Euler characteristic here is also 2 for that lattice point. Let me. Let me maybe say the next one is out here. Maybe the Euler characteristic here is six, minus six. Maybe here's something where the Euler characteristic is minus four. And of course, there's additional lattice points floating around here. And we have an ateroidal manifold. So we know that for each of these For each of these points on these rays, the Euler characteristic of the surface is not zero. It's always negative. And that means that this function here is going to be proper. The only way that if you go to infinity in this cone, your Euler characteristic goes to minus infinity. Now, concretely, You know, concretely, if we look at the place, so this is where the Euler characteristic is minus one. Of course, there aren't any surfaces of Euler characteristic minus one, so it doesn't go through a lattice point, but it's a perfectly reasonable polyhedron. The fact that each one of none of these guys is zero means that this is actually just some little compact cross-section. Compact cross-section. And then what we're doing, then call this thing D. Then what we're doing is, like this thing here is 2D. I just took D and I scaled it out by 2. This thing here would be 3 times D. No, sorry, 4 times D. Right, oh, I should have said that this is not just a nice function, it's a linear function, right? So, like this is going to be six times t. So, what we're doing is we're counting, you know, if we want to count the number of lattice points in here, a particular Euler characteristics, the thing we're actually trying to count, this is simply equal. This is simply equal to the number of lattice points in 2n times d intersect with this lattice. And counting lattice points in an expanding sequence of polytopes is exactly what Earhart studied. And so his work applies immediately to this picture to tell us. Uh, picture to tell us that the count has this quasi-polynomial structure. Other questions? So, let me put this in a little context before I get to some of the examples and back to Mark's question about counting the connected ones. So, one is I hinted earlier. One is, I hinted earlier in response to Saul's question, there are different ways you could interpret this result. One of them is you can think about essential surfaces and sort of rational combinations of essential surfaces as real multiples of essential surfaces as being lattice points in some space of Some space of measured laminations, just like you study measured laminations on a surface. So Hatcher in the 90s studied this for three-manifold, building on work of Morgan and Shalin. And so there is a nice space. It's described by branch surfaces in the same way as measured laminations on a surface can be given coordinate charts coming from train tracks. Unlike the case with surfaces, where Unlike the case with surfaces where the topology of ML is very simple, it's just Rn or R to the 6g minus 6 if it's a closed surface. Here, this space of measured laminations is not necessarily a manifold. It's some kind of piecewise linear stratified space. But it does have a volume form on it that comes from sort of the integrality of the change of coordinates as you move from branch surface to branch surface. Branch surface. So, in particular, it has a natural volume form that's like the analog of the Thurston volume form on ML for a surface. And you can interpret this, our result as sort of counting lattice points in this space of measured laminations in terms of the Euler characteristic is a nice function on this, and you're counting the number of lattice points inside some increasingly large ball with respect to Euler. Increasingly large ball with respect to Euler characteristic. But maybe to focus on the corollary here, one thing you get out of this polynomial, quasi-polynomial behavior, is it has a degree, the degree of the leading term. And you could ask, well, what does that number represent? I mean, you know, the way I described where this theorem came from was in terms of the normal surfaces, which comes in particular from a triangulation. In particular, from a triangulation, and for different triangulations, you'll get different solutions, different least weight faces, and so on. And the answer has to be invariant because you're just counting something that's topologically defined. But kind of an abstract way to think about this is, for example, that the rate of growth of these surfaces is one less than the dimension of this space of measured laminations. And this is something that should be contrasted with. You know, should be contrasted with if instead of counting just embedded surfaces, I looked also at immersed surfaces. So, Khan and Markovit showed that in a closed hyperbolic manifold, if you allow yourself to count closed surfaces, closed essential surfaces, then the growth is super exponential, grows very, very rapidly. Whereas what we're seeing here is Here is polynomial behavior. And that's the same thing if you thought about like the maybe you know the sort of work of Mirzakani on counting curves in a surface in function of length. If you count all essential loops, embedded or not, that grows exponentially in the length. But if you count only the embedded ones, that grows polynomially in the length. And it's the same underlying phenomena, roughly. Our questions? So let's look at some examples. So we computed these, the generating function describing the number of surfaces and this least weight complex. Which is just a union of these faces for some almost 60,000 manifolds. Each of these manifolds had some of closed essential surfaces. Otherwise, this is, of course, very interesting. Sometimes, you know, one thing that can happen is that all your surfaces are just parallel copies of a finite list of surfaces. For example, Ken Baker found... Ken Baker found examples where there's a closed genus 2 essential surface, and every other essential surface is just a multiple of that, just some parallel copies of that. That corresponds to this least weight complex being one-dimensional. So I'd like to focus on the ones where the behavior is a little more complicated. So there were 4,000 of those. And when you look at the generating functions that you get, there's a lot of You get there's a lot of manifolds which give you the exact same counts. And there turned out to be 88 distinct behaviors that we observed in these 4,000 examples. And I'd just like to show you some of the most complicated, because of course, those are the most fun. So here is one example. Maybe I should have given this to Dave when he asked me for my favorite knot. My favorite knot. This is a case where the least weight complex has maximal cells of different dimensions. So in particular, the least weight complex is a cone. So I don't want to draw that. I want to draw a cross section of the cone. So for example, this thing here, this really means I've got a two-dimensional cone. I've got a two-dimensional cone like this. And I'm just, this interval is just a cross-section. So, of course, there are surfaces here on these rays. And the convention is that these little circles with white interiors correspond to genus II surfaces, where the surface Where the surfaces with black interiors correspond to genus 3 surfaces. So here, the least weight complex breaks up into three connected components, one of which is two-dimensional, one of which is three-dimensional, and one of which is the cone on the tetrahedron. So that's four-dimensional. And their vertices correspond to surfaces of genus 2 and 3 in this manifold. And then this here. This manifold. And then this here is the generating function for the number of surfaces of any given Euler characteristic. So this one's interesting because you have components of differing dimensions. That's relatively rare. Here's another example from some other 15-crossing knot. Here's its generating function. Here, Here, the cross-section to the cone is two-dimensional, has two connected components. It's got a lot of sort of sub, it's got a lot of faces in it. And again, this is like genus two, these are genus three, and then there's a couple that are really complicated. You got this one of genus seven here and some genus five surfaces that are giving you the boundary, the The boundary, the rays of this cone. And we also have a face here, which is not a simplex. That's an actual square. So that's another example. Let's see. Oh, now we've moved up to the Conway knot that we started with. Here was its generating function. function. So this is now three-dimensional. The cross-section is three-dimensional. There are, I think, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven three-dimensional tetrahedra here, sorry, three-dimensional polytopes here, five of which are tetrahedra, no, sorry, four of which are tetrahedra, this one, this one, this one, and this one. This one, two of which are well, this one is a this one here is like a cone over a pyramid. This is like a prism. This one's kind of funny looking. Anyway, they can get complicated. We really have no sense of what, if any, restrictions there are on these guys. This is not the Conway knots, not the most complicated that we can do. The most complicated example we've managed so far. Complicated example we've managed so far is a certain 13 crossing knot. In this case, the least weight complex is connected. There are 44 maximal faces, all of which are dimension five. So the cross section has dimension four. Each face has between five and nine vertices. So if it has five vertices, that means the cross section is a five, a four, a four simplex. But some of them are more complicated. But some of them are more complicated. Their vertices correspond to 48 distinct surfaces, genus between 2 and 5. And despite all that, here is the formula for the number of surfaces of Euler characteristic minus 2n. And we can start then from that to compute the number of surfaces of every given genus. So there are 12 surfaces of genus 2, 34 of genus 2. Of genus 2, 34 of genus 3, and so on and so forth. Are there questions about these examples? So they can get quite complicated. Nathan, so I just wonder, I guess, do the roots have Do the roots have a settled meaning? Right on the top, there's this interesting polynomial with its roots and oh, the roots on the top don't have an interesting meaning. The roots on the bottom do. The roots on the bottom are telling you things about like the period of this quasi-polynomial. So for example, here in this thing, we see this thing oscillates modulo two, which means that if I wrote it out, the denominator would look Wrote it out, the denominator would look like something like this, where B would have to be bigger than zero. And so you can see a sort of periodicity, sometimes mod three, mod six. That's read off from the cyclotomic factors on the bottom. To the best of my knowledge, the roots on the top don't have any particular meaning. Thank you. Any other questions besides Saul? All right, so let's return then to the question that we started off with, which was arguably the more natural one, which was counting these just the connected surfaces by genus. And as I mentioned in response to Mark's question, that we can do this by counting all the ones of a particular Euler characteristic and going through and throwing out all the disconnects. And throwing out all the disconnected ones. And so it turns out for these 4,300 manifolds that were sort of complicated, we found some 94 distinct patterns for this guy here. And it turns out that this sequence AM does not determine the sequence BM, which Sequence BM, which was the one that counts surfaces by the oil characteristic, nor conversely. So they're not actually equivalent to information. They certainly are related. And even in the case of surfaces, this distinction between counting all the curves and just the connected ones is really subtle. And that's in the case of counting curves on surfaces by length, that's one of the key. By length, that's one of the key contributions of Mirzakani: understanding how you count just, for example, the connected ones. So we only have conjectures, and actually, I guess I should have updated my slides because at least this one here, this is now a theorem of my student Shai Win Li. So she was able to prove that for this particular example that That there are two surfaces of genus two. And after that, the number of surfaces is given by the Euler phi function, the number of numbers co-prime to the g minus one. So here is an actual closed form formula for the number of surfaces in this situation. And in fact, And in fact, some of our sequences, we also have a conjecture for what the correct answer is. One thing that's necessary for the surface to be connected is that the lattice point is primitive, that it's not the multiple of some other lattice point. Because multiplying the lattice points in the normal surface solution space corresponds to taking parallel copies of your surface. So if your lattice point So, if your lattice point is a multiple of another, it's certainly disconnected. And in simple cases, the converse is true. That's what happens in Chabrin proves here. In general, there's this technique in number theory called taking the Mobius transform, which allows you to count sort of primitive lattice points. And so, 54 of our 88 examples seem to have sort of some kind of simple type where Sort of some kind of simple type where the only obstruction to corresponding to connected surface is that your lattice point is primitive. And when this happens, the Mobius transform of the sequence is quasi-polynomial. And we are able in those cases to conjecture a closed formula for this number. But then there is the other 34 that we just have no idea. And that includes like the Conway example. No idea what the structure is. No idea what the structure is. The structure is there. What is a Mobius transform of a sequence? It's another sequence. So it's like, you know, it's one of these things where you take the sum. So the Mobius transform, it's like the convolution. So you look at all divisors of n, you know, the Mobius function of d over n times the function of Of D or something. So this is like the transform, I don't know, Cm of D or something, of N. Sorry. Anyway, just it's something we you take your numbers, you recombine them in a certain way. And it's a useful tool. So in this case, it takes a bunch of sequences, which are definitely not quasi-polynomial, and it turns them into things they're talking about. Polynomial and it turns them into things which are quasi-polynomial or conjecturally quasi-polynomial. But you could ask an easier question about the asymptotics of these sequences. So when we count all the surfaces connected or not, we actually have these basically polynomial formulas for the number. And so they grow like a polynomial, like n to the d, where d is some. Is some basically the dimension of this space of measured laminations. And you're always going to have sort of like sort of mod whatever phenomena, periodicity kind of things are coming from dividing. So it's better if we want to talk about the asymptotics here to take the sum of the number of surfaces up to genus G. Otherwise, it will oscillate back and forth, you know, depending on. Course, depending on the genus mod 10 or whatever, depending on the example. And so here we have a conjecture that there's always a reasonable asymptotic growth rate for the count of surfaces by genus. So either There simply are no connected surfaces for large genus, or there exists a natural number s so that this sequence grows asymptotically like g to the s. So this is just saying, you know, that this count is asymptotic to some constant depending on the manifold times t. And we can, in the situations, I guess in this conjecture, yeah, now theorem. For the ones that satisfy this conjecture, this conjecture certainly implies this conjecture. For the others, we don't really even have an approach to this. But the data is quite striking. But the data is quite striking. Here is, I'll end with this. So here are some of the data on these 94 different patterns. So on the horizontal axis, we have the genus, and the vertical axis, we have AM bar. Have a m bar, and they're both log scales, as you'll notice, which means that polynomial growth should appear as a straight line. And so, you know, here we see a whole bunch of lines which apparently have, so this dotted line here that corresponds to slope two. So you see a whole bunch of lines which basically seem to have. Slope two. And then here we have a whole bunch of things that basically have slope four, slope three, and slope five. And the red ones here are the ones that we conjecture are sort of simple type. Our Mobius transforms are. Our Mobius transforms are quasi-polynomial, and the blue ones are the ones where we don't know of any structure the sequence has. Despite that, you see that asymptotically, you get very good shifts to behavior that looks like here n to the or g to the s. So that's what I wanted to. So that's what I wanted to tell you. So maybe I will just stop there. Thank you for your attention. Thank you, Megan. Anyone has questions for the speaker? I had two questions, if I can jump in there. So thank you for.
