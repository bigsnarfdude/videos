So I think it's okay. Okay. Okay, thanks for the invitation and also thanks to the organizers for organizing such a nice conference in such a period. I hope we can meet soon. Okay, today I will talk about Okay, today I will talk about mobility age, PT symmetry, and topological phase transitions. And we are interested in quasi-belief shooting operator. So it's talked about several times. So it's so the operator is Laplacian plus some potential. The potential is quasi-biotic. And here we select alpha to be an irrational number. And theta is the phase. And the zeta is the phase, and V is the potential. Okay, if V is real than H is theft joint, I think so most previous talks are concentrated on set the joint setting or the unit setting. But in this talk, I will talk something different, which means if the potential is complex, then the operator is non-self-adjoint, which means The joint, which means non-Hermitian in physics. Okay, the goal of my talk is something related to phase transition. Okay, I will introduce you several physical models and talk about several topics about phase transitions. And these topics are what the physics interested in just in recent years. And the method is from And the method is from dynamical systems, and especially Avida's global zero. I think Ling Lui has an introduction on global zero yesterday. Okay. So for the self-adjoint setting, so we know the spectrum is always real, right? So there is no transition from the spectrum set side. Okay, but there are some transition from the spectral. Some transition from the spectral measure side, okay, since it has the AC absolute continuous spectrum, singular continuous spectrum, and pure point spectrum. Okay, in physics, it corresponding to extended state, okay, critical state, and the localized state. So then one can talk about some sharp phase transitions or some mobile age, but I will introduce the concept of mobile age later. mobile later and for the non-self adjoint for the non-self joint setting so things became quite complicated so the spectrum might be real and might be complex so there are some transitions okay from this aspects there are two topics related to the transition it's called the pt symmetry transition and the topological phase transition The topological phase transition. Although I will talk about these concepts later. And from the spectral mirror side, we know in the non-self joint setting, there is no spectral measure, right? Because I think everyone knows there is no functional analysis. Okay, there are no functional colours. Okay. Okay, but Okay, okay, but in physics, they will talk about localized state. Okay, localized is okay, but there is in the non-septic, we are not about talk about the extended state. Instead, they will talk about the skin effect set, but I will not talk about it in this topic. Okay. Okay, first, let's start the well-known almost the material operator. So it's not. Almost the material operator, so it's no, it's also known as the Avery Andry model or Avery Andry Harper model. So I repeat this model. So since it's the starting point of my talk, so it means that the potential equals to two lambda cosine. So it has some physical background. Okay. Background. Okay. And for almost the material operators, there is a sharp phase transitions. Okay, which means if lambda is smaller than one, so operators will have purely AC spectrum for all alpha and all theta. And if lambda equals to one, so operator will have purely singular continuous spectrum for all alpha and all theta. And this is open for quite a long. Quite long. And it's just recently solved by Lana, maybe last year, at least published last year. Okay. And if lamna is greater than one and smaller than exponential beta, and here beta, we define the beta to be limited to log plus qn plus one over qn. And here Pn over Qn is the fraction expansions of alpha. So if lambda is So if lambda is greater than one, smaller than exponential beta, then the spectrum is purely singular continuous for all theta. And if lambda is greater than exponential beta, then the spectrum has Anderson localization for almost every theta. Okay, so these are some well-known results. And we can understand these results from dynamical. From dynamical systems. Okay, so which means we can write shooting operators as shooting of cycles. Okay, since Un plus one plus Un minus one plus V theta plus alpha equals to E U n and it can be rewritten as the following way. Okay, U n plus one U n equals to E minus V minus one one zero. V minus 110 and the UN UN minus 1. And we can see if, since we also interested in V is complex. So if V is complex, then this cycle belongs to S L to C. Okay. So in general, a quasi-betic SL2C cycle, so it's a skill product. So from the Taurus. The torus times R2 and to torus times R2. It maps x omega to x plus alpha and a x dot omega. And then once we have cycles, then we can have re-exponent, but I will not talk about the concepts since it already talks about too many times. Okay. Okay, then if we have the exponent, it's a very important tool for spectral theorem. So then I will talk about global theorem, to the global theorem. So to the global theoretical for analytic one frequency analytic SR2C cycles is the following. So the basic observation of version of a villa is that so if we complicify the phase and write it as a theta plus i epsilon so epsilon is complication then we can compute its re-exponent then a epsilon belongs to s l2c okay the basic observation is that the exponent is a piecewise linear and convex function And the convex function of epsilon. So if the function is a convex function, then we can talk about its right derivative. Okay, and the key observation of A2 is that the right derivative, of course, the left derivative, it's an integer. So this integer is called acceleration. Okay. Okay. And so the quantization of integer, the quantization of observing is quite important because once we have this, we can classify the dynamics. But here we I will talk about SL2R setting because if the cosyco is if the cosycle is s r2 then the the exponent is an even function with respect to this epsilon and i think so dingle already introduced this feature to you yesterday but i will repeat it okay so if the exponent is positive and the acceleration is zero then the cycle is called a uniform hybrid and if the exponent is If the exponent is zero and this acceleration is zero, then it's called supercritical. If the exponent is positive and the acceleration is positive, then it's supercritical. Of course, we have critical, but since I will not talk about critical in my talk, though, then I delete the picture. So, we can relate the classification to the spectral measure. Okay, this is a bigger picture. So, if the exponent is zero, then we can divide it to be supercritical and the critical setting. And if the cycle is super cool, and these anegress will support a absolutely continuous spectrum. So, it's a it's It's Ato Avidas' almost reducibility conjecture, which states that if the cross cycle is supercritical, then the cross cycle is almost reducible, which further implies these angles, these operators. It's purely AC. Okay, okay, so which means from the sub-critical side, okay, seems like very good. So if it's critical, if it's critical, then by global zero or linearization zero, it's easy to prove that all the critical entries will form a Lebesgue zero-Lebesgue measure set. So by Cotani zero, by quotani zero there are no absolutely continuous spectrum so it's uh it's a i think it's a bigger conjecture uh it's conjectured by several person say that these critical energies will support the singular continuous spectrum however up to now it was only proved in the almost material setting by lana but But it seems that the Lana's method cannot journalize to the journal setting. No, no, no, critical case. Critical case. And if that's bound is positive, then we call the cycle to be cypical. Of course, we first assume the energy belongs to the spectrum. So, if our further is that 17, then we say it will have a pure point spectrum. But so it's the thing is the following. So, Lana first proved that alpha is different, and for the almost Is definitely and for the almost material case, so operator has undersonical position. And Borgian and Gotstein prove that for almost every defining alpha and the fixed any potential, fixed any potential, then the operator has a pure point spectrum and the operation. However, it's still open whether for any fixed defending alpha and the fixed any analytic potentials, the operator has. Potentials so operator has underscore position, it's still quite open, and so if alpha is Leo Belian, the picture will be if the exponent is greater than beta, then it has pure point spectrum. And this part is I think it's more even more difficult than the defining case, and it's only known in the almost automatic setting. And if the exponent is smaller than beta, then Exponent is smaller than beta, then the operator will have a singular continuous spectrum. So, by a modified coordinate argument, okay, then we will talk about the proof of the almost a material case. So, and later Avila proved that the exponent, if the energy, if the energy E belongs to the spectrum. E belongs to the spectrum, then the exponent equals to maximum zero and log lambda. And if lambda is smaller than one, it's subcritical, then it has AC spectrum. If lambda equals to one, it's critical, then it has a singular continuous spectrum. And lambda greater than one, it's supercritical. And so we have log lambda plus beta and log lambda smaller than beta. Okay. than beta okay uh these for these are for almost the material operators okay once we have this basic models then we move a bit forward okay okay then i will talk about the first topic of my talk so it's called the mobility age so in fact mobility edge uh came from came from the anderson model From the Anderson model on L2ZD. For this Anderson model, if the dimension equals to one or two, okay, the physical result, physical intuition will be the operator will have undesirable condition for all lambda. However, if the dimension equals two, okay, this is not proved in mathematics, although the physics assume this is true. this is true and if the dimension is greater than greater than three or equals to three uh things are quite complicated and for a small coupling constant lambda okay the physical intuition will be there exist a critical energies separating ac spectrum and the pupil spectrum which means there exists the energy separating extended state and the low class state State and low class state. Then this energy is called OBDH. Okay, this is from, I think, so the fixed total. He disappeared, right? Yes, yes. Everything disappeared. Yeah, he writes that he lost his connection. You are muted, Chi. Okay, that's okay. Yes, now I can see. There is some problem of the with the net. Okay, so this is this is where mobile edge came from. Okay, if we compare the random case and the quasi-belief case, then we find that in the random case, there are mobile edge, which means Mobile age, which means they are transition in the energy. And for the almost material setting, there is a sharper phase transition in lambda. So the natural question is that, so whether for the possibility case, there exists mobility age. So if there exists a mobility age, then the next step is to is to is to To is to ask whether there are some antique formula of mobile age. Okay, the third question is that, so if there is an equity formula, whether there are some proof of it. Of course, one may ask, so why we should talk about why we should ask the exist analytic formula of mobility age. Mobility age. So, okay, I make a copy of the physical paper. Okay, in this paper, okay, the authors write, this is quite important and it will help resolve the effects of interactions on the energy-dependent localization transition. And it's a subtle and open theoretical questions. Okay, so there it's since it's. okay so then it's since it's uh important in physics then we can we can study it okay okay the history of mobile age in the in the quasi-bank setting is the following and in physics okay there are quite a lot of references on this setting at least i i there are there are five physically vector right Five physically vector, right? And there are even more. Okay, in fact, I have to, I have to say, in physics, in physics literature, if we want to find some model has mobility, it's quite easy. Because if we have MATLAB, we have numerical calculations, then when it's very easy to verify more bage. Okay, but in math side, In mass side, in the mass side, okay, and to the global zero totals, so for typical potentials, we have remote bridge, okay. And the second question, of course, is whether there are any formula of mobile edges. Okay, it indeed asks whether there are several, whether there are physical models which have exact mobile age. The exact mobile age. And in physics science, there are some theoretical arguments and numerical results. And before us, there are two papers. As you can see, it's 2010 and 2015. There are two models. But from the math side, there are no proof. No proof. And first, I will talk about introduce this model. It's called possibiotic Mosak model. Okay. Okay, this model is named by my co-authors. Okay. You can understand this quasi-piodic MOSAC model just from almost a material operators. Okay. Okay, almost the material operator means the potentials equals to okay two lambda cosine and this more second model means okay in different sides okay the potential might take zero okay if I take this kappa kappa this kappa is an integer so if kappa equals two then the potential takes cosine zero cosine zero and cosine 0, cosine 0, and cosine 0. Okay, if kappa equals to 3, then the potential takes cosine 0, 0, and cosine 0, 0. Okay, this is a possibility, this is a possibility model. And for this model, and in our physical paper, we prove that, I mean, just in the physical way, this model has exact mobility edge. Mobility H okay for any kappa. And if kappa equals the two, then the mobile edge are given by one over lambda and minus one over lambda. And also my co-authors propose experimental realization, so based on optical Raman lattice. Okay. And this is And this is the following, the numerical picture of kappa equals two and kappa equals to three. And you can see kappa equals two, there are two mobile edge and kappa equals to three, there exist four mobile ages. And all the mobile ages are exact. Okay. And from MASLIDE, recently we we prove that this one over lambda are mobile okay which means the following if we assume alpha is definitely if we assume that alpha is defined then the operator will have a purely ac spectrum okay in minus one over lambda to one over lambda and in the complement set the operator will have So, Pritter will have uncertain position for almost every C time. And so, okay, we should note, we should note. So from this result, if the result is the following, if Lambda, even if Lambda is very large, even if very large, there always exists more bridge, which means there always exists zero. zero zero is diagram exponent right but we know if the potential is smooth if the potential is smooth and if lambda is large enough then the operator will have then the operator will have positive exponent and pure point spectrum something like that okay so this is different okay just because the potential is not smooth the potential is not smooth. And in fact, this is this operator, it's not a standard, it's not a standard quasi-opiodic, any quasi-operative model. In fact, it's almost a periodic, not quasi-pedic. Okay. Chi, do you prove that this mobility age that one over lambda is in the spectrum? Okay, no, in fact, I didn't prove. In fact, I didn't prove it. In fact, so from the numerical picture, it seems that if lambda is larger enough, one of lambda lies in the gap. Okay, so this will imply a very, it seems a bit a surprising result. Since you can see, since you can see, okay, the Lebesgue measure, the Lebesgue measure of AC. The Lebanon measure of AC part goes to zero if lambda goes to infinity. But one over lambda, the one over lambda, if one over lambda lies in the gap, lies in the gap, then it will cause the integrated density of states. It's unchanged. Right. So even if the bigger measure goes to zero, but the ideas does not change. But the ideas did not change, right? So it seems a bit surprising. And my co-authors give some physical explanations just from flat band. I mean, but I don't know why it's true. And we tried several times to prove this, but we failed. Okay. Is there a critical region in this case? Because if all the of course critical region is one over lambda. Oh no no no. If one over lambda is lies in the spectrum, then one over lambda is critical. Okay, but unfortunately, we don't know. Unfortunately, I don't know. Okay. Okay, it's the second model. But you do prove that. She one more thing, but you do prove that there is some spectrum within minus one over lambda, one over lambda, right? Yes, of course, because if the energy equals to zero and that point is reducible, okay, in that bodice it's reducible. So, you know, if one point is reducible, okay, then in the neighborhood, we'll have AC spectrum. Okay. And what happens for the Nubian elements? And what happens for the Liuvinian analysis? Liuvini part? Yeah. Okay, Liuvini part will have will have will have a pure AC spectrum and a single vinyl spectrum and the and the location. Okay, I didn't prove it. I didn't approve it because joint with Lana and Ato we have more journal result and supervision. In fact, we can prove antisocial for energy has acceleration one. And this model have acceleration one. Of course, you can prove directly by you can just use Lana's method with one time and you can prove it. So do I understand correctly that actually if you drop the words Anderson local. If you drop the words under some localization and say supercritical, then you need no condition on alpha that the result is about the Lepunov exponents. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And the second model is called the GAA model. So if it means the potential takes the form 2 lambda cosine and over 1 minus torr cosine. So if tor equals to 0, then it is the standard almost material. then it is the standard almost domain operator. However, if here we will select toll is greater than minus one, two and smaller than one. Otherwise, if tor is greater than one, and the cis potential is singular, which means it's unbounded. Okay. And the physics in the physics, okay, they have some okay, theoretical argument and the numerical picture show that. Shows that so the mobile age are given by signal lambda tau equals to 2A1 minus lambda. And it's very surprisingly, okay, although this is a physical argument, okay, not rigorous, but the conjecture is true. Okay, the conjecture is true. And this is recently, and we recently proved this one. Okay, we still. This one. Okay, we still assume alpha is definitely, and then we find if signal lambda tau e is smaller than two one minus lambda, then the operator will have paid spectrum. And in other parts, in other parts, then the operator will have antenna correlation for almost every sigma. Okay. Okay, then I talk about talk a bit about the proof. Talk a bit about the proof. Okay. So the quasi for the quasi-emplica models, the first step is to estimate the exponent. Okay, in fact, by actually global zero, we can estimate the exponent equals to one of lambda maximum log lambda e and zero. And this calculations, I think this kind of calculations was already mentioned. Was already mentioned by Jake, so I will not repeat it. So, then if the energy is greater than one over lambda, this is supercritical, then we can use Lana's localization method to prove that the operator will have anti-localization. Okay, and if the adder just is smaller than one of lambda, then it is topocratical. However, I critical however i however uh i have to mention that although i said that so supercritical energies will spot ac spectrum right but in this case it's not a direct application of at was arc just because this model it's not a standard analytic possibilities models it's homostyle okay then in fact Okay, then in fact we prove the following general result. Okay, we consider the almost periodical shooting operators and which means the potentials, the potential has the copper parts. The potential has to have copper quasi-quasium analytical quasi-bit potentials. And then in fact, okay, I have to mention so this kind of So this kind of potentials, this kind of setting was journalized by David and Jake to the product system setting. So this operator is not quasi-opetic, but the iterates, the iterates of the quasi-analytical quasi-operative cycles. Then for this quasi-cycle, then for Zoo cycle the iterates we can talk about we can talk about supple critical and our result is the following for any alpha is defined in for any alpha is defined in and kappa is integral then for any situation this operators is a purely AC in the set the where the angles is almost reducible okay Reducible. Okay. Okay, so the concept of almost disability is introduced by fellows, so I will not talk about it. Okay. Okay, this is the technical part on AC spectrum. And for this GAA model, okay, in fact, the pro is much. In fact, the proof is much simple and follows the exactly the same line as the Mosaic model. Okay, the first step is that we compute the exponent if the energy belongs to the spectrum. The formula is quite complicated. And the formula is quite complicated. And what's surprising is that so if Surprising is that so if we simplify phi, and we'll find that signal tau E equals to one minus lambda is the critical case. And you will find the physical intuition is true. Okay, okay, this is for this is for the self-dejoin setting, and now. setting and now I will move to the non-cept joint setting and then I talk about the PT symmetry transition and the topological phase transitions. So first I talk about the PT symmetry transition and this is a very important part in non-Hermitian mechanics and non-Hermitian Hermitonian in physics. Okay, PT symmetry means a parity time inversion symmetry. inversion symmetry, okay, which means the potential takes the form V n equals to V star minus n. Okay, so we assume that V is complex, it means the real part is an even function and the image part is a odd function, right? So this concept is introduced by Ben and Butcher in 1998. Okay. Okay, why is this PG symmetry makes things different? Because PG symmetry might have a real spectrum, but not always, not necessary. Okay, why is this important in physics? Okay, I copy this centers from a well-known PT symmetry survey. I mean, also from physical paper. Okay, it says that so. Okay, it says that the PT symmetry modification of the conventional quantum mechanics, we can see as observer as Hermitian operators. Just because the energy can be real. So if the energy is complex, then the fixes will say that, okay, I cannot imagine that. I cannot understand. But fortunately for this kind of Fortunately, for this kind of a PG symmetry, it will have real spectrum. Okay. Then there are two natural questions. So the first question is PT symmetry breaking transition. And we know, so if the potential, if the potential has a PT symmetry, then we will find that if HU equals to EUN. equals to E un and the way to implies h u star minus n equals to e star u star minus minus n. Okay, so if E is real, then U n, the eigenfunction is U n equals to U star negative n. So this case, we will say we will say that it has PT symmetry states. Okay, so I should say PT symmetry is this concept. Symmetry is this concept is from the potential side or from the Hamiltonian side. And the PG symmetry states is from the energy side or from the engine functions side. So if the energy is complex, then these two guys are not equal. And in this case, it's called the PT symmetry breaking states. Okay. The second question. The second question is more important than in physics, which ask, so for which kind of PG symmetry potentials we have real spectrum. Okay, it means we will talk about the transitions in the level of potential space. Okay. Okay, and I will talk about two PT symmetry examples. Symmetry example. The first example is the potential takes two lambda exponential i theta. And the second example is the we complex the phase of almost the material operator which takes two lambda cosine theta plus n alpha plus i epsilon. Okay, and you will find you can easily check that these examples are PG symmetry. Examples are PG symmetry. Okay. In fact, the first potential was introduced by Senek in 1983. And he proved that, so if alpha is F1T, and if Lambda is smaller than one, the spectrum is that it's an interval, it's minus two and two, two. And if lambda is greater than one, then the is greater than one, then the special set is LPS. Therefore, from the although when Zenac studies its example, there are no PT symmetry, but we can understand this from PT symmetry site. It says that the first thing is that it says that the P lambda equals to one at PT symmetry breaking transition. Okay. CC is real and since the CC is real and CC is complex. And the second part and related to the second question and the standards examples only gives one PT symmetry potential which has real spectrum. Okay. Okay. I should say that okay the Senaka started this non-self joint exam. non-self-joint example in 1983. I mean, in the Cosibel case. And what's surprising is that in physics, in physics, people started to study non-self joint possible case only in 2018. I think it's okay, 2018. Okay. Okay, so just quite a recently. Okay, so just quite recently. Okay, then I will talk about the second potential. The second potential is we complicify the phase of almost the material operators. Then we find that if lambda is greater than zero and smaller than one, then negative log lambda is the PT symmetry breaking transition. And the first case, if epsilon is greater than episode, if epsilon is greater than zero and smaller than negative log lambda then the spectrum set the spectrum set okay it's real moreover in fact the spectrum is the same as almost a multiple operator therefore it's a counter set okay it's a counter set and if epsilon is bigger than minus log lambda then the spectrum is complex uh spectrum is complex this spectrum is complex and uh it's uh it's surprising is that in fact this okay this result can be easily proved by i as global zero okay there are two main ingredients of the proof the first ingredient is that if the energy belongs to the uh belongs to the okay okay i it's it's a fault it's a It's does not belong to the spectrum if and only if the cycles is uniform hybrid. So in the so in the self-dejoint setting, so this result is proved by Johnson. Okay. But in the non-self-adjoint case, it's still true. Okay. And we look at the proves this one in paper. In paper, in paper with Lana and Lingre and Professor Yu. Okay, and the second ingrained is the following: assume that alpha, the exponent is positive, then the cosycle is uniform hybrid if and only if the exponent is affine with respect to epsilon. Okay, then we can just prove this result from this picture. From this picture. So, if the energy belongs to the spectrum of almost the multiple operators, then it's supercritical. Then we'll find if epsilon is smaller than minus or lambda, then it's still a spectral point, right? And if greater than this guy, and it's uniform hybrid. And the second part is that if. And the second part is that if the energy, if the energy is uniform hybrid, then it is positive and accelerating zero. And then one can easily check that it's a special point unless this epsilon zero is greater than minus or lambda. Okay. Does this prove? She may ask the question. So that's very beautiful, but one part I don't understand. Beautiful, but one part I don't understand. Why doesn't there appear in a new spectrum for positive epsilon? Something that wasn't in the spectrum of the original MOS matter. Okay, you mean I okay, I here identify here I didn't assume that the lambda is greater than one, right? No, no, no, no. So take lambda less than one. So you convincingly proved that if energy is in the spectrum of the original almost met you, then it stays in the spectrum. Then it stays in the spectrum of this complication for epsilon less than minus log lambda. My question is: what if the original energy was in the gap? Okay, it's just here, right? If the if it's a gap, then it's a uniform hybrid, right? Yeah, but do you know exactly is why does it mean that it does? Why does it mean that it does not become non-uniformly hyperbolic for small epsilon? This is not okay. Okay, no, no, no, you guys, because it's a picture. If lambda is large enough, or if epsilon is large enough, then it's epsilon plus log lambda. Right? Ah, okay, I see, I see. So this picture is the same regardless whether you are in this. Regardless whether you are in the spectrum or not in the spectrum, okay. Okay, the blue line okay represents the uniform hypertrophic case. Okay, right. Outside the spectrum, the blue line will be larger because the whole picture will be shifted by vertically, but still what you say is true. Okay, I see. Okay, okay. Okay. And I want to say, okay, CS picture can be generalized to general setting. Okay, not almost the material breakers. Okay, then I will talk about this topological transition. So it's about the topological wending numbers. And in fix, it's defined as follows. And if we have the transition of the Hamiltonian and Hn minus the and H n minus E B and E B is a base point. Usually we will take E B is real. And then you take a determined and you take a log and you take a derivative. Then you over n and you then you take the limit and then this is an integral. Okay. Although it's not because proved in physics, but okay. Because proved in physics, but okay, this is true. And we can see what does this mean. And if you okay, we can first see this part. If we take a log determinant, if we take a log determinant of HN exponential b e b and take a derivative, in fact, it just means, okay, this is a lambda minus e b and this part, okay, this. this part okay this part just means the angle right it's just means the sum of the angles then you take a take n so it means it gives the number of times of complex angles in circle this e b okay for example in this picture in this picture the 1d number is two okay in this picture the Okay, in this regular one d number is two. Okay, and what we prove is the following: if we take a Hamiltonian to be this guy and the complication of epsilon and for any analytical potentials, so the question is whether there are some mathematical explanations of this topological winding number. And what do we prove that in fact this topological one number just equals to the just equal to the acceleration okay defined by a two okay so once have we once we have this one then we are easily checked that we go to this picture we easily checked that minus okay negative log lambda is the pt okay is the topological phase transition just means if this epsilon is smaller than epsilon is smaller than smaller than smaller than log lambda then the then the acceleration is zero okay and if it's very easy to understand since the the energy is the energy is zero so there are no windings and if epsilon is greater than minus log lambda then the acceleration is one and then the topological winding number topological number topological mandate topological one when you number it's minus one okay so minus low lambda is the pg symmetry breaking transition which is also a topological phase transition so this is for almost the material operator then we can ask what happens for journal potentials what happens for journal potentials general potentials and so in fact we can still look at the pictures our result implies that so our result implies so if epsilon is a turning point of the exponent then it's a transition of topological winding numbers okay then if we need want to answer these questions Want to answer these questions? What happened for general potentials? In fact, we should use what Linre talked about yesterday. And we need this kind of quantitative version of Avila's global theorem, which is also known as the multiplicative Jason's formula. So which means if epsilon is smaller than gamma one, then it's a constant. Then it's a constant, and in this case, so it's a linear function. So, and n i is the okay is a multiplicity of gamma n i and the gamma n i is the dual exponent. Okay, it's proved it's already explained by it's already explained by Lingry yesterday. And I remember someone yesterday asks whether. Yesterday, I asked whether this kind of quantitative version is useful. And I just said at least we can give a direct application in quantum physics. Okay. Okay, this is a picture. It's for subcritical energy E, and we have this kind of picture of that exponent. And from what we introduced, explained, and we'll find that. And we'll find that the supercritical radius, which means if we take a minimum E belongs to the self-joint spectrum, and then you take this guy, the first turning point, gamma N1, okay, then this guy gives PT symmetry breaking. Okay, so if this guy is positive, which means for any which means the for any integer belongs to the the the self-dejoin case it's it's a it's a it's super critical then if small if epsilon is smaller than this guy then the separation is real okay and also we can prove that so this gamma and i these turning points are topological fix Topological phase transitions. Again, when this NI, the slope, this kind of slope, when the slope is the topological binding numbers. Okay, so then we see that this kind of quantitative version of at least global zero is quite, I mean, quite useful, right? And finally, we'll talk about the second question. The second question is that, so ask, so what kind of PT symmetry potentials will have real spectrum? Right. So this is more important, at least more important in physics. And what we prove is the following. What we prove is the following. What we prove is the following. And in this part, we is the then alpha is not necessarily an irrational number. Alpha can be any dimension, okay, multi-frequency. Okay. And if the potential takes the form, if the potential is a predict, right? So potential is a k belongs to this gamma and f kat k exponential exponential 2 pi i k theta. pi i k zeta. And if this gamma forms a cone with angle less than pi, and if lambda is smaller, then is if lambda is small enough, then we prove that the spectrum is an interval. The spectrum is interval is minus two and two. And we also prove that for any energy belongs to the complex plate, not Not the Lurpat, not the spectrum. It holds for any integer, belongs to C. And we prove that the log is the exponent is log E over two plus E square of minus four and over two. And then you will find that this exponent, it's just the exponent of the standard. Of the standard Laplacian. Okay, this is just a standard Laplacian. And what I want to say is that so this result, okay, here D can be finite or be infinite. Okay, D of D is infinite. Then we talk about there are infinite potentials. Then it's almost periodic, not quasi-pairic. Okay, and so this is the rough picture of the integral goal and we prove by k mutation and the integral goal shrinks but finally we have the convergence of the km scheme. Okay, I think I should stop. Okay, thanks. Chi, can you return the last result okay as well? Yes, so it's very interesting, but I don't quite understand. And what is your condition? Because, for example, for the real potentials, you don't have the spectrum is the same. So, okay, this is the complex part. This is a complex. I explain in one dimension case. Okay. In one dimension case, one frequency and the potential just mean so the just k is. So just K is positive. Okay, it's positive. Okay, cool. All right, now I understand. I see, I see. Okay, so it's a generalization of Sernak, but very interesting one. Ah, yes, yes. So it's necessarily a non-real potential. Yes. I see. And And uh why is there a PT symmetry here? Why is PT symmetry? Okay, you can you can take it to PT symmetry. Okay, just because all right, I see, I see, I see, okay, okay, very interesting. And is it an if and only if result by any chance? Uh, unfortunately, no, okay, still very beautiful, okay, but we can easily construct. But we can easily construct the potentials which is not in this form, and then measuring is not interval. We take a most material composition. Right. But do you have any examples that are not in your phone and the spectrum is still minus 22? I mean, so if it's not minus 222, then we can at least one example is only. Example is almost a material pretty you compare for the phase. And in fact, there are another interesting model is you can compare with the Senaka's result. Okay, so Senaka result is 2 lambda cosine. And if we take the lambda cosine minus exponential 2 pi I see that z, it means it's a i sine. I sign. In fact, we have some numerical picture. It seems that it's quite complex. Okay, and we don't know how to prove. Okay. Interesting. Probably move on unless there are any questions. Questions
