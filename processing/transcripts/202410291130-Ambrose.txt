Can communicate like this. So, I am talking about the Birkhoff-Rod integral for non-decaying non-periodic flows. And of course, only having 10 minutes, I'll have to choose what to focus on. And I'll actually talk a bit more about the Hilbert transform than the Birkhoff-Rod integral. But the Birkhoff-Rod integral for an irritational water wave, the free surface is a vortex sheet. If you have an irritational water wave, the vorticity and the bulk of the fluid is zero. In the bulk of the fluid is zero, but there's still measure-valued vorticity concentrated on the top surface. And that vorticity is an amplitude Î³, the vortex sheet strength, times the Dirac mass along the surface. So if you do what you usually do, which is recover the velocity from the vorticity using the Bios-Savart law, then if you take the limit as you approach the top surface from inside the fluid, you get the Birkhoff-Rod integral. So as Berkhoff-Rod integral, integral. So this Birkhoff-Rod integral is part of the velocity of the pre-surface and the formula is written here. And so this is the singular integral, right? We just see your first slide. The screen seems to be frozen. Let me try to share again. Okay, so I had been reading, not reading exactly, but going over the start of that. But then there's the formula for the Birkhoff-Rod integral. So the Birkhoff-Rod integral is the singular integral that is singular like 1 over alpha minus alpha prime. Okay. And here the surface of the lower wave is parametrized as x of alpha, y of alpha. Okay, if we write this Birkhoff-Rod integral in complex. Write this Birkhoff-Rod integral in complex notation, not really doing complex analysis, but just writing C of alpha is X of alpha plus Iy of alpha, then the form simplifies and you get that the integral of alpha prime over X of alpha minus X of alpha prime. So one thing we want to be looking at here is when does this converge? Well, if gamma is in L2 of R, and if C grows like alpha for large alpha, then the numerator is in L2 and then the numerator is in L2 and the other factor 1 over xi of alpha minus xi of alpha prime away from the singularity is also in L2 since 1 over alpha squared converges at infinity as an integral. So with gamma and L2 of r, this would converge. So that's the decaying case. If gamma nxi were instead spatially periodic, then that integral would not converge. But you can sum it carefully. You can sum it carefully. If you sum over periodic images, you can do things carefully. Summing over periodic images symmetrically about the singularity, which is the same thing as taking the principal value at infinity, gives you an expression for the Birkhoff-Rod integral where you can write it over one period with a cotangent kernel. So you get the formula w1 minus iw2 is this integral with this cotangent kernel. So these are two expressions for the Birkhoff-Rod integral, which again gives you the integral which again is the gives you the velocity on on the surface of the water wave but the first one really only works for the decaying case and the second one really only works for the periodic case so you can do the same thing with the Hubert transform the Hobert transform has the same kind of representations in the decaying case you get the first formula here where you're integrating f over alpha minus alpha prime and if you do the summing And if you do the summing over periodic images carefully, where you go symmetrically about the singularity, you can write the Hobart transform in the periodic case with an integral with a cotangent kernel. And these are related for the purposes of order wave existence theory in that you can rigorously approximate the one by the other. You can rigorously approximate the Birkhoff-Rod integral with certain Hilbert transforms. And in certain water wave existence, In certain water wave existence theories, this is a key element of the proof. This approximation lets you bring out the leading order terms, and the error from the approximation is smooth. And so there's estimates available for the error from approximating the Birkhoff-Rod angle with the Hilbert transform. Now, as you've heard, you know, I think you've heard in other talks so far, like by John Wilkining and maybe Zhen Yu Zhao and maybe Dave Nichols, that Dave Nichols, that there's interest in water waves which are not periodic and which are not decaying, especially quasi-periodic water waves. So part of the thought in this work is how could you write this Birkhoff-Rod integral in something like the quasi-periodic case? There's also a paper by Alizard Burke and Zuli on water waves with uniformly local Sobolev data. Uniformly local Sobolev data. So if you were in a uniformly local Sobolev space, how would you write this Birkhoff-Rod integral to express the velocity on the sheet? Well, like I said, I'm going to focus more on the Hilbert transform because there's only a few minutes to give the talk. But part of the answer, or at least my answer to this question, is by introducing a cutoff function. Now, that doesn't mean making any approximation. This is going to be exactly the Hilbert transform, or exactly. Or exactly, but we go through a cutoff function to get there. I let A be a typical cutoff function: A equals one in a neighborhood of the origin, A equals zero outside a ball of radius two, and let's say A is even, smooth, and monotone in the other pieces. And I'm going to make an assumption about the function f that we are taking the Hobart transform of. And that's that after subtracting a constant, the antiderivative grows sublinearly. Derivative grows sublinearly. And so that's a generalization of C of F here is a generalization of the mean of a periodic function. If I had a periodic function, well, one is a periodic function, but the antiderivative of one grows linearly. But if I have a periodic function like one plus sine, I take away one, the mean, then the antiderivative for sine is like cosine, and it actually doesn't grow. So So I'm going to assume my function has this property that if I subtract a constant, then the antiderivative grows sublinearly. Well, then I'm going to define a new Hilbert, a new representation of the Hilbert transform. I'm going to the Hilbert transform of a constant is zero. So I can write my Hilbert transform subtracting a constant. Then I introduce my cutoff function. I put in a and I put in one minus a. And here I have used the fact that in I have used the fact that in the first integral in the last displayed equation, if I had a times c, I would integrate to zero just from symmetry because the cutoff function is even and the denominator is odd. Okay, so I have a local piece and then I have a far field piece. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to integrate by parts in the far field. So my local piece stays the same. I have my cutoff function A times my F, and then my far field piece, I let capital F be an antiderivative. piece, I let capital F be an antiderivative for f minus c, and I integrate by parts to take the derivative off of f minus c. And I get two new pieces, one piece when I differentiate the cutoff function, and one piece when I differentiate alpha minus alpha prime. And the point is that this representation of the Hubert transform no longer cares if the function is periodic or decaying. If h is a periodic function, then this is the Hubert transform. And if h is a decaying function, And if H is a decaying function, then this is the Hilbert transform. And what's more than that, this version of the Hilbert transform works in more than just those two cases. So we expect it will work for a variety of quasi-periodic functions and other things like that. So this is a version of the Hilbert transform, which unifies and extends the previous formulas for the Hilbert transform. And you can do the same thing for the Burke. And you can do the same thing for the Birkhoff-Rod integral. So I'll just leave this formula for the Birkhoff-Rod integral up here. But the point is, you have a constant term. You didn't have the constant term for the Hilbert transform because the Hilbert transform of a constant is always going to be zero. But then you have a local piece. You have a piece where you differentiate the cutoff function, which is again a local piece because the cutoff is identically zero at infinity. And then you have the new piece, which has the denominator. piece which has the denominator decaying like alpha minus alpha prime squared. And because the antiderivative grows sublinearly, this new piece converges. Okay, and so that's it. We've given a new expression for the velocity field for the Birkhoff, the velocity field and the Birkhoff rod integral associated to a vortex sheet. We've given the corresponding new expression for the Hilbert transform. These expressions unify and extend the cases of decay and periodicity. And the hope is to And the hope is to use this as the basis of an existence theory for water waves where we don't care if you're in the decaying case or the periodic case or something that is in between or different from decay and periodicity. So I think we can do that existence theory, but there's a lot of work still. All right. Thanks. Thank you, David, for any questions.
