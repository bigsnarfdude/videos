Thank you also for inviting me and for giving me the possibility to speak here about slicing properties of the lattice point enumerator, which roughly means that we want to say something about the number of lattice points in a convex body in terms of the number of lattice points in slices. I think this is a well-studied topic in, I mean, with respect to the volume, of course. And to the best of my knowledge, this discrete setting was first. Discrete setting was first studied by Gardner, Kronke, and company in a paper from 2005 where they were interested in discrete geometric tomography. Because there you have the problem that you have finite point sets and you take some x-rays, so you measure how many points are on some lines, and then you want to say something about your set, about the number of points in your set. Okay, this is a motivation, a part of the motivation why we Part of the motivation why we started to look at these problems. And we mean that this is what I present here is based on ongoing joint work with Anska Freyer, who is a PhD student in Berlin. Okay, so first let me start with projections instead of slices and then of course therefore the volume we have the well-known inequality of Loomis and Whitney saying that the geometric mean of the projection onto the coordinate type mean of the projection onto the coordinate hyperplanes is an upper bound on this volume raised to the power n minus 1 over n. And for instance, you have equality for such an orthogonal box. If you look at the paper of Loomis and Whitney, then actually what they prove is a discrete version of this. Namely, if we denote by G of K the number of lattice points in a set, then this is actually what they prove, namely that if you count the number of lattice points in the projection, take the geometric, and take the product and the geometric. Geometric and takes a product, and geometric mean, then gives you an upper bound again on the number of lattice points raised to the power n minus 1 over n. These two things are equivalent, actually, but there was also later an independent proof given by Schwenck and Munro in 83, but I think they were not aware of this result of Loomis and Wigne. Now we know that we cannot have an adverse Loomis-Wigny inequality, so we cannot bound the volume from. Inequality, so we cannot bound the volume from below by projections. Then we have to go to sections, and now I go to convex bodies. And there we have the well-known inequality of Meier, saying that again you take the geometric mean now of the slices with the coordinate hyperplanes, and then you get a lower bound on the volume. And here you can even characterize completely the equality case, namely equality holds if and only if you have such a generalized cross-connector. Cross-collector. And so, what assumptions do you have kids centered or here? K is a convex body. But then it's a low body. I think that must be because it must be this way. Actually, you apply Steinersmintertation, you reduce it to the case that you have an unconditional body, and then you do the calculation. That's proof. And then the problem posed by Gardner, Cronke, and Son was: does there exist a discrete analog? Can we also do something like this now for the lattice point analytor? So this means that you know somehow the number of lattice points in the slice with coordinate hyperplanes. Can you say something about the number of lattice points in your body? And this seems to be more tricky than in the case of projections. Of projections. And what they proved is: yes, you can do it in dimension two. And there you get also such a best possible inequality if you look at such a stretched, say, cross-polytope, and m tends to infinity. But you see here already that you get here 1 over square root 3, and this is different from what you get here, which is 1 over square root 2. But this is just possible. And so the question, and then their question was, can we And then their question was, can we expect something like this in higher dimensions? And the short answer is no. So in dimensions greater than or equal to three, you cannot expect such a result because here's an example. So what you do, you take a simplex, and here's a picture of it, say in dimension 3. You take some lattice points on the last coordinate axis and then some lattice points parallel to the, say, second coordinate axis. To the say second coordinate axis, you look at the simplex, and what you observe is that each slice has at least, say, m lattice points, but the total number of lattice points is also linear in m. So you cannot win. So at the end, if m tends to infinity, you get nothing. So you get zero. So this is the short answer, but it's not surprising because when you work with convex voices and lattices, and if you think it all... And lattices, and if you think about the theorems of Minkowski, that is quite natural to assume that you have a symmetric convex body. Then you can probably say more. And so we were interested in this class of symmetric bodies. And what we want to understand, oops, what we want to understand is here this intimum. So whether it is bounded away from zero and what it is. Gartner and Cronke and Song in this. And so on in this paper, as I told you, they observed that C is 1 over square root 3. And in general, of course, you get this upper bound. This is the one what's coming from the volume, because whatever you get here works also for the volume, because you just look at slices with coordinate hyperplanes that determine the one of the lattice. So that's clear. But this is roughly 1 over E, this number there, but it has to be smaller. It has to be smaller, namely what we know, it has to be at least, it cannot be, I mean, if n tends to infinity, it cannot be bigger than 1 over square root 3. And there is the example, you take an n minus 1 dimensional cube embedded in the n-dimensional space of edge length 2. And then again, you take a bipyramid over this cube. And now you do just some calculations. Of course, the number of latest points is 3 to the n minus 1. Of lattice points is 3 to the n minus 1 plus 2m. The number of lattice points in the slice orthogonal to the last coordinate direction is 3 to the n minus 1. You get the cube. In all the others, you have 3 to the n minus 2 coming from the slice with the cube. And then plus 2 times m coming from the bipyramid. And then when you do the calculations, and m tends to infinity, you get 3 to the minus, 3 to the 1 minus n over. 3 to the 1 minus n over n. So this is an upper bound, but I mean the question is: can we bound it from below? Can we bound it away from zero? And all what we know at the moment, I hope we can improve it at some point, is yes, you can do it. But in general, what we get is 4 to the minus n. And for the unconditional bodies, we can improve it slightly to 3 to the minus n. And on the next slide, I want to show you some details of the proof in order also to... Details of the proof in order also to show you the differences between, say, volumes and lattice point. So, first of all, what we need here, what we apply at least, is a kind of discrete gen-type theory. This goes back to Tao and Wu. They introduced it in a more general context called generalized arithmetic progressions. And the idea is, in this discrete setting, you want to find something like a John ellipsoid, but now But now via a discrete structure. This means this discrete structure should be a good approximation of the number of lattice points, and you should be also able to easily calculate the number of lattice points of this discrete structure. And in this case here, such a the structure, sorry, the structure looks like this. You take a unibuller matrix, so you take a basis of your lattice set N, and you have here a right-hand side. And you have here a right-hand side vector, and then roughly speaking, what you consider here are just some lattice points in a certain parallel bit. So, generated, I mean, the edge directions of this parallel bit are just the columns of this matrix A. So, you take all integral combinations of the columns of A such that the scalars are bounded in absolute value by this right-hand side Bi. Okay? And then what we And then what we could prove there is then, of course, that you can find such a matrix on the right-hand side, so that these lattice points here are contained in a subset of the lattice points in K. And now if you enlarge the right-hand side by n to the l and n, roughly speaking, then it covers all your lattice points. Okay, this is like the John ellipsoid. In the case of the John ellipsoid, you have square root n is a symmetric case. Square root n is a symmetric case, but here we have something else. And then, of course, you can easily calculate, to easily bound the number of lattice points in K just here by the lattice points in PAB or in this bigger guy. By the way, Tao and Wu posed a problem or ask whether it is possible here to considerable to improve this bound. And this is a problem of index. And this is a problem of independent interest. I mean, we could improve it a little bit, and so we got this n to the ln, but maybe it is even possible there just to write n or to get a polynomial. Okay, another thing which we use here is wrong direction. What we have to understand in the proof is what happens with the number of lattice points if you scale your body k. Lattice points if you scale your body k by an integer n. For the volume, this is not a big thing, but if you do it with the lattice points, you get here an additional factor of 2 to the n. And this is roughly speaking again best possible. If you take a cube of H length 1, send it at the origin, contains one lattice point, you scale it by m, you get 2 times m minus 1 to the n lattice points. So you cannot improve it much. What is the reason for this? Well, basically, scaling a body is roughly. Body is roughly speaking the same as translating convex body. Namely, what you first can prove is that if you take a symmetric convex body and you translate it by an arbitrary vector, then the amount of latest points can increase at most by a factor of 2 to the n. Again, best possible. If you take a cube, h length 1, centered at the origin, translate it by 1 half, 1 half, 1 half, you get 2 to the n lattice points. But what has it to do with scaling? Well, Well what has to do with K mean? Well, if you want to count now the number of lattice points in M times K, then you count them via the cosets of your lattice modulo M set N. So here are the representatives of the cosets. Then you get this. And now you divide by M, okay, then you divide also these uh representatives. But then you have basically just count the number of lattice points with respect to a translated copy of K, and this gives you the bound. copy of k and this gives you the bound. So here you get this bound 2 times m to the n. Yeah and then we use all these things in order to get this bound of 4 to the minus n. Namely we denote these slices by ki. We apply the Disfree-John theorem to the last slide. So this is an n minus one-dimensional slice. And and and and And and and and and then we may assume that the jth column vector of A is not contained in the orthogonal complement of Ej after permutation. And this implies that if we take such a slice, if you take such a slice, if you take such a slice Kj and translate it by one of these lattice vectors, then we know the number of lattice points is exactly if we translate it by all of them, the number of lattice points. By all of them, the number of lattice points in the slice times two times bj plus one, and all of these translations, and this is now the maybe even stupid point, all of these translations are contained in 2k, because this is an element of k and this is an element of k. And so you know that g of 2k is bigger than this. And now you put the things together. You have 2k, the number of lines. You have 2k, the number of lattice points of k is bigger than 4 to the minus n, the number of lattice points in 2k. You know, each 2k, the number of lattice points in 2k is bounded by this, so it's bounded by the geometric mean here, what you get there. Then you enlarge a little bit here the right-hand side, enlarge it a little bit, and compensate this by this little O of n, negative little o of n, and this of course then gives, this, of course, then gives you an upper. Then gives you an upper bound for the last slide. Okay? Because of this discrete John type theory. And then you get the inequality we wanted to prove. But you see, the crucial point here, or the stupid point is that we use the information about the slices kj in order to say something about the number of lattice points in 2k. And we do this because we are not able to use. And we do this because we are not able to use the information about the number of lattice points in the slices to say something about the lattice points in k, which we can use. So that's why we get this 4 to the minus n. Okay, now let me also briefly discuss some related problems and results. First of all, I said at the beginning that we don't have an inverse Loomis-Wittnie inequality, but we can get one if we One if we project on a different set of orthogonal hyperplanes. And I think this was first studied by Campi, Gutzman, and Wrongy in 2018. And then you get also a lower bound on the volume in terms of the geometric mean. And they proved it with this number, which is, I think, something like n to the minus n. But this is not best possible because, in the same year, it was shown by Kodobsky, Savokno, and Svavich that the optimal order is. That the optimal order is n to the minus n over 2. Now, can we expect there a discrete analog? Yes and no, I think, because yes, in the sense that we can just project onto some orthogonal hyperplanes which are irrational and which do not contain any lattice points. Then we are done. But this is not fair. We are done. But this is not fair somehow. So, what we have to do is, in order to make this a problem, we have to project on planes, we have to project also our lattice onto the planes. And we have now to count the number of lattice points in the projection with respect to this projected lattice. And this makes it much more interesting and a bit more difficult, because this in particular means that these vectors along we project have to be We project have to be lattice vectors. But then, of course, if you take your convex body and you project your convex body, you say on such a plane which is orthogonal to a lattice vector, you can have as many lattice points as you wish. Because the determinant of this projected lattice can be as small as you wish if the vector is long enough and primitive. So you have to find really some good vectors in order to do this. So, that you do not count too much. And we can do this via so-called successive minima. And we also use some transference theorems from geometry of numbers. And then you can prove that you get such an inequality. But you see, what I meant is that you count here the number of lattice points now with respect to the projected lattice. And then you get here something with a constant to the minus n. But we have no clue. The minus n. But we have no clue how good it is, whether you can do it better or not. Now, what about we have a reverse Loomis-Wigny inequality? Then, of course you can ask, what about a reverse Maier inequality? And this was also studied, I think, by Feng, Huang, and Li in 2019. And again, they proved that for a symmetric convex body, there exists an orthogonal basis so that you get this bound. So that you get this bound, but this is certainly not the best possible bound. And recently, two weeks ago, one week ago, there was a paper by Alonso Viterez and Frazi Tikos that the optimal order is just a maximal isotropic constant for all central convex bodies. And this means that the order is, at the moment, I think, fourth root of it. What about in the discrete setting? Yes, there you can also prove such an inequality. Prove such an inequality. This means here you can also find some vectors. So you get something like this, but here with an exponent 2 to the n, roughly speaking. Observe that from these results, you cannot recover the volume results, because we don't take care of the determinant of the lattices in the sections. Okay, so that's why you cannot go immediately here from the discrete setting to the continuous setting. Continuous certainly. Let me point out one ingredient of the proof. This is a kind of discrete Brund theorem. Namely, of course, when we are working with the volume, then it's clear if you take a section, then the maximal volume section is always attained if the section passes through the origin. But this is not true in the discrete setting. Again, what you can prove is that the maximal, with respect to lattice points, that's the maximal section is That the maximal section differs by a factor of 2 to the k from the central section. And this inequality is certainly also best possible. I mean, you just take the cube, 0, 1 cube in dimension n minus 1, you embed it to height 1 in dimension n, and then you take also the reflection at the origin, and you draw the, and you do the, look at the convex hull. Look at the convex hull. I mean, let me draw a picture. What you do is you take this guy, and you take this guy. Here's your n minus one dimensional cube now embedded on height one and here on height minus one. Then this section, say the n minus one dimensional section, contains only one lattice point, but this section here, of course, contains two to the n minus one, two to the n minus one, many lattice points. Okay, and this is the reason why you get this. Is the reason why you get this? Basically, this is the reason why you get this 2 to the n. But of course, now you can say, okay, we are not working with the volume, we are working with the lattice points. Why are you interested in central sections? Okay, you can say they are nice. But of course, you can also ask yourself, what do you get if you allow maximal sections with respect to a certain direction? And there you can do it, there you can do it better. This is a kind of inhomogeneous inhomogeneous. In homogeneous version, and then instead of an exponential bound, you get a polynomial bound. And of course, then you can also ask: if you look here at the right-hand sides, if you look here at the right-hand sides, then of course we can replace all the right-hand sides here just by the maximal linear section or by the maximal affine section, right? And this leads then to another class of problems, and to this end, I denote by... Problems, and to this end, I denote by LZK. Ah, it was me. Sorry. This one. You denote by LZ Kn the set of linear lattice subspaces, and by AZKN the set of F lattice subspaces. And there, if you start, say, with M equals 1. with m equals 1 and linear subspaces, then there is a result by Züranberg, and she proved this inequality, which is sharp, which is really best possible. But if you are just interested, say, in an inequality with respect to this number here, maximal one-dimensional slice, then you can rewrite this in this way, which is as entirely best possible. Best possible. What about affine slices, one-dimensional affine slices? There is a very nice and old result, not too old, by Erabinowitz, and he proved this inequality. This says that if you have a convex body and you know that it does not contain more than k collinear lattice points, so lattice points on a line, then the total number of lattice points is most k to the n. This and all these bounds are tied. Well, in the general case we know much less. There is a result by Matthew Alexander, Artem Smovic and myself where we got such a bounce. So for arbitrary slices, okay, so this is here for an arbitrary slice. Again, you can say what happens if we go to affine slices, then you can do it better, a little bit better. You get rid of this exponential factor, but no clue. Exponential factor, but no clue how good it is. But you can also compare this to volume results, and there are many results on volume, on volumes, on slices of volumes. And here are two by Alexander Kordobski and Hasab Pistranopoulos and Ilyakopoulos under the assumption that the origin is an interior port. And I hope I did it in the right way. They did it in a much more general context, namely for arbitrary measures, and then you should get... And then you should get such an inequality. This here is not good at all, in particular in the case m equals 1, when we know that this should be a constant. Here at the moment, we have something which is n to the n. But as I said, this is ongoing work, and I hope we will have better results in the near future. Thank you for attention. Questions? Questions with Samsung's water? This with a cube and then the bipuramid. Yeah, we believe that this is really a good example. At least we don't know a better one. And maybe this is the right one. So we are far off from what we believe, namely then this constant, this Cn would be something like 1 over square root. Cn would be something like 1 over square root 3. And at the moment, we just know that it's 4 to the minus n. But maybe this is a, we believe that this is the basic. Any more questions? Okay, this was the last talk of our morning session. Yes, let's thank all our speakers again here.
