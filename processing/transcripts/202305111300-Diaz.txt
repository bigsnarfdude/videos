Yes, Cesari is working on his post-talk with Maribel, I think, at the moment, and intriguing what evol mining is. So thank you. Hello, everyone. First of all, I would like to thank Maribel and Gavib for the invitation. And now I think that I would like to say Would like to say a little bit about me, about myself. I was trained as a pure mathematician. But recently, I have shifted areas to attack problems in metagenomics. So I want to talk to you about my problem that I was thinking about. That I was thinking along with the city of the United States. Well, I I'm going to talk I'm going to talk to you about the work in progress. As I said before, I presently have changed of area. The overview of the talk is as follow. I wanna give a little review on metagenomics. Little review on metagenomics. Then I want to talk to you about some important problems. And finally, I'm going to talk to you about evomining as a tool that we believe that it can be of help to solve the problem that we are interested in. When metagenomics, I'm going to repeat something that Laisla already told you. Metagenomics is the study. Metagenomics is the study of the genetic material of microbial communities recovered directly from environmental or clinical samples. So here the genomic, the genetic material is from the environment. Here we are interested in the metagenome. The metagenome consists of all the genomes of the microorganisms present in an environmental sample. So we expect to have a lot of different microorganisms, like where we are sampling from the environment. It's almost sure that the diversity is going to be going to be very large. So in the metagenome, this So, in the metagenome is the collection of the genomes of these microorganisms. And why do we study metagenomes? Because most of the microorganisms cannot grow in a culture. So, if we want to study the microbial communities, at least at the moment, At least at the moment, the best way that we have is through metagenomics, studying the metagenomics. Part of the workflow of the metagenomic studies are this, the metagenomic sequencing. Here we obtain the metagenome. The metagenome, the genetic material of the environmental sample. And with this information, we would like to obtain a taxonomic assignation. That's to say, we would like to know what are the microorganisms present in our sample. And also, we would like to know the functional assignation if there are or what are. Or, what are the genes that are expressing or that are present in the environmental sample? There are mainly two techniques for the sequencing. One is through Amplicon, in that we focus on a target part of the genomes, and the other is metagenomes. And the other is metagenomic sequencing, or also called shotgun sequencing, in which we sequence the complete genomes of the metagenome. We take pieces, randomly pieces of the genomes, and we obtain short sequence fragments from all the DNA. Well, this is the complete workflow of the meta-unumen sequencing. We begin with the DNA extraction, then we obtain the shotgun sequencing, then we obtain the DNA sequencing through a DNA sequencer. Here we obtain the reads that are the sequences of Sequences of nucleotides. With the RITs, we would like to obtain a good RID classification that can give us the taxonomic profiling and mainly the taxonomic profiling and the functional profiling. That are the two kinds of information that we would like to know, at least for our problem. But we also could obtain another. Could obtain another type of information. Well, an important problem is how to obtain a good classification of the RIT. How we have a lot of REITs, and maybe in our sample, we can find very similar organisms. It is possible that we can not be able to recover. Be able to recover the correct information about the organisms present in our samples. And this is perhaps the more important problem in metagenomics to achieve an accurate classification of the rates. Well, there are many tools. Tools that search to obtain this taxonomic classification. Here are some of them. They are based on different strategies. Some use camerization of the read, another use some probabilistic approaches. And I think I don't put here, but some. But some of them also use neural networks and machine learning techniques to obtain the taxonomic classification. But until now, no one of them is able to classificate the reeds to the species level. And that is the problem that we would like to solve. We would like to solve, we would like to achieve the species level classification. Well, this is a related problem with the species level classification that we were interested in solving. Let's suppose that. Let's suppose that we know that some species A is present in a metagenomic sample. And also, let's assume that we have N subspecies of the species A. We would like to know accurately which of these subspecies are present. Are present in our metagenome sample. This is a similar problem to the metagenomic approach that Luxla talks us the and That problem is difficult to solve. So, we can relax it a little bit, and at least we would like to classify the rich in the metagenome into the subspecies with the high specificity that we could achieve. Well, this problem was. Well, this problem was appeared in a project that while I was part of the laboratory of Debianformatica Henomica headed by Dr. Nelly Selim at Centro de Incia Mathémámática Sunam. There she was, we were studying the previous problem. The previous problem with a clavivacter, with a species of clavivacter that is a bacteria that infects a lot of ropes that are of interest in Mexico. We try some ideas before we Talk of appliable mining. We also, in fact, we try using topological data analysis, but maybe we don't have the computational power to apply with a problem. We don't obtain good results. So we change our mind to see if we can. Mind to see if we can we will modify the algorithm of EMO mining to obtain some insight. Well, Evo Mining is a tool that was developed by Dr. Anne Li Selim and collaborators with which they were able to obtain candidates to new genes in genome. In genomes that could be part of new piosynthetic gene clusters, we believe that at least the first part of the algorithm could be applied to try to obtain some results to our problem. The solution or the idea was to take all To take all the reads that align to some of the species, super species. This could be obtained with some of the alignment tools. And repeat the same pipeline that before. Apply BLAST to the genomes of the subspecies. We are assumed that these genomes are already known. Are already known, that they are all sequences before, that for a problem this was the case. Then we stay with some of the reads, the best matches, then we apply another blast to obtain the best bidirectional heat. Heat and we in this stage we have that we believe are very created reads and we would like to classify this, to classify them, to obtain some knowledge or some of the if possible the solution. But in this stage is in which we This stage is in which I left the problem, and when I moved to the lab of Dr. Ambrivere, we believe that we one idea is maybe in this stage we could repeat the algorithm with TDA. Maybe here we could obtain good information, but this is to be to be done. To be done, and that's all. Thank you. I would like to thank Dr. Nelliserin at Central Assistance Mathematicas, and also this is the new group of Dr. Maribert, from which I recently joined two weeks ago. And I don't know, there are some comments or questions. Thank you. Thank you very much, Sister. Thank you very much, Cesar. Questions for Cesar before going for lunch? Yes, Richard. So some of the systems you mentioned, like the frog bacteria and other things, when you have the blast step in the workflow, do you find that that's a blocker? Is that a problem? Do enough reads map, or do you need better remote homology detection? Homology detection when you're mapping the reads in those two blast steps that you show with the two reads last, sorry, we pretend to obtain the best. In fact, we obtained some good reads, but we have the problem in this moment is that we don't have how to detect which are the correct reads that map to the true. To the through subspecies present, I don't know if it's because of the homology of the orthology. I believe it is because the species are very similar. Yes, Clara. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Cesar. I just only wonder if it's not going to be so cost-intensive, the use of PLAS again with the metagenomics and the diversity of all the samples. Because you were working with this was more simple because Brillon more or less like some similar. Some similar roots coming from the same genus or species, but now the biodiversity is going to be huge. So I don't know if maybe you could include another tool that map more simple. I don't know. It's just that I guess maybe that's maybe all the last step you use with the network. Network, the machine learning approaches are working well, but this step is going to be very intensive. I don't know. It's not something that I find concerning. Thank you. Okay, thank you very much again, Cesar. And we'll go for lunch now. And we'll be back at three with Back at three with before we get a
