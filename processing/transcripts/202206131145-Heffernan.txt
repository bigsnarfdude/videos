I just want to make sure that everyone can hear me clearly. Yes, okay, thanks. Yes, so the work that I'm going to talk about today is a huge collaboration and I'd like to acknowledge funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research, CIR, NCERC, Canadian Immunization Research Network, the COVID Immunity Task Force, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and And a certain NCERC emerging infectious disease modeling networks called Omni, Rioni, and Mathematics for Public Health. So I'm interested in, sorry, does someone have a question? Okay. I'm interested in modeling immunity. And so that means that what I try to do is look at how your immune response or your immune response. Response or your immune system is going to affect your susceptibility. And so we have our susceptibility down here. And then we look at what's happening in your body if you do happen to get infected. So first we look at susceptibility. If you do get infected, we model how the pathogen and your immune system interact. And we look at the development of immunity. And specifically, we look at antibodies. We look at antibodies, some cytokines and chemokines, but also memory B cells and memory CD4 and CB8 T cells. So we're interested in really looking at the longevity of immunity against different pathogens depending on your history of infection and vaccination. And then, so we're interested, so if you get infected with a pathogen, then weeks later, if you're re-exposed, will you get infected or not today? Will you get infected or not? And if you do, will it be asymptomatic or symptomatic? And then we look at many years later as well. So using some simple calculus, we're also able to align our in-host infection curves and immune response curves to looking at symptoms. And then that can help us when we're looking at population level models also identify individuals who have symptoms. Individuals who have symptoms, and then we look at the changes in behavior and that they'll stay home from work or school, hopefully. We can do the same thing for vaccination, where we look at how vaccines are eliciting immune response and looking at the development of memory or immunity, antibodies, B cells, and CD4 and CD8 T cells as well. And the model that we use depends on the type of vaccine that That we are considering. Like, for example, with COVID-19, we've looked at protein subunit vaccines and viral vector vaccines and mRNA vaccines, and our models are similar but slightly different. And we're also, when we're taking all of this information in terms of in-host infection and in-host immunity, when we're looking at the infection of an individual, we're trying to quantify how transmissible that individual will be. And that's going to also depend. And that's going to also depend on their initial conditions of their immune system when they become infected with a pathogen. And so their symptoms depend on that initial condition, and so does their transmissibility to expelling quanta or expelling pathogen into the community. And so when we incorporate all that information into our population level models, then we also need to keep track of Also, we need to keep track of how individuals are changing their behavior over time. Like, for example, with COVID-19, whether they're wearing masks or practicing social distancing, and then looking at the natural waning of those behaviors over time too. So then, and ultimately, of course, we're interested in looking at how pathogens are moving around the world, but more from my group, we're looking at how immune systems are moving around. Immune systems are moving around the world. And so you can imagine that trying to quantify the distribution of immunity against a particular pathogen in Toronto will be very different than the distribution of immunity in, say, Kelowna, because the distribution of ages, ethnicities, and sex are going to be quite different. We know in Toronto, I think it's like 60%. I think it's like 60% of Torontonians weren't born in Toronto and 50% weren't born in Canada or something like that. And so there's a very diverse population in Toronto compared to some other Canadian cities. So just a reminder, we're really interested in quantifying what immunity, what protection you're going to gain from your immune system over time. And there are two levels of protection. And there are two levels of protection that you can get. The first is protection against getting infected. And then the second is that if you do become infected, you have a protection against getting severe infections. And so we look at those two different levels of protection in the population. But immunity also is dynamic in how it affects us. And so our immune systems are always changing. We're getting boosts in immunity from infection or vaccination. But over time, we can also. But over time, we can also have an effective waning of our immunity. And that waning can be simply due to the fact that our antibodies and our memory cells populations are decaying in our bodies. So they're being cleared. And so we could be moving down this conveyor belt and then maybe get another booster shot or maybe we'll get an infection and so on. But it could also be due to the fact that the pathogen is evolving. So our effective level of immunity is changing over time, moving us down. Is changing over time, moving us down this conveyor belt. And then, if you go across the conveyor belt, you should also think about age. As you're aging, your comorbidities are changing, your immune response is also changing up until puberty, and then there's more change, some decay in your immune response after that. And so, you could think that as you're moving across this conveyor belt, the boost that you experience from infection or curb vaccination can be quite different. Okay, so we've been interested in quantifying the distribution of immunity in a population over COVID-19. And so here is a statistical analysis of seroprevalence surveys by Canada Blood Services that the COVID Immunity Task Force, which is based at McGill in Quebec, has done. And so they take in And so they take in seroprevalence, so anti-N and anti-S antibody measures from blood donors, and they have a statistical model that they use to determine what the distribution of immunity or the sterile prevalence really is in different Canadian provinces over time given measures of anti-N and anti-S. And so we've been interested in doing the same type of quantification, but using a mechanistic model. But using a mechanistic model. And so, our research question is: We want to quantify the level of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 over time from vaccination and infection by age, considering different variants of concern. And in order for us to do that, we really need to also understand the immunity generation from vaccination that individuals are obtaining. The immunity generation from infection. We know that individuals can have mild, moderate, or severe infections. We need to understand more about that. And then we want to look at. About that. And then we want to look at the immunity protection by age and by variant of concern. And so, in order for us to do that over COVID-19, we've been tracking infections, hospitalizations and deaths, and vaccination by age. We have considered looking at the outcomes of vaccination from Edenovirus vaccines and mRNA vaccines. So, specifically Astravenica, Pfizer, and Moderna, because those would be. Pfizer and Moderna, because those have been used in the Canadian population. And then we also have to track public health interventions because these interventions change contact structures. Remember, we want to look at the distributions of immunity by age. So we need to take into consideration how different age groups are contacting other age groups during certain public health mitigation intervention windows. And then we need to look at how the public health interventions are also affecting the effective. Are also affecting the effective susceptibility and effective transmissibility of individuals. So, if people are told to stay home when they're sick, then they will, that's going to affect their transmissibility. And if people are home are told to stay home when they're not sick, that's going to affect their susceptibility effectively. Okay, so when I talk about immunity, I'm typically talking about antibodies in B cell memory and T cell memory, which has to do with C D4 and C D8 T cells. Do with CD4 and CD8 T cells, and there are lots of other components of the immune system as well. What we do is we look at the two levels of protection. So, we have protection against infection and protection against severe disease. We also incorporate waning into our model. So, we need to consider that and consider how immunity is varying by variant concern and look at immune escape mechanisms. So, the first thing that we're going to talk about are some in-host models that we've done for vaccination and infection, and then we'll Vaccination and infection. And then we'll look at the assumptions that we've gathered from those studies. And we're going to embed those assumptions into a population-level model of immunity. Okay, so here's an in-host model that we've developed to look at AstraZeneca. So we had antibody data and we had interfering gamma data. Of course, you can see that we wanted to model many things, but we had to simplify the model down to To simplify the model down to down because of identifiability. And so we had data for interferon gamma and for antibodies. And we wanted to see how we could project what's happening in the T helper 1 arm. So looking at CDH T cells that can kill infected cells. So we're looking at memory priming in there. And then we're also looking at the T helper 2 arm, where the T helper 2 activates B cells to become plasma cells that make antibodies. Plasma cells that make antibodies. We have a very similar model that we have used for Pfizer and Moderna. So the mRNA vaccines act differently in activating the immune response and specifically in terms of infecting cells to make RNAs. And so you can see over here that there's a little bit of difference in how they're working, and the models are similar, but a little bit different. Okay. Okay, so when we were looking at AstraZeneca, we had some clinical trial data, which you can see on the left. So here we have measurements for IgG, which is an antibody. We looked at the clinical trial where we had one dose data and two dose data for different age groups. And then we had interferon-gamma data as well for one doses, for one dose and two doses for different age groups. So we fit the mathematical. Different age groups. So we fit the mathematical model to the data and then we try to project what the outcomes for the T cells and antibodies would look like. For the mRNA vaccines, we also have clinical trial data for Pfizer and Moderna. So Pfizer is our BNT162B2 data here, and Moderna is the mRNA 1273. And we plot that here, but it's important to note, I'll just show. I'll just show here for a sec that we have arbitrary units on our y-axis for many of these data sets. And so while it looks like on the right-hand side that Pfizer produces less immunity than Moderna, Pfizer is in red and Moderna is in green, we do have one study that looked at Pfizer and Moderna in the same lab with the same hands. And you can see, so that's here in the middle. so that's here in the middle and that study has shown that Pfizer and Moderna outcomes in terms of IgG response and we do have other data are similar and so what we did is we took the mathematical models we fit the mathematical models to the data and then we quantified what our antibody outcomes were going to look like over over time and then we also quantified what our CDHT cell population was going to look like over time so we could get an idea of what the general Over time, so we could get an idea of what the generation of memory CD8 T cells would look like. So, on the left-hand side is an output from our AstraZeneca study, where what we did is we looked at what happens if you spread your two doses of vaccine more than four weeks apart. And we looked at what our CDHT cells would look like at the same time. And we were actually able to show that even if you spread the doses very You spread the doses very far apart, and even if you diminish the size of the second dose, you can still get T cell measures and antibody measures that are similar to what have been measured in individuals that have been infected and have had neutralizing immunity. And so that is an interesting outcome from the AstraZeneca in-host modeling study. On the other three figures here, we were able to look at the decay. We were able to look at the decay of antibodies over time. We looked at other components as well, but I'm just going to talk about antibodies. And we were able to show that if we looked at just Moderna, by day 238, 238 passed dose two, there would be 99% loss of peak antibody that the individual obtained from vaccination. And for Pfizer, it's a little bit worse that you would only have one. Bit worse that you would only have 1% of your antibodies left from peak value at day 190. And so when we were doing the study, we were showing that the current accepted third dose timeframe that was recommended by the US CDC was too long. And at the same time that we were writing up these results, the CDC changed the recommendation to be in line with what we arrived. Recommendation to be in line with what we are actually showing. So, those were a couple of in-host vaccination studies. We also have looked at in-host infection, where we have some data for interleukin-2, interferin gamma, and granzyme B, and we embed that into an infection model for COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2. And we look at what our outcomes are going to look like for different patients. For look like for different patients and obtain parameter values for some of our immune system components that will help us understand when individuals are going to have a mild, moderate, or severe infection. And so here, what you can see is data where we have data for interfering gamma, interlithin 2, and granzyne B. And we have our severe patients, our fit are in black, moderate are in orange, and mild are in green. Are in green. And you can see here that our mathematical model is showing that interfering gamma levels are lower in mild infections, and same with interleukin2. For mild and moderate, they're similar for granzyne B, and they're higher in severe patients. And then so what we did is we actually fit the mathematical model to all the different patients that are in the study. And here are some examples of what the fits look like for individuals who have a mild infection. Individuals who have a mild infection versus a severe infection. We've also been able to fit mathematical models to data for different large studies done by Goyle, Neant, Jones, and Key for studies that are mostly looking at severe infections and mild infections, where we also have data for nasal and saliva infection data, and whether we have early data or we don't have. Early data, or we don't have early data in the data set. And so we take all of this information from all of the fitting of our in-host models to clinical trial data and all of our in-host models to infection data, and we use that to help us understand what the immune response looks like. And so some things that we've been able to find is that an immune response from a mild infection, after a mild infection, you gain less immunity than you do. Less immunity than you do after a severe infection. And we've also been able to see that the decay rate, thus, of our immunity, like our antibodies over time, is slightly different in individuals who've had mild or severe infections. But ultimately, it also means that individuals who've gained less immunity from an infection or from a vaccination will have immunity for a shorter period of time. For a shorter period of time. Okay, so from all of our in-host modeling studies and also combing the literature, we've been able to, and looking at sensitivity analysis of our in-host modeling studies, we've been able to gain some assumptions where we're going to assume at the population level that if individuals are getting a mild infection, their immunity that they gain will be less than what they get from a moderate infection. Get from a moderate infection, which will be less than what they gain from a severe infection. Okay. And so we're going to incorporate those assumptions into a mathematical model of our population over time for infection of COVID-19. So here we have four different levels of susceptibility. These are individuals that are in S1 are totally susceptible to COVID-19. To COVID-19. In S2, they have some protection against infection. And if they do get infected, then they have some protection against severe disease. S3 has more protection against infection and more protection against severe disease if they do get infected. And F4 has total protection from infection. You can see that we assume that individuals who have a mild infection then move to the S2 class of immunity, moderate infection, they move to S3. Infection they move to S3 and severe infection they move to S4. We've also been able to determine, so this is for this is an age-structured model. So over every five-year age group, we have the same system of equations. And the probabilities of getting mild, moderate, and severe infection are going to depend on the average comorbidity status of that age. Early on in the pandemic, we were able to gain from To gain from the literature that your comorbidities are going to affect the probability of mild, moderate, and severe infection, and comorbidities also increase with respect to age. And so we can incorporate that data directly into this model with these probabilities. We've also been able to incorporate the vaccination program. And so, this is incorporating one dose of vaccine and two doses of vaccine. And the shade of And the shade of purple that we have here is allows us to assume or is indicating that we are assuming that we have the same characteristics as the similarly shaded susceptible class. And so all these vaccinated classes that are in the darker purple, we're assuming are resistant to infection. And then this, if you have one dose from an S2 class, then you have a similar immunity to S3. If you have one dose from If you have one dose from S1, you have similar immunity to S2. And again, remember that S1 means that you have no immunity at all. So there are some assumptions that we've embedded into this model, apart from just the structure of immunity. We've also considered a different waning rate. So these omega W's, we look at the waning rates of vaccination and infection over time. We also have early on. We also have early on in the pandemic been able to set our transmission rate, beta, to the basic reproduction number that has been measured in the Canadian context. We pick a value of 2.6. And we assume that individuals who are mildly infected have a lower beta than people who are moderately infected. And we also assume that people who have a severe infection have even a lower value of beta because they're feeling sick and Because they're feeling sick and will stay home, or they're going to hospital and are wearing a mask. When we incorporate different age groups into the model, we also have to incorporate different age structures. And so what we've done is we've looked at the synthetic contact matrices for the Canadian context from Prem et al. And we've designed different contact matrices given the different public health intervention strategies that have been taken and all of the Canadian contexts. That have been taken in all of the Canadian provinces over time. Where here we have no mitigation. And then phase zero is what we had when we had total lockdown, where we had school closures and most people were working from home. Phase one has a little bit of not working from home and a little bit of school opening. And phase three has school opening, but still some work from home. But you can see for all these different no mitigation and so on, that when we look at the contact rate for the activity. The contact rate for the activity of our individuals over age, that this age group, the 15 to 19-year-olds, always have the highest level of activity or the highest level of contact. And so we were also able to see early on, even pre the vaccination rollout, that any coverage of this age group will also positively benefit all the other age groups. We're looking at the indirect effect of vaccination in that age group, and we found that. And we found that vaccination in this age group will always benefit all the other age groups. And so that was one of our findings that we relayed to our public health officials. When we're looking at our contact structures and how they change over time, we need to take into consideration that all of the provinces had different rules over different time windows. And so we've had to collect a lot of data regarding what all the provinces Regarding what all the provinces have done, you can see that Ontario, which is where I currently am, has been very strict in the closures for closing schools, closing work, and closing other overtime. And then you can see that the more relaxed provinces like BC has been better in terms of not having to enforce as many restrictions as Ontario has has. But so we've gathered all this data and if you But so we've gathered all this data and if people are interested in getting this data to do some of their own studies, you can please get in touch with me. We're currently writing up an article that we'll submit soon on the database that we're continually updating with students in my group. So going back to the model, when we're comparing our model to data, like we want to fit this model to data, so then we have to understand how we're going to observe these different. We're going to observe these different classes of infections in data. And so, for severe infections, we've assumed that these are individuals that will definitely need to go to health care, whether it's just to go to a doctor for consultation, and then some subset of these individuals will go to hospital and maybe will die. So we definitely assume that severe infections will be captured in all infection reporting. And we assume that all hospitalizations will be a subset of this class. Subset of this class. For our moderate infections, we assume that some of these infections are reported since they have some mild symptoms and there's also contact tracing. But for our mild infections, we assume usually, generally, we've done some sensitivity analysis, of course, on these assumptions, that these individuals won't be, we won't have a high level of detection of these individuals unless there's contact tracing and unless there's rules like if you want. That there's rules like if you want to go visit grandma, you have to go get tested first. We've also looked at different characteristics for the vaccination program. So we're looking at protection against infection from if you only have one dose or if you have two doses, and then also looking at that secondary level of protection against severe disease, where then you have a probability of moving down more towards mild infections versus moderate and severe, depending on your vaccination status. Vaccination status. So, when we incorporate all of these different things into the model, then what we do is we fit the model with all these different age groups, five-year age group, to case data or hospitalization data. And we have this parameter Kappa that then we scale. And Kappa gives us a reflection actually of six different things. So, Kappa incorporates our PPE compliance and relaxation. Our PPE compliance and relaxation, wearing masks, for example, social distancing compliance and relaxation, as well as ebbs and increases in testing rates and contact tracing rates, changes in virus transmissibility, and the effect of weather on transmissibility. And so we're currently, we've written a grant, and we're seeing how to parse Kappa up given different data sets where we have weather, we have different testing positivity rates. Different testing positivity rates. And we're doing a study on behavior to look at what that natural relaxation rate is for waning behavior in terms of wearing masks and social distancing. So we have a fit where we fit our mathematical models to the data and we use Kappa to parse these six effects. Okay, so of course we varied assumptions. I'm not going to go into that in detail. Go into that in detail, but we do always vary the waning rate. We also vary what our levels of susceptibility are, and we vary what our protection levels of S1, 2, 3, and 4 are compared to each other. And we also vary some assumptions on our vaccine protection capabilities. So here's an example of what our model looks like when we fit it to data. So we have here daily incidence data for case reports, our solid Case reports, our solid black line, our daily, is our daily incidence of our severe infections. And then the dashed line here is our daily incidence of severe plus moderate. And then there's another line that we could plot here where it's our severe plus moderate plus mild. And so here we're assuming that our ascertainment is 100% of severe infections and 80% of our moderate infections. So we do vary these assumptions and we look at what the fits look like. Look like. After we've done the fit, we look at how our fitting compares to our different age groups. And so, here you can see if you look at the zero to nine year olds, we're always capturing the severe and moderate infections into the zero to nines. But when you go and you look at our 60 to 69 year olds, we're always capturing the severe infections and we're not always capturing the moderate infections. And this has been And this has been, this kind of gives us an indicator that these individuals are less likely to go to health care or to go get a doctor's appointment or go to hospital or go get tested unless they feel very sick. We also can show you here that when we incorporate our first dose rollout by age and our second dose rollout by age in the simulation, we're actually also capturing the same level of coverage. Level of coverage, and this is looking at the FIP2 Ontario, and we can see that our vaccination outputs look similar. So, now finally, we can get to looking at what a distribution of immunity looks like over time. So, here, the different shades in each one of these colors is looking at age groups 0 to 9, 10 to 19, and so on up to 70 plus. Our red are our age groups where we have Age groups where we have everyone in S1. So red is totally susceptible. Blue is S2, or you've had one dose of vaccine when you were in S1. Yellow is S3, or you've had one dose of vaccine if you were in S2. And green are in S4, or have had two doses of vaccine, or have had one dose of vaccine from S3 or from S4. Okay, so these individuals are. Okay, so these individuals are totally protected from infection. These have some protection against infection and from severe disease. They have a little, these blue individuals have a little bit of protection from infection and severe disease. And then red is totally susceptible. So after we've done our fitting for all the different provinces and maybe even nationwide of the mathematical model, we can then plot what our distributions of immunity look like for all these susceptibility levels. Susceptibility levels. And so, one thing that we were able to see, so this is an example of a fit that we did back in August 2021, and we were trying to project what the fall wave would look like. And so, here we were able to see in Ontario that there needs to be more vaccination coverage in 12 to 29-year-olds. And so, this was feedback that we were able to give to the Ontario model and consensus table that then can be interpreted and be given to the Ontario Public. Given to the Ontario public health officials to maybe have a new media campaign or to go out to schools and talk about getting vaccinated. We were also able to see that most of our infections in the fall wave are going to be mild, moving people into S2, and moderate, moving people into S3. We can see that the waning of immunity is overtaking the number of severe infections that were actually going to happen in the fall wave. Actually, going to happen in the fall wave. But when we did look at the severe infections, we were able to also see that 50% of severe infections in the fall wave would be in individuals who are age 50 plus. And so we also were able to give feedback here to state that a third dose or booster dose of vaccination should be provided to all individuals 50 plus, especially those with comorbidities, starting in September. September. With the mathematical model, we're also able to track who's being infected. And so you can see here that over time, most of the people who are being infected are people who are in the S1 class. So either they've never left S1 or they have been infected and then have waned back down into S1. You can also see that most of our infections are happening in the older age group. Older age groups, and some of our infections are happening in the S2 classes of our age groups as well. There's very little infection in the mathematical model in our children, in the model. Over the course of the pandemic, we're also able to look at what our accertainment rate looks like. So, early in the pandemic, we were getting about two and a half infections that were not reported for every one reported infection. And then after about And then after vaccination, that ascertainment rate is going to change up to five. Because remember that when you vaccinate individuals in the population, you're then increasing their probability that they're going to have a mild infection. And so then unless you increase your contact tracing rates and your testing rates, you're going to have a lower ascertainment rate post-vaccination. And so that makes sense that we'll have a higher, a worse ascertainment rate. Worse ascertainment rate, but overall the outcome of the pandemic in the population will be better. So, recently, we've been extending the model to incorporate more than the first and second dose and fitting it to data. And then also trying to track the, to be able to differentiate between infections in people who've never been vaccinated and infected. Never been vaccinated and infections in people who have been vaccinated over time. And then we're also able to change the characteristics of what we're going to assume our immune system looks like from vaccination versus from infection, and then even versus infection and vaccination combined. And so here's a mass, here's a figure, I guess, that we've plotted to look at different levels of immunity. For here in white are people. We're here in white are people who are S1, who are totally susceptible. And then here we have people by different age groups that are residing in the different susceptible and vaccinated classes over time. And we're currently fitting this to Omicron data as well to see if we can go further into 2022 and then start looking at projections for the fall. So this work was done by a lot of different people. Done by a lot of different people. And then I'd just like to reiterate that there's been a lot of funding that's been going, that's been used to support my group over the course of the pandemic as well. And so hopefully we have some time for questions.
