Thanks for inviting me and I'm very pleased to be at PEMP again. And this is joint work with Maria Stair and Linda and James and Jane. It's about the complementing number of T-perfect graphs. So let me start with the stable set. Maybe I don't have to define this over this. And the perfect graphs, I guess everybody knows perfect graphs. And when you have a graph, we can talk about the stable set polytope, which is a convex hull of the characteristic instance vectors of the stable sets in a graph. And so the instance vector is zero one vector representing the subset of the button set. Subset of the button set. And then when you have a point in the stable set polytop, you have some easy inequalities that should be satisfied. So one inequality is the clique inequality, that when you add some of the coordinates corresponding to a click, then it has to be at most one, because each stable set intersection with the clique has size at most one. And obviously, every coordinate has to be. Every coordinate has to be non-negative because it was convex of gerbil vectors. And if you ignore all other things, just take these two inequalities, then it's called the fractional stable step polytope. So let me write Q step. And it turns out that I mean the stable step polytope and Q step the fractional stable step polytopes are not always equal. That quality are not always equal. So here's an example: like C5, where if you put weights half every vertex, it's not in the stable set polytope, but it is in the fractional stable set polytope. You can easily check all the inequalities. And in 70s, it turns out it's known from 70s. It's known from the 70s that the stable step polytope is equal to the fractional stable step polytope if and only if graph is perfect. So we have characterization. And then we may wonder what happens if we add more inequalities instead of having just two inequalities, click inequalities, non-negativity. So are there any other inequalities that has to be satisfied by any point? By any points inside the stable separator. So there's one inequality, it's called the odd circuit inequality. So whenever you have an induced art cycle C, then you want the sum of the weights to be at most like length of the cycle minus 1 over 2. This is because when you have an induced cycle, any stable cell will have intersection at most, I mean, half of the cell. Most, I mean, half of that, right? So we can add that into the fractional stable set polytheum, right? Having more inequalities, you might have a lot more, you would have smaller polyton. So hopefully, this could be closer to the stable set polyton. So the H step, I don't know why they call it H, but H step a pole. H sample, a core, okay. Right. So this is the polytop defined by these three types of inequalities. And we say graphics A is perfect if these two polytops are equal. And then to have a simpler case, I mean, so let's eliminate some of the inequalities here. Let's eliminate some of the inequalities here. So instead of all click inequalities, if you only care about clicks of size 2, then we call it an edge inequality. Then this is called the T step. And then graph is T perfect. T step is equal to step. So you can now see the containment between these various polytops. These various polytops. So, stable set polytop is included in the H step, and H step is included in the fractional stable set polytope and the T step. And graph is perfect, that means this is equal to that. So, that means this is equal to that. So, perfect implies H perfect. And if graph is T perfect, then this is equal to that. So, that means this. So that means this is equal to that. So T perfect implies H perfect. But also T perfect graphs cannot have K4 sub and use subgraphs. If you have K4, then we see that this one-third weight will not be in the stable step polytop, but it's in T-step. And if you don't have K4, then when you go back to these inequalities, Back to these inequalities, then you don't have people, this edge inequality is enough. When you have a triangle, it's also an odd circuit. So triangle is covered, so clinic inequality for triangle is covered by the odd circuit inequality. So t step will be equal to h step if you don't have k4. So t graph is t perfect if and on it, it has no k4 and h perfect. H perfect graph. And just like perfect graphs, H perfect graphs, and P perfect graphs are closed undertaking in use of graphs. And now, previously I showed you that one-third, if you put weights one-third everywhere, it's in T-stack from K-pole. But this is true for any graph, right? So if you have any graph. Any graph, right? So if you have any graph, let's take the one-served vector, then all three inequalities are satisfied. This is obviously true, these two are obviously true. This is for any, you look at the induced R cycle, and this inequality is true. So that means t-step political always contain this vector. So that means if graph is And if graph is T perfect, then I can write this as a convex combination of the instance vectors of state sets. Then if you rescale, then that means I can cover all vertices by the fractional collection of the stable sets. So the fractional chromatic number will be at most 3. So T-perfect graphs have a fractional chromatic number at most 3. Chromatic number at most three. So the natural question is: then, actually, can you prove the chromatic number is at most three? And this was asked by Bruce Shepherd in the 90s and disproved by Lorenz Seymour. Maybe you don't remember. It was not in, so it was mentioned in other paper. And then Bruce Shepherd later asked. And then Bruce Shepherd later asked again: How about any constant C instead of 3? And this is the problem that we are answering. So we prove that chromatic number is almost 150,000. And so the actual number is keep decreasing. So last night I changed some truth, so it's it's getting smaller and smaller. Smaller and smaller, under 40 to under 49,000, under 42,000. Yeah. And so previously, Henning Brun and others and Cao Wang had some various special cases where they prove recolorable, like cloth free or P53 or VOC, then recolorable. But we don't know the But we don't know the example where you require five colors. Can you give us a couple examples? What's a graph that's not G perfect except for K4? Oh. Subdivisions of K4? Yeah. Ad will. There's no hope of the structure there, is there? No, no, no. Some way to build that. Way to build. That's a major open problem. That's like the open problem of T Perfect Graphs is to get a contract for it. Sorry, I shouldn't be able to do it. I knew your first episode of T Perfect. Yeah, but it's your talking. Welcome to interaction. And if we know the bound for T perfect graphs, then we will have a bound for H perfect graphs by using this simple lemma. Lemma that when you have this is due to undersever and the lemma says that when you have a H perfect graph, I can find the stable set so that when I delete it, click number decreases quickly. So if I have an H perfect graph with a click number K, then I keep picking out one stable set, one stable set, until I have no K4. I have no p4, then it becomes p perfect curves. So that you can apply induction. And the proof of this is, I mean, you take the, let's say, take a long vector where each coordinate is one over omega. Then it's easy to check that this is inside H step. But H, since the graph is H perfect. But H, since the graph is H perfect, H stat is equal to stat. So since this is in the stable set polytheum, you have a linear convex combination of stable sets whose weight is, whose sum is this kind, and then you can read. This means that fractional chromatic number is at most omega. Then take the one of the stable set here and delete from the graph. Then the fraction. And the fractional chromatic number is strictly less than omega. So that means omega of the new graph is strictly less than initial omega. So I have a stable set, deletion, then omega t drops, so I can take out stable sets. So this is how we uh deduce the H perfect graphs about this formatting number of H perfect graphs. Is the most ominous person constant. And by the same method, we can increase the adgers, which is the length of the shortest ad cycle. The reason is it's a similar proof. So when you have a T perfect graph with ad girls at least twelve plus one, then fractional chromatic number is at most two plus one over L. 2 plus 1 over L and the idea is that you can easily see that this vector where each coordinate is 1 over 2 plus 1 over L is in the t-step. That implies that fractional chromatic number is at most 2 plus 1 over L. And 2 plus 1 over L is exactly the fractional chromatic number of the cycle of lengths 12 plus 1. So when you have people pick up with articles 12 plus 1, added verse 3 plus 1 then I can still find the stable set so that when I delete it the fractional commenting number drops the fractional crematic number drops then you cannot have any odd cycle of like square plus 1 because this that was the fractional chromatic number of odd cycle so that means adverse increases and this is nice nice because This is nice because many proofs will be simplified when you increase the articles. You don't have a short cycle. So this is the 11. So we increased the articles to 11 by dropping, taking out some stable sets four times, maybe, right? Four times? Yeah, something like that. And then we prove committee numbers and most. prove committing numbers at most something. It could be two, one for two or yeah. And there's an operation to preserve the T perfectness. This is due to Potter and Bruce Shepherd. And this is called the T contractions. So you take about X whose neighborhood is stable. And what you do is contract every S instant with the technology. Is construct every instant with that vertex so that this vertex created with all the neighbors become one vertex. And turns out that T contraction preserves T perfectness. And then we say that smaller graph H is a T minor figure graph G if you can obtain smaller graph from the figure graph by a sequence of vertex deletions and T contractions. And but extremely also preserves the T perfectness, so every T minor of a T perfect graph is T perfect. So what we actually prove is that if you have a graph with articles at least 11 and no other field as a T minor, then chromatic number is valid. We don't use any T perfectness in the proof. Use any T perfectness in the proof. And why as wheel? Outwheel is not T perfect. So you can see it confused a little bit. Oh, now I'm very good on time, I think. Right, so why is it good to have large ad curves? So typically, Other girls. So typically, in many of this chi-bounded proof, you use this leveling technique. You start with one vertex and the component of large chromatic number. And you look at the vertices of distance 1, distance 2, 3, etc. So it's level. And since adverse is big, first four levers will be only stable, but when you take a union of all of them, it's going to be bipartite. You don't have any outside regions. You don't have any other cycle inside. And some of the ideas were from this paper by Maria, Alex, Paul, and Sophie that if you don't have a long life cycle, then cloud is kind of net. And what we have What we have is like lemma like this, where if you have large chromatic number, then we want to find five vertices, q1, 2, q3, q4, q5. And from qi to qi plus 1, you have two induced paths, one of even length, one of other lengths. So that when I combine any of these two, any of these two. Any of these two, any of these two, any of these two, any of those two, etc., always have an induced cycle. So that I can control the parity as I like. So the one member we have is like, yes, I shouldn't say R here because the paper will prove it for not only five vertices, but R vertices. When you have a large promoting number, we can find. Krammetic number, we can find such configuration. So you start with the vertex in a component of large chromatic number. We do the leveling. There's some level with a huge chromatic number. So inside we find this configuration with five special vertices. Now I take the parents of the oldest vertices. Parents of the oldest vertices in the previous layer, previous layer for these five vertices. And then take the minimally connected subgraph containing these five vertices. And then one can prove that it doesn't have long no, it doesn't have a size. It doesn't have a cycle of length it doesn't have cycle of length smaller than 11 and then since articles is big this becomes bipartite it doesn't have a long cycle yeah that's more precise it doesn't if you have a long cycle then I can delete it and stay graph stays connected or Stays connected, or you can have a I mean, let's say I have a minimal connected subgraph containing all these five vertices. And if I must, then I can assume that if I have any other vertex, if I delete it, every component should contain one of these five vertices. So if this graph contains cycle, then cycle may go through any of those. Any of those, but if I have any vortex through it, then there's a component containing the vortex of this, and this component doesn't intersect with any of the vertices. So every vertex on the cycle is either in either one of these five vertices or has a private component having a vertex of the chosen five vertices. So the length of cyclone cannot be too long. And that And that but since adverse is B, this minimum connected subgraph contains these π vertices, is bipartite. And if it's bipartite, then what's nice is out of five vertices, we take the three of them in one side of the bipartition. So let's say these three are one side of the bipartition. So let's say these three are one side of the bipartition, having neighbors into this configuration, the level of large chi. And what we do is, since this is conducted by part I subgraph, in u subgraph, we do the t contractions from the right hand side. From the right hand side, we do t contraction for every vertex. Then we keep reducing the right. Keep reducing the right. Once you contract one vertex on the right, the neighborhood is stable because it's bipartite, and you can move the new vertex to the left, right? And you stay bipartite. So you keep contract to the right, to the left, so that right-hand side decreases and everything on the left will become single vertex. Then you have a picture like out of here, we have the fruit. We have the proof. So, holding here will be contracted into a single vertex. When you go back to the previous slide, by t contraction, so delete these all these other vertices, this bipartite subgraph into subgraph will become a single vertex having neighbors. And there's a lemma that if you have a configuration, you might have more neighbors in this press, but This industry, but once you have such a configuration, then you have an ugly perfect. So that's the proof. Thank you. But the problem is you had the you had no ropes, you know, even files and all the files perfectly fast. White, I mean, isn't all you Why didn't I mean, isn't all you needed an old cycle there? Yeah, so we use this Pizon principle, right? Out of five, I choose three, which is on the one side of my particle, and then what we need is, so if let's say Q1, Q3, Q4 are these three vertices, I want this path to be add lengths. So I need to choose even add, etc. Yeah, it's a question. How difficult is it to find this red room structure? Okay, James made it. Oh, yes, James and Jane wrote the lemma. But the proof is like two pages, three pages. Yeah. Yeah. It's just different. Yeah, this this paper the uh idea is that paper but for us since articles is big it's there's some simplification? Why not? Why not? So, and I missed a step. So, you proved if they go to V7 and they're like moving on tolerable or something? What was it? Yeah, it's a huge difference. Yeah, yeah, these are some digits. It changes every night, so it changes, it decreases so fast. Under fifty thousand. So if you go to 999, it should be okay. Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, I think last night I got 142 or something. There are many small rules, but I think that's a good question.
