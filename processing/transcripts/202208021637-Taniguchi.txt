From Japan. So, two minutes ago, I said good morning. Now, in Japan, the time is 7:30 in the morning, but I think you are in banff in the afternoon. And in my talk, I will speak about balanced reaction diffusion equation. And this is balanced reaction diffusion equations, usually called Alenka equation or anagmo equation. And this G of U, this is G prime U is a derivative of we cannot see the next slide. Just the first slide. Just first slide. Just past slide. Sorry, just just a moment. Now we can see the third. Peter, just how about this one? Anyway, can you see the equation? Yeah, we see the equation on page number three. It's okay. So this is this is equation and G prime this is a G manybody write W of U is a potential and U0 is bounded and uniformly continuous given function. This is a Caucasian problem and this is a potential This is a potential term G. And as I said before, manybody write this potential term W. Just please think G is W. And minus one plus one, G takes zero at one and minus one, and derivative is zero, and the second derivative is positive. positive and always here is positive takes g takes positive value and then and if g s is this special term minus g prime s is s minus s cubic then the equation is called the alenkan equation or nagma equation and balanced sometime or in my talk In my talk, balance means g1 and g minus one is equal. Then I call this balance. Otherwise, I call this is imbalanced. So this is sometimes imbalanced or unbalanced. So I maybe if this is not zero, not equals. Not zero, not equals, maybe imbalanced is better than unbalanced, I think. So in this case, u minus u cubic, this is called Alenka equation. So just you can consider my talk is for Alenka equation. And for result for Result for balanced nonlinearity is so Chen, Shifu Chen and John Shen Yuo, and Francois and Hirokazu and Jean-Michel studied axis symmetric traveling fronts in RN. So I think at least four of them, all of the authors are in the audience. And also, Lun Chang Wei, Delpin. Nunchangwei, the Pinochovology, studied axisymmetry traveling wave squeeze to non-planar fronts and such axis symmetric non, they study non-convex traveling fronts. And this is axisymmetric traveling fronts. This work is, I think, studied essentially the same axisymmetric travel. The same axisymmetric traveling fronts. This is a result for traveling fronts in balanced nonlinear regression. And this is stationary front. Stationary front is a traveling front with speed zero. In this case, such result. Such result is studied and studied by Jun Zhangwei and Chang Feng and many other researchers. This is the axis symmetric traveling funds for balanced reaction diffusion equations. And this is a I I write a level set of an axisymmetric travel front in R2, such shape. So this is plus here plus one and here minus one. And this goes to upwards with constant speed. C. C is any number. If this one for any positive number C, there exists such a similar. There exists such axisymmetry traveling font. And for, and let me explain about multimedia traveling front for imbalanced reaction diffusion equations. And in this case, I just write FKS is this one. K is a small hosting number. And this K gives a speed of one dimensional travel. Give us a speed of one-dimensional traveling front. As I said, k is a positive small number, and as k goes to zero, the speed goes to zero, and the profile and profile converges to a profile, that of stationary standing front. And I'll explain about pyramidal traveling front. Explain about pyramidal traveling font and pyramidal traveling font is firstly studied by Hirokaza and myself for two dimensions as two dimensional reform front and related work by Francois, Regis, and Robert Joff, Jean-Michel, and so many works. And for R3 or Rn. Klokawa is a student, former student of mine, and he got a PhD in this thesis. So, this is a pyramidal traveling front. And currently, I wrote a book in Memoirs of Mathematical Society of Japan, and I wrote existence and uniqueness and stability of traveling, pyramidal traveling front in. Pyramidal traveling front in REN as much as I possible in this year, last year. And this is a pyramidal level set of a pyramidal traveling font for imbalanced equation. So you can see here, no common points. This line. This line has no common points. So the aspect ratio is not one. I fix the expect ratio and make such use such pyramidal traveling fund for given expect ratio and takes a balance and takes and And take and prove the existence of asymmetric troubling font for balanced reaction diffusion equation. This is a stolatty. So as I said before, for imbalanced reaction diffusion equation, I studied pyramidal traveling front with the Which the ratio of major axis, so they have cross sections. They have the cross section is like an orbo that has a major axis and minor axis. And I preserve the ratio of the major axis and the minor axis to be constant, inconstant, any given constant, and take balanced limit and then obtain. And then obtain probable in front in balanced reaction diffusion equation whose cross-section is a compact set with a major axis and a minor axis. This is a balance one. As k goes to zero, this one disappears. F k converges to this one. And let alpha two, no alpha one, alpha one is one, alpha two to alpha n minus one and this one, this one is a ratio, aspect ratio. And S star is the largest zero point of G prime. Theta zero is any number, this one. Here I Here I wrote theta is an arbitrary given, but this differs in theorem one, theorem one. Here, this is correct. CRM2, no. Theta is some number. So let me proceed. And theorem one, actually asymmetric traveling front. For C is arbitrary given positive number and set. Positive number and theta is a given arbitrarily given in theorem. And there exists capital U. This is actually a symmetric traveling font such that one has this one and this is profile equation. This is this satisfy this one, this one. And for the cross section, this is my minor axis, major. Minor axis, major axis, the ratio can be chosen arbitrarily, not necessarily one. That says this is actually asymmetric. And this satisfies such market for the detailed argument, you can see this paper. Just a moment and theorem two: C is any number and R1, R2, Rn minus one be arbitrarily given, then there exists capital U with such one. And in this case, for some theta, you such. Some theta, you satisfy this one. So, and you satisfy this one. That says the cross aspect ratio of the cross section, aspect ratio of major axis and mine axis can be chosen arbitrarily. I think, Captain U. I think capital U in serum one and serum two is totally the same, but but the proof is a little bit different, not a little bit different. And I'll show picture just moment. Can you see my picture? Yes, yes. So I so this is a level set sorry, I'll just just moment. I'll return to the this one. This is a This is my axiom asymmetric travel font in CRM1 or CRM2. X1, XJ, and this is XN traveling to this direction, Xn direction with constant speed C. This is a level set of capital U at u equals zeta zero. That zero the plus one and minus one, and just a moment this same picture, and you can see this one is. See, this one is not axially symmetric. Just moment. Something wrong. Sorry for interruption. Once again. Once again, this one. So, you can see this is axial asymmetry. So, if you count this one like this, here, this is a minor axis. And from here, this is a major axis such front. I return to the slide. Can you see my slide? Thank you. And this is, I briefly explain the proof of CRM2. And I M2 and I consider imbalanced passive reaction diffusions equation for some small k. As k goes to zero, you can see here disappears and this gives the balanced reaction diffusion equation. And then for this imbalanced bicycle reaction diffusion equations, 3K be the pyramidal traveling front with this one and this one. This is a parameter traveling font. And take and then take the limit. And then to take that limit, limit means k goes to zero. Reaction difficult equations becomes balanced. And then I need a uniform estimate for Pyramid traveling front k it's a k goes to zero, but still, if even if k goes to zero, it has some uniform estimate. And this is take R like this. And then just moment and then I have this lemma one. I have this lemma one. And lemma one, as k goes to zero, this one goes to zero. This term goes to zero, but still g c term minus this one is positive. So this one, the right hand side is positive uniformly for k. This is essential. So this one, so this proposition one, the left-hand side. The left-hand side is a parameter VK is a parameter travel structure. This is a this depends on K. See the right-hand side, this one is independent of K and this one is independent of K. And this one is depends on K, but K goes to zero, this one disappears, but still this one minus this one is possible. So using this uniform estimate for k, I can take the balanced limit. This one. Then the cross-section of U at C equals theta zero is such shape. And this means this traveling front is actually astymatic. Axel estimated and has such the bad eye view of actually estimated traveling fund is like this. Okay, my time is almost up and so I will stop here and thank you for listening. Any questions or comments? comments very nice talk and uh thank you just one quick question are there any non uh x estimation solutions careful junch i can i can't hear your question clearly with some not i actually one more game Other solutions, other travel wave solutions which are not X-ray symmetric isometry, yeah, yeah, it's isometric, yeah. But this is still symmetric in in X, yeah, I seriously yeah, yeah, this is still symmetric. This is still symmetric. Other solutions without any symmetry? Okay. Other traffic work solutions without any symmetry? That's a very good question. So, yeah, yeah, yeah. Your question is, I think very good. So this in my this this solution has such similar with respect to With respect to XJ axis, so you mean unsymmetrical foreign font, no symmetry? No, I don't know. Very good question. Thank you very much. But my answer is, I don't know. I tell you, one problem you have a solution without any same shape, sign-changing solutions. For sign-changing solutions, For sign-changing solutions, sign-changing final energy solution in for the side for the client model, you have solutions without any symmetry. You have solutions without any symmetry. I don't know, maybe you know better. I think well, yeah, yeah, you have the construction, there's no signature. Yeah, yeah, actually, my question. Actually, my question is somehow related to Chinese question. So, in this case, you scale this level set at semi-height. Then it gets even bigger, right? You scale down properly. Do you know the curve? Curve and limit curve. Limit curve. So this is a level set of u equals theta zero. And your question, what is your question? So you know this, it's all like a mix, right? Well, can you say more about this curve image, image without the scale? Yeah, I'm sorry. I I cannot hear you clearly. So yeah, yeah, yeah. So would you please repeat your question again, once again? Okay, so you take the labor set. So it's almost like a parabolic level, but it's not blunt. Go the label higher and higher. And higher, the curve gets bigger and bigger, but you stay the tongue to the right size, and it has a limit. At least maybe some sequence you have a limit. You know the more information about this limit curve. So, for example, is it like an ellipse? Probably it's not, but can you get more information? It's not can you can move from which empowerment you're a chunk fan. Yeah, I'm chunk fan. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, for this you are asking me very very good question. For this one, the asymptotic shape is studied by but for this case In this case, the cross-section becomes like this, and the aspect ratio goes to infinity. If you cut in higher place, jump in the aspect ratio go to infinity. Such shape. What's the your spectacle? You say this next, what is what is that here? What you said the vast one, yeah. If you cut in higher place, zeta is a height of the cross section, and if zeta goes to infinity, So the yeah, yeah, uh, but does this curve you have you more information about this curve? Yeah, yeah, I said it's a very good question. I think it's many open questions for this driving font as the cottage shape of driving font. I don't know. So okay, very, very, very, very nice. Very good question. Very nice. Very good question. But the asymptotic shape of other. I think there exists a lot of questions, including your question. Thank you very much. But my answer is, I don't know. Another question? Can I start speaking again? Okay, so we also sign to our channels here. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. So, tomorrow, we be ready on the subject, right? So, let me check, right?
