Thank you, Anne-Marie. Thank you to the organizers, Anne-Marie, Luis, also Luis and Vanish, for inviting me to give this talk. And thank you for lining it up after Dan's very beautiful talk, just before it's going to allow me to go a little more quickly through some of the things at the beginning of the slide. So, in this talk, I'll talk about, I'll describe the status of what Described the status of what I refer to as Vogen's conjecture on arthur packets for p-iadic groups, which is a little ridiculous because Vogan wrote a paper back in 1993, yes, 93, in which he articulated, in which he used micro-local geometry to describe things that he called a packets or arthropackets, but never actually formally said, oh, these things should. Formally said, oh, these things should be the same as what you get from Arthur's construction, but nevertheless, it's very clearly a conjecture of Vogens. And that's what I refer to as Arthur's conjecture on Vogen packets. This is joint work with a large group of people, but the paper specifically is joint work with Mishti Ray, a graduate student of mine. Oh, I'd like her to be a postdoc of mine. Okay, so I'm just going to start by. Okay, so I'm just going to start by very quickly going over some properties of A packets. I will always be referring to p-adic groups in this talk. So, a packets are indexed by A parameters, and I use the language of A parameters versus arthur parameters. A parameters are conjugacy classes, j-hat conjugacy classes of arthur parameters. A packets are finite sets that appear in the well-known set pi of g of equivalence classes of irreducible admissible representations. Irreducible admissible representations. A packets don't cover all of this set. So, in particular, there are many non-Arthur type representations. It's not hard to produce examples of such things. And they don't form a partition. They overlap even on this set of Arthur type representations. Yes. Can you make a comment on whether these things are existing or conjectured? Are existing or conjectural? I mean, is they so? Oops, I have to go back. Yeah. These statements here? Yeah, like, yeah. Have they all been constructed or do they, is it a conjecture that they exist with certain properties or what is the exact status? Yeah. So you said the same thing for L packets. One person would say conjectural L packets. So I'm asking about. Yep. And I asked a question to Dan a moment ago. Like, you've okay, you've exhibited something. I'm going to talk about it in a moment. So I'm saying when A packets are known. So, I'm saying when a packets are known. So, I'm referring specifically to Arthur's work. Yeah. So, classical groups, classical groups, yes, classical groups, SO odd, SP, some slightly weaker statements for SO even. Yeah, yeah. Anytime I talk about an A packet, I will be specifically referring to groups for which the main result of Arthur in his book has been proved for that group. Yeah. For that group. Yeah. Of course, the principle that I'm invoking here is: okay, well, we would like to understand a packets more generally. And so here are some of the properties that we might expect to see for a packets in other contexts. Every a packet contains a distinguished L packet, and the way that you build the Langlands parameter for the L packet is given here. And the API The A packet consists of that L packet and other representations in general, and we refer to these as coronal representations. And representations in an A packet are labeled by a function. Again, this is like in the main result of an Arthur's book, a function that is characterized essentially by endoscopic character identities, both endoscopic down and twisted endoscopic from GLN. Okay, more. This labeling function defines coefficients from which Arthur shows that you can build a stable distribution. And further, that the endoscopic transfer of the stable distribution as it's repeated for an endoscopic group G prime produces a distribution that's produced explicitly by using the same link. By using the same labeling functions, but now you evaluate them not just at the element that we saw up above, but this other element S that appears in the definition of the endoscopic group. Okay, so these are all theorems from Arthur's book. More is true. I referred to a moment ago that not only does Arthur consider endoscopy, endoscopic subgroups of the groups that we were just referring to, but also twisted endoscopy. But also twisted endoscopy from a general linear group. So I want to give you an example. And this example is from G2. Well, we don't, G2 didn't appear in the list that I just gave you a moment ago. So so far, so good. These L packets correspond to representations of unipotent reduction, and we have good information about the Leinlands correspondence in that case. So in this picture, Case. So in this picture, the teal square is, I'm not sure what happened to the pointer. There we go. This is a tempered packet. And this representation down here, pi zero, is at the other extreme, if you like. So for this language, for the parameters that are exhibited here, phi zero, Parameters that are exhibited here, phi zero through phi three, the corresponding L packets are just labeled. And these are the A packets, which is to say actually the ABV packets. And the dotted line in this picture is the Ober involution. So if you think about the topic that Dan and I were just discussing, I mentioned that this is a tempered packet, and so you should be able to And so you should be able to produce an A packet, or but you know, I'm calculating ABV packets, but what you would expect reasonably, as Dan said, to be an A packet by switching by applying Obert duality to the tempered packet. And that is indeed the case. So you see that the teal circle consists of just the L packet, but the red circle consists of a little bit of the tempered packet plus two others. tempered packet plus two others and and and the the representation that shows up that that pi three epsilon is a is a depth zero supercuspital representation of of g2 and in fact the depth zero supercuspital representation of f4 that dan showed up that dan exhibited a moment ago uh has has exactly very structurally similar properties this is this is the s3 fundamental group uh and and you've constructed one for for s4 so um uh So these ABV packets should produce distributions that are stable. And so I put the word stable in parentheses there because we have not proved that these distributions are in fact stable. But these distributions are produced with coefficients that are built from something that plays the role of the labeling function that we saw in Arthur's work. And the coefficients are defined. Arthur's work. And the coefficients are defined purely geometrically. So these are expected stable distributions for G2. And I think Ahmed, in fact, is thinking very seriously about how to prove that these are, in fact, stable. Okay, so I've given you a whirlwind overview of A packets. Now I'd like to say a few things about ABV packets. I'm going to explain roughly how these things are defined. And again, And again, it's a bit of a misnomer because ABV packets suggest that they appear in the 1992 book by Adams, Barbash, and Vogan, but that book is for real groups. So I call them ABV packets, even though they're for Piatic groups, because the ideas are gleaned directly from that book. And in fact, the 1993 paper that I referred to a moment ago by Vogen makes some of that explicit. So, the first notion that I'll introduce is talking about an infinitesimal parameter, not an infinitesimal character in the sense that we saw in the talk just before. So, an infinitesimal parameter, it's really just a Langlands parameter that's trivial on the SL2 part. And I should point out that I, whoops, I keep doing that. I think I did I write the domain, yes, so the domain. Yes, so the domain of my A parameters will be the V group cross two copies of SL2, as we saw in this, in what Dan referred to as simplified story. And in fact, the classical Vay-Delean group will never appear in this talk. I'll always be talking about V cross SL2 or two copies of SL2 in the case of V parameters. And horrifyingly, I use the notation WF prime to refer to the V group process. refer to the vague group cross SL2 and double prime to refer to vague group cross two copies of SL2. Okay, so every Langlands parameter determines an infinitesimal parameter. I've given you the recipe right there, but the machinery that takes you from Langlands parameters to an infinitesimal parameter identifies you can have many different Langlands parameters with the same infinitesimal parameter. And the machinery that takes you from an Arthur parameter The machinery that takes you from an Arthur parameter to a Langlands parameter looks a little bit similar, but that's injective. That function does not identify different Arthur parameters. Okay, so if you fix one of these infinitesimal parameters and consider which Langlands parameters have that infinitesimal parameter, then the answer is given by this element in the Lie algebra, which turns out to be necessarily nilpotent. Be necessarily nilpotent. And so we build what Vogen built is a variety which consists exactly of those elements in the Lie algebra that satisfy the condition that appears, that labels, allows you to go from x plus lambda to a Langlands parameter. And again, here there's a subtlety, which is to say if I'd worked with the real, the proper, oops, I shouldn't say real, the proper Vay-De Ling group instead of this simplified version. De Ling group instead of this simplified version, then there's literally a bijection between these two. When you work with this simplified version of the Vei de Ling group, I guess is the language to use, then that's not true anymore, but somehow the fibers of that map can be characterized. Okay, so I'm calling this a variety of language parameters with the caveat that actually you should be using the classical Veda link group in order to make that. Classical Veda-link group, in order to make that connection tighter. But I've given you a recipe. Whoops. I've given you a recipe that tells you how to go from an element in this V lambda to the corresponding Langlitz parameter. Okay, so in this way, you produce a variety which has a reductive group acting on it. And the orbits on V for this action by H correspond exactly to conjugacy classes of Langlands parameters. Classes of Langlands parameters with a fixed infinitesimal parameter. But the spaces V that arise are not exotic in the sense that they are pre-homogeneous vector spaces. And so the geometry is lovely and in some sense classical. And in fact, here's an example of one of these varieties, V, together with its stratification into orbits by this group action that comes from a very simple example. A very simple example. It's an SO5 example that gives this variety V. Okay, so I'm now taking your attention from studying irreducible admissible representations in some sense to geometric constructions on that variety V, and specifically irreducible equivariant perverse sheaves on V. So this is the recipe that takes you from an irreducible. That takes you from an irreducible admissible on a p-iadic group to a perverse sheaf by construction irreducible equivariant perverse sheaf on that variety V. And of course, it passes through the enhanced Langlands correspondence, and therefore, anytime I talk about an ABV packet, I have to have access to that. And so, again, I can only speak meaningfully about ABV packets. Meaningfully, about AVB packets now in cases where we have a local Langlands correspondence. So there are lots of interesting questions here, like, does the ABV construction depend on the choice of a Whitaker model? In fact, we think that the packets don't, and I'm working on that problem right now. Okay, so far I've described how you go from an irreducible admissible to Go from an irreducible admissible to a simple perverse sheaf on this variety V. But the arthur parameters themselves show up very nicely in the geometry. I've already shown you how to match a point in this variety V, which I call a Vogan variety, okay? A point in this Vogan variety to a Langlands correspondence, sorry, to a Langlands parameter, and vice versa. So in particular, I could start with an Arthur parameter, right? In particular, I could start with an Arthur parameter, write down the Langlands parameter, and then identify that with a point in this Voken variety V. And that's denoted by X sub psi in this slide. Okay, well, there's a sort of eerily similar or parallel construction that produces an element Y that actually isn't in the Bogan variety, but in its dual. And the duality is, you see in the definition of V. Of V, um, the exponent what um helpment and energy for you. Thank you. Okay. So you see the condition. The condition right here invokes the norm of the W, an element in the V group, and in this dual construction, that is inverted. So this recipe that takes you from an arthur parameter psi to these two elements, one in this Vogon variety and the other in its dual, produces a pair that lie well naturally in the cotangent space. Actually, in the cotangent space, because the cotangent space is such a simple thing, it's just literally v cross its dual. But you can see I'm doing something here. I'm identifying v star with actually the dual of the vector space, even though it gave a different construction. So you have to use the killing form to do this. And yes, of course, killing forms are not always non-degenerate, but the killing form does pair V and V star non-degenerately because we're, remember, V is contained in the nilpotent part. Remember, V is contained in the nilpotent part, and the same is true for V star. Okay, but this pair that you get actually lies in the cotangent, in the conormal variety. So from an arthur parameter, you get an element in the conormal variety. And it's a very special element in the cotangent in the conormal variety, which is to say that it's regular, which is to say that it appears. Which is to say that it appears in one component and doesn't appear in the closures of any other components, and its orbit is open in its own component. So components of this variety, I just gave you some background here, components of this conormal variety are actually indexed naturally by conjugacy classes in the Boken variety V. But the components are the closures of these conormal bundles that I've written right here. Okay, so. So the recipe that I gave you for taking an irreducible admissible and producing a perverse sheaf used the fact that the component group attached to a Langlands parameter becomes an equivariant fundamental group for the orbit that it produces in its moduli space. And this result is eerily similar to that in the sense that from an Arthur parameter, we build an element in this conormal variety, and then its orbit. Variety, and then its orbit has the property that the equivariant fundamental group attached to it is exactly the component group attached to the Arthur parameter. And so that means it's possible for us to go back to, I'm not going back, let's go back to this labeling function. Remember that the labeling function, there we go, is a labeling. Is a labeling of irreps in an Arthur packet with characters of this group, which I've just told you is actually an equivariant fundamental group. And so that means I can take the value that you get from this function given to us by Arthur, non-constructively, I should add. And now, whatever this thing is, I can interpret it now as an equivariant local system on the On the orbit that's determined by the arthr parameter in the conormal variety. That's exactly what you're allowed to do with this observation right here. Okay, so in some sense, that's the key to saying, okay, I'm going to use geometry to build these labeling functions. And the recipe that we use to do this is a functor called EVS. Called EVS, which is defined in terms of vanishing cycles. And it's given by this recipe right here. And the functor is designed to have the property that it produces a priori perverse sheaves on the conormal variety, but we restrict them and shift them so that you actually get local systems out of these things. And the functor is defined so that the stocks of those local systems are the same. That the stocks of those local systems are exactly produced in this very simple way from the vanishing cycles functor. So, this is Q-Meck in the book by Adams Barbash and Vogen. Sorry, did you say what the function f sub c is? Yeah, I didn't. So the function f sub c is defined by looking at where this functor is being evaluated, which is to say on v. say on V, so F is on V crossed with C star. And so that's contained in the cotangent space. We just restrict to the killing form from those. Thank you. Great. Yeah, so F sub C is attained by restricting the killing form to the cotangent space, but to the part of the cotangent space that appears in the R. The part of the cotangent space that appears in the argument of the vanishing cycles functions there. And again, it's really defined so that you get this, these vanishing cycles. So in the book by Adams Barbash and Vogan, when they prove their main result for this functor, QMIC, that plays the role of this EVS, they make a comment. They say, okay, here's some properties of this functor. And here are some ways they have a discussion. Here's some ways you might prove it. You might consider micro-local analysis. You might consider the vanishing cycles functor. You might consider the vanishing cycles functor. You might consider stratified Morse theory. And in the end, it's the latter that they use to prove the result. But we found that if you, they said specifically, you should be able to use the vanishing cycles functor. And they point to an article by Berlinski and they say, however, it appears that there's something missing in order to bridge the gap. So what we did is we just used that idea as our definition for EVS, built a functor. For EVS, built a functor which necessarily had these stocks, and then just ran with it. So, when I say ABV packets for p-adic groups, I'm not referring to QMIC. I'm not referring to the classical micro-local analysis that appears in ABV. I'm referring to this version of it. But stock by stock, there's no mystery in how to compare these two things. Okay, so I can now define ABV. Uh, I can now define ABB packets for you. Uh, they're they're they're defined by looking essentially at the support of this of this functor. And remember that the support that the functor lies in an orbit in the conormal variety, and it's and it's an orbit. It's literally an orbit. So that means I could pick any point in that orbit, evaluate the stock of this EVS, and I will get zero if and only if this thing is zero. And that P should. zero and that that p should be a cal s sub lambda as it appears down below so again you can rephrase this and i'll do it when i get to general linear groups you can rephrase this condition just in terms of stocks of vanishing cycles of of the um of the sheaf uh p i'm not going to go through the the the normalization the the n part uh it's it's very interesting if you if you don't do this normalization you actually get a different labeling function than You actually get a different labeling function than appears in Arthur's work. And so, this term is designed exactly to make it viable for the labeling function that we get from geometry to match up with what Arthur produces. If you just use EVS on its own, it doesn't work. And partly, I won't be discussing it further because we won't need it for the general linear group. That normalizing part is trivial in the case of general linear groups. Of general linear groups. Okay, so this is a different recipe that will produce these labeling functions. And the superscript here is meant to sort of emphasize the fact that it's a different recipe. But one of the things you'll notice is that it's defined for all languages parameters, not just those coming from Arthur parameters. So what this is saying is that ABV packets, they actually do cover all irreducible admissible representations. They aren't a partition. do they aren't a partition um but they uh you can start with any uh irrep and write down if you have i already said i'm going to assume you have the language the the language correspondence write down its language parameter and then make this construction and you will get an abb packet attached to the representation you began with and it'll contain the l packet so certainly it covers everything uh further uh this construction allows you to This construction allows you to define a distribution, which again is designed so that these coefficients that appear right in this expression right here matches the labeling function that you see in Arthur's main result. So the conject, I'll just go straight to it. So the conjecture is that if you start with an arthur parameter and build an ABV packet from the corresponding Langlands parameter, Corresponding Langlands parameter, you get an A packet. And again, this is a conjecture that says we're going to have to know the Langlands correspondence, and then we're going to hope that we get these A packets in cases where we know A packets. And further, that this distribution that you build from the same, remember, there's a very close relationship between these two parts, that this distribution should be stable. That this distribution should be stable. And so, this is the calculation actually that produces the coefficients that I showed you in the G2 example: the plus and minus and the two and the minus two. They all come out of calculating the terms that you see right here. And this really is eminently calculatable. Did you switch from vanishing cycles to nearby cycles, or is that a I noticed it when you were asking? That is a typo. Yeah, thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so what's the status of this? Well, just before I get there, I just want to point out that, remember, again, modeled on properties of A packets that we know from Arthur's result, we expect that that distribution, if it really matches an APA, if the labeling functions that I've introduced really do match the labeling functions that appear in Arthur's work, then this should also be a stable distribution in the bottom. A stable distribution in the bottom line, right here. And these distributions that you produce should be compatible with endoscopy in exactly the same way that we see in Arthur's main result. Okay, so what's the status of this? Well, lots of examples. So in that first list of examples, we just literally said, okay, for each of these groups, we're going to write down. Said, okay, for each of these groups, we're going to write down some interesting infinitesimal parameters and then calculate independently the a packets together with their labeling functions and the corresponding coefficients that come from the geometric construction. The SO, you can see the like the first two are meant to sort of show you some interesting things that happen in the Things that happen in the geometry. So, for example, that SL2 example is the infinitesimal parameter that we choose is the one that gives you the unique four packet for SL2. And it turns out that the associated Vogon variety is a single point, but that group H that acts on it is discrete. So, the equivariance of this group acting on a point produces the four representations that appear in the packet. appear in the packet. But you can see really where we're going, right? So I want to think about SO even, sorry, SO odd next. I'll say a word about that at the end. For tempered packets, and now when I say again in complete generality, I'm saying that what we've confirmed is that ABV packets, if you start with a tempered Langlands parameter, the ABV packet will be exactly the L packet. Be exactly the L packet. And what I want to talk about today is the GLN case. So let's make the transition to the GLN case. So the strategy of the proof that Mishji and I have used to do this is to say, essentially, is to use the compatibility with endoscopy version, but just. Compatibility with endoscopy version, but just in the special case of Levy subgroups. So what we do is we say, okay, start with an arbitrary Arthur parameter, psi. And again, there's that horrifying double dash notation, or prime, I guess it is. And as a representation of this group, decompose it into irreducible representations, and then use that decomposition to build a Levy subgroup of the general linear group. Of the general linear group. And now, by construction, each of these psi i's are irreducible. Okay, so um, and and then uh, I'm gonna just pick the data that allows me to say that that m is indeed an endoscopic group. So, I'm not considering all endoscopic groups. I'm saying start with an arthur parameter, define a Levy subgroup, and then view it as an endoscopic group. And in that way, produce a new arthr parameter for that endoscopic group. And that psi m is on each, it's built up on each factor that appears in the decomposition of the levy into GLNs, it's built from the corresponding psi i. Okay, so now I've got, I've started with an Arthur parameter for GLN. An Arthur parameter for GLN. I've produced in this way an Arthur parameter for m, which is a bunch of copies of GLN. So I can write down the infinitesimal parameter for that, and that's the lambda sub m. And now you can show that the Vogan variety for that infinitesimal parameter is contained in the Vogan variety for the original infinitesimal parameter that came from the original Arthur parameter. And in fact, it's the part. In fact, it's the part that's fixed by this element S that picks out the endoscopic group. There's an action of S on the Lie algebra, and it fixes exactly the sub-vogon. So like this sub-vogan is the fixed points of an automorphism, an outer automorphism. Okay, so so far, what I've done is I've, what I've done is I've said, okay, if you What I've done is, I've said, okay, if you start with an arthur parameter, you can produce a levy subgroup and an arthur parameter for that levy that's irreducible. And geometrically, you get this Vogon and a sub-Vogan. And now I'm going to use that in just a moment. So put it aside. And let's talk about, let's do a little bit of background work, which is to say we're going to repeat exactly what Adams, Barbish, and Vogen did for real groups and what Vogen also adapted to piatic groups. Adapted to piadic groups, and write down two Grothendieck groups. So, on the one hand, they're all determined by the infinitesimal parameter lambda. And I should mention here that if we were working with more complicated groups than general linear groups, we would have to fix something in the Bernstein center that maps to this infinitesimal parameter. And there could be more than one, and we'd have to choose one piece by piece. I'm kind of interested in talking to you about that. Talking to you about that. Okay, so for Geas Gyllen in this story, so we just simply write down the growth indeed group of, in some sense, the way Adams, Barbesh and Fogen talk about it, is they say write down the packet of equivalence classes, not a packet, write down the set of equivalence classes of irreps that have this infinitesimal parameter. Gather that together. That's going to contain all sorts of representations. It's much bigger than an L packet. It's much bigger than an L packet. It's much bigger than an A packet too. And look at the growth indicator attached to that. But really, I'm going to work with a growth indicator attached to this category and this category. And we're just going to define a pairing between these growth indicat groups using the Langman's correspondence. So remember, this is something that I explained at how you take an irrat pi and produce a simple perverse sheaf. So I'm saying if you take something, if you take an element, like this, this is a very important thing. Like this, this is telling you the only things that are paired with an ERAP is the corresponding simple perverse sheaf. But elements in this group link group are, of course, linear combinations of such things. But that's okay. I've told you how to define the pairing on a basis for each of these two groups. Okay, so this is the strategy for the proof. So, first, what I'm going to do is sort of recast the conjecture for GLN using that pairing. And I'm going to say that what I want to prove is that this virtual representation matches the virtual representation that Arthur produces. Okay? And so that's the goal. And the way to get at this equality is to pass through this other machinery. So the So the machinery takes you down to the constructions on M and then invokes. So the two sides that take you down are actually quite general principles. But I'm going to say, I'm going to reduce to the case of irreducible arthur parameters. So I'm going to say, suppose I know that this is true for irreducible arthur parameters. For irreducible artha parameters, then by the two theorems on either side that I'll describe in just a moment, that tells you that the conjecture is true for a GLN. So I'm going to describe the theorems on either side of this square. And for the moment, I'm just going to say, well, actually, we already proved this. So I'm describing a strategy that we actually ran backwards, which is to say, first we proved the conjecture for irreducible representations of. Irreducible representations of sorry for irreducible arthur parameters and now I'm telling you how to get them for arbitrary parameters through this passage to a Levy subgroup trick okay so here I'm just saying that that in a in a paper on the archive Mishti and I Mishti Ray ours for for Ray proved these statements where when M is a general linear group and saw Group and psi is an irreducible arthrit parameter for a general related group. So there's a little bit of work that you have to do here to go from GLN to a product of GLNs, but fortunately it's minor. It's easy work. Okay, so that means from this paper, you get this equality. And now let me tell you how you build the result from those two results. Okay, so the argument again, in some sense, in a very real sense, In a very real sense, mimics ideas that go back to the 1992 book by Anav Barbasch and Vogen for real groups. So the first is to say that restricting the object in this growth indicator group. And at times I'm going to say, well, you know what? The growth indicator group of equivariant reshives is the same as the growth indicator group of the equivariant derived category. So I'm going to view F as. Category. So I'm going to view F as just an object in that equivariant derived category. And that's what I'm doing right here, because I'm taking a sheaf, taking an object in that category, which is on V, and I'm restricting it to this sub-Vogan that's built from the Levy subgroup. And the result tells you that if you pair that with these virtual representations coming from the general machinery, the results are compatible. Machinery, the results are compatible. And the first step in getting there is to actually go back and look at the definition of ADA and simply see that the growth and D group allows you, growth and group pairing, I should say, allows you to rewrite the information of ADA purely in terms of these stocks of the vanishing cycles functor. So here, I'm just using the definition of ADA together with that proposition that tells you that you. Proposition that tells you that you can describe that EVS functor in terms of stocks. That's all. So, this is just a consequence of the definitions. And then the next step is to say that the vanishing cycles functor behaves well with respect to this sort of restriction. And I don't at all like the argument that we use to prove this, because what we do is we pass from the stocks of the vanishing scales functor. The stocks of the vanishing skeptical functor back to the stocks, back to the Morse groups that we see from stratified Morse theory, and then use a fixed point formula there and then translate the result back. I think it should be possible to prove this directly. And there's a remark in a book by Sherman that says, Adams, Barbish, and Vogan said there should be, they even said in their book, there should be an easier way of making this. Should be an easier way of making this, proving this fixed point formula. And Sherman said, Here, I'm going to give you another way of doing it. I don't follow that argument. So I'm sticking with Adams, Barbash, and Vogan in the comparison that's given by Berlinski. But I would love to talk to anyone who has any thoughts on how one might be able to prove this directly. I'm just looking at the ranks of these things, right? Just the ranks. It's just counting dimensions and signs on either side. Signs on either side. But this result is absolutely not true if you don't have this really interesting miracle, which is to say that the A packet for the levy picks out a point in the conormal bundle, and the A packet for G picks out another point in the conormal bundle. And they're designed so that they match under this map that came from the dual side of the endoscopy with this var epsilon. Of this var epsilon. And they're both strongly regular in the sense that they're regular in the conomal bundle and they have open orbits in their components. That's not true in general. You can easily write down something that's regular here and then look at its image up above and it's not regular anymore. So if that fails, then this result fails too. We can write down examples that just tell you that, nope, this comparison is garbage in those cases. So it's really using some very special properties of the points in the conormal bundle that. Points in the conormal bundle that you get from Arthur parameters. Okay, so now the next ingredient is to think about restriction. So here you can see what I'm doing. I'm saying we have this, you know, remember epsilon was a map from the Vogon for M up to the Vogon for G. So that means I can take a sheaf on F and restrict it to V. I did that in the previous slide, and I'm just re-writing. In the previous slide, and I'm just rewriting that restriction as a pullback. And the reason for writing it this way is to say that this, because I have this perfect pairing, it defines a linear transformation in the opposite direction on the vector space obtained from the Grothendieck group so that this pairing is true. So ABV refer to this function as Legend's functoriality, and it's And it's built directly. Its definition is just, it's the spectral incarnation of geometric restriction. That's its definition. So, and there's no way to make it more concrete. No, it's it's um it's not induction, um uh but but it's But but it's it's language shells of transfer in the special case that we're that we're working with. But like he okay, okay, so that's a great question. So if I if I take an object in the remember that in some sense, what I really care about is perverse sheaves. So if I take a perverse sheaf on V and restrict it to the subvogan, it's not perverse. In the Growth Indeed group, I can write it as I can anything as a direct sum of shifted perverse sheaves, but it does not Of shifted perverse sheaves, but that didn't tell me. I mean, I went to the past to the Growthen group to make that statement. That's very poor information. This epsilon star in particular is not a functor from perverse sheaves on the Vogan for G to perverse sheaves on the Vaughan for M. And I feel like that's related to the fact that this transfer that you see on the other side is also, like, you can only see it after passing to the, in some sense, to the Growth Indy group of the derived group, if you like. If you like, um, but but there are all sorts of other things you could do here. So, for example, there are other functors that do take perverse sheaves on V to the perverse sheaves on the on Vogon that are essentially related to Lustig's construction of induction and restriction that you see in character sheaves. And you would know in that case that at the very worst, you produce a semi-simple complex from a perverse sheaf. And so you could write down, you could replace this functor with one of those and then hope to see something that's better behaved or run it back. Something that's better behaved, or run it backwards. Say, look, I know I've got a great functor here that comes from induction, for example. Why don't I see what that corresponds to? Sorry, this. Yeah, that's right. So this is a little confusing because pi is on M. So you could say, what does induction do here? What would that correspond to on the other side? Run this idea backwards. See what is the geometric meaning of induction. Okay, so the left-hand side. So, the left-hand side of that square, I'm just going to go back to the square. This is the basic idea. I've explained how this side works, and this side is exactly a comparison between this language functoriality in the sense of the term used by Adams Barbersh and Fogen and Langland-Shell-Ste-transfer. So, the first thing that you do is you say, well, from its definition, okay, and that should, there should be a delta right there. So, from its definition, Delta right there. So, from its definition, you can show that this Langlands functoriality takes a standard representation to a standard representation. Well, it takes an element in the growth indicator by a standard representation to an element in the growth ending group defined by a standard representation. That's not hard to do. And a comparison, but that's also true for Langland-Shelstead transfer. Transfer. It's a very, very special, simple case of language Schelstein. And the fact that these two things agree on the basis coming from standard representations allows you to say that they just agree. So that's what you use to say that actually this thing, which is defined, it's just the spectral incarnation of restriction. It actually does take an irrep to an irrep in the growth indicator. And you can compare this with induction, for example. You can write down an example of. For example, you can write down an example of something and induce it, and it's not irreducible anymore. And therefore, it's not in the growth indicator group equal to something that is irreducible. But this argument does use the Kaisten-Listic hypothesis, which again, Dan mentioned sort of in passing in his talk, for general linear groups only, the p-iadic analog of the Kaiserdan-Luc hypothesis. So that goes, as Dan remarked, that goes back to Zelovinsky's paper. goes back to um zelovinsky's paper um okay and and again there's the same the same typo uh this this is a statement that standard goes to standard this is a statement that irrep goes to irrep okay okay so so if you go back to this to this square uh i've i've filled in these two sides and now i'm saying well if we knew the conjecture Saying, well, if we knew the conjecture for irreducible arthriters, we'd be done. But we don't know that. So now let's go and review that. So is it obvious that diagram commutes? In other words, you're saying the diagram commutes and defining the error, or are you defining the errors first and then showing them to error? Well, they're honest to God equalities on all sides here, right? So the value. So the value that you get from the pairing here is equal to the value that you get from the pairing and likewise over here. And at the end, I'm going to say that this eta matches that eta. Why? Because this is true for all F and that pairing is perfect. And so it allows me to see that these two etas agree. And that's the strategy is to show that ABV packets are indeed A packets, show that the Ada attached to them are exactly the Ada that you get from Arthur. Eda that you get from Arthur. So now, how do we know that this conjecture is true for irreducible Arthur parameters? Well, so I've done a reduction to irreducibles, irreducible arthur parameters. Now I'm going to do another reduction, which we call unramification, which says that if you start with an arbitrary irreducible arthur parameter, that's something that you can write in this form, then you can produce a new. A new artha parameter for a new group with the property that the ABV packets agree once you've made these canonical identifications. So what this is doing is it's saying that the moduli space of Langlands parameters on G is canonically isomorphic to the moduli space of Langlein's parameters for a different infinitesimal parameter and for a different group. But there's an isomorphism. A different group, but there's an isomorphism between these two varieties that's canonical, and likewise for the groups. And that means that the category that I built of H equivariant perverse sheaves on V is exactly the category of, is equivalent to the category, isomorphic actually, to the category of H lambda non-ramified attached to V lambda non-ramified. So you go from perhaps ramified representations. Perhaps ramified representations for a GLN to unramified representations for a different group, which is produced explicitly right here. And what I've done is I've sketched that it follows from that that the ABV packet that we produced here is the same as the ABV packet that you get after the unramification step. So, if I know the conjecture on Arthur, Vogan's conjecture on Arthur packets for representations that are simple and have a trivial row, then I'm done. So I've gone from arbitrary arthritis parameter psi to the irreducible case. And then now I'm going from, well, how do we know if we know this for a trivial row, we finish the argument. Get, we finish the argument. So then these simple arthr parameters are literally arthur parameters that take the form with trivial rho. So they're just products of these. And yeah, A is for Arthur and D is for Delene. This is the L and A that we saw in Dan's talk just a moment ago, that it's labeling the two copies of SL2 compatibly. Okay, so interestingly, the crux of the argument is this geometric statement that says that if you have an arthur parameter that's of this form, a simple arthr parameter, and you build the orbit in the moduli space from it, and now you take any other orbit in the moduli space. This inequality says that this appears in the closure of that. Okay, it's the zero. That okay, it's the Zariski closure relation. If you know this is true, and if you also know, well, okay, ignore the hats, uh, those should be the stars, uh, so the these are the dual orbits in the dual moduli space. So, if you know this containment and if passage to the to the dual Vaughan preserves the inequality, then actually they're the same orbit. And the argument that we use to prove this. To prove this is combinatorial in the sense that, like, orbits in these Vogan varieties correspond to equivalence classes of Langlands parameters. Well, those are multi-segments. So, the argument that we actually use is to revisit what it means to say that two orbits are related in this way in terms of the multi-segments and again, give it, and likewise for the dual. So, the machinery that takes you from here to there is the Zelovinsky involution. And so it's the combinatorics of multi-segments that we use to prove this. Where you use the fact that it's simple? I will post it into journal. Okay, so it turns out this is true for all Arthur parameters, not just simple ones. Yeah. We didn't know that at the time. This is the crux geometric statement. Crux geometric statement, and it exactly allows you to show. So, the proof of this result uses that geometric lemma together with some basic properties of this EVS functor, specifically under this duality that takes you from V to V star. Those are the only ingredients that you need in order to do this. I should mention that we owe a debt of gratitude to Andrew Fiore, who gave us this lemma, I would say. This lemma, I would say. So that completes the proof. That completes the proof that says that, oops, keep doing that. That says that I started with an arthur parameter. I said the conjecture is true. If I can reduce the argument. Okay, I'm going to run the argument backwards. I'm going to say, start with an arthur parameter that's simple. Prove the conjecture. That's what we did first. Conjecture. That's what we did first. This is what we actually did in practice. We proved there, proved that case. And then we use this unramification process to say that if rho is non-trivial, don't freak out. We can still adapt the argument. And then now we've got it for simple arthritis parameters, and then we use this square to get you from arbitrary arthritis parameters down to the simple case. Okay, so I want to conclude with just a couple of comments. Uh, just a couple of comments. Um I think CMO just got muted. We can't hear Clifton. Can you hear her now? Yes, thank you very much. Okay, great. When did I cut out? When did I cut out? When you said, and now for the big surprise. No, okay. All right, so I'll start. Restart the talk. Okay, so as you anticipated, I think this lemma is true for all arthor parameters, not just, so for all unramified arthriters. And the point is that that multi-segment argument that I gave you can be adapted to the case when there's a supracuspital part in the multi-segment. We didn't know that at the time. In the multi-segment, we didn't know that at the time. Andrew Fiore, who I mentioned a moment ago in the context of this lemma, had a master's student who proved this actually. So he extended this result in the version to the form that you imagined, Tom. And then, if you have that result, all you need is the unramification process to give an alternate proof for Frogen's conjecture for general linear groups. So that's like, you just do some mind-bogglingly lovely. Some like mind-bogglingly lovely combinatorics with multi-segments to get this statement with the word simple removed and also this unramification idea. And that gives you a completely alternate way. That avoids all of this restriction business. So why do it? So this square somehow now seems a little gratuitous. Somehow now seems a little gratuitous. But the reason is because I think that this is really key if you're sort of going to think about groups that are more complicated for general linear groups. So remember, Arthur's main result establishes that A packets are characterized, not uniquely, but after you make explicit choices, are characterized by how the distributions attached to A packets transfer under endoscopy and twisted endoscopy. twisted endoscopy. And this is the game that's telling you how to interpret endoscopy geometrically. The transfer that is interpreted in terms of this restriction on the Vogon. And again, this is an idea that goes back to Adams Barbashen Vogue. Now, this argument right here, this argument, I think, can also be, I think. Argument, I think, can also be: I think you can actually avoid this trick of saying, look, restriction on simple perverse sheaves is hard to calculate, even in the growth and degroup. So I'm going to avoid that problem by saying I know how to calculate restriction on local systems. That's easy. And they give me a basis for the growth indicator. So I'm going to do restriction, and then I'm going to go to the other side of the pairing between growth indicators. Side of the pairing between growth into groups, and I'm going to compare it, uh, its spectral incarnation, is what Langland-Shelstad does to stable representations, which are paired with these. It's exactly the casualtic hypothesis that tells you that you can rewrite the pairing between the growth indicator groups in terms of standard representations and what we might call standard sheaves, not sheaf complexes, just constructible sheaves. I think it might be. I think it might be possible to do to get the same information that you get from this argument directly on the geometric side. And I have a graduate student who's working in that direction. Another comment that I want to make is that ABV packets for general linear groups are not always singletons. Certainly A packets are, they're just the L packets, but they're not in. They're not for general linear groups. So, we wrote down, we used the Cachewar-Cyto singularity actually to produce a specific infinitesimal parameter that's manufactured so that the component on the conomal variety that holds this geometric calculation is actually quite interesting. It doesn't have an open orbit in particular. It doesn't have an open orbit by the action of H. And that's responsible for this. For this appearance of two representations in an ABV packet. But weirdly, that the representation, the coronal representation, so here's an L packet attached to a Langlands parameter, and the associated ABV packet has a coronal representation, and that coronal representation turns out to be of Arthur type. So you know that that on its own, by the result that I just gave you, that on its own is an ABV packet. So you get an ABV packet contained in an ABV packet, but not for the same. ABV packet, but not for the same Langlands parameter. This is, this is, that should say phi sub psi. So an ABV packet attached to a Langlands parameter, an ABV packet attached to another Langlands parameter. That's not mysterious. In G2, I showed you examples of relationships like that between ABB packets. But it's somehow not something we expected to see in general linear groups. That's it. That's it. And I really, really want to sell my students. I know that's the wrong way to put this. I want to promote them. They all played a role in this argument in one form or another. Thank you. So I I have a question. You at some point you mentioned using induction of power shifts. Is it directly related to the definition of UX Paciran? Well, it's not the same, but there's reason to believe that it's related. So think about what you see on the spectral side. If you just look at restriction, it's a poorly behaved functor as far as perverse shaves are concerned. It's spectral incarnate. Are concerned. Its spectral incarnation is this operation epsilon push forward, which corresponds to Langland-Shelstead. Is that induction? No, but it's like related to induction in the sense that like this is just inclusion. Say again? When you define epsilon, yeah, that's right. Epsilon is just the inclusion of the vogue for m to the vogue for g. And I just literally take objects up above and restrict them down below. It's like. And restrict them down below. It's like the easiest, but also the worst guess you could possibly make in the sense that, like, that's not well-behaved on preferred sheaves. And somehow that's what matters. But what matches it on the other side, that it's transpose in some sense, this spectral incarnation on the other side, turns out to be like a fundamentally important function, but it doesn't come from any, I have no candidate functor to write down. No candidate functor to write down that produces that function on the growth indices. And in fact, I don't, I have no reason to think that there is such a thing. Yeah. But this goes back to Tom's comment. Like, you could play this game and look at different functors on the geometric side that are more well-behaved. And so my comment is saying, well, actually, between the vogon for g and the vogon for m, I can write down a vogon for parabolic. Yes, exactly. For parabolic. Yes, exactly. And then I can use the pull back and proper push forward. That's a much better behaved functor. What's its spectral incarnation? No idea. Could it be parabolic induction? Seems a good guess. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. No more questions. Thanks. Okay. Thank you.
