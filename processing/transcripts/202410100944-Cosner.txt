Types of models assume that individuals all move in the same way, and there's only one type of movement rule to consider. Movement rules could be simple or complicated, but there's one rule for everybody. Technology has increased our ability to see what organisms actually do, and it does. Do and it doesn't seem to be following a single pattern all the time. There appears to be simple movement, diffusion, maybe finding a home range and sticking to it. But the more complex kinds of movements that would be required to develop an ideal free distribution are not available as a single simple movement mode. So, to get closer to So, to get closer to ideal, what organisms may actually do is combine simple movement modes, but switch between them. And so a typical example of that would be something like intermittent search. And so you might get a population where individual tracks do something like this. These guys go around. Like this. These guys go around, they search a little bit, they go around, they search a little bit, and if they find a place where there's food, they hang around there a long time. And maybe when it's gone, they go somewhere else. But that's an example of something you could try to pick up with anomalous diffusions, but the statistics don't support that too well. But another way you could do it is... But another way you could do it is by having individuals switch between home range behavior or area restricted search and large scale movement for searching. And so this is something we tried to explore in terms of how you'd model that and what the consequences would be. So one thing that started this for me was work with Bill Fagan. Me was work with Bill Fagan and where scientists took little creatures out of the forest, South America, and moved them different distances. And if they could sense the forest, they would go right back to it. If they couldn't sense the forest, they would wander around like crazy until they did sense forest, and then they'd go right back to it. So this was observed. Observed, and we tried to work up some models that would capture that. So the type of model that we used was for random search, large diffusion. So that when you're searching, you do this. When you can smell the forest, you do that. And there's a switching. There's a switching model that we attach to this. So those are the two modes. And let me comment briefly: this H here is something that Bill talked about, where you have your actual data. Uh data, spatial data, has convolved with some uh uh or other mutation. I guess I should call this yeah, I should call it age to match up things. So the idea is. Things. So the idea is that you have some sensory radius and you have your actual status at a given point, but that information is only viewed within a certain radius of where you are, and your perception may be limited. So that's what H represents here. H represents here, it's perceived environment as opposed to actual environment. This speaks a little bit to Frischoff's question: what if you can't see everything? That these terms switch between those two types of movement. So if you're in places where you've got a strong gradient, you can detect a strong gradient, or you can detect Or you can detect a high level of resource, then you switch to directive. You stay there, you move into home range type behavior. And if you have either no gradient and/or low resource, you go to random switching. Remember, excuse me, you switch to random movement. To random movement. And that gives us model type. And that was the model that we worked with. And we didn't do much. Where is it? A little typo and the diffusion term. What's that? The diffusion term. It's a little typo of the other one. Oh, yeah, yeah. This one should be a u. In fact, there's an extra thing. This should have u should be there. I should have. You should be there. I should have eliminated my apologies. So there's additional things, work that's been done by our group in that general direction. I put in detailed references in case people want to get slides later and look things up. But I want to comment here that there are other models where switching has shown up in very different biological In very different biological settings. So we've got intracellular, we've got a cellular level, basically a cancer model, and we've also got something from an applied modeling paper where Rebecca and friends were trying to figure out how bees would move. So bee movement. Bee movement was relevant to what they were doing, and they had switching in their bee movement. The bees would go to the resource, they knew where it was, and they would move around slowly there, and then they'd bring back the results to the hive. So my point, this slide is just that there are a lot of other places where this kind of switching behavior in movement seems to come up. It's not just a search for resources. Search for resources. Okay, so a different thing, as mathematicians, Steve and I wanted to think about this in a more general situation, or a different situation, that the models I described before have no population dynamics. These models do. So we thought, what does switching do if you put that into something like a logistic equation? So this is supposed to be a logistic type. So, this is supposed to be a logistic type equation for a single population that can switch in its movement patterns. Each of the operators in here would be some standard kind of dispersal operator, possibly just diffusion. That's what we worked on mostly. And there's, on the mathematical side, then quite a bit of related work. This famous paper, people don't look at that case. People don't look at that case too much. They had some things where they treated where you had what amounts to mutation or switching. They also had described the cases where populations remained genetically true or however you want to think about it, but no change in pattern. Traveling waves have been looked at in these kinds of systems in great detail by Jared. Jardin Briette studied Booker's. Don't be studied for them. And Steve and John, you and I have a paper where they talk about a bunch of other preferences and applications. I want to now give you, I want to switch to a different kind of switching model. This one has the same general form that you see. I'm not sure why that comes crawling around, but there it is. That's yes, it's giving the simulation side of the talk. Well, this is biology, right? Dispersal. So these are the same general kinds of forms of terms that we had in the models that we. In the models that we were looking at for population dynamics, but the rules of things are reversed. So, this is a little bit more like Yuan's situation that he described the other day. The spatial part is discrete. It's a two-patch model. However, they're looking at genetics. They're looking at quantitative genetics sort of things. And for editors, we did put these guys at least. These guys, at least, I mentioned their journal. These terms are diffusion in trait space. So mathematically speaking, these systems are similar, but biologically speaking, they're quite different. And I would make a pitch that this type of mathematical structure is interesting. This might be something worth looking at because it does appear in these different situations. In these different situations. And you have, again, switching between two things, but in this case, the switching here is between two locations, and the diffusion is in the phenotype. Again, it's because it's quantitative genetics. Okay, so I'm going to quickly skip through a bunch of mathematical stuff, but I'll come to a brief stop. To a brief stop here. The model has, as we studied, had two different diffusion rates. I guess I should go back one. We looked at that situation with something like this, just to check out how the diffusion switching would compare with planned diffusion. And what we got was, in this setting, that the solar The slower diffusion diffuser wins. So if D3 is small, that's the single diffusion, then that guy wins. If the small diffusion is bigger than the faster of the two switched diffusions, the switchers win. And if it's in between, the slower diffuser basically wins. Diffuser basically wins. So the model we have still gives selection for slower diffusion. So that's part one. Part two, similar ideas, different context. We want to look at the reduction principle again. Principle again, where slower diffusion is helpful. So you get the logistic model, linearized model, decreasing the diffusion rate, increases the growth rate. Principal eigenvalue is decreasing in diffusion. So that's the reduction principle again, Steve talked about. So we looked at an old model due to Brown and John. Old model due to Brown and Zhang for a space-structured population. So, walking through this, you are juveniles, V are adults, you have adults putting population into the juvenile density. Some of those juveniles are now maturing to be adults, and we've got mortality and And a logistic type of self-regulation. So reproduction by adults, survival and maturation by juveniles, mortality, and density-dependent mortality. So this mathematically is interesting because you've got a cooperative system at low densities, competitive system at high densities. That's the zero equilibrium, and any other The zero equilibrium, and any other equilibrium, because of the nature of the coupling, has to be positive. Okay, so what do we get with this? Oh, what we want to do is look at fast and slow diffusion limits and see what that told us about dependence on diffusion rate. So skipping some math. Math, let me just tell you: the linearized problem at zero determines persistence or extinction. Normal way, this is what it is. There's technical results that say that that's what happens. If the eigenvalue is positive, you get growth. If it's negative, you get decay. So standard thing. Nothing very interesting. Nothing very interesting yet. But now let's look at small diffusion. The diffusion rate is small. The linearization breaks, loses, goes towards zero. This is what you get with the zero diffusion. This is just the interaction part. And the principal eigenvalue you get then is this expression calculated. This expression, you can calculate it, it's easy. It turns out that it's positive under this condition. So you get a point-wise condition that has to be satisfied to get this thing positive in the eigenvalue. So this isn't just what you have at each point. And by work by Adrienne and Ron Millow, okay, we have. Okay, we have the eigenvalue goes to the maximum eigenvalue there, lambda. So persistence depends on the maximum of this quantity. Okay, now going on to large diffusion, we had to use probably reinvent a folk theorem that says if you've got a A Folk theorem that says if you've got a coupled system like this, fusion here and coupling there, and you've got an irreducible matrix that's non-negative, et cetera, you look at the principal eigenvalue, then, so we wanted to look at the principal eigenvalue for this. If we think of the Aij bar as being the average. The average of the Aij is here, which can be varying in space, then the principal eigenvalue tends toward the principal eigenvalue of the matrix of averages. So you're just averaging what these guys are across space. And if the diffusion rates go to zero, The diffusion rates go to zero, then the eigenvalue for the PDEs approaches the one for the matrix with average terms. So mathematicians out there, you can get this by a compactness argument. So now we get an interesting situation because we have two different cases of conditions for persistence. For persistence. For large diffusion, persistence condition is this with spatial averages of coefficients. For small diffusion, the persistence condition is this one with local values, maximum local values of these. Details of what these things do depend on the environment. And so a thing that we found interesting. A thing that we found interesting is that if you have a situation where the habitats where adults can produce juveniles and habitats where juveniles can survive are not the same. So, in other words, you have, say, in space, adult reproduction. Pre-production, production. And then you have over here a juvenile survival. So this is R, this is S. Okay, in this situation, R times S equals zero. S equals zero. This is not good if you have small diffusion. If that term is zero, your population is out of business. On the other hand, the average values of R and S Okay, so we've got R bar and S bar, those guys could be pretty big. So that's the case where the prediction of the model is: if the diffusion rate is small, you get extinction. The diffusion rate is large. The diffusion rate is large, you get persistence. Okay, no more reduction principle. You get selection for faster dispersal if you happen to have this situation. Now, this is pure theory. We haven't tried to figure out organisms which fit this pattern. But it's also the case that things could go the other way. So you would also have a situation where Where the averages of R and S are very small. So you have R and S. We have a large region. So here we've got R bar, S bar, small, but we have But we have max of R s is large. So if there's a small region of your habitat where survival and reproduction are good, you want to stay there. You don't want to go anywhere else. And so that case goes back to the classic situation where you want to have a soil diffusion rate. So in this setup, you can have either. Setup: You can have either prediction of faster diffusion winds or slower diffusion winds, and it depends on the geographic distribution of habitat types that are suitable for reproduction and for juvenile survival. That's really most of the story. So, this is just repeating that. In this kind of structured population model, Structured population model, it may select for or against floor diffusion. Either one may be necessary depending on the environment. So there's something different going on here that I think is interesting and maybe worth exploring further. Okay, just to wrap things up, if we look at mixed diffusion rates, then And the equation, we can get some situations where, this is work with Vashiri Sladho, the previous work with Salome Martinez, I should mention. We get things where if you have no no movement by one type, say the the adults don't move or the juveniles don't move, which are both possible depending on your populations. Depending on your populations, we get these conditions for persistence, which the eigenvalue goes to something where you're looking at averages of some combination of parameters in the system. So you're not just looking at averages of S or R or S or A, you're looking at this average of some related, more complicated quantity. We still get the same sort of thing for the dichotomy, but now the dependence is on this more complicated combination of things. And if we've got, if that's the case where one of the types doesn't move, the same kind of thing occurs if the other type doesn't move. thing occurs if the other type doesn't move. So you either have sessile adults and moving juveniles or vice versa. So you get these more complicated dependences on averages of combinations of parameters in most cases, which we've not explored extensively, but you know that's what you get. Okay, so things for the future. We've got things that are identical except for diffusion. Identical except for diffusion. There's still more stuff to do. We haven't looked at strong competition in this last setup very much. Strong competition could occur if you have adults eating juveniles, which happens in fish species. So some kinds of fish which are cannibalistic. That's why there's a Ricker model. But it would be interesting to see what happens with that. It would be interesting to consider directed movement and time dependence. Directed movement and time dependence. We just looked at the pure diffusion, the other movement types. And there are models around the Kendrick-Pan-Furster type for continuous age or stage structure, which are probably better models, but they're mathematically a lot more challenging. So the age structure model that I showed, the stage structure model was it, was simply you feed from one stage to the next. One stage to the next one, some rate. But you could also think of a true H structured model where you have density is dependent space and time and edge. And that makes for a more challenging PDE problem if you want to try to analyze it. But I think that would be interesting because it would be in many ways a more realistic description. Realistic description of stage and age structured populations. That's it. Thanks. So just two comments. So I think recently Bo has an experiment with sea elegants. So in which the sea elegants take up food at a rate proportional Pick up food at a rate proportional to the food distribution. So, this is sort of like the power rate. And then the reproduction rate is suppressed by toxins. So, it's sort of like tests. And then, her experiment showed that the faster diffuser does have an advantage in terms of measuring the proportions. Oh, thank you. Yeah, and then and the second comment is, so it seems like this is related to Sebastian's in some regime. In some regime, in the result. So, Sebastian has this result that the eigenvalue expansion has the, you have two modes, and then you need to look at the eigenfunction, how much deviation, how correlated are the two eigenfunctions. So, in this case, the two eigenfunctions are concentrated in the same space, and they're at the top. Right, that's right. That's right. Listening to Sebastian's talk, I thought I saw some similarities, but the difference is our stuff is all in space. His stuff is in time. But time and space both come into play. And so I think there is, a cool thing to do is to put in both, but that's hard to do. Now you've got some kind of And now you've got some kind of complicated time-dependent PDEs or something. So I don't think from the point of view of an individual, it is a time-heterogeneity. Yes. When you're in this state, you experience this kind of environment. Yes. And so probably if you want, this is unsolicited, but if you want to talk about fitness, you have to take the path of the individual from juvenile to adulthood. Juvenile to adulthood and track the life cycles. So we hadn't thought about trying to connect this stuff to fitness optimization or anything of that sort. But it does raise the point that if you've got time and space together, you probably have to look at paths or something to get things right. But now you're talking like Copps-Feynman theory. Feynman theory, so the math gets pretty hairy if you go out that way. But if anybody's brave enough to venture there, I think it would be pretty interesting. Other questions? So, Chris, you look at large diffusion coefficients and small diffusion, but if you look at the case where one is a fast diffuser and the other one is slow, do you get any Turing instabilities? We don't get anything like that, but we do get. Like that, but we do get interesting and more complicated conditions for persistence. The model probably wouldn't have, I don't think the model has the right nonlinearity for Turing instabilities. Because you need sort of an activator inhibitor, you could cook up, so it depends on the interactions of adults and juveniles. Of adults and juveniles. So, the ones we took were quite vanilla. You could cook up ones that were less vanilla. Maybe with cannibalism, you could get something like that. I'm not sure. Because there you have sort of predator-prey. We haven't explored it. It's a good question. There's lots of good questions. Thanks. I have a question. You mentioned the meaning of there is not um a good support for lady flights in uh in uh Uh in the data, which uh I heard uh also. Uh what do you think about the the model for persistent motion uh like the one that the one that was proposed by um biophysicist uh Bedi Schubertieri gravity between a broadened motion somewhere and then uh motion with large uh uh persistent uh displacement. But that that's which is not a belly fly, but which is not a deflion either. So Not a differentizer. So, my approach is sort of related to that, but it's not the same. The idea is that your organism moves by random diffusion some of the time, so that's, in that case, but it's a large diffusion. So it's moving randomly but at a large rate. But then it switches to something where it moves still by a version of diffusion or a diffusion of vection or something. Or a diffusion vection or something, but at a much slower rate. And so I think that it is a different attempt to capture the same kind of phenomenon. I totally agree. Just to prove your point of view about this alternative about having a mixture of diffusion and persistent motion. I think I get your point, and I completely agree with your own view on this. I haven't looked specifically. I haven't looked specifically at the thing that you described, but just from your brief and little description, it sounds maybe technically different, but philosophically somewhat similar. The thing you draw by blow for me is exactly that. You drew a line, a straight motion for a long time, which is Carson. Right. You get actually encoded this type of equation. So, this is why I work my own. Yeah, no, what I drew on the blackboard is what we see in data. And so we're trying to capture the same. We're trying to capture the same phenomena and probably by slightly different but related ways. But I would be interested to get a reference for what you're describing. It sounds like it might be useful. Of course, I'm a classical PDE guy by training, so I'm going to go with something that I can work with. There's another question that's thank our speaker again. So the next talk is 1035. So it will be Thomas Hilletta to replace the buttons. One to one.
