To plastic. So, Eric, the floor is all yours. Well, thank you, Ton. And thanks, of course, in the organizing team. So, Michelle and Bruce. And yeah, it's great to be here on this talk and to talk to you about a new direction, I guess, in my research about Bayesian inference of source attributions. So, something that we've been working on for the past year or so. Year or so. And a few papers are now coming out. And I'm going to give a bit of an overview of what that then means and how I think it could be a cool way to learn more about how the ocean works by investigating the pathways of plastic. And of course, like essentially all the work that I do, it starts with Lagrangian simulations, right? And this mesmerizing picture that you see here. And by the way, You see here. By the way, should we be recording, or this is happening? So we actually use beers to do the recording and okay, okay, okay. Okay, I'm just continuing. Good morning. I believe we are recording already. Yes, this is Carlos from Burris. Excellent. Perfect. Yeah. So what you see here, so in this mesmerizing picture, the trajectories of virtual particles on the surface of Virtual particles on the surface of a 112-degree ocean flow model in this case, right? And it is color-coded so that randomly. But I hope that you see some cool patterns here. And I do want to point out here what happens here, which is quite cool, is of course the sea ice. So there's a big difference in the turbulence and the flow scales in the open ocean versus in the sea ice. Now, this is the only thing that I'm going to say. And this is the only thing that I'm going to say about the sea ice today. But I thought that for some of you, this might be quite cool to see that the spatial patterns are much more largely coherent, right? And there's much less turbulence there. So something to explore. Anyway, so this is what you then get. Let me see. If you take a side view and you actually make an animation of the same simulation. So here we started virtual particles all across the surface. Virtual particles all across the surface of the ocean, as I said, in the 112-degree NEMO surface field. And then you just start that and you get something like this. And this is a very, very typical simulation that we do all the time. And immediately what you see is that there's convergence and there's divergence, right? So there's clear divergence at the equator and there's convergence in the subtropical gyres. Now, of course, Tropical gyres. Now, of course, the water itself is nearly incompressible, so there's mass continuity. But because we are here looking at the 2D slice in a 3D circulation, you can have convergence and divergence. And what you see is then, well, what's often called the garbage patches, the accumulation zone, whatever you want to call them, these areas in the subtropical gyres where probably due to across the. Called gyres, where probably due to Ekman convergence and Ekman pumping, all the floating material ends up. But actually, that is not the whole story. Actually, if you look carefully, then these garbage patches aren't just simple accumulation regions. There's actually a lot of variability below the gyre scale. So, this is a data set by Cara Law. Gabalaw, who went out with the SEA so many years, and every time they did a sample with a Manta troll, like the one over here. So trawling a Manta net through the ocean for a mile, counting a number of pieces of plastic that you find in the content of the net, and then converting that to a number per square kilometer. And sure, what you see is that in the center of the gyre, you find the highest. Of the gyre, you find the highest values, and you find typically somewhat lower values as you go towards the tropics and also here on the coastal shelf. But you also see large variability very close together. And these samples often are taken just a few kilometers apart and can vary by orders of magnitudes in their size, even if they are taken. Even if they are taken consecutively on the same day. Of course, you can't see that from this map over here because I've averaged all the time here, or I've just plotted all the time. But even if you would do this in animation, then you see that sometimes the consecutive samples are widely varying in the amount of plastic that they show. So there's a lot more going on than simple. On than simple Egman convergence. The large-scale ocean flow is kind of just a background on top the stage of oceanographic processes that create heterogeneity and variability in the amount of plastic is happening. And that, I guess, was the point of the review paper that we wrote a few years, where Tom was a co-author, where many of the others, I guess, in the audience. Many of the others, I guess, in the audience are Cohron, and where we try to kind of like to give an overview of all these different processes, all the physical oceanography processes that act on floating material. With the idea to understand plastic accumulation better, but also very explicitly to understand the ocean better. Because the plastic is a unique tracer and that we can use to. And that we can use to say something about how ocean processes interact, especially on the smaller scales. Now, so my workhorse tool, as I've shown before already, is this Lagrangian simulation. So virtual particles, which then can be used to do Lagrangian analysis in the ocean model. And what we use is a tool called Parcels, which stands for probably a Which stands for probably a really computationally efficient Lagrangian simulator. It's a bit of a backronym. And this essentially is a set of Python classes and methods to build your own Lagrangian model. So it's not an out-of-the-box, off-the-shelf plastic model or anything. It's much more a toolbox that you can use to build whatever tracking model you want. It can be plastic, but it can also be. Plastic, but it can also be tuna or fish or plankton or heat or carbon or anything that is moved around with the ocean. In principle, you can simulate with parcels. Now, for this talk, of course, we are going to focus on plastic as the items that we're interested in. And the key thing that we're then doing in parcels is that we can very easily incorporate behavior through what so-called kernels. And in this Uh, kernels and in this case of plastic, we develop the kernels for the wave effects, for biofouling. Uh, Delphine Lobel, a postdoc in my team, is very active on that, for sinking, for fragmentation, for beaching, maybe even at some point for ingestion. And the idea is then to parametrize all of these processes with lab field studies, right? So to find out, well, what are the So, to find out, well, what are the rates of fragmentation? What are the rates of sinking? What are the rates of beaching? And we can do that with lab studies, but we can also very much do that with field studies, with the type of observations that I showed in the plot from CARA to try and find out: well, how do we best match our models to the observations? And the first time that we really tried that on a large scale. On a large scale, was when Michael Kandorp, a PhD student in my group, when he tried to estimate the total plastic budget in the Mediterranean. The goal now is to go globally and to do this globally, but we thought, well, so the Mediterranean is a bit like a toy ocean, it's a bit simpler than the global ocean with a good amount of data. Good amount of data, so why not try it in the Mediterranean first? And essentially, what he did was he developed or he combined a set of source functions. So where we think that the plastic enters the ocean from rivers in green, from fishing in blue, and from mismanaged plastic waste around the coastline in red. And note actually that especially the fishing and That especially the fission intensity, of course, is not in a unit that has anything to do with plastic. So we have to have, or we have to come up with a conversion factor. We have to somehow try and find out what the conversion factor is and how much plastic is actually lost per hour of fishing. So, that is one of the parameters that we need to estimate in our model. Now, there are other parameters like beaching and sinking, but I'll come to that. Leaching and sinking, but I'll come to that. Because first, what we did was just to do a simulation. So, three simulations essency: so, one where we release plastic from the beaches, one where we release it from the rivers, and one where we release it from the areas of the fishing intensity. And if you combine them, and if you do simulation, then that looks something like this. So, this now has given Mikkel a three-dimensional, so A three-dimensional, so two-dimensional in space and one-dimensional in time distribution of the amount of plastic in the Mediterranean. And then the thing is that you could then match that two observations. So observations that were taken at certain times in the Mediterranean. And then, of course, it becomes an optimization problem. So, for a set of parameters, unknown parameters, I think in total we had eight or nine. What is What is the best value of these parameters to where the model actually most closely fits the observation? It's as simple as that. Although, of course, it is not as easy to implement this. What Mikel did was he used a Bayesian parameter estimation. So I'm not going to go through all of the parameters, but the two most important ones, and I guess also the two that are most intuitive to think about, are the beaching time scale and the sinking time scale. Beaching time scale and the sinking time scale. So, what we needed was: if a particle is close to a coastline, what is the probability that it actually beaches? So, our simulations, so here it was on 112 degree or so, they don't include explicit beaching, right? So, there are no beaching processes. So, we need to parameterize that with a Markov model, essentially, a probability that a plastic or no, sorry, that a particle ends up on the beach. Sorry, that a particle ends up on the beach if it is close to the beach. And that involves a time scale, and that needs an estimate. Now, what we did in the Bayesian parameter estimation is that we started with a prior, which was really broad, anywhere between 10 days and 100 days or so with a peak around, so 10 days and 1000 days with a peak around 100 days. And the same for the sinking time scale. We also needed. We also needed the probability that a particle would sink out of the surface. And that would be a loss in our model. So we didn't actually in this simulation explicitly resolve that. But that we also needed a time scale for, which was a little bit short. Anyway, then after the Bayesian parameter estimation, what we ended up with was much, much narrower. Much, much narrower estimates of these parameters. We're really happy with this that actually the model shows a beating time scale of, I think it was 24 or 25 or so days, anywhere between 20 and 30 days. So much shorter actually than our prior. And for the sinking time scale, our prior, the peak was The peak was chosen pretty well, but it did narrow down very much. So, actually, there was a lot of information in the data and in the model so that the parameters could actually be narrowed down by the data itself. Now, we did this for all of the parameters. You can read it in the paper. The cool thing is, then, if you have that, then you have a simulation, a simulation that best matches to the observation. The uh to the observation, and if you have that, well, then you can start to create a map. So, this is the map of where, according to Michael's simulation, most of the plastic beaches and most of the plastic sinks in the Mediterranean. And what you see is that, well, that the beaching hotspots are on the southern side and here on the eastern side, and the sinking hotspots are especially here in the Adriatic. Spots are especially here in the Adriatic and here on the western side. And of course, if you then have a map like this, then it's completely trivial to integrate this all up. And he came with the estimate that approximately half of all the plastic that ever entered the Mediterranean had beached, approximately 40% or so had sunk, and approximately 10% or so is still afloat. And this, of course, then relates to the 1% and the missing plastic, et cetera. But I don't really want to go into that anymore because I think. Don't really want to go into that anymore because I think that there are more interesting questions right now than where's all the plastic. This actually provides us maps of hotspots of plastic accumulation. And at the end of my presentation, I will come back actually to the Mediterranean because we just had a really new, exciting project about that. Anyway, what you see is that half or so of the plastic in this simulation seems to have beached. And that's interesting because that, for the first time at least, Because that, for the first time, at least to me, showed that beaching may be a very, very important parameter for the global plastic simulation. So I come from large-scale physical oceanography, right? I started my work on marine plastics 10 years ago to think about the convergence zones and Agman pumping. But I've realized that. Pumping. But I've realized that that is maybe the least important of all the processes. It's actually the beaching that's much more important. And here's some evidence, but there's also other evidence. And I want to go through a few of the papers that we've done in the group over the past year that have shown that really beaching is absolutely crucial. And that, so this, for example, is a paper that Miriam van der Main from the University of Western Australia led. Of Western Australia, I led, and she showed for the Indian Ocean that if you do a simulation, and here it was with high comp data, but that doesn't really matter. That if you show, if you do a simulation where you release plastic from all of the Indian countries and you don't include beaching, then indeed you get an accumulation in the South Indian Ocean and a quite big accumulation in the Bay of Bengal. But if you do include But if you do include beaching, a fairly strong beaching probability here, then you get a completely different picture. So there are hardly any dots now anymore in the open ocean, if you see it, right? It's almost none of the plastic is in the open ocean after five years anymore. And instead, most of it has beached. And what Miriam had then looked at is that she looked at, well, who's what is the origin of the plastic that beached? Origin of the plastic that beaches in a certain country. And that was really, really surprising to me. Because so this shows with the sources up here in the columns and the things in the rows, this shows, well, essentially, whose plastic is it that ends up on a beach somewhere in the Indian Ocean rim? It's surprising because most of the countries, it's actually their own plastic. The highest numbers are all on the diagonal, except for countries like Except for countries like the Maladives and Madagascar and Mozambique, where it's actually none of their own plastic that ends up on the coastline. For most of the other countries, it is essentially their own rubbish that ends there. And of course, so this is really, really good news, I would argue, because if you think about this from a management perspective, it makes much more sense for a local authority to clean up a beach if it's their own rubbish. If it's their own rubbish, than if it comes from the neighboring country, right? If you think about that, so this is so this shows that most of the plastic is local. Now, then, at the same time that Miriam was doing this for the Indian Ocean, Victor Oning was actually doing it globally. And again, so using the HICOM model, he did an analysis for the global coastlines, and he looked if plastic is released. And he looked if plastic is released from a certain point in the coastline, how far maximally does it typically move offshore? And that's in this color bar here. So yellow are areas where essentially the median, maximum distance is only 10 kilometers. Most of the plastic really stays very, very close to shore on the African coastline. On the African coastlines, of course, here on the Arabian Peninsula, because well, it's all fairly constricted. And really, so you only get far off-scale transports, essentially for islands in the Pacific Ocean, in the Atlantic Ocean, and the West Coast, or sorry, the east coast of the US and the east coast of Japan also. And that's, of course, because the Western Boundary currents just take all the plastic offshore very quickly. Take all the plastic offshore very quickly. But if you sum this up, then you would see that so it depends again a bit on the beaching time scale and whether you take the 26 days that Michael found in the Mediterranean or a little bit shorter or a little bit longer. But you see that typically half of all the plastic stays within a few hundred kilometers or so, never gets further offshore than two, three, maybe. Than two, three, maybe 400 kilometers. Most of the plastic is released and just washes back up very quickly after that. That is really, I think, the new paradigm, at least for me, of what the ocean circulation is doing. Anything that starts on a coastline typically stays close to a coastline, except for, of course, on islands and those areas. In those areas. And that means also, of course, that then all the plastic that ends up in the open ocean probably comes from the open ocean. Now, I don't have the simulations to prove that, but I do have observational data to prove that. So this came out of a paper by Carmen Morales Castellas from the University of Bigo in Spain. And what she did is, with a big group of co-authors, she Of co-authors, she went through all the data sets of macroplastic that were found, that were collected. So litter cleanup campaigns, essentially, in rivers, in open waters, on the deep sea floor, on the near sea floor, on the riverbed, on the shoreline, etc., in different categories. Then she looked at what type of plastic. I won't go into that. The material is also not that interesting, except for that it was. Also, not that interesting, except for that it was almost always dark blue, which is plastic. What is interesting, and what I want to highlight here, is actually the origin. What you see is that for most of the categories, most of the plastic was actually takeout consumer, except for the open ocean waters. There, most of the plastic was actually ocean and waterway, which essentially is most of it fisheries. So, you see that this category really stands out from all. Category really stands out from all of the others in terms of its origin. Now, with this, Sir Carmen was able to actually construct a flow model, a material flow analysis of the most likely pathways of plastic between the different reservoirs. And this is the figure that she ended up with. This shows that, so you've got input from rivers, input from shoreline, input from the near shore. Line input from the near shore and offshore input. And then you have the different boxes over here and the open ocean waters again showing that most of the plastic in the open waters is fishing related and most of the plastic in nearshore water is actually plastic bag and wrappers. And the key thing, and I was really shocked when I first saw this, and I thought, okay, there goes my career down the grain, because the key thing is that. Because the key thing is that those arrows are tiny. There's hardly any flux, at least of macro plastics, between the near-shore waters and the open waters. There's a clear disconnection, right? So fishing-related plastic enters in the open waters and then sinks, or it ends in the near shore waters and then also sinks. But it doesn't really flux between. It doesn't really flux between the nearshore and the open waters. So, the key, key thing, and I'm a late convert, maybe, but I am a convert now. The key thing is that coastal processes. Coastal processes are key. That is, if you really want to understand, especially consumer plastic, we need to better understand how plastics end up on the shoreline and what the role of rip currents and longshore currents and all these kind of things that coastal engineers are so good at. That coastal engineers are so good at that they know. So, this is a figure from a paper by Kirpen who just came from coastal engineering and who started to think about, well, what are the processes that are important for plastic particles in the near shore? It's really interesting because coastal engineering are completely used to think about particles, but they always think about sand particles, which are negatively buoyant, of course. Negatively buoyant, of course. So for them, they have to completely flip their minds and on his head. And Cleo Jungedajk, who's a PC candidate that I co-supervise at Imperial College, she's really now diving into this and has some fantastic ideas about this too. So now we know that the plastic is mostly coastal or stays coastal, but that isn't really. Goes to. But that isn't really yet the answer to whose plastic really is that. So, this is where the really new stuff comes in. How can you find out whose plastic it is that you find somewhere on the beach? So, say that you are at a location and we call it X, and then you ask yourself, well, what's the probability that it came from a certain source, a source S? Then, obvious way to phrase this. Obvious way to phrase this is in a Bayesian form, right? So the probability that it came from S given that it is at location X. And then you can use a Bayes theorem to say that the probability that it came from S given it was an X times the probability that it came from X is the probability it is an X given that it came from source S times the probability that it is from source S. Right? That's the simple base and you can rewrite. The simple base, and you can rewrite this as this, obviously. And now it becomes quite interesting because it turns out that at least two of those terms are fairly easy to compute. Px given S is called the likelihood. It's the probability that a plastic that starts at source S arrives at location X. Well, that is exactly what Lagrangian simulations do, right? You have a source and you You have a source, and you simulate weather plastic that comes at location X. So, this comes directly from the type of simulations that I've built my career on, and that my whole group is doing essentially non-stop. PS is the prior. That's just the probability that a plastic comes from a source S. And for that, there's a lot of fantastic groups around the world who build data sets of estimates of where. Of estimates of where plastic comes from. Now, you can say a lot about the accuracy of those data sets. I'm not going to do that because I'm just taking it as a given here, right? So these data sets, and they keep getting updated. That's a whole different game that I don't want to get involved. We trust them. Now, Px, on the other hand, is a little bit more complicated because Px is, well, what's called the normalizing termophile, and technically, it is a probability. And technically, it is a probability that any plastic is found at location X. But that requires a closed system, essentially, that we have to simulate all the plastic in the world. And that is a little bit too complex still for us. We're not there yet. So, what we've been doing, and for instance, so Claudio Pierar, who was also doing his PhD in my team, he's now Team, he's now suggesting to replace the PX for simply the sum of all the probabilities of all the simulations, essentially, the weighted probabilities of the simulations. So if you do this, then you can see that the sum that it comes from any source S is one. That's fairly obvious to see, I guess. So now it becomes. Fairly obvious to see, I guess. So now it becomes a closed system. Given that we have a set of sources S, we can figure out what the probability is that it came from any of those sources and not anything else. No, and then you can do that. And Claudio applied it to the South Atlantic in this paper. So he chose all the rivers, which he then clustered in 11 clusters and also then later in the. Later in the reviewing process, he also looked at the unclustered rivers explicitly. I'll come back to that. Anyway, so he has seven clusters on the American coast and two clusters on the African coast. And if you do a simulation, then it looks something like this. And the key thing, what you immediately see already, is that even though the particles they start out The particles they start out all with their own coloring. In the gyre, it's a bit of a bland color. Everything gets mixed, literally. It's literally a mixing of the coloring over here in the gyre. So the question is then, well, if you pick a point somewhere, say, so this location of Cape Town, what we can now do in this framework is we can calculate the posterior probability. So P of S given A. Of S given X, so the probability that came from any of the sources given that it is at location B as a function of time. And see that, well, that it takes, say, just over a year for any plastic to arrive. So before that, the probability is ill-defined because it just takes too long for plastic to arrive to this point. But after that, you see that, well, so early on, the probabilities are are the highest for for that's for this set of rivers uh but then over time that decreases a little bit um and rivers like italia and um and which is it uh i think recipa uh or orio de plata they increase so this is cool because now you can say that well if you uh you know the the age of a piece of plastic in the ocean and come back to what it exactly means but if you know that Exactly means, but if you know that, you can look here what the probability is that it came from any of the rivers. And it may be a bit boring because the probability is essentially well the same for all of the rivers, but that's because in point B, everything is mixed up. Of course, you can also do this for coastlines. And then it becomes much more interesting. So it's maybe too complicated a figure, and it's certainly too colorful a figure. And I know that Claudio is also aware, but still we've decided. Is also aware, but still we've decided to stick with this coloring. You can now, for a certain latitude on either the American coast or on the African coast, you can ask, well, what is the probability that the piece of plastic that ends up on that coastline came from any of the rivers? Where the dashed is the unclustered Africa and the dotted is the unclustered rivers of America. So you see that as soon as you go south of Fort Go south of 42 south or so, it's one of the unclustered rivers, and that's because the last cluster is up here in Rio de la Plata. But you can see some interesting patterns. I mean, so for example, that orange, which is Cape Town, is not the most dominant source, actually, just near Cape Town. It is actually the Rio de Janeiro. And that is simply because the source of plastic, PS, The source of plastic PS is much higher for Rio de Janeiro than it is for Cape Town. And only if you go a little bit further north, then that one becomes more important. And you do actually get a quite large contribution also on the northern side of Brazil. So this, of course, is quite interesting again for policymakers if you want. So this is forward in time. You can also do this backwards in time. So you can look In time. So you can look at: well, where did the plastic that they find something, where could it most likely have come from? And that is a study that Bran van Daune did, who was a bachelor student actually in my group last year. Amazing that this is the work of a bachelor's student. It just got published in Geophysical Research Letters two weeks ago or last week or so. And what he looked at is that say that you find yourself on a beach here in the southwest of the Netherlands. Here in the southwest of the Netherlands. It doesn't really matter, but we chose this beach. If you find yourself there, then what is the most likely sources over time of the plastic that end up here? And the way that Brom did that is that he did a backward simulation and then still did exactly the same Bayesian framework. So the probability that it came from a source given it was found on a certain location of a beach is a probability that it came from. is the probability that it came from a certain beach given that it was from a certain source times the probability that came from a source divided by the probability that came that it is on the beach on the first place. And here, by the way, it's also time explicit. And as you see, I mean, and this you may recognize as you're developing these kind of theories, we haven't really settled on the terms and how we define. The terms and how we define them. So sometimes we use XS, sometimes we use S, but that's fine. I'm sure that in a few years we've settled on a notation. But if you do that, then you can see here in this animation what this looks like over time. So as a function of time, what is the most likely source in terms of the fisheries, in terms of the coastal probabilities or in coast of the in terms of the river poss uh probabilities? Terms of the river probabilities of plastic that ends up here. And see, it's fairly dynamic. Sometimes it's from the North Sea or from the east coast of the UK, but most often it's from the channel. And it's either from the fisheries or from the coastal probabilities. And by the way, here we haven't really settled then on which one of those it is. One of those it is. But we can do that if we now take the approach where instead of over time, we look at as a function of particle age. So how long has a particle been in the water before it ended up on the location of the beach here of Southwest Netherlands? And what you see then, so here's the zeros. So for a very young particle, it's most likely from an L, which is the Netherlands. From NL, which is the Netherlands, which is obvious, right? So, so plastic that's really young that you find on the beach is probably local, right? And either from NL itself or from NL fisheries. So, the shaded bit is the fisheries bit, the non-shaded bit is whatever comes from either the rivers or the coastal probabilities. And then you see over time that especially the east coast of the UK becomes bigger. So, again, so this is. So, again, so this is quite useful, I guess, if you want to know whose plastic it is that you are finding on your beach walk, given that you know the particle age. I'll come back to that. But first, the next step then, of course, is to use these kind of models to actually extend this, to combine it, and to estimate: well, how much plastic is then really on the coastline? And can we predict? The coastline, and can we predict where all this plastic comes from and what are the main drivers for plastic bleaching? And that's a paper that Michael Kandorp has just been accepted in Ocean Science. It will come out in a week or two or so. The preprint is already available. And what we did here is that we worked together with an NGO, the Sifting de Nordse, and they organized beach cleanups, a beach cleanup tour. Clean up tour along the entire coast of the Netherlands in one, two, three, four, five, six years typically. And every kilometer of beach is cleaned and the amount of litter is weighed. Now, so we had a great data set of the variation of the amount of plastic on these beaches. And what Mikel then And what Mikel then did is try to get to a machine learning approach where, given the wind fields, the wave fields, the tides, and all kinds of other parameters, we could predict or estimate the amount of plastic found at each of those locations. And then optimize, of course, against the observations themselves. And what he found. And what he found was: so, in terms of the Gini importance, and I don't really want to go into this, this is all the machine learning technical bit. And of course, you can read it in the paper if you want. But he found that the tides were actually, so the variation of the tides was the most important predictor for the amount of plastic found on the beaches. And the second was the height, the maximum height of the tide. The maximum height of the tide in the three days prior to the cleanup. So it probably has something to do with tides. The third was about the orientation of the beach with respect to the grids. The length of the code was important, etc. And then you get to smaller and smaller. And I think in total, he had something like 200 parameters or so that he tuned. But also with a smaller set, he got similar results. Now, of course, it isn't perfect. Now, of course, it isn't perfect, right? It isn't a perfect model. We got to Pearson R values around 0.71 or so. So the observed value compared to predicted value, you got a reasonable fit, but it wasn't great. So this is not yet kind of a perfect model. But the good thing is that we could also estimate the variation from the variogram, and we got an uncertainty also on the prediction of how much. On the prediction of how much plastic is on the Dutch coastlines. And then again, if you have this model, then you can apply it to the mean situation and you end up with a map like this. The mean predicted amount of litter in kilograms per kilometer over the Dutch coastline. You see a hotspot over here that we still don't really know what it is about. Know what it is about. I think it is because of the river influence that kind of like comes out of here, out of here in Rotterdam and then hits back on the coastline here. But I know that Mikao has other ideas. So we still have to sort this out exactly what it is. But we do see a hotspot here and lower concentrations here in the south. And then, of course, you can sum this all up. And we find that the amount of plastic on Dutch beaches is anywhere between 16,000 and 31,000 kilograms. Kilograms. Now, why are we doing this? I mean, who cares about the Netherlands, right? We are doing this because the Netherlands has a super simple coastline. If you've ever been here, it's all sand. It's all roughly the same width. It's fairly boring. It's fairly homogeneous. So, this is a great starting place to learn about how to predict beaching for machine learning. And the next step that we want to do. And the next step that we want to do is to actually apply this to the Galapagos. So we're working together with the Galapagos Park Authority to create simulations of where litter actually ends up on the Galapagos. And Stephanie Ipma, a postdoc in my team, is leading all this work. And this is quite cool. So the idea is, well, I'll come back to what the idea is. First, so this is really what we're doing. So, this is really what we're doing here as part of the Pacific Plastic Science to Solutions project is really interdisciplinary. So, it's not just our simulations and our machine learning and all that. It's actually much more than that. And one of the really exciting things that we do is that we work together with archaeologists. You ask yourself, oh, archaeologists, why archaeologists? Because if you think Because if you think about what an archaeologist does, I mean, what is their key expertise, is to look at an artifact and try to tease out the story of that artifact. And John Schofield, who's at the University of York, he thinks that he can use the same techniques for plastic, at least for macroplastic, to look at objects found on beaches. Objects found on beaches and try to find out with robust archaeological theory and techniques and methods what the story of that object was, where it came from. And that we can then combine with the simulations. And this may be a way to get an estimate of the age of the particles, right? So I've now for a few times said, well, all the Bayesian simulations are nice, but really only if you know how long the particles, the plastic. The particles, the plastic has been in the water. So maybe taking a page from the book of Archaeology 101 could be a solution here to really understand this a little bit better. And the goal then of this project is to develop an app, an app that uses all of this data to then predict when and where the plastic will actually wash ashore on the Galapagos. On the Galapagos, and that, um, and that will then, yeah, I mean, we can do that for the Galapagos, but also for other islands in the end, right? And then eventually, the app will help the local park ranges and residents from beaches all over the world with managing, targeting, and prioritizing their beach cleanups. Um, and that is the ultimate goal that we have in this project. So, I do want to come back to the story of Back to the story of plastics as an artifact. So, this is actually some photos from a colleague of mine, Walter Jan Strietmann, and he works at Wageningen University. And he organizes litter ID workshops, for example, here in Svalbard, so in the high Arctic. And what they do is they clean up a beach, first of all. Clean up a beach, first of all, but then they very carefully categorize and analyze all of the items that he's fine that they find on the beach. Pair category, trying to figure out, well, whose plastic is it really that ends up on these beaches? And one of the really, well, powerful stories for me that I very often tell, especially to journalists, about, well, where does this plastic come from? Is that I wasn't there, but. Um, I wasn't there, but but but but Valtray Janus has told me the story that at some point they were looking together with the group, they were looking at the category of uh cosmetics. So plastics that came out of the cosmetic industry, right? So shampoos, deodorants, all these kinds of things. And we're overviewing that category, all the items they found on the beach. And someone suddenly said, hey, that's weird. Hey, that's weird. Every single one of those items is actually men's cosmetic. It's a men's shampoo. It's a man's deodorant. There were no women's deodorants on this beach. And that, of course, is quite interesting because that suggests that this isn't from rivers or from coastlines. It's from fisheries or from shipping, right? It's from an industry that is very much Governed by men. And so, it's nothing to do with the story of the left shoe and the right shoe. I would assume that a man's shampoo drifts exactly the same way as a woman's shampoo, but it does have to do something with the sources. So, again, really looking at those items, and that's why I'm also more and more interested in microplastic, because I think that we can really hear interdisciplinary work together and learn something. Work together and learn something. Now, my last few slides is where we want to go with this, I think. And one really, really exciting bit of news that I am probably most proud of of all the things that I've done over the past few years, and actually, I didn't do anything, is this the Blue Cloud Hackathon, where that was a hackathon organization. Where that was a hackathon organized last week, actually, by the Blue Cloud, which is an EU project. And a group from my team, so Laura and Cleo and Delphine and Darsica and Victor and Claudio and Joey and Normo, they grouped together. So with a set of PhDs and postdocs and even master's students, and in two days developed an app called See Clearly with the idea that it would be again for It would be again for the Mediterranean, and it was targeted towards agriculture farms with the idea to inform agriculture farmers and stakeholders where pollutants that could end up on those locations, where they could come from. So using the tools that we've developed backwards in time, if you take, say, this farm over here, what are the most likely sources of the pollutants? Of this, uh, of the pollutants that could end up on this location, and then also with a Bayesian flavor on top of this. And what I really like about it is that, I mean, most of the tools we've been developing and we had in our team, but what the group was able to do is to transform this within two days into actual working app that the judges of the hackathon liked so much that they gave it the first prize. So, I'm super proud that this is one. Proud that this is one the first prize for Seek Clearly in this hackathon. I had nothing to do with it, and I'm just as kind of like a parent. I'm just so proud if my students stand by themselves. And some of them I know are in the audience, so give them a big applause at the end. So that's kind of the wrap up, right? I do want to end with this statement. I've mostly been talking about simulation. About simulations, about modeling, about computer, about virtual particles. And that's this bit, right? My attempt to draw a supercomputer. But I can't do this alone. These simulations have absolutely no meaning by themselves. We need ocean-going research. We need observation from the sea itself. We need remote sensing. We need lab-based studies of, say, turbulent mixing. So the type of studies that Marie. The type of studies that Marie Poulin has been so fantastic at, for example. Or, yeah, so those, and we need to work together. We should really work together and learn from us. And what I really like about this community in ocean plastics, and especially then the physics of it, is that we do work together, that we have open workshops like the one that you've been organizing here that are transparent and that are informative. And where really I hope also later today on Gathertown, we can have a great conversation. Today on Gettertown, we can have a great conversation and discuss this further. Because I think that you know, the plastic that's littering our society is an atrocity, right? Society should be ashamed. It is shocking and it is shameful that there's plastic now in a Mariana trench. But at the same time, the plastic is also a unique opportunity to better understand how the ocean works. So we should reap this opportunity. So, we should reap this opportunity. We should also take the silver lining out of this environmental problem and take it as a scientist as a way to increase our knowledge of oceanography and especially I guess coastal oceanography too. And that's my conclusions. That's what I want to end up with. So, the ocean is no bathtub. It's in constant motion for Swaskadis. So, have a crucial role in the transport of plastic. The challenge now is to capture additional physical processes. To capture additional physical processes such as beaching and numerical models, and then I've shown you that we can, if we have those accurate numerical models, we can use them to optimize cleanup strategies and to, or what I would say, play the blame game. Whose plastic is it that ends up somewhere? And I want to thank, of course, my whole team, all the fantastic people who've worked so hard with me. I couldn't have done it without them. Thank you. Great. Thanks a lot. Great. Thanks a lot, Eric. You can see all the applause for you and indeed for your team, I think, especially for the recent priority one. So excellent overview. So let's see whether we have any questions from the audience. So if you have questions, could you please raise your hand using the tool? And I'm then going to. Yeah. So, Claudia, I. Georgia. Hi, Ed. Great talk. Really enjoyed it. I was wondering that first simulation that you showed us about the Mediterranean, where it basically was pretty convincing that since 50% of those parcels end up on the beach, beaching is an important mechanism. Is there any way? And look, it was mainly on the north coast of Africa. Do you have any data that you could use to kind of, I don't want to say validate, I don't like that word, but you know, that's just. Validate. I don't like that word. But you know, that's just to that can show that indeed in the coast of northern coast of Africa, there is more plastic found that say in Spain or around Italy. Is there, or you have to rely on this kind of beach cleanup, which then, you know, obviously is a bit more work to get the data. Yeah, so good question. So, indeed, we don't really have data to validate the coastal concentrations here yet, unfortunately. There is some. Yet, unfortunately. There is some beach data, but unfortunately, especially lacking in the areas of the highest concentrations. You may hope that remote sensing could help, but yeah, who knows? And to be honest, I think the really big challenge with beach cleanup data itself is that you never know how representative that is for the long-term mean, right? The good but annoying thing is that beaches also get cleaned up by local administrations, that councils clean up the beaches without actually then weighing the amount of plastic. So if you go out there and weigh how much plastic is on a beach, you don't know about what time scale that's representative. That I think is true here in the Mediterranean, but it's also true in lots of other countries. Mikao is now doing the global work. Now, doing the global work, as I said. And he has found only really a handful of good data sets that we can use directly in a simulation to compare our model to the observations. Okay, thank you. All right, we have another question from Marie-Louise. Yeah, thanks, Eric. That was super interesting. My question is on this picture that we're on right now. With respect to the With respect to the sinking, do I understand that that means you have a model for biofouling? No. Well, we do have a model for biofouling, but we didn't use it here. So here it is purely the time scale. So this time scale that I showed. Oh, I'll go one too far. This time scale says that if a particle is That if a particle is 80 days in the water, then it has an E time 1 minus E probability of sinking, essentially. So here we are just taking the particles as they are in the water. They are randomly removed, or actually part of their mass is randomly removed in this sense. Now, since we've developed this, Delphine Lobel has developed a full biofouling model. Fowling model, and we have two papers on that. I mean, I didn't have time to explain everything here. But we do have a model where the biofiling is actually dynamically weighing down the particles, so increasing the biofilm, increasing the density of the particles, that at some point then start to sink. And now, in the latest paper of Delphine, actually, that biofilm can also remineralize, so the particles can actually increase. Can actually increase their buoyancy and then go back up again. So you get this yo-yo-ing effect that some people think is important in the ocean. That we've now tested in the North Pacific, subtropical gyre, in the tropical Pacific, and in the Southern Ocean to see how big that effect is. Okay, interesting. Thank you. Yeah. Great. We have another question from Jean-Luc. Yes. Hi. Very interesting. I'm really curious about this beaching aspect of it. This beaching aspect of it. I mean, so you're saying it was a surprise that beaching was that high, but do you have any idea of the mechanisms involved? And secondly, a related question: this must depend strongly on the size of the particles, I would imagine, this conclusion. So yes. So in our simulations, it's pretty obvious that the beaching is mostly driven by stokeshift. So it's a large-scale stokeshrift that A large-scale Stokes drift that is a key to the beaching, and that's also, for example, why wind is important for the Dutch beaching, and why we've been taking that into account. Now, here we use virtual particles that don't really represent a size. We just put them on the surface of the ocean and they're affected by Stokeshrift. So that would typically be macroplastic. The same, of course, is true for the observational study that I showed you. Study that I showed you. So, this one is clearly microplastics because they're actually items that can be identified as being from one of those categories. They're actually picked up by people. So, this is larger than your typical microplastic, which is just a grain of rice that you can't define anymore. So, I think it is, well, okay, so I and that's actually why I changed the title of my presentation three minutes before I get. Of my presentation three minutes before I gave it, if you weren't around already, I think that most of what I've said is actually more relevant to macroplastic than to microplastic. Also, of course, because microplastic and or even smaller nanoplastics get mixed down into the deeper ocean much more. So they're much more three-dimensional. There's more and more information, also observational information now, that actually there's the smaller. The smaller microplastic and nanoplastic behave almost colloidal and just move with the flow. So you don't get accumulation zones anymore. The garbage patches are a microplastic and microplastic phenomena, not a nanoplastic phenomena. So what I now think of it, but that's pure hypothesis, is that on the one hand, you've got microplastic that stays near shore and also fragments there, because that's another of That's another of Michael Kandorf's papers: is a fragmentation model that explains why the size distributions we see in the ocean, where there's a big role for fragmentation actually on beaches. That's where the rubbing with the sand happens, the breaking of the stones. So you've got the microplastic starts from the rivers, spends a lot of time near the coast, going back and forth between the beaches. Microplastics break off, nanoplastic breaks off. Microplastics break off, nanoplastic breaks off, and those get washed in the undertow, in the subsurface, into the open ocean. But they don't really have the proof for that yet. Okay, I think we have one more question. Question from Bruce. It's just a follow-up on what you discussed. In terms of these estimates for how much plastic goes into rivers and the ocean, and then what's actually observed, do you have a sense from your studies or these observations? Sense from your studies or these observations of what fraction of that observed mass is macroplastics and hence what left over is microplastics? Yeah, so that's a great question. A lot of our simulations actually depends more than we would want on the quality of the source distributions of where we think that the plastic enters the ocean. And not only my group, but what I've heard. Only my group, but what I've heard in the always is that a lot of groups are realizing that, for instance, the famous Jamback paper and the estimate is far too high. That there's likely much more plastic entering the ocean. We see it also. If we do a parameter estimation of the amount of plastic that has entered, say, the Mediterranean Ocean, I I I don't have the numbers on the on the on the top of my head, but in Mi Mi in Miko's But in Michael's best estimate, it is at least an order of magnitude smaller, our best estimate, than what, say, Jamback thinks is going into the Mediterranean. So there might be quite a bit of a mismatch there that we still have to resolve. But it's a call to action to all those people creating those data sets, estimates of how much plastic enters the ocean, because otherwise, yeah, that. Because otherwise, yeah, that's the big uncertainty we have. Thanks. Great. Thanks a lot, Eric, for your talk again and for answering.
