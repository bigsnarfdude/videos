Followed by a third one after a short coffee break. So, to begin, it is a pleasure to introduce some students who will give us the third and last lecture on this mini curse on types and local expression. Okay, thank you. And also, I should maybe say that the next quarter is, as it says, directly after this one. Court is, as it says, directly after this one. So, if there are going to be questions from my talk, then they will wait until after Guy's talk in the coffee break. So, in the last two talks, I've talked about types. And since the Language Correspondence was in the title of the course, today I should say something about the Local Language Correspondence and what it is and some relation with the types. So, the plan is to talk about. The plan is to talk about local languages for GLN mostly, say a bit about local languages more generally, and then depending upon how time goes, talk about things called endo classes, endo parameters, and then also just some other questions. There's kind of a bit of a sort of a I struggle to think about what to include and what not to. So there's a bit of a potpourri of things, and I'm sure there are lots of things that I've not included that I could have included. But anyway, there we are. So Anyway, there we are. So, local angles for DLM. So, first of all, I should start with what the objects in it are. So, we have F, a non-Archimedelian local field, as we've had previously. And so, when we have our F, then we have a separable algebraic closure at the top. F, separable closure. The top F separable closure, and then we have the absolute Galmo group here, which is the Galma group of this extension. So, this is these are indicating Galma groups. Inside this, we have the maximal unramified extension, which is so generated by roots of unity of order prime to p and also the maximal tame extension. So, generated by all finite extensions, which are well, where the p doesn't define the ramification index. And so, we have corresponding Galmo groups here, which are called the inertia group and wild inertia. Okay, now so the the Now, so the absolute Galois group, then, if we look at the kernel by the inertia group, that will give us the Galois group of this extension here, which is just the same as the Galois group. And the only thing that changes is, of course, the residue field. So that's just the Galois group of the extension of these finite residue fields, which is isomorphic to Z hat generated by the topologically generated by the Frobenius map. Okay, so which is just the Okay, so which is just the thing which lifts. So it's so if I think of it in here, it's something which lifts the Frobenius map on this Galma group. And the V group, which is the thing which ends up taking the role, so this is this here, this is the V group, is the pre-image of just the integer powers of Frobenius. Okay, so this is Z inside Z hat. Inside Z hat. Okay, and so it's like that abstractly as a group. It's also a topological group, but the topology is not just the subspace topology from coming from TF. On the inertia group, which is completely in there, so the inertia group, we declare it to be open. And the topology on the inertia group is just the same as the topology that we get here. And so then we see that the big. We see that the Fey group is locally compact with the inertia group as its maximal compact subgroup, as opposed to the Galmoi group, which with its normal topology would be compact, in fact. Okay, so then local class field theory tells us that there is a natural isomorphism of topological groups between the multiplicative group of the field and the abelianization of the Bay group. Okay, so this is the quotient by the closure of the derived subgroup. The closure of the derived subgroup. So, maximum Labelian quotient. And so, dualizing that, we get a bijection between here between continuous characters from F cross to C cross and continuous characters on the V group. Okay, and so of course, continuous characters are the multiplicative group we've seen already. I've talked about those previously. Okay, so. Okay, so then the idea of local angulars for GLN is to is essentially to generalize this. So we think as continuous characters of the v group, that's telling it, we think of that as meaning one-dimensional representations. And so that's part of the rep those are part some of the representations of the vagroup, and then we've got a whole load more that we've not that we've that we've not seen. And so what what should what should those correspond to? So So this is just local class field theory again from the previous page, but now rewritten as on the left-hand side, saying that if I want a character of F-cross, that's the same as a continuous character. First of all, continuous characters are always smooth, so it's a smooth, irreducible, complex representation of GL1. Okay, and on the other side, one-dimensional. One-dimensional continuous complex representations of the vagrant. Okay, so a first approximation to local languages might be that we think that on the left, we should think about irreducible representations of GLN. So these things which we've been looking at already. And on the other side, Here, n-dimensional representations of the vague group. So, continuous and continuous, semi-simple n-dimensional representations of the vague group up to up to so up to equivalent, so up to GLN conjugacy. Okay. And so, what we might also think is, well, on both sides, we've got a nice sort of subset from which we build everything. Subset from which we build everything. Okay, so because on this side these are semi-simple, we're going to build everything from irreducibles just by taking direct sums. So we can think about the irreducible phi's. Okay, and we'll call that phi cusp. And on the other side, we know likewise that by parabolic induction, we can build everything from the cuspidals of smaller GLNs, of Levy subgroups. So we can think about the cuspidals. And so we might hope that these. So we might hope that these correspond to each other. But then we see that we have a bit of a problem because so if we have some some semi here, if we have some semi-simple, some semi-simple representation of the V group, so we can decompose it as a direct sum. That's fine of irreducibles. If we had such a bijection, that would give us some cuspidal irreducible. Some cospital irreducible representations of some GLNIs. So we could take their tensor product, get a cuspidal irreducible of this product of GLNs, which is a levy of GLN. And then, well, what would we do with that? Well, the thing that we know how to do is parabolic induction. But as we know, parabolic induction, while it's parabolic conduction, is sort of generically irreducible, but it's not irreducible obvious. And so somehow Somehow, then when we get up here to the irreducibles, we're going to have a whole bunch of representations, all the subquotients, which somehow should all be corresponding to the same representation on this side. And so you could sort of think of this much as being a sort of a semi-simple Langlands correspondence, which is really just seeing the cuspidal support of a representation. Okay, so that's what it's detecting. That's what it's detecting. So, what you need to do is you need to add something extra on the side of these representations of the V group. And there are different ways to do that. But so this is the way that I decided to write it down because it matches with, well, what I know and other ways that things are written down. So what do we change now on this right-hand side? Rather than just having representations of the Just having representations of the V group, we have things from the Veg group times SL2C, which is what was called in previous talks the simple version of the Vaderlene group. Was that right? I think so. But so the simple Vada-thene group. And so, what conditions should we want on these? Well, still, if I restrict to Still, if I restrict to the V group, this should be semi-simple. And if I restrict to SL2C, this should be algebraic. Okay, so algebraic representations of SL2C, there's just one in each dimension. And so such a phi here on this side is going to be called a Langlands parameter. And so what the Langlands local Langlands corresponds to. What the Langlands local Langlands correspondent says for DLN. So, this was proved by Loman, Hop, and Stule when F is has a positive characteristic by Harris Taylor, and then separately about the same time by Enier when F is characteristic zero, says that there is a bijection, or rather, there are bijections that between the set of irreducible representations of GLN and these parameters, these Language. These parameters, these Langlands parameters for GLN, which are natural in some sense. Okay, so they satisfy some long list of properties. I've written down, I guess I've written them down here for GLN. When I talk about other groups, I'm not going to write them down at all. But so here are some of the properties that they should satisfy. So, for example, on the GLN side, by Shaw's lemma, every irreducible representation has a central character, and the central character should correspond to Character should correspond to the determinant of the parameter, I guess the parameter restricted to the V group, under the local class field theory. So this is a one-dimensional representation. This is sorry, this is a character of F cross. This is a one-dimensional representation of the vagrant. Also, twisting, so this should be compatible with twisting by characters. So if I identify the characters. So, if I identify the characters of F cross under the V group, then you get compatibility with twisting. It should be compatible with contragradients, so you have contragrans on both sides. And finally, since the ones which are kind of really most important are that L functions and epsilon factors should match up. Okay, so for whatever definition of L function and epsilon factors, it makes sense on both sides. Okay. So one thing to point out is that this is here pi is some irreducible representation of some GLN and pi prime is an irreducible representation of some gln prime. So this is not one bijection. This is a family of bijections, one for each n. Okay, and you have to say it like that for And you have to say it like that for this last condition to make sense. And that's where the naturality is. Okay, so inside, so inside here we have, so I've already mentioned, so we have the cuspidal representations, and the cuspidal representations really do correspond to these. Correspond to these things which I call phi cuss, so irreducible parameters of so this is uh things which are where the SL2C, there's no SL2C action, so the representation of SL2C is trivial, and so it's something which and something which is just irreducible as a representation of the Vey group. And in between, we also have discrete series representations, so, or maybe essentially square integrable. Or maybe essentially square integrable, I should probably say. But so these are sort of generalized, so-called generalized Steinberg representations. And these correspond to things on the other side, which are, if you like, if you like, they're sort of irreducible as representations of the Vay-Deleme group. So, in other words, you can write them as, oh, I should have written this with phi zero irreducible. With phi zero irreducible. So phi zero is some representation of the V group, and S T A, this is the A dimensional, the A dimensional irreducible representation of S L 2C. Okay, and of course, any parameter can be written as a, can be decomposed into a direct sum of these ones, of these and decomposable ones. And so now And so now this bijection is in fact compatible with parabolic induction. You have to do this with normalized parabolic induction, which I didn't do in my previous talks. I didn't normalize parabolic induction, but I did mention it. So in other words, if you have a cuspidal support, and so you have pi in some parabolically induced, then if I just look at the restriction of my The restriction of my parameter to the vagroup, then that is just the you just it's just the sum of the parameters that we had. So it's sort of compatible with what I sort of loosely called a semi-simple Langless correspondence. And in fact, that was how it was proved. So the on the to going from cuspitals to irreducibles, we have the Bernstein-Zelovinsky classification. And so it was by matching that to what happens on the By matching that to what happens on the other side, was in fact how you can reduce to the case of cuspit. So, to prove it, you reduce to the to the to needing to prove bijections between the cuspitals, and then you prove that. Okay, so right, so I was gonna mention uh say some other things, so so going to sort of towards types. Towards types. So one thing you can start to do is you can start to ask questions about your representations and your parameters and how they match together according to sort of invariance of those things. So one of those is depth. So for example, we saw examples of depth zero hospitals, but more generally, you have depth zero. You have depth zero irreducibles of GLN. So, what are those? Those are irreducible representations which have a non-zero invariance under the propyradical of a maximal parahoric subgroup. On the other side, you can think about parameters whose restriction to wild inertia. So, remember, this is the wild inertia group. wild inertia group is trivial. Okay, so these are would normally be called tame parameters. And well so these do in fact correspond to each other in terms under under the local angles. So we get sort of some of the information about the representation theoretic information on this side. Information on this side corresponds to things on the other side. And more generally, the depth. So these were depth zero, but in fact, you can talk about depth for any, more generally, and that's preserved by the local language correspondence. So what are the depths? Okay, so I don't think I defined the depth for irreducible representations, so I thought I should write it down. I've mentioned it, but I didn't define it. It down. I've mentioned it, but I didn't define it. So, essentially, you look at all, if you have some representation, you look at when does it have invariance under... So this here, these were the filtration subgroups of a parahoric. And you look over all the parahorics and you look to see what's the biggest filtration subgroup. What's the biggest filtration subgroup on which I have non-zero invariance? Okay, and so some filtration, some R plus filtration group. And you look over at all of those and you take the least such R for which there is the P, and that's the depth. And that, I mean, I've written, yeah, actually, no, that's fine. So, and it's not. So it's not as horrible as it looks. I mean, these live in some, for a given GLN, these live in some discrete set of rational numbers. So they live in the rational sense and then a discrete set of rational numbers with denominator bounded by n. Okay, on the other side, okay, so there is also a filtration of the V group. So it has a filtration, so where the first step is the inertia group, the zero plus step is the. Zero plus step is the wild inertia group, and then you have filtration subgroups below as well. And you can ask, do the same thing, except now it's a bit easier. You've only got one group to worry about. You're asking when is the parameter trivial. So this is generalizing what happened up here. Okay, so then that's the depth on this side. And the depth is in fact preserved by the local anglers correspondence for GLM. GLM. For GLM. It's not always true. Oops. So somehow these tame things, like I said, talking about when the restriction to wild inertia is trivial, but possibly we can say more. Oh, I forgot I was going to talk about restriction to the inertia group first. The inertia group for first. Okay, so we can also just think about the restriction to the inertia group and how does that match with the representation theory side. So with the automorphic side. So let's just look at cospitals. Okay. So we have, this is the local England correspondence for GLN. Okay, so if I take two parameters and I restrict them now to the inertia group, so these are these are now just These are now just from WF to GLNC, and they're irreducible. Okay. So when do two parameters have the same restriction to inertia? Well, in fact, just when they're unramified twists of each other. So it's detecting the Bernstein block of pi. So the restriction to the inertia group is exactly detecting the Bernstein. Group is exactly detecting the Bernstein component of pi. And in fact, you can then use the theory of types. So Pascuna's proved that if you take the restriction of some Langlands parameter, or if you prefer, you can think of this as a representation of the inertia group which extends to an irreducible representation. Which extends to an irreducible representation of the V group. Well, then there's a unique irreducible representation of GLNO. Okay, and there's a really GLNO, which detects when the parameter corresponding to some representation has the correct restriction to inertia. To inertia. Okay. And so in some ways, some ways, so you could, if we hadn't, if we hadn't wanted to restrict to this to K, then we kind of already had that in some senses because we know that there is a type for the representation. We know that there's a type for pi, but the thing is, the type is not usually defined on GLNO. Not usually defined on GLNO. It's defined on some weird group. So there was work to do here. Right. Okay. So then, I say, so what you can also do is you can restrict to wild inertia. And I'm going to be a little bit vague here and then a little bit more precise later, time permitting. Okay, so if you take some, again, irreducible parameter. Parameter, and you restrict it now to wild inertia by, I don't know, Clifford theory, I guess. That what you see that what you get is just a multiple of an orbit of irreducible representations. Okay, so as you have some irreducible representation of the wild inertia, WF acts on those irreducible representations, you take the sum of the representations in an orbit, and then with some multiplicity. In an orbit, and then with some multiplicity. Okay. And so, in that case, what you can do is you can think about this map, which this map here, which is the restriction map from a cuspidal representation to the orbit which you get. Okay, so this is some orbit, some orbit here. And so, the question is: can you see, can you detect what that orbit is by looking on the side of representations of GI? The side of representations of GLF. And so it turns out that the answer is yes. And there are these things called endoclasses which do this. And somehow, so one thing to notice is that this line is here is independent of n. So it doesn't depend on the n. So for every n, we can make this map commute. So this is supposed to be a commuting. map commute so this is supposed to be a commuting map um or you could also do it rather than just doing it for cospitals um you could uh look again at so just restricting to wild inertia parameters so what what what what do i then have so uh this should probably say that that's okay so so this is this would be uh uh uh representations of the Representations of the wild inertia which extend to a representation of the V group, okay, as the parameters down here. And again, you can ask: is there something? So now this is specific to n, because it depends on n. Can is there something here, which the down here, which makes this diagram commute? And again, it turns out that the answer is going to be yes. And essentially, it follows more or less formally from once you have it for the cosmetics. So later on, I will come back. So later on, I will come back to that. But I guess what I just want to say is that in order to do this, you need the very precise information about cosmetal representations and how they're constructed, which you get from types. Okay, so another thing you can do is you can, when you, now we know that there is a local language correspondence for GLN, you can try to. Correspondence for GLN, you can try to make it explicit. Okay, because particularly on the side of the caspital representations of GLN, we have explicit constructions of them all. So let me just mention the essentially tame case due to Bushel and Enia. So first of all, what does the word essentially tame mean? So if we have some, so this is, remember, this is some irreducible end-dimensional. Remember, this is some irreducible n-dimensional representation of the V group. Would say it's essentially tame if the restriction to wild inertia is a sum of characters. So on this previous slide, it's saying that the orbit that you get here is going to be an orbit of one-dimensional things, so an orbit of characters. So this generalizes, obviously, the tame case, which is when that restriction is just trivial. It's a somewhat trivial representation. Those are somewhat trivial representations. Okay, so on the other side, so that's for the parameters. For cuspidal representations, you can say that they're essentially tame. Well, one way to say it is if the data that's involved in its construction is tame. So I gave an example of yesterday of something of positive depth, and there was a field extension in there. And you just want that field extension to be tame. But you can also see it more intrinsically. See it more intrinsically. So if you look at, so this number t of pi is called the torsion number, okay, and it's the number of unramified characters which leave the representation fixed when you twist by them. And being essentially tame is saying that p does not divide n over the torsion number. So this torsion number is also related to the ramification index of the field that you. index of the field that you that appears in the construction that's why you can you can do this so for example when p doesn't divide n everything's essentially 10 okay because clearly this this condition is satisfied and so in a series of papers bushman and illier actually do make the correspondence explicit for these essentially tame representations and parameters okay so that was everything i was considered Okay, so that was everything I was going to say about GLN for now. So let me set talk, but now about local angles more generally. Okay, so this has already been mentioned, obviously, in other talks, but I will try to say, well, I will still say things. So we take now some arbitrary G. Okay, so this has a complex dual group, first of all, G hat. Okay, so how does that work? Well, you take the How does that work? Well, you take the base root datum for the algebraic group G and you swap the roots and the co-roots. Okay, and then you make it into a complex group. And so here is the usual table that people write when they don't want to actually write down the definition. And they just say, here's a list of examples. And here's the usual list of examples. So dual of GLN is GLN, the dual of SLN is PGLN. The dual of a symplectic group is an orthogonal group. Of a symplectic group is an orthogonal group of one dimension higher. The dual of an even orthogonal group is just the even orthogonal group. And similarly, you can swap the two lines here as well, as long as you also swap F to C. Okay, so because you get an action of the V group on this side. On this side. So then you can see that as an action on the base root datum, and then you can transfer that into an action onto the complex dual group. And so this is how you then form the L group, okay, which is this semi-direct product. It's a for when the groups are split. So actually, in all the examples that I've written above, this is actually just a direct product. Product. And then, what's a parameter going to be, or a Langless parameter? It's going to be, so rather similar to what we had before, so a continuous map from this Vadylene group, so the Vad group times SL2C, to this L group. Which so now the one thing that we have extra is that when we when we for GLN, we didn't we didn't have this this v group on the end. Um so what you could do what we could have done was we could have put it there for GLN that split this is just going to be a direct product and basically we just so to extend it if we had an element of the v group here we could just map it to itself there as well and that's what that's what we want to happen in general so this is what the first condition says Is what the first condition says is that if I, another way of interpreting this first condition is that if I then I have to have a map to, well, okay, I have all rights. That on the on the vague group part, it's just doing nothing. Okay, so five w is in g is in the coset of the element w. So it's in g hat w. This is the semi-simplicity condition which we had. So when Condition, which we had. So when we restrict to the V group, it's semi-simple. And now on SL2C, well, it's that basically again, the same condition. So this is a homomorphism complex algebraic groups to this complex dual group. Okay, so these are parameters for the L group. And the thing is that lots of different groups can have. So any two inner forms of each other will have the same L group. Okay, so and Group. Okay, so at the moment, there's nothing which specifies the group itself. And so then when I want to get some parameters for the group G, you need an extra condition which I'm not going to say anything at all about. So this is called relevance. So you need to look at the parameters which have this extra relevance condition for G. And you look at these other. G and you look at these up to G hat conjugacy. Okay, so and then what we expect then is a subjective map from irreducible representations of G to these parameters for G, which should have finite fibers. The fibers are called L packets. Called L packets and satisfying, so as I said, various naturality conditions. So I'm not, like I said, there's a long list of conditions we'd like it to satisfy. I'm not going to write any of them down. So one thing to be aware of is that, so in the GLN case, there was this nice thing that we were able to say, oh, we can just look at, we can use parabolic induction and person Zelavinsky and so on to reduce to the case of cuspids. And I've And unfortunately, that doesn't work anymore because it turns out that you can get packets which contain both cuspital and non-cuspital representations. Okay, so cuspital is some of the wrong note is the wrong notion here. There were also between the cuspals and the irreducibles, there were discrete series representations for GLN, and those are really the things that you can reduce to. So you can reduce to discrete series representations, and those should correspond to corresponds to uh to so you can you can say on the on the side of the parameters exactly which which uh which uh things those should correspond to discrete parameters um if you want to get more so for gln this is the i mean this so this is still not as good as for gln right so this is a surjective map but it's not it's not bijection okay so if we want to get a bijection then you need to parameterize Then you need to parameterize the representations in the L packets. And so you need more. And so, again, I'm not going to say what they are, but you need some enhanced parameters where you get a parameter in the same way, but you also have some extra information. And it's an irreducible representation of some finite group. It's some irreducible representation of some finite group, which depends on the parameter. It's kind of complicated because I think if the Because I think if the, depending on whether you assume the group is, I've not assumed the group is quasi-split, even. So if the group's not, if you, if, so, as I understand it, it's somehow which irreducible representation you take tells you which inner form you should be looking at. So it's not just that you could take all irreducible representations of this S. Irreducible representations of this S. It's only certain ones which will be somehow relevant for G, for the group G. Okay, so I guess so the big result that Arthur proved is that there is such a local Langlands correspondence for symplectic and special orthogonal groups. And I guess mock for mock for quasi-split unitary groups. For quasi-split unitary groups. I confess I don't know. Okay, so we're expecting various naturality conditions and lots of, I don't know, different people seem to write down different naturality conditions and check some. And so lots of people have written down sort of potential Langlands correspondences of various sorts and maybe check different conditions. And so I don't actually know whether. And so I don't actually know whether Arthur's Lungless correspondence is known to satisfy all the conditions that we could possibly want it to. I don't know that. Maybe somebody else does. Right. I should also just mention that semi-simple local lines correspondence. So if you remember for GLN, you could do this thing where you forget the SL2C part. You forget the SL2C part and you just think about the, you just look at representations of the V group. Okay, and this is somehow just giving you the cuspital support. Well, so this is what Falg and Schulzer do. So they give a map to these semi-simple Langlands parameters. Langlands parameters, so where there's no SL2C here, which has the expected properties, and they do this for an arbitrary group G. And so if there were really a, well, once there is, I'll be optimistic, once there is a Langelist correspondence, then this is how we should expect it to be related to this semi-simple correspondence. So this here is then an element of S alt2C. Element of SL2C. And so we would expect the semi-simple correspondence to be related to the Langlands correspondence like this. So the Langlands correspondence is somehow enhancing this, this semi-simple correspondence. And then if you want to parameterize the L packets, you have to enhance it again. Okay, so there's kind of two steps there. Okay, so how am I doing? Okay, so that was kind of everything I was going to say about. That was kind of everything I was going to say about. Oh, no, no, I forgot. No, I was also going to say that. So there's also recent work, well, over a number of years, but especially recently of Ober Mussa and Solervelt. So for, well, so classical groups in this sense here. Oops. So So suppose we take some inertial cospital support. Okay, so this is in the Bernstein spectrum. So this is some inertial cospital support. So this gives us a block of the representations. And also, we know that it's equivalent to modules over some Hecker algebra. So this is the Hecker algebra. This is the Hecker algebra given in the way that I described briefly, but not very much so, sort of Bernstein, Hyman, and Solerfeld. So what a number of years ago, well, Sam and Solovelt did was that they defined actually for an arbitrary G, the cuspidal support of an enhanced Langlands parameter. Parameter. Okay, so there's some definition of cuspital support on the side of the enhanced Langlands parameter. And so then you can partition these enhanced Langlands parameters according to this cuspidal support. And you can call those Bernstein components. So S-Chatch here is a cospital support. That's what this is. And what they also do is they build. What they also do is they build for each such Bernstein component, they build a Hecker algebra. Here, Z is an indeterminate, and a bijection between the Bernstein component, so the elements of the Bernstein component, and the irreducible modules over this hacker algebra. Hecker algebra. So the q to the half here, I put q to the half because it's going to need it on the next side, but actually, you just need it to be bigger than one. It doesn't actually matter what it is. And then what they can do is if you match the cusp, essentially, if you match the cuspital support using the work of Arthur and Mergland, so this is just the cuspital case, really, then that what they can prove is that actually the Hecker algebra. Prove is that actually the hecker algebras that you find on the two sides are well, so one is equivalent to the opposite of the other, okay. When so here you really do need the q to the half, okay, okay. And then you can use this to build a local Langless correspondence, which from the irreducible representations to the extended, so this E, I should have said what this E was. Should have said what this E, what's the so this means extended, sorry, enhanced enhanced parameters and so they can build an L local Anglus correspondence essentially so using Arthur Mugla only for the cospitals, and then they can build it from that. Build it from that. You'll notice that this one is not a bijection at the moment. Not always, it's not, they don't know, although they expect it to be, but it's an injection. Essentially, the reason is that they, at the moment, you don't know while, so I said that you match these things together. Well, they don't know that you get all the possible cosmetal supports on this side. That's what they don't know yet. On this side, that's what they don't know yet in general. Okay, okay, so that is now it for what I was going to say about LRC for other groups. So I wanted to talk briefly, so some of this is going to get more technical, but about these things that I talked about. So when you restrict a wild inertia for GLN, what are these objects which are supposed to correspond to restrictions to wild inertia? Inertia. So, when you're constructing the cuspidal representations of GLN, so it involves these things called simple characters, theta. So, again, in the example I did yesterday, that was yesterday, there was this thing called a theta at some point, which you may or may not remember. And that was a thing called a simple character. Okay, so how do you get these things? Okay, so you have some data. So, you have some extension of some degree. Extension of some degree, some field extension, which you can just think of as an abstract field extension. Then you have some embedding. So the way I wrote it yesterday was I actually wrote beta actually as a four by four matrix, but what you could have done instead is just sort of beta abstractly and then embedded, embedded the field. Okay, so some embedding and V here is, so I'm thinking of GLN as the automorphisms of V. Okay, so this obviously puts some constraints. So the D, for this to be possible, D has to divide N. D has to divide n. Okay, and then the last bit of data is: well, there are different ways to say it. It's some point in the Bruhartitz building. Okay, so it's something which is going to be giving you these filtrations. You can think of these as lattice functions. So, functions from the reels to lattices in the space V, or whatever. But so, it's the building of, so this here is the centralizer. So this here is the centralizer in G of the image. And this building embeds into the building of GLM. Okay. And using that, so Bushmal and Kutzko defined some set of things, which they call simple characters on some pro-P subgroup, which they called H0 plus. And this Pro-P subgroup is defined so kind of that. So kind of it that again, the example that I showed showed yesterday kind of shows the kind of the one step, the one's the one step example where you have some parahoric filtration subgroup, and then you have a parahoric bit that's in the centralizer that you add. And you kind of, in general, you have to do that in steps. But in any case, they define these things. And so here's some, here was a remarkable fact. Well, is Is oh, except this was the I forgot something. Okay. So, what they proved is that there are some canonical bijections between these simple characters and what I should have done. And so this is So, how do these work? Well, sometimes these, so at the moment, V was not supposed to be, we should think of V as not being fixed. But when they have the same target, you can see exactly how these things correspond. When do these simple characters correspond? They correspond essentially when they. They correspond essentially when they match on their intersection. But the phi prime here doesn't actually need to have the same target as phi, and yet there's still a natural bijection. So you get bijections between simple characters living on different GLNs. So there is one problem, which is that unfortunately, the simple character in general doesn't determine the data that defines it. Okay, and so the but the byte these transfer bijections do depend on that data, but um you can get around that. So this is Bush and any other. So suppose you have two simple characters now, but now with potentially different different data. So different x and x prime and different beta and beta prime. Okay, so you say that these things are You say that these things are endo-equivalent, and it's called endo-equivalent, and it does, but it doesn't look like an equivalence relation when it's stated like this. If you can find embeddings of the two fields here into a common space, and you can find points for these two such that you Such that, so now on the previous slide, I can transfer theta to something, to something, for something here, and I can likewise transfer theta prime to a simple character here. But these are now both in the same GLNF. So these are both living in the same GLNF. Both living in the same TLNF. And so you can ask whether or not they intertwine. And so, what's remarkable is that actually it turns out that this is an equivalence relation, because it doesn't look like it. It's just asking for one way of transferring them so that they intertwine. But in fact, it turns out that this is an equivalence relation, because if there is one realization where they intertwine, then whenever you transfer them to a common space, they always intertwine. Okay, so if there exists, then. Okay, so it's if there exists, then it's true always, and in fact, if you uh transfer them not only to a common space but to the same point in the building, so we've we've kind of got two buildings because we've got two centralizers, but remember those embed into the big building. So I mean, building here. Then if we're on the same point, then they're actually conjugate. So even more. And so what's an endo class? So an endo class is an equivalence class for this relation. So it's an endo equivalence class. Relation. So it's an endo equivalence class of simple characters. And so if we write E of F for the set of endoclasses. And if you have an endoclass, then it has various invariants. So if you have an endoclass, you have, for example, the degree of the extension of any simple character for that class will be the same. And in fact, the ramification index and the residue class degree also. And so what does the ramification theorem of Bushland say? Theorem of Bushland, I'll say. So it says that the thing that should go here to make this map commute was exactly the set of endoclasses. And how do I get from a cuspidal representation of GLN to an endoclass? Well, in the construction of pi, there is a step where you have to construct a simple character. Okay, along the way, you construct a simple character and you just take construct a simple character, and you just take the class of that simple character. So you take the class, the class of the simple character in the construction of pi. And so this is what they prove. You can also do the same thing. So as I said, more generally, you could just think about all irreducible representations and the restriction on this side. Well, then what you do is essentially, like I said, Then, what you do is essentially, like I say, you sort of take form, you can sort of think of this as taking formal sums of endo classes. So, you can define what I call the degree n endo parameters, which is where you take the you take, if you like, you take a multi-set of endo classes, which satisfy a certain degree condition, where this D here is the degree that I had on the previous slide, the degree of the endo class. And like that, you can. And like that, you can find the thing which fits down here. What's this map now? Okay, so there are two ways you can do it. You can either take the cuspital support of your irreducible representation, then once you've got the cospital support, then we know that we can associate to each piece of those, we can associate an endog class, and then you just have to take it with the right multiplicity, which is determined by the size of the block, the size of the TLA. Okay, or you can generalize the theory of simple characters that. Generalize the theory of simple characters that Bushnal-Kutzka did, and to allow your element beta to generate a sum of fields rather than just a single field, so to be semi-simple. And then you can see that every irreducible representation contains some semi-simple character. And you can define, and in effect, well, it turns out that these endo parameters are exactly the intertwining classes of these semi-simple characters. So, again, there's a remarkable. Simple characters. So, again, there's a remarkable thing that for semi-simple characters, intertwining is an equivalence relation, which seems strange. So it shows they're very rigid. Right. Ah, yeah. And so why else might you want to think about these endo parameters? Well, it turns out that so you can use this to get a category decompositions. Get a category decompositions of the category where, so you'll notice I have now suddenly changed my complex numbers to my C. Okay, so at the level of these simple characters, these are all pro-P groups. Makes no difference what the field is as long as it's not a characteristic P. And so you can get a decomposition of the category according to these endo parameters, and you write down And you write down a pro generator for each of these for each of these blocks. So, this is essentially, I mean, this follows from, because for GLN, we have a block decomposition. So, for even in this situation, due to Vinyas, this follows from that, right? So we're just sticking blocks together. But it turns out that the reason for doing this is because you can generalize this to other groups. So maybe a couple of comments is that. So, maybe a couple of comments is that first of all, this refines. So, what there is also is there's a depth decomposition. So, this is depth R representations, which actually this decomposition into depth R representations exists for any group. That's due to Vignars. So, these into the category by depth, this exists for any group. You actually don't need. You actually don't need C to be a field. A commutative Z bar one over P algebra would do. And this generalizes to classical groups when P is not two. And you can define endo parameters likewise. And what we expect is that these endo parameters correspond to actually enhanced while parameters. So for a while parameter, you would find some sort of component group. You would find some sort of component group like these S5s, and some irreducible one. This is, I mean, this is a simple case where it'll just be a product of cyclic cruise order two. It'll be, so it's not going to be a very complicated group, but still, we expect that this is what we expect. Okay, so I've got five minutes left and I have to finish on time. So, very briefly, other questions? And like I say, there are lots of things which I haven't written in this, but I will then go through them quickly. So, what things might we want? Um, what things might we want to do? Well, we might want to make the local ironous correspondence explicit more generally. Okay, so um, we've got, in particular, on the side of representations of p-adic groups, we've got constructions of, well, all cospitals in lots of cases, for example. And can we use that to make local language correspondence explicit? So, there are various results. So, I've just mentioned here the debt zero case due to debacle. The debt zero case due to debacle and reader with some constraints on the group G. There's also the tame case due to Kaleta, and but in all of these, again, they could have sort of, this is what I'm saying, is they check some conditions that you'd expect a local language correspondence to have, but maybe not all of them, or maybe not the same ones as other people have done. And so that's one thing that you could ask about. You could also ask questions about transfer. So if you have Transfer. So if you have a suitable map of L groups, so I've just done this from the L group of some group H to G L N, just to make this easier. So if we just do this at the level of parameters, so we have a map, well, we expect the local correspondence to give us a map from irreducible representations of H to parameters for H. But now we could compose a parameter for H, which has image in the. image in in in in the the L group with the with this with this map which then gives us a parameter for GLN okay that was supposed to say gln um and then the local language correspondence in here is now a bijection so I can take it back to an irreducible representation of TLM and so the the map that we would get get by going around here to make this commute this is um This commute, this is the transfer map. Can you make that explicit as well? Or to what extent can you make that explicit? And maybe, so, for example, what you can do is think about the restriction to wild inertia of these things. Oh, I should also have said, in this first one, explicit local language. We'll also hear something about that in the next talk. So, other things that you could think about is, so what Could think about is um so what that there are these these things which are called endo parameters, what should they be for an arbitrary group G? So I just discovered while I was here that somebody's thinking about this already, so nobody else think about it. But still, what are there such things which should so what they should do is that they should they should reflect restriction to wild inertia on the one hand, they should behave functorially in the group, hopefully. group hopefully so uh the this is actually does is what happens so between uh sort of between gln and and classical groups for example um and hopefully also give a decomposition to the category um moreover what would be nice would be if and what happens quite often at least is that that uh can we uh find a way to uh see the bit of the category that they cut out as the depth zero As the depth zero subcategory for some other group. Okay. And so due to results of Genello, this is true for inner forms of GLNF. And this is essentially by taking the Hecker algebra that's associated on this side, which is coming from the pro generator that I showed you, and checking that Hecker algebra is isomorphic to the Hecker algebra on this side. What you might What you might want to do even further is say is to take not only sort of reduce to some depth zero piece, but even reduce even further to something unipotent. Okay, so can you for a block? Okay, so this is I've done complex representations, can I find an isomorphism between the block corresponding to some cospital support and a block? Some cospital support and a block for some other group with some unipotent cospital support. And then you could also think about other correspondences. So there's Jacques Langland's correspondence, which gives a bijection between essentially square interval irreducible representations of GLNF and then in a form. So can you give an explicit correspondence of explicit description of that? So dotto um so dotto uh does this at the sort of at the inertial level so in other words the uh at um at the blessy at the at the level of of of bunstein components in particular uh there's a you can see uh endoclasses on both sides and it does preserve the endoclasses also so something which i which i didn't say write down but maybe should have done is you can think about local angles correspondence mod l or or um or integral even better Or integral, even better, or in families. And there are, you know, there's work of starting with Vinohas, and then, I guess, recently, sort of Dathelm Kurinchuk and Moss, for example, but for other groups, you can think about. So here for Jacques Langlands, you can think about compatibility with model congruences. So this was done by Mangus Cecer. Actually, interestingly, that was actually an ingredient in that, in this bit. That in this bit. So, reduction mod L turned out to be ingredient in this explicit description, even though that's a complex question. And then you can do the same thing for the theta correspondence. Ask about explicit descriptions or compatibility. Okay, I need to stop now because I've already 15 seconds over. So, all right, thank you. What's good? So now we need to use the mastery of the thing for the second lecture. And as I already mentioned, sorry, if you have any questions, you can ask them during the context.
