For the introduction. Okay, let me start the screen share. And I hope you can see my slides. Yeah, perfect. We can see your slides now. Okay, perfect. Yeah. So, okay. Um Okay, so today I would like to share a case study that my collaborator and I did during the COVID period. We utilized a statistical method to study some of the important behavior of this ACE2 protein. So hopefully you will enjoy the next 25 minutes of the story. First, I want to say this is a joint work with Xiaoyu, who is an assistant professor. Our assistant professor at Mount Sinai, and Jay is our master level statistician working with us. So, I will give some background information about this ACE2 protein and the motivation problem first. So, I know that probably everybody now survived from this past pandemic, but I guess during the past three years, maybe you guys heard. Past three years, maybe you guys heard about this ACE2 protein, which is the key receptor protein on human cell surface that used by the COVID virus, the CESS coronavirus tube, to enter the human cell and then doing damage. And this protein is super important because the affinity binding strands like between the virus. These strands, like between the virus and ACE2, basically determine how contagious the virus could be. So, compare like the latest COVID virus stream, like Omicron Delta, the binding affinity is probably tenfold compared to the earlier COVID streams, and then another tenfold compared to the first generation cess virus that happened, that caused the pandemic. That happened that caused the pandemic in 2003. So, this protein plays a very critical role on how the virus may impact the human body. And at the same time, it also plays an important role in the defense mechanism. So there is extremely high interest to understand what are the other pathways this protein are participating or interacting with, such that those genes and the pathways. Those genes and pathways regulating ACE2 receptors can help us to better understand what are the other functions that facilitate this viral cell entry and the replication. And also, to understand what are the genes and the pathways that are regulated by the ACE2 receptors, we will understand what are the biological functions of the human cell that has been perturbed by the virus. Been perturbed by the virus. Okay, so this is a great interest, and therefore, like shortly after the pandemic happened, so there's a team, Ziegler and the co-authors did a very nice study. They used the single-cell RNA-seq data from the human cell atlas and trying to understand or characterize what are the pathways is really associated. What are the pathways really associated with the ACE2 gene expression level, specifically in the airway epithelial cells? So, that actually is the cell type where it's first of all, ACE2 has a high expression level under a cell surface and was attacked mostly by the virus. And this study caught a lot of attention because it identified this interferal pathway. This interference pathway. So, there's a group of pathways called interference to be their pathways showing the most significant association with ACE2 gene expression level. So why this is important? Because at that time, interference actually has been used as a drug strategy to treat COVID patients. So, just for your background information, so interference is a group of So, interference is a group of proteins that help the human body immune system. So, it basically boosts up the immune activities in the human body. And those related drugs has been used to treat many other virus infection. So, in the beginning of the pandemic, very quickly, many clinical trials have been launched to using the interferon-related drugs to. Using the interferon-related drugs to treat COVID patients. And therefore, this new finding that this interferomet pathway actually is associated with AC2 expression becomes very alarming in the sense that usually we are thinking this path that the interference is boosting up the host immune system. So it will suppress the virus activity, right? But if this interference is also If this interference is also elevating the ACE2 expression levels in the cell, that could motivate and promote how the virus would invade human cells and actually will help the virus spreading in the human body. So, this funding then put a big question mark on a large number of clinical trials that was ongoing at that time. Time. But this study also has some pitfalls. First of all, the whole study is based on kind of cell line experiment. And we know in many cases, the cell line system does not truthfully reflect human tissue. And especially, urally cell line experiment is very limited to understand immune reaction-related biological functions. And a second limitation. um and a second limitation in the study is that the protein abundance of uh so the the study is mainly using rna seq um expression data and it has a very pilot uh experiment that measuring the ace2 protein abundances but then they didn't observe the similar association in the cell line experiment um so therefore it's not really that convincing It's not really that convincing whether the interferon gamma or beta or alpha pathways is really stimulating the protein activity of ACE2, right? But the protein activity of ACE2 is what really matters in the cell, controls all kinds of function. So, therefore, there is a great interest to hopefully to understand this problem better that Problem better that whether in the epiciliar cells their interferon pathway would impact the protein activity of ACE2 in the human tissue system. So that is kind of the goal. And another piece of information why we want to study protein directly is that we have already come to realize for many genes, there are a expression level. Their RNA expression level and protein abundances is not tightly correlated. So, there is a lot of like post-translational regulation or modifications such that the read of the expression level alone does not tell us the real activity of those molecules in the downstream pathways. So, this figure is illustrated how the RNA expression level of AC2 compared to the protein abundance. To the protein abundance level of ACE2 in long tissues from a long cancer study. So, apparently, the correlation is very low and not significant at all. So, this is why we think we really need protein data to understand this question. So, then the goal is like if we can ideally have kind of single-cell data of Cell data of the epithelial cell from the human lung tissue, then we will be able to really answer this question very accurately, right? Whether AC2 and IF interferon pathways are interacting with each other in their epithelial cells in this human tissue microenvironment. But of course, we know that the proteomics profiling technology is not the Technology is not at the one-state enough such that we can measure protein profiles in a genome-wide manner at single-cell level. Instead, we do have bulk-level proteomics data generated in a very recent cancer study. And in that cancer study, the samples were collected, like the tumor samples, as well as normal adjacent tumor samples. The tumor samples. So it's basically those adjacent normal tissue can serve as a surrogate of normal lung tissue to be used to study how the protein activities could be in those cells. However, the limitation is this is a bulk data, right? So the measurement of the protein abundances is a mixture of epithelial cells and immune cells, stroma cells, in their microenvironment. Stroma cell in the microenvironment. Then the question is: how can we use the spark data, which is the protein profiling from the lung tissue, to answer the question whether we can know ACE2 protein abundances is associated with other pathways or other protein activities? Okay, so now this becomes a statistical question that we hope that you see statistical. We hope that using statistical tools we can answer. So, for some type-specific analysis based on bulk data, that has been caught a lot of attention in the past decade and a lot of method has been developed to address this issue. Specifically, those deconvolution methods, which is using their bulk data profiles, omics profiles to estimate the cell type composition, has been developed. Has been developed, and there are multiple tools available. And some of those tools can even estimate their mean cell type-specific expression levels. And also there has been effort to really to develop tools to estimate their cell type-specific expression level in individual sample. Of course, that is a very challenging task. And another group of methods. And another group of method is trying to incorporate the cell type heterogeneity to facilitate some of the association analysis, which is more similar to the question that we want to solve here. Like using, including the cell type composition as a coval rate in the regression as a way to adjust it to the confounding, or test the interactive effect between cell type proportion. Effect between cell type proportion and the predictors, or using some hierarchical mixture model. However, when we look into this problem, at that time, we have some new challenges in the data. So the first challenge is that both the predictor and the response, like if we treat ACD2 as the response variable and other protein abundances as the predictor variable, then both response and predictors. Both response and predictors are actually impacted by the cell type composition. And the existing association analysis work cannot handle such a situation. And also the cell type composition estimate, as we all know, is always a guess, and there are noises and variations in that estimation. So we hope to also account for that uncertainty probably such that we can. Properly, such that we can better characterize the association. With those motivations, we developed a new method. We call it IPROMIX. So it's a joint mixture model to study cell type-specific dependence between molecules based on the bulk data. So, the key idea is that we certainly will decompose using a mixture model to decompose the observed bulk protein abundance. Bulk protein abundances, and then to model the cell type-specific dependent structure using the mixture model. And we also utilized some non-parametric hypothesis testing strategies. Okay, so I will now using some time to explain this model in more detail. Some notations that I want to introduce first. We have those XIYI, which is the observed tissue level program. Observed tissue level protein abundance. So that is measured at bulk level. And then we are interested in the information coming from the epithelial cell. So we denoted that as U, and we say those XUI and YUI are actually unobserved protein abundance of, for example, ACU2 and another protein in episode cell. And also, we know in the tissue, there. And also, we know in the tissue there are non-hypothesiliar cells such as stroma immune and other cell types, fibroblast other cell types. So, we say, okay, the protein abundance of AC2 and other proteins in the other cell types are annotated with this XV and YV. And we also have other COVID rate of the patient, like age, smoking status, and tumor stage, and so. The tumor stage and so on. We're using this pi i to denote the percentage of epithelial cells in each sample. And then at the end of the day, we can wrote this mixture model, which is kind of intuitive. That is the typical model people used for order deconvolution analysis. That the observed data is a linear combination of the protein abundances in different cell types. And we have this. And we have this weighted by this pi, which is the percentage of the cell type estimated to in the tissue. So what we are interested actually is the covariance of the mu I and the Vi, which is representing the protein abundance in the epithelial cell and in other cell types. So we are interested in the covariance structure in the epithelial cell. And we are modeling. And we are modeling the mean vector to depend on the other covalent rate. And the covalent, the variant structure, as we outlined here, that it can take different value in the epsilon cell versus the other cell type. And a parameter of interest is really the correlation coefficient, this rho mu, the correlation coefficient in the apocalypse. The correlation coefficient in apocilia cell that is particularly what we are interested in, and we want to identify those non-zero row u so we know what are the proteins is really associated with ACE2 in epithelial cells. So, this is a, how do you say, a typical mixture model, and that can be solved using our EAM algorithm, using a likely hood framework. There are some other factors. Factors, however, we want to consider in this real application. So, first of all, in the lung cancer study, the CPTAT lung cancer study that I mentioned earlier, actually both protein and RNA profiles are obtained for the same set of tissues. And specifically, this polarization protocol has been used in the CPTAC study such that the RNA and Such that their RNA and the protein samples are identical. So basically, the tissue was frozen and then break into tiny pieces. And so that is, so we assure that perfect mixture. And then half was sent for RNA profiling, half was sent for protein profiling. So they should have the perfect same cell type composition. And of course, for RNA profiles, there has been a lot of deconvolution method. Been a lot of deconvolution methods have been established, and specifically, there has been rich kind of databases on cell type-specific genes. So we can obtain those from the literature. And by utilizing the well-established deconvolution method, coupled with the well-documented cell type-specific genes, we can get some pretty good guess on the cell type composition based on our. Composition based on RNA data already. Okay. And, but of course, those estimations, as I mentioned earlier, is not perfect. There are randomness in it. So we treat those as prior estimation, and then we further model the randomness in those prior estimation. So we denote the epithelial cell proportion estimated by Excel based on the RNA data as this HR. On the RNA data as this HI, and then we assume this HI actually is an unbiased estimation center around the true pi, which is the true cell type percentage of those epithelial cells in tissue I. And we model this HIS or beta distribution such that its mean value is pi i and it has some other coefficients, parameters of the beta distribution. Parameters of the beta distribution. And then we move to the protein data. We know the protein data should share the same cell type percentage. And now we only focus on the protein data that we know they are epithelial cell specific. And so we have the unobserved gene expression level of those. Expression level of those proteins in the epithelial cell as well as in the non-epithelial cell. And then for this subset of the genes, we model, we only care about their marginal distribution and we don't care about covariance structure yet. And by using this framework, we can re-estimate the cell type composition. Cell type composition basically is the epithelial cell percentage. So, again, so we're using this framework to integrate the prior estimation of cell type composition from the RNA data together with the protein data, but we focus on the cell type specific markers, so the epithelial cell-specific markers. And then we perform the EM algorithm to update those pies. And then we And there we believe this is a much improved estimation of the cell type composition that combines information in both RNA and protein data. And then we plot this estimation into the mixture model that I explained earlier to study their correlation structure between ACE2 and other proteins. Okay, so this is just one factor that we considered. That we considered, and then after the estimation, the next goal is the hypothesis testing. And of course, we could just using a likelihood ratio test since we have a nice likelihood framework. But because of the complicated correlation structure and underlying information of the unobserved data. Of the unobserved data, we found that the chi-square approximation does not work very well for the likelihood ratio test. So we actually implemented some non-parametric permutation-based test. And in addition to the regular permutation test, which we called permutation replace, we actually also explored the knockoff idea. And thanks for the previous presentation where actually when we hear Actually, we hear a very nice introduction about this idea of knockoff model. So, we actually also did a version borrowing that idea. And we call that method permutation add. Okay, so we also implement a pathway level test that is after we got inferences for individual genes and proteins, we could also compute a pathway enrichment score. A pathway enrichment score. So we get just utilizing the test statistics of those correlation coefficients to do an enrichment test. That can give us actually more accurate inference on the pathway level summary. Okay, so this is slides gives a summary about the whole pipeline that we want to make use. We want to make use of the, first of all, existing tools, multi-omics data, both gene expression and the protein, as well as take into account of the coval rate of the samples. And the output of the pipeline, we have our updated cell type composition estimation, and we have estimation of the correlation between AC2 and the other proteins in the epithelial. Other proteins in the epithelial cell. And also, we have inference result, which is the genes significantly associated with AC2 in epithelial cells, as well as the pathways associated with AC2 in epithelial cells. Okay, just one more comment that I've always talked with my students that real data analysis is kind of like cooking, that even That even after you identify the photomaterial and your favorite pot to use, there are still many other details that you need to pay attention to, like the timing, what kind of seasoning you are using, all are very important. So that is how in this case study, we really tried our best to take into account all the potential factors we could think of. Potential factors we could think of to make the final estimation or inference as accurate as possible. Okay, so I think due to time constraint, I will skip the simulation results. Just quickly mentioning by using this proposed method, we have better control of the FDR compared to some of the other more ad hoc methods, which is only using a linear regression model, some interaction terms to account for. Model some interaction terms to account for cell type composition heterogeneity. And another message I want to quickly mention is that we found actually their original permutation test, permutation replace is actually better than their knockoff strategy here, but I will not go into detail due to their time limitation. We did have provided a discussion about why that's the case in the paper. I want to quickly show the exciting results. I want to quickly show the exciting result of the real data application. So, first of all, just to recap: we have this RNA profile and a protein profile for 101 adjacent normal tissue of lung cancer patients. And we didn't see correlation between RNA and the protein in either female or male patients, which is not surprising. Basically, that is. And basically, that is why we want to study the protein data directly. And after we did all the ICRO mix and the pathway enrichment, we also observed that the interference pathways is the pathway that has the most striking correlation with AC2. So, this is kind of similar to the cell paper that I mentioned earlier. But what's striking, and what we find is that we find is that the male in a male and in the female subjects actually this is lung cancer patients we observe the association is opposite so the opposite so so interference pathways are positively associated with a CE2 protein in male pa in male samples but negatively associated in the female samples Associated in the female samples. So, this is a very striking observation. And it kind of makes sense because ACE2, for your information, is a gene on the X chromosome. So, it kind of knows that many of its functions is related to sex differences. And for COVID, And for COVID pandemic, there has been many studies reporting that male and man and woman actually has very different phenotype. They have different rate to contract the disease. And also the male seems to be more likely to develop a more severe symptom. So that kind of makes sense because whenever if the human Whenever, if the human body, right, they have this reaction to up-regulating the interferometric pathway activities in the body, then in the male patient, it could actually help the COVID virus to even replicate faster. So, that is, could be one of the factor explain why the man or male patient tends to develop more severe. Tends to develop a more severe symptom compared to the female patient among the COVID patients. And another message is: if we think about interferomet-related therapies, then probably that should be implemented very carefully in a sex-specific manner. Probably it can help female patients, but maybe not too much for the male patient. Okay, so hopefully, those information could be helpful in the future. In the future, other coronavirus pandemic. Of course, cross fingers, we won't face that in the very near future. So, in summary, we developed a method, IPROMIX, which is using a mixture model that can help us to perform cell type-specific inference to study the association between among molecules based on the bulk level data. And when we apply this. And when we apply this analysis to study ACD2 and interfering pathway activity using lung cancer data set, we identified striking sex-specific patterns and which probably can cast a light on how we can better treat this virus down the road. And we have this our package of the method and the paper. Of the method and the paper published already. I just want to add one more sentence that this, although we have been very focused on this particular application in the paper, but the method actually could be very general and applied to many other studies, like constructing cell type-specific network or studying other cell type-specific inference. A cell type-specific inference based on fog faith. Okay, I will stop here and thank you all for the attention. Thank you so much, Paige. That was a very interesting talk with very good findings that explain a lot of things that had happened to us. So, questions from the audience? Yep. So, Hector here, I think there are questions. Here, I think your question. Hello, thank you. Two questions. How sensitive were the results to the re-estimation of cell type proportion? So you started with a bulk RNA cell type proportion estimate, and then you moved that over to. But part of the discussion is the lack of correlation between gene expression and protein. So it seems that that was the key for updating the cell type. For updating the cell type estimates, but if you not necessarily trust that there's a lot of relationship there, then I wonder how effective was that recalibration of the proportion estimates. So that's one. And two, can you extend this so that you have two compartments that you're trying to estimate so that you look at the immune cell compartment as well, not just the epithelial compartment? Yeah, thank you for the great. Yeah, thank you for the great questions. So, for the first one, actually, another reason we want to update this is that in the mixture model, we have specific interpretation for those pi, right? It is a percentage. But the X cell, the cell type proportion kind of estimation doesn't have the percentage interpretation. Interpretation. It is just a scale that's proportional to the cell type composition. So actually, that is, so we do find that this calibration step helps a lot. We do observe nice correlation actually on the updated high estimation versus this HI, but with the update. But with the updated pi estimation, actually, it seems the signal is much more stable. And another thing I want to say, yeah, you did mention that the RNA data and protein data are kind of different, right? For many of the cell type-specific markers, actually their RNA and the protein correlation is higher. Is higher, but that's not this case for all the cell types. Like, for example, for T cells, those cell type specific markers actually have very good cell type RAN protein correlation. But like for some of the B cell or microphage cells, some of the markers doesn't have that property. So it's really a matter of which cell type you are looking at when you think about RA data. Think about RA data-based cell type percentage estimation versus protein data-based cell type percentage estimation. I think for epithelial cells, definitely some marker have a low correlation between RA and protein, and that is another motivation we wanted to use in the protein data to further update this pie estimation. So, that is your first question. And for the second question, yes, that is a very And for the second question, yes, that is a very good question. We do want to extend this model to more than two cell types. But of course, that will increase their parameter numbers quite a bit and make the power in the inference lower based on our simulation experiment. And so there are, I hope we can make more progress. I hope we can make more progress on that when we extend the K, basically the number of cell types from two to many. Thank you. Yeah. Other questions? Nice talk. I was just curious. So I'm under the impression that the cell type proportion estimations by RNA are. By RNA, are sometimes poor estimators of the actual cell composition of the samples because different cell types can generate very different amounts of RNA. So I was just curious if you know whether that's also true for proteins or is that less true for proteins? Does that make sense? Yeah, I think definitely that is also an issue in progress. Issue in protein-based deconvolution analysis as well. For example, we know tumor cell urine is much bigger than immune cell, and the RNA abundant in tumor cell is higher than immune cell, and the protein abundant in tumor cell could also be higher than immune cell. So, in terms of that limitation, I think it applies to both RNA and protein. But I guess to some degree, when we're using such a framework, so that is kind of like identifiability issues, right? It's like we could say in all the cell type one, all the genes are twofold of another cell type, or we Another cell type, or we could say the genes are at the same level, but we just have this pipe percentage could be higher. I think the good news is that in reality, when we look at hundreds of genes or thousands of genes, that identifiability issue usually does not exist. There are definitely combinations of genes that didn't share that characteristics. So, in our experience, we feel it's okay. Thank you. I have one more question before we let you go. Yeah, sure. So, in your step two, I think it was, you said that you were looking at correlation. Yeah, here at the end of step two, you were looking at correlation between ACE2 and other proteins, but then you showed the results only with interpret. Results only with interpretone? Have you found results with other proteins as well? That's kind of my first question. And then I have a second one, which you showed here the relation. You showed that sex, it's an important variable to add into your model, given that this is pandemic data, but I don't know if you really have data on other things. Have you found other covariates to be important? For example, race, I'm thinking, is that something we should care about? Or other About or other covariates? Yeah, thank you for the very good questions. I think there are actually a collection of markers associated with ACE2. It's just that the interference is the most striking one if you look at a genome-wide level. Its magnitude is just many fold compared to some of the other things. But actually, you see, there are many pathways. You see, there are many pathways significant, although it looks mild, but that is only because the scale is very large. So, indeed, there are other functions has been impacted by AC2, and probably we still don't have much understanding on those yet. And the second, yes, great question about other covariates. In this data set, however, we don't have enough. However, we don't have enough sample size to do our ethnicity stratified analysis. So we just don't have power to go that direction. But I agree that would be a very important question to ask. And hopefully in the future, we will have more resources to do that investigation. Perfect. Thank you so much. Yeah, I missed the result here in red. Sorry. And I don't know if Red, sorry, and I don't know if there's a question coming from Zoom. Is that Veronica? No, okay, okay. Well, then we want to thank you again. That was an amazing talk. Thank you very much for sharing with us your results. Oh, thank you so much. Really glad to be able to be here. Thanks, everyone, for the good questions. Okay.
