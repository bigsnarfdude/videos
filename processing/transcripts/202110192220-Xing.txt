Thank you very much for your introduction, Professor Zurk. Thank you very much for all the organizers to the invitation and organize this interesting conference. So my topic today is on the framework of RP summations for function. So this is a joint work with Michael Rudson. So, first, I'll introduce the skeleton of my talk. So, first, I will talk about the convex geometry background, and then next, I will talk about the functional analogs of convex geometry theory, including two functional summations. One is a supreme convolution, another is the S-ploid summation. Now, my main work is about RP stations of the functional analogs of supreme convolution. functional analogs of supreme convolution S plus summation. So include LPS convolutions, LPS S plus summations for all p greater than zero. So first let's see the convex geometry background on the function on the convex body space. So the convex bodies we denote K0N to be the convex bodies with RT in their tiers. That is all compact convex sets. And so on this convex body On this convention, families of these conventional bodies, we have the elementary summations, the elementary operation on this family. So that is for any two convex bodies, K and L, we have Mikovsky sum, that is the vector sum of these two convex bodies. So for convex bodies, we have some basic functions to characterize these convex bodies. Always say these functions. Body. So, always say these functions are uniquely determined by this convex body. We have this convex body k with already serial. We have two convex functions and one characteristic function. The first one, support function, which is the sublinear or convex function to find out the unisphere. Therefore, each direction u on unisphere support function on the direction is the maximum projection distance for all x. Projection distance for all x belongs to k on the direction u. So another convex indicator function defined Rn that is when x belongs to k, the characteristic function is zero if x not belongs to k positive infinity. So the last one is about characteristic function. So it's when x belongs to k1, x not belongs to k zero. So for the first function, the support function is the elementary. Support function is the elementary of convex bodies, converse geometry. And so, for converse individual function, the characteristic function and the bridge to connect the convex geometry theory and the function series. So on the convex body space, we first have the Mikoski sum. So the natural extension of this Mikos sum is the RP volume, so RP-Mikovsk combination. So there is, we combination. So that is if we have two convex bodies only in the arterial for P greater than one. So Rp micro combination of K and L is determined by support function. There is a P me of the support function of P and L on the direction of U for every direction. So when P equal to 1 recovers the classical Mika sum, there is the linear sum of the support function. linear sum of the support function, also the vector sum of the vector sum of the convergent bodies K and L. So the elementary inequality called L P from Mikovsky inequality, that is 1p greater than 1 to convert body p and l. We can see from the formula that this volume n-dimensional the big matter. Okay, so this is the p over n can gave respect to this. Over N-Kang respect to this RP-Mikovsk combination. So, this is the RP-Brown-Mikowski inequality very important in the RP-Brom-Mikowski theory. And when P equal to N, we cover the classical Brown-Mikowski inequality and states that the volume is over n can be related to the classical Mikovsky sum. So, with this L chemical summation and this And this volume, the big mirror, we construct this LP space for convex bodies. So, this series is founded by FARI that is with the family is a conventional body space with LPM and the mirrors of the big mirror. So, now we can see the so we can see that in this space, in this mirror space, so this family. So, this family is your end, these convex bodies with oranges in this terrier. So, like, is there any extensions on this space? So, maybe work on this family of convex bodies or work on this sum of the operation or work on this volume of this Lebesgue mirror. So, the first is Shenshen. This is based on Luther Wag Yang and Zhang Ying in 2012. 2012. So that is with 10 the family of conversibodies to be all memorable sets, would be not to be beta. This notation. So the RP-Mikoski summation for convex bodies can extend to memorable sets. That is the non-convex case. So the basic definition is that if we have two negative coefficients, alpha and beta, p is more than one, and the k and f. P is more than one, and the P and L belongs to this family of this sets, variable sets, and P and Q are conjugates of each other. So the RP because the RP summation of this P and L can be written as this L P coefficients that alpha with the power over P1 minus lambda 1 over Q. So beta respectively have the similar coefficient, the similar power. For all lambda between 0 and 1, this can be written as a union of. Be written as a union of this classical Mikaus sum, but with RP coefficients for all lambda between 0 and 1. So this definition works well with the L P Mikotic sum. When this convex bodies belongs to the classical, belongs to the classical convex bodies with orange in the interior, so the definition are equivalent to each other. Also, for this, Mikoski. So for this Mikosky sum formula, we also have the same formula for the LP-Mikowski inequality for the compact sets. That is the volume is the P over L tang related to this L P sum. RP sum for P and L are compact sets, even they are not convex. So now it's 10 L P space of memorial sets. RP space of membrane sets to the membrane sets, then the family of convex bodies becomes membrane or membrane sets. This summation to be this 100 RP mechanism summation, the volumes, the mirror is due to the big measure. And so now based on this, for this measurable set, we can also extend for the measure. This is the volume n. So we know the volume of n is one tip. So we know the volume of n is one typical value, typical quantity for the core mass integrals. So core mass integral is that first we see some basic definitions. That is for omega n is the volume and dimensional unit ball, and this C and J is this quotient. For J belongs to 0, 1 to n minus 1. So the C and N minus J is N minus J grass man. mass j is a mass j Graph manifold with the Grand manifold and K products are H this is the production so K on the mass J dimensional H for H belongs to this G and MS J So covalent integral formula for K for K is a complex body with orange in the Terrier express as this coefficient C and J and then integral of integral And integral for this emerged volume of this projection of K over H for all H belongs to this Graph manifolds. So when D equals zero, this is just the volume. So in this case, that is, we can extend the space to the more general space, that is the convergence body family with L P sum and also the quantity for our quantum integrals. For our quantum mass integrals, for convex bodies. For the conventional bodies, we have this quantum integral and we also have this Mikausi sign, LP-Mica sum. So a natural question is that what's the variational formula? So that is the variational formula for this chromatic single in terms of this RP sum of RP sum of convex bodies. So this can be expressed. So, this can be expressed as the integral representation related to support functional K and L. For convex body, K and L belongs to the family convention with already in their tiers. So this goes related to SJ. So, Sj related to this co-mass integral J. So, Sj is the J substair mirror of K defined a unit sphere. And when S equal to when zero, sorry, when J equal to zero sorry when j equals to zero so it recovers the surface area on the unique sphere and when j equals to zero this wjk recovers the classical lp mikoski volume for convex body v pkl and for this p small mixed p more converse integrals we have this mikoski type inequality that this part mass j this part minus p this part is p and so when z equals zero it recovers the class equal to zero it recovers the classical Mikoski inequality RP-Mikowski inequality and now that is the space we we can see the RP space with this core mass integral for this space in WGP so next I'll talk about the functional analogs about convex geometry series so first let's see some basic notations for functions so For functions. So, first one is about the S mean of constants. So, for S belongs to negative infinity and infinity, AB are non-negative. So, the S mean of AB with respect to the non-negative coefficients and beta is denoted by this. So, when S is not equal to zero and positive neck infinity, so it's the regular or the Euro we Euro S mean we used. So, when S equal to zero, so So when s equal to zero, so we just raise power the coefficients alpha and beta. So s equal to positive infinity, it recovers the maximum of a and b. When s equal to neg infinity, the minimum of a and b. So this is based on the a b is greater than zero. However, if a b equal to zero, we can see this is just s means we denote as zero. So function s can give if for every x if for every x and y belongs to rn and t belongs to zero one so f of this one mass t f of x y with coefficients of one mass dm t is greater than the s mean of f x and f y with related coefficients one minus dm t so particularly when s equal to zero so this is a low cong function and when s equal to negative infinity it's the cosine congeal function counting function and related to this s mean as mean for this for this constant we have one important inequality cost barrier bonds and leaving quality so we know that for commerce body space the elementary elementary um elementary mirror is a big mirror of code volume so for the feminine space the elementary mirror Base the elementary mirror, or we call this is the total mass of F or the integral of F. So the Brea-Bronze Lib inequality, so we call it BBR inequality, states that for T belongs to 0 and 1 and S is more than negative 1 over N. So if we have three non-negative functions, H, F, and D, satisfy this condition, that is, each of this linear sum of X and Y. Linear sum of x and y with coefficient one minus cmt is greater than the S m of f and x and g y with coefficients one minus c and t for every x and y. So we can see it's the total mass of h is greater than s over one plus s mean of the total mass of f and g. So it means you have relation for this function, this total mass relation. So this really s mean, so this s over 1 plus n. So, this s over one plus n s me. So, when s equal to zero, it recovers the classical pre-carbon quality. So, it's for here, when s equal to zero, so it will become the raise power one mass t and t for f and g f x and g y respectively. For the total mass, we also raise its power one mass t and t for total mass of f and g. So, it's a pickup lender inequality. So, it recovers the It recovers that the fact that mirrors have one over s congive density must be one over n plus s congie for s less than negative n and s greater than zero. So this problem is proposed by Bra and Bros-Lieb in 1975 and 1976, respectively. So we can see that the condition for this BBR inequality, if we only give this F and Gy, so the minimal function for this So the minimal function for this H will be the supreme of Z equal to the linear sum of replaces 1 minus TX plus Ty BZ and the supreme of related the supreme of the S m on the right hand side. So there's a minimal function satisfy the BBR inequality condition. It's that the supreme of the inside term of this H is a linear sum X and Y was coefficient 1 minus T and T and the S mean on the right hand side still the S mean on the right hand side still the S mean of FX and G wire coefficients one minus T so based on this minimal function so Clark Tech in 2007 proposes supreme convolution also called this S sum of functions okay so that's one s belongs negative infinity infinity and infinity so supreme convolution of these two functions in Of these two functions into non-negative functions f and g, the supreme. So add this supreme restriction for z equal to x plus y. The right-hand side just s mean for fx and gy for every s, every cases of s. So the scalar case due to s greater than zero, the scalar case, so s not equal to zero infinity, satisfies alpha to the power of s. So well half of f is x over. Well half of f is x over alpha. x equal to 0 raise power of alpha. S equal to positive negative infinity is f itself. So this supreme convolution is well defined as closed for S concap J. So it means when F and Z are S congive, so the supreme convolution of F and Z are also S congive. So now there is a functional space equipped with the supreme convolution. To the supreme convolution, so this f all the set of integral functions or marvel functions we give this family of this set capital F. So this summation is supreme convolution, and this i is just the total map on the functions. So one important example that connects the conversible theory and the supreme convolution theory is that if we have theories that if we have two convex sets and with this kappa k is just the characteristic function, we can see the superinculus of this characteristic function k and l with this coefficient 1 mass t and t is just equal to the characteristic function of this Mikosky sum of k and L with the same coefficients 1 mass t and t. So, but it doesn't work for any other coefficients. Other for other coefficients. So it's because these coefficients, there's some one must be and t, there's some must be one. So for general alpha and beta is not correct. So the BVR inequality then deduce that, so I replace that H by this supreme convolution of f and g with coefficient of mass t and t. That is for any s greater than negative 1 over n, we can see that the total mass of the supreme conclusion of f and g greater Supernova of F and G greater than S m s over one plus S mi of the total mass IFIG. This is the kind of VM type inequality. The left hand side is the sum. The right hand is that is S mean of the mirror for the elements. So we see that when f is the characteristic function of k, so the integral, so to the method of f will be the volume of k. So we can see that you So we can see that if we replace this F be the characteristic of K and G be the characteristic of L for complex bodies, we can see this becomes the volume of the linear sum of K and L. So right-hand side will be the S over 1 over S mean of the volume of K and L. So as we know that this S plus S mean is less than 1 over N, so that we obtain a weaker version of the because Of the Mikovsky the BME quality because this power is less than 11. So the volume is 11 concave, so it must be S over 1 plus an S congive for the volume. So when S equal to 0, you can see it obtained the dimension 3 VM inequality. Okay, so these are the supreme convolution. So another function summation code infield code S plus summation. infield code S close I mentioned closely related to the infield convolution based on this space C V X R N. So there is the family of function U satisfy purple on convex and lower semi-continuous. So the infilm convolution defined on this G V S R N that is for any U and V infield convolution of X because the infilm of the sum of UX minus Y and V Y for all Y And Vy for all y belongs to Rn. So the scalar case also satisfies that this property and this Newfound convolution for U and V is also closed for this space C V X R N, this convex space. So when U and V belongs to VX, it's the infield convolution also inside. One important geometry and property for this infield convolution with this space. Conlusion with this space is that if we have the epigraph of this function u, there is n plus one-dimensional set, satisfy y greater than x. The epigraph, the infimum convolution, is just the Minkowski sum epigraph of u and v. So this is very beautiful for geometry property. So the infield convolution has a close relation to the Leyton transform. The land transform is a kind of duality. transform is a kind of duality for functions. So the land transform defined on this C B X R n at X for u is equal to the linear sum X. So the supremum of Y minus Rn the inner product of X Y minus U Y. So the linear transformation is due, it's kind of duality because satisfies two properties that the vector transformer Is the transform function u recover itself of u and when u is less than v, the length transform does reverse reduction inequality. And also an important part to connect converse geometry is that when any converse body k is characteristic converse lintiger function, so it's conjugate because the Legend transform is just a support function of K. The support function of k. So it's the connection with the infium convolution that is well distributed with this Latin transform. The Lend transform of infium convolution for U and V is equal to the sum, this linear sum of these two Legend transform functions for U and V. So to work on more specifically, we see this supreme. We see this supreme cursive function. They accept this Vxrn. We add more conditions than orange and the norm of x goes to infinity. Orange is zero and the norm x goes to infinity, the ux over the norm of x equal to positive infinity is a subspace, some subspace of C V X Rn. Okay, so S condi function works only that of this S conduct option continuous belongs R Rn and with the And with the maximum point is origin. So when S equals zero, so this recovered the law congeal function family and neck infinity is cosi congeal function family. So the s-ploe sum is construct the base function of the s-congeal function. So when f is the s-congeal function, we can find the convex. Here is a supercursive function uf related to So this proposed by Leonardem in 2013. So when S equal to zero, so it's become the law congregate case and exponential log of the base function for f. So when the connection with the connection with the convex geometry case that one case convex body is only in the terrible so f if the character So f is the characteristic function for k. So the base function will be the convex indicate function of k. So s plus sum for this function f and g belongs to f s rn. So we can see its s plus sum is defined by the infimum convolution of its base function uf u d the base function infume convolution is just the uh s plus the summation the base function s plus summation of m d scalar sense Of md scalar satisfied a similar condition, so therefore the functional space can be constructed equipped with this S plus summation, this functional space with S plus summation with the total mass mirror. So, the properties for S plus summations, the supreme conclusion S plus summation, they are equivalent for the coefficients of one mass d and t. So, it means that So it means that this supreme convolution can be written as this base function, or this is the Lagen transform of this line transform uf and ud on this formula. So we can also work on this supercarci function, define this integral operator ds. So then we can write this. Distribute varying quality by infilm convolution with this DS operator. Okay, the red hands due s over one over S mu of D S U and D S V. So our work is designed the supreme conclusion as plus summation to the space for LP case. So first they together with Michael Rudson we work on this LPS supreme convolution. P S supreme convolution for P greater than one and S greater than zero. So that is for two non-net Q functions F and Z. This PQ still conjugate to each other. This there comes from the RP stensions for non-commerce sets by Botook Yang Dong in 2012. They use RP coefficients. So here we also, that is a union for lambda. So here we choose a supreme for lambda between 0 and 1. Prime for lambda octane zero one and here they see also the RP coefficient related to the linear sum of x and y x and y so we obtain the CPM of lambda between the one. So this is the supreme convolution, then the L1 case of supreme convolution with this Lp coefficients for lambda, one minus lambda, lambda, but with the power one minus q and yeah. So the scalar case The scalar case satisfies this inequality, satisfy this identity, satisfy this identity. So, one important part is that if we replace F and G by the characteristic functions of K and L with this K and L member sets, we can see this L P supium convolution of F and G. So it recovers that recovers that the L P recovers that the RP sum of K and L with the same coefficients. So now we construct this functional space the RPI supreme convolution with the integral integral function space, the RPI supreme convolution with the total mass. And we also have very good properties for this RP supreme convolution. So there is set So there is a satisfied homogeneity property. So we can for alpha for the coefficient of alpha g related to alpha and beta. So you can pull out this alpha and beta. Second-wise that if f and g are memorable, so we can show the RPI supreme convolution of f and g for non-negative coefficients alpha and beta. So this also memorable. So it also satisfies the community. So it also satisfies the community. We continue the predation to work the same idea. However, the associability that is not working. So it's when we put alpha and b together and then with gamma, so this is not working. So however, when p equal to one, all these four rows works. Not only the first three rows, but observability also works. However, Also works. However, for P greater than one, for P greater than one, the last one observability is not working. This is because RP coefficients are much more delicate. So when we take supreme, so it can not satisfy suitability property. So also define the LPS E-film convolution for P between 0 and 1, that is when P and Q are conjugates, and F G satisfies. And FG satisfied RMG in their support. And we have this RP infield supreme convolution that is China supreme of lambda between 0 and 1 by infield. This is based on the definition of the RP Mikosky sum for convex bodies. That is the isand of body of the P me of the sport function. So that is 1p greater p from 0 to 1. 1p greater p from 0 to 1, so it only satisfies that when the supreme of coefficients change to the infilm, we obtain the corresponding RP coefficients. Okay, so this is the idea why we see this infilm lambda between 0 and 1. So the corresponding RPBR inequality with related RPS supreme convolution is that so we have this condition for P greater than 1, S greater than 0. Than one, s greater than zero. So, this is our first work with Michael Rudson that when this lambda and tp zero and one with L P coefficients, so it's this with the power over p1 over q, t one over p over lambda over q. So that is when h of this linear sum x and y with the L P coefficients belam T d B lambda t is greater than S mean of this F. mean of this f x and g y with r p coefficients we can show the total mass uh is of h greater than the total mass of s p s over one plus n s mean of this if i g so when p equal to one this recovers the classical bbr inequality also this lp coefficient goes back to the general coefficient one mass t and t so this method uh in our work in this work to use a very Our work in this work to use the revolution bodies for functions, and we find these corresponding revolution bodies for H, F, and G, and then use L P Brahmi-Causing qualities for the RP sum of this for these RP cases of convex bodies. Okay, and then we go back to the functional version of obtaining this LPB variable inequality. So, our next work just is 10 because this work we just saw. 10 because this work we just solved this x is greater than zero and use this method. Okay, so our second work not only extends this x to the point infinity, but also gets the complete version of all cases LPA DBR inequality. So when s greater than zero, the same formula, but we also give the result s less than zero. So we can show s greater than negative one have the same. Over n have the same mean for the total mass. When s less than 1 over n, we can see the minimum with this RP coefficient by the power 1 over gamma. So the gamma is s over n s. So we can see when s is greater than negative over n, that is the classical bibliography inequality, when p equal to 1 is less than negative over n. This case solved by Daskos and Uring in 1980. So, in this work, we use different methods of the optimization transportation method and the classical BBR inequality for different cases to produce all these results, but use different methods, also different forms of revolution bodies and BVR inequality for converse body case. So, we up now use three methods to show all this LP BVR inequality for different cases. So, we can see that this So we can see that this condition for HF and G, we replace HF and G by the same function F, so we can obtain the corresponding concave takes for function, but this RP coefficients. So based on this idea, we talked about, we gave the definition of RPS can give measures. Then if we have a measure mu, if the RPS can't give, if satisfied if this set A, it's at B. This F A is at B. Right hand the S mu of mu A mu B with L P coefficients B lambda T and D B lambda T. So S equals negative infinity calls L P S cosine can get measure. And when S equals zero, it calls Lp S law Kangan measure. And when P equals to one, it goes to the classical S kangar measure. So similarly, if mu is replaced to be the function, obtain the RPS calcavities definitive for functions. Definitions for functions. So we also have the corresponding property with RPS concavity with the field prime convolution. So if F is RPS cong, D R P beta concave, we can show its convolution of F and Z. It's just when this S beta over S plus beta, so that is a congivity power of F and Z. If this is greater than that Un, we can show this convolution. we can show this convolution is this RP this term concave so when s beta over s plus beta less than q over n we can show this is the RP and this term is this cosine concave okay so when people do one goes to the June's work in 1980s so last work is related to RPS S plus summation for P greater than one so first this is RP additions of the base supercursive function Base supercursive function. This is the Latin transform of the RP mean of this lattice form of U and V for supercursive function. So we define the RPS S plus summation for S congate function. That for P greater than one case, so this is one month S. So this is the RP additions of the base functions for F and Z. So this is R P S plus summation for. RPS closum mission for SKANGA function F and C. So on P equal to 0, S equals 1, so it covers the Closundi Fragla in 2013 and quantitative Screen and Pladex work in 2015. And the 1p greater than y s equals zero, it recovers our work with Fung and Yi and Mi in 2020. So we construct the LP space, LPS plus functions. LPS plus function space we can call. We replace the summation by the LP S plus summation. So based on this summation, we also based on this also give the case for P from 0 to 1, the LPS S plus summation. First, we define spoil function for S-Kang function. The spoil function is just the ledge transform of its base function. Base function. So as a zender function is just one minus s let defines for mu with this formula. So the RPS plus summation we define for p from 0 to 1 is just the s standard function for the p mean of the sport function of f and g. So this is our case for p from 0 to 1. And over s equals 0, so this is the work s plus summation for the all kind function by differential term. Function by Dirang Rotem. And we also define the power mass integral for functions based on the projection function. So that is when alpha is the S cong, so we have this projection function and D. So this is the formula. So similar to the Qubac formula for complex bodies, we also have the quantum syntax for functions. Therefore, g becomes zero to n minus one. So inside is replaced. side is replaced for the projection a mass g volume of cap projection h replaced by this integral for the projection function for f as a similar integral for all h belongs to mass graph money so one important thing is that the quark mass integral for f is equal to integral for the level set so the inside is just quite mass integral for convex sets okay convex bodies so when So when f is a characteristic function, we can show the quantum as angle of a function that recovers the quantum single for complex bodies. And we also have the corresponding this is using the LP supreme condition, we have this BBR type inequality for quantum as integrals. So similar to the variation formula of the quantum integral in time the LP sum for convex bodies, we have this For convex bodies, we have this RP miss core mass integral for S cong function rated F and G. So that is the variational formula of this chromatic integral in terms of this RPS upic convolution. So this is the definition. And moreover, we gave the integral representation for the LPS mixed quarter mass integral. So when s equal to zero, we can see this term, one minus s to the power one very. term one minus s to the power one variant minus one will become the exponential case and also when j equals to zero so that simply j equal to zero goes through the four dimensional space when s equal to zero so the log case the variational formula uh recovers during root time work when p between zero and one and one and p greater than one is our work with one and e and also if i replace this f be the current This F be the characteristic function k, G be characteristic function L for to convex bodies can L. So when this Wp01 means J equals 0, S equal to 1, S equal to 1, this term will disappear. So this recovers the McColless, LP McCos volume, RP mix volume for K and L with this integral representation. Okay, so that's all my thought. So that's all my talk. Thank you very much. Thank you. Do we have any questions, comments?
