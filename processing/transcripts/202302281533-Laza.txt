Yeah. So before I forget this is all going to be programmed in the master. There will be frequent references for the papers. So the ultimate goal is to study moduli of colour genes. So basically we heard a lot here about moduli funnels, about the moduli of general type, why not colour. General type, why not Calabios? I have quite a bit of selling in this direction, but it's not ready for prime time. It's maybe private conversations if you are interested. Anyway, so today we are more modest. We are studying the local picture, so deformations of singular, so X is a singular colour of young. And there are two important restrictions that kind of Restrictions that kind of are always in my talk. Rational simplerities. So it is about the interior of the modularized phase as one understands, but you'll see that it's a pretty interesting picture. And I would love to have something to say about the question that um Philip asked about what happens if X is a boundary, but anyway. Anyway, first thing is first. Okay, so let's start with X smooth. I mean, we know in general that in algebraic geometry we have Murphy's law and stuff like that. And Calabi also one of the surprising bright spots in terms of deformation theory. So if X is smooth, we have the theorem of Trump. Theorem of Tian Propogomon of Tian Todorov, which says that the deformations of X are an obstruct. I mean, this might not seem like a big deal, but typically H two of D of X, the obstruction space. The obstruction space is non-zero for alarm here also. And the explanation for this theorem and for all I'm going to say is the fact that Hoch theory works very well for modulized calamiums. And I mean the point is that H1 of D of X because of the calamia of the t-shirt excess H1 of FX minus 1. One of the x step minus one. So, in particular, the modular smoke calibrates is small than the must of dimension. If there is some h showing up, it might also be h equals h n minus 1 comma 1, which is h 1 comma n minus 1, and throughout the talk. And throughout the talk, I need to mention thanks. And through all I'm talking, the dimension has to be at least free. Just out of self-interest, you have to have a Gala condition here, otherwise. Yeah, so I'm hiding this thing, so you can assume. Anyway, let's. No, so you need to assume X is projective or maybe that. Or maybe that the resolution has the DD bar condition satisfied. So there are various technical conditions to allow a Ni1 degeneracy, but let me pretend. If you want, you can assume X is projective, but there are situations that you are interested in. You can also not project it. You want a weaker condition. Okay, so let's see what I wanted. Okay, so let's move. For you, Clavia, I was a strong one. For you, Claudia's strong one? Let's assume, yes. I mean, so I'm assuming definitely omega x is not numerical, it's just L of X. And I'm as and likely sometimes, I mean, many theories go through, I'm also assuming the strong condition. Okay. So let's see what happens when X is singular. So let's see what our previous Are the previous results. So there are three main theorems here. So one is Cava Mata Ranitian. I mean these are kind of like three different papers simultaneous. He said if X is collaborative enfold with ordinary double points, then affordations. Affirmations of things. I'm abstracted. And I mean, in the key point here, the key here is the key one with the Cartelion, which in particular simplifies the BTT theorem, prove that the Obomo of T and Obomolovty and Odorovdi or M, which in turn basically boils down to constancy of Hautch numbers for smooth genetics. I'm simplifying a lot, but basically basically combined with this thing that the tangent space to the formation is a host theoretic space, it boils down the Bogomolo of Tian of Bogomolovtyantovsky family of Kalabi also, but any smooth family has constant Holschnow. Okay, the TOM2 is a bit of a surprise, and this was the earlier one, the start of the so this is due to Friedman in 86. It's kind of the complementary question, and this is dimension 3, so x is Hanabia 3. So X is Hanabil Freefold with ordinary double points. And then the conclusion is that X is movable if and only if there exists kind of Ai different, all different from zero, such that some of That sum of Ai Ci equal to zero in H4 of X hat, where X hat to X is a small resolution, which exists in threefold with ordinary double points. Any small resolution on U and C I are the exceptional curves. The exceptional curves. I mean, the punch line, the punch line, I mean, it's kind of hard to digest this one. For a sitting, the punch line, this is a topological obstruction to smoothing. So, generally speaking, you want two things about singular calabic outs. So, you want So, you want an obstructive deformation, the modular space to smooth, and of course, you want to be able to smooth. So, what the theorem says is that there exists a lab yaus such that they, with nodes, they live in a parallel universe, are never smoothable. But the proof of this second theorem relies on the yeah, I mean, the first one was up to first order. First order. So, and then once you have an abstractness, then it's actually smoothing. So it's kind of. I mean, Friedman had an if and only if, but under stronger assumptions and so what this is the distilled version. Okay, one further theory. Is hex time in this context also, Columbia? Yeah, I mean, because it's small resolution, the small resolutions are frequent. Are crepe and yeah, and I mean any small resolution, I mean, I don't know, you would have anyway, and I mean, okay, anyway, hopefully I get to see, anyway, so that's actually purely topological, and I mean it's hard to see in this way, but anyway, so the first the first durant is Namikawan stamping. Maybe 95, if I remember correctly, it says that if X is a label freefold with isolated canonical hypersurface singularities, then X deforms to model. To model one and then F conditional price. I mean, kind of an epsilon improvement here is that any non-O and P singularities are smoothable. So let me say it in words that blackboard is not. We say it in words, the blackboard is not too big. So basically, any non-ADE singularity, you can smooth it on the nose. You are just left with the ordinary double points. So the ordinary double points, you do a definition, keeping them. So in the Freedman situation, is the ability simultaneous something together with a uh smoothing together with uh x hat? Uh no, uh I mean uh I mean x hat is smooth. Yeah, yeah, I understand. That that's the deformation. No, no, I mean okay you hopefully I'll get it too. So actually this is a hard part comparing the deformations of X with the deformation effects hard. So this is the missing piece. And I mean one thing that's missing, so just kind of a warning. So one piece that's missing. So one big piece that's missing is the surjectivity of the global deformation T1x to H0X of whatever. So the global to local to local. And I mean, for instance, you have, I mean, quintic free faults with, I don't know, 130 nodes, where you know that you don't have such anything from the global law. Because the model I have, Puintick. The moduli of pointing threefold is 101-dimensional, while you have too many nodes, and we don't understand, I don't know, kind of the simultaneous beat. Also, also kind of a warning is that, so this is Mark Gross, so the formations of canonical collaborative threefolds are abstracted. Obstracted, but the good news here, in some sense, is that the obstructions are only local. So basically, basically, if local deformations is smooth, then the global deformations are smooth. So for this reason, you will see this type of assumption, isolated economical hypersurface similarities. Hypersurface similarities. So, this is necessary to have good deform to have good local deformation. So, Mark, yes. So, should I have in mind something that has a coordination to I mean a curve of similar? No, no, no, even isolated. So, you have this kind of like what about whatever. whatever I don't know complicated non-LCI isolated singularities that whatever have the local I mean he he proves that the global to local is smooth functor so basically the global deformations are smooth over the local deformations at least under some assumptions in his example okay so Okay, so let's move on and basically, basic, and I mean the only theorem that we don't generalize, and I mean, let me put it here. So there is a theorem one plus, which is due to Namikawa, is that if X is a low threefold with terminal singularities, the formations of X are an obstacle. And of start. So, what I will talk today is whatever kind of vast generalization of 1, 2, 3, unfortunately, 1 plus is missing. So, we have no idea. But unfortunately, to state our results, I need to make a pretty big detour so that means Let me just kind of the part of the book, which is simulation. I mean, most of the people here know these diagrams, so we have the canonical similarities, we have the local canonical similarities, there may be semi-low canonical similarities, we have the rational similarities, and you can. And you are similarities. And the diagram is like this. I mean, some parts of the diagram are classical and easy, others are more complicated. So this is Kolan and Kovac in 2010. This is Kovac in 2000. And one more thing to say is that if Bornenstein Polanged in everything. And keep in mind that we are talking about LCI singularity, so in particular, Gorenstein, so for us, all things kind of are community canonically the same thing first. You're saying Gorenstein is what is similar? Yes. I mean, that's a theorem, some combination. Some combination of Kovat, Kovach Field, Hern Smith, or something like this. So, this part of the diagram here, this corner is highly known. So, that's okay. So, what I want to say, I want to generalize everything to higher kind of k to 1, k rational, and before I start everything. And before I start everything I start saying anything, let me say that k equal to C volt is the standard case. Higher means milder, in particular kind of k implies k minus 1. And k about dimension over 2 if needs. Okay, and so so there are, I mean this is very recent, there are the papers of Mustato, Ulano, Popa, Vitashek in twenty-one. Uh okay, this one I'll be gonna remember. Numkim Saito Yung saito Anyway, so twenty-one, three twanlasa, twenty-two, this is a sea paper. And everything in some sense was known to Yubois and Stenbring in the 80s. But basically, why didn't they do anything about that in the 80s? It's because there are two fundamental questions. Is because there are two fundamental questions. How do I recognize a higher rational singularity, higher de Bois singularities, and what's the use of those? So let me try to give some hints in that direction. So why? And I mean, this is my perspective. I mean, Mustafa and Oba came to these notions from a different perspective, from the perspective of a junction and stuff like that, higher adjunction, if you want. A junction, if you want. My perspective is Hoch theory, and let me explain what's going on. So, suppose that X is smooth, projective, and over C. Everyone here knows that the commodity of X is a projective position. And to keep the top self for 10, let's just note two things that we have the whole symmetries. And that H to Q are constant in small values. The reason for all of that kind of why this holds is the E1 degeneracy of the Hodge-Deram spectral sequence, which in particular. Which, in particular, tells you that the Hauser numbers can be computed by oxygen convergence. So, once you have this thing, then of course you get upper semi-continuity or whatever, some semi-continuity coming from coherent homology, and combine with the topological whatever. You have a fiber bind topologically, you get the constant C of the Haush numbers. Now, the symmetry is. Now the symmetries, this is the complex symmetry, complex symmetry, complex conjugation, and this is served to mine. Okay, we want to generalize this picture to the singular setup. So, what's happening in the singular setup? So, first of all, we have a link which tells us Which tells us that h star of x has a mixed hole structure. And this is functorial. From this perspective, I will define, and this is my definition, I will define the HPQ numbers, these are what I call positive one numbers, to be the dimension of the gradient at P P's. P P is HPQ operation. Of course, this is exactly the HPQ number if it is smooth. And this is also sum, if you want, of the Hoistahin numbers. Hopefully I got the index right. So this is Hoisterin data that we know better. I mean, these are badly behaved. I mean, kind of, they have no symmetry, they don't behave well in families, and whatever. Everything kind of is bad. One good thing to notice, for instance, is that you always have this type of inequality. So, this is a consequence of the fact that the weights on the commodity. On the homology, you have the Denin conditions on the weights on the homology. And you can do it with HPQ. It's getting more complicated, and let me skip it. I'm still a bit gentle. And so on and so forth. Okay. On the other hand, we have kind of du 1. I think it was 81. And he wanted to generalize this. So generalize this. So generalizes the E1 is in the RC. Can you say again what's the sum? Yeah, so with the sum, okay, hopefully I okay, the index might be wrong. I mean, so the Hoch-De-Lin numbers take care of both the Hoch filtration and the weight filtration. So there are three indexes. And you kind of integrate by one of those indexes. Integrate by one of those indexes so you forget a way to filtration. I'm pretty sure that I got the index wrong and I will not try to correct it on the fly. But keep in mind, and I mean, okay, let me take a minute, keep in mind that the Hoch-Delin numbers are symmetric. So because you have pure Hodge structures when you fix a weight, you still have the complex conjugation. Conjugation. And you lose that, you gain only an inequality here in more general stuff, but you'll see that there is a gain later on. Okay, so Dubois generalized the E1 degeneracy. Degeneracy, and long story short, you have some gadget in the derived category of x which replaces replaces the kernel differential. General differentials. And further, I mean, the important thing is that this exists. So exist. You have E1 degeneracy if X is compact, which in other words means that what I know, the Hoodworth numbers, are the dimension of the hyperbombology of these cabinets. Okay, sure. Because roughly one minute for a very, very long time. So, happy birthday. I should explain, I was born on February 29. So you are only 15 or something. And if anyone wants to say anything right now, the administration said they could cut this out of the video. How do you think? How do you sing happy birthday in the Italian? Happy and audience. To the Italians in the audience, I sing happy birthday in Italy. Happy sense. Okay, so to continue. So to continue, so there exists a gadget which is pretty complicated complicated to define and whatever to work with. But the point is that this computes the U1 degeneracy and there exists somewhat functorial map. I mean this is natural map comparing the header dimension to the to the to the DuPont complex, to the gray pieces of the DuPont complex. Great pieces of the DuPont complex. Of course, because these are not sheaves, these are not semi-continuous, not semi-continuous. And when you put it this way, of course, you want T1 degeneracy, you want semi-continuity, what not. You say X has k divided singularities if the natural type of meta. The metrical type omega x omega x p is quasi, it won't face for p. Let's see. But k is k equal to 0, of course, this is to 1 dash 10 and 8 is and k greater than 0 and p MP collaborators in 2021. What context does it exist, this Dubois? X complex analytic or the only thing the only thing that you need is define over C. Like a compact, complex analog. Like a compact, complex analytic space or something. Yeah. So it doesn't work in positive characteristics? No, no, no. And I mean, I should point out even in the smooth, in the smooth case, you have the example of SER that, so you have the example a surface, smooth surface such that omega s1 is different from h1 omega s per omega. No, but the definition of the one. The definition of the Du Bois complex just doesn't work, doesn't exist. Of course, you can make it because the Du Bois complex, how you define it, okay. You need to assume, you need to assume resolution. So once you assume kind of whatever, cubical hyper-resolution or something, you do that. Okay, but what you want, and whatever, okay, you can define or whatever, but you want, I mean, from my perspective, what you want is that you want. From my perspective, what you want is a human degeneracy. So that's the whatever. Why do you have this gadget? So in positive characteristic, you don't have that, whatever. You have criteria to win. Okay, I mean, why don't, yeah. Anyway, let me... I mean, I mean, this is whatever, very new. Do you assume that X is algebraic or complex enough? Is there anything that? No, I think it works complex enough. No, I think it works complex analytic or whatever. Even the U1 in general. Yeah. I mean, you need compact. The U1 is for, of course, for compact. And maybe, okay, I take it back. You need something, of course, because the U1, I mean, even in the smooth case, if you don't assume Keller or you don't assume dd bar lemma, it it will fail. So you need very mild assumptions, so so so so some sort of Keller or replacement of Keller. Or replacement of Keller. TDPAR lemma is the most general. But anyway, and how about rational? And I mean, this is this is new. So this is 22C, this is higher rational. And actually this is an interesting definition even in the even interesting even for for k equal to zero four. For k equal to zero for the star. So, what we observe, so the Q observation is that under mild assumptions, which means coordination of the singularities, there exists a natural map between omega XP and omega X. The growth and the dual. uh the grotene dual of the n minus. So basically what you do, you do concurrent duality or served quality on a resolution and push it forward. And using from tofuality you get this kind of map. So composing with the one map you get a natural map. So we have matur map from omega xp to the northern equal of the omega x n minus p. And the definition is that x has k rational similarities if and only if If it's quasi isomorphism for P placing Let me just say something for K equal to zero. So for K equal to zero you get the the Graham Riemann Schneider shift, which is a push forward of omega X from a resolution. Omega X form resolution. This maps naturally into omega X under G, which is the broadening dual of omega X0, which maps to the dualizing shift, which is just the dual of X. And rational is the composition is an. So, this is the usual definition of rational. Maybe you assume normal or something like this. It's the usual definition of rational, that the push-forward from the open set or from a resolution is the same thing. And this kind of definition actually occurs in polar oncology, and I mean whatever, various forms. But the point of this. Forms. But the point of this one is that it factors, it factors through the Duplois condition. We probably said that, but omega xp without the underband. Is that just the different? Yeah, the general differentials. I have no idea what. You mean the pth wedge power or the saturation of that? The pth wedge power. So this is the usual definition of jet. Usual definition of gel. So omega xp is volunteer press signs along the same lines. Is it always true, at least in Bex's LCI, that page zero of the new volume? Yeah, so this is a corollary of Cebecus Schnell. So some very mild assumptions which which is that H0 of omega x p under the line is reflexive. But the point, so in particular the wa implies that omega S P is is reflexive, but of course the issue is that this can have higher cohomology shifts and that are quite complicated. Is there something similar to the Drupal? Is there something similar to the dual? Uh yeah, I mean y yes and no, so so sorry. But anyway okay the point the point, I mean the punchline and I mean the so the punchline of this definition is that it factors through the Dubois, but you are only asking, so the Dubois condition is this is isomorphic, this is a valuable du Bois. And the comm And the composition being isomorphic is equivalent to rational. It's a non-trivial theorem of Kovac that rational implies dubois. So basically, this is an isomorphism implies that is an isomorphism which boils down to some sort of injectivity theorem. They're suitably set. And what about the main theorem here? Main theorem here. Rational or zero rational? No, zero rational is rational. So this is just to whatever connected with, I mean, it's exactly the same thing, but you do up to P, P omega X P and so on. And the theorem, so main theorem in this business, which is simultaneously Simultaneously starts upper hand side or somewhere in between. So if x is FCI, as FCI singularities, then k to 1 implies k rational so this is number 1 and number 2 is k rational implies k minus 1. Implies k minus 1. And I need to this one was first kind of hypersurface implied in this case. And then kind of more recently. Chen Der's Mustaza. This is okay for LC, I think. What are the two letters between F L and S? Mustaza and Popa and Morehicos. And the Morihikosai to and so k equal to zero, k equal to zero is Kovach. Hopefully I could accent in the right direction. So Kovach 2001 is rational. No LCI, no LCI. It's the other way around, right? It's rational and Went down, right? Rational and technology. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Okay, I'm really. Yeah. Yeah, I really apologize. That's exactly right. So national is a stronger coalition, yes. And I mean, so a big question in the here, so for younger people who are not so young, so open question in this type of things is is there a good theory? Is there a good view in away from L C I'm confused? Higher K is milder. So K to Y is Yeah, but but I mean the diagram is as follows. So k to one by minus one K minus 1 to 1. K rational implies K minus 1 rational. This is 3d. But 1 and 2, 6 implies K minus 1, but 1 implies 1. I think because the arrow reversed, the K minus 1 became K plus 1. Okay, K plus 1. Okay, so let me do the diagram. So you have this diagram, this diagram, and the surprise is which one? This one or something? Which one? This one or something like this? Wait. No. No, the other way. The diagonal this way. Right? So the k to y implies k minus 1 is by definition. The other ones are highly non-trivial, and this is kind of unexpected. Unexpected. I mean, I would bet that this is true in general. In general, and we have this is true for arbitrary isolated singularities. So, have you made in general which assumptions you want to draw? No, I mean just complex analytic overriding. I mean in gener I what's not general about the main theorem? The L CI assumption. And I mean the reason, I mean it might be, I mean the reason that It might be, I mean, the reason that we need LCI, the reason that we need LCI is because you work with Keller differentials, and in the LCI case, you have a two-step resolution. That's what we can do. So, I know other people might. And anyway, let me put kind of thesis that you are going to start with now. This is we found that this medium wanting to x, so this is hyper surface singularities. x is k1 if and only if the alpha tilde is greater or equal than k plus 1 and k rational if and only if alpha tilde is greater than k plus 1. This is Saito's. This is Saitos minimal exponent or something like this. The low canonical threshold is kind of the webinar of this one. This is a mean of alpha tilde one. And additionally, if x is kind of isolated similarities, alpha tilde of f is just the minimal spectrum. just the minimal spectral numbers the minimal spectral number which means that in practice in practice I mean if you have isolated isolated say weighted homogeneous similarities you can compute this alpha tilde to be just the sum of the weights so concrete So, completely the ODP in dimension 2k plus 1 is k u1 and this is kind of an effect or the gif and all the key indimension to k is k irrational, but this is not the defect of the gift. Okay, so in practice you have ways to produce many KPY rational similarities. For instance, if you have weighted homogeneous similarities, you just do the sum of the weights. And the notable thing is that the nodes are kind of k du bois, k d rational, roughly half in dimension over 2 for k equals whatever dimension over 2 minus 1 minus. Over 2 minus 1 minus 2. So in the hypersurface case, this seems to be. Yeah, I mean, in the hyper, once you have the theorem, then of course this is a trivial corollary. But I think we prove, I mean, first you prove the theorem in the other way, or whatever. So it's not that linear. So the first, this is the first theorem, this is the hard one. Anyway, let me come back to Uh let me come back to the Paul's numbers because um you missed the punch language for that. So the two theorem. So theorem for NASA. So let's assume that I have X over S proper smooth L not proper flat family and the only assumption is that X zero Assumption is that X0 is KD1 LCI, local complete intersection singularities, I mean for JD1, something like that. Then the conclusion is that R, okay, I should call this one F, R F lower star, RQF lower star, omega, the relative Keller differentials from Relative Keller differentials on the total space. Push forward, this is locally free and compatible with, this is the key word, arbitrary base changes. So for reduced, for s reduced, this simply means that means that HPQ with P less equal than K for, of course, for P less equal than K and over Q for P less equal than K stays constant in that properties. Are we good? So so so the K to war condition is exactly the local condition that guarantees any preservation of the Hodge numbers. And the thing that's preserved in the Hodge diamond is this kind of lower right side. Now combine with the definition. Now, combine with the definition for rational. I mean, once you know that you are in the previous URL. So, for rational, for rational, k rational basically is the same thing as kb1. This is a corollary of the main theorem one kv1 plus partial cell duality. Center of the one with so kind of for K rational you get the whole symmetries H Q H N minus P N minus Q and you get a bonus one which is H. Monus one, which is HQP and four p. That's it. But okay. The one thing that's missing, and I mean this is maybe laziness or running out of steam. It's missing the symmetry. Maybe let me do let me give the forge diamond. So this is okay, this is okay. And this is kind of open. So. So that one I bet that's true, but we we didn't prove it means that is not okay so just to pack, let me switch and at least take my theorems. Theorems for the Calatia also. So the K-Dubois condition, and I mean this is our perspective, most of the popular inside of whatever come from a junction and stuff. So the K-Dubois condition is a Condition is the one that guarantees some preservation of the Hausd numbers, and the rationality is the extra symmetry condition and partial cell duality thing, if you want, partial concern. Okay, and going back, going back where I started, the formations of Galabio. So let me So sorry, so in on the left bow we say colorial mentee remote. So that's in the LCN case? Yeah, yeah, sorry, everything is LC. Oh, you you mentioned that. Yeah, I mean I mean it's why and I mean whatever Mirja has an entire industry working, whatever. Tori case Working, whatever, Tori case, Gaussian singularity case, and all of that. It's not clear that whatever. The problem is not that the complex is the Keller differentials. Maybe those are not the right thing in that situation. But anyway, so the first theorem, this is generalization, an inverse generalization of Hava Mata Ramican, which says the following. So here I need what from x is a So here I need what from X is LA and fold L C I non-necessarily is isolated, non-necessarily isolated and the key assumption is one then bad formations affects R and I'm stuck. I mean, in dimension three, in dimension three, one to one is equivalent to ordinary theorem. So in dimension three, this is exactly theorem. But in general, whatever. This is a vast universe, not isolated, we know nothing. And I mean, this is, I bet, this is the optimal. T1 Q1. So we prove it by using our theorem on whatever push forward of whatever relative KL differentials and whatever. So the T1 lifting right element. This is the best you can do kind of in terms of general thing. And I mean key here is that in the previous theorem, Theorem, S is allowed to be non-involved. Okay. So remember that we had the push forward of the higher Keller differentials for mid-base change and that. If S is reduced, it's just the same saying that the Hauth numbers are preserved under small deformations. But our theorem holds. But our theorem holds in absolute generality S is actually S is a spectrum of another thing that that you need here. No, no, that one was actually earlier. So this one doesn't use which one doesn't use page? No, no, so this only uses Dubois. So this only uses the constancy of a certain piece of the Haushtime. Of the Hoist timer. The theorem about rational is the next one. Here we need X cannot be Yau n for not okay, not one rational actually either. I mean, the theorem says something meaningful. If you are not one rational, then basically you can defer x to first order to one to one. And finally, let me say of theorem C, which is the intersection of theorem A plus theorem B. B if X is not one rational but one to one then X is movable if and only if there is a topological Linear condition analog to the Friedman condition, analog f condition in dimension Friedman. This kind of situation we call one linal, and again this is equivalent to all a p dimensional thing. But not one rush is supposed to be. Okay, so let me say it in words. If you have somewhat mild singularities, which means one du bois, so in dimension three it means O dp, but in higher dimensions it means much more. So if you have somewhat mild singularities, then the deformations are unobstructed, the modular space is smooth. On the other hand, On the other hand, to smooth singularity, to guarantee the existence of smoothness, you need bad singularities. You need so everything is rational, everything that we are describing. Then you have kind of one new one, have one rational and smaller stuff. So for this kind of thing here, we have smooth ability. Movability, the first order on the nose. For stuff here, we have smooth ability subject to a topological constraint. For stuff that's here, we have an obstruct. And kind of this is the region. Kind of this is the region where both things apply. So bad singularities are smoothable, good singularities are unobstructed. And there exists kind of like the ordinary double points in dimension three, where kind of both du and supply. And that should, is it clear what I'm saying? And And actually, the one thing, I mean, let me just close and let me just make one final thing. So, in particular, Fieldman Lazar 22, whatever, we have several papers, do not say anything. Anything about smoothability of calabi yellows if all the keys in dimension larger than larger equal than four. The point is that these are too too mild for our techniques. Theorem did see a Theoretically, I think they require, actually, they require isolated hypersurface. But still. And I mean here I should mention a paper of Rolensk and Thomas. Okay, roughly ten, fifteen years ago. 10-15 years ago, which says that Calabios with ODP in O dimensions are smoothable implants non-linear topological constraints. And what about our final theorem? That would be theorem of D, I guess. Okay, this general answers to k linear singularities, where k linear means not k rational, but k divided by Okay. So the the upshot the upshot is the upshot is that again the upshot is that bed singularities are smoothable kind of on the nose and the mouse singularities satisfy increasingly complicated more complicated conditions to be smoothable. So if you have a collabial with ordinary double points, and this condition I mean, and these conditions are only necessary. We don't know if they are sufficient. Maybe I think they have some under very strong conditions, they have also the sufficient for ordinary double points in five dimensions or something. I think my time is up. I'm happy to answer questions now after that. So can you tell me about what the topological condition looks like in general? Because there's no small resolution. Yeah, I mean the point yeah, I mean the point I mean, let me. So, the point is that you are looking at GURL F maybe KHN minus K of the link, and this maps this maps to the to the H. the H something like H n of any resolution of H n plus 1. So there you take any resolution, you can make it even resolution free, you are looking at the length of the singularity. And the punchline is that such a gadget is one dimensional, is dimension one if If aim. So, and I mean, this was the starting point of Rolensky and Thomas. So, basically, they observed that if you have all finite double points, then you can resolve whatever the standard resolution would be, an even-dimensional quadric. And what you should look at is a difference of two. Look at that is a difference of two rubles and one minus L2. Okay, right here. Okay. This is kind of the class that gives you the correct homology and you get a condition involving powers and stuff like that. So that's pretty subtle. So then the reason I So then the reason I guess you restrict to like one Dubois but not one rational is because in the one rational case this dimension is like zero or something and then it's. No, no, so so so our our okay and I mean kind of this was the idea and I mean kind of it's a bit hard I don't know if I'm on paper or not. Uh so so s so in the dynamic awareness template uh paper is a bit hard to to to follow was the main the main idea. Follow was the main idea. The main point is that if you have a bad singularity, you get a certain piece in the Hodge filtration that whatever, that you can deform and that improves singularities. So if you deform in that direction, you improve the singularities. If you are at least one rational, that piece in the Hodge filtration mechanism, this is coming from the resolution and stuff like that, that piece is zero. That PC is zero. So you get no improvement. So they are our methods, our methods. And it's fairly subtle, and maybe, I mean, it's fairly subtle to go deeper, deeper. I mean, what's happening, and I mean, maybe, maybe this is, maybe let me put this one. So under one Dubois assumption, you get a Hoch diamond for B, let's say, in dimension. Would be, let's say, in dimension, it's H minus some CH1. So under, and whatever it might be. So this piece is preserved. Under one equal. And you use this C to improve the situation. But if you are one rational, then you get one H1. H1, and this is also preserved, and you have nothing, and I mean, this is what controls the deposition flow. I mean, the reality is that if you are in higher dimensions, you need to go deeper into the whole filtration. And this is what they did, Lorenzo, Tommas, and whatever. We could start with on there. So the I mean my the punch, I mean I have two things and whatever to to say. So first of all, I mean kind of this higher rational and higher seem quite abstract. But they are absolutely natural and I mean this is the answer I don't know who asked why funnels are better behaved. I mean in inside my theorem, my theorem My theorem, my theorem, my theorem about cubic fourfold is that the stable ones are one rational and the boundary ones are one-to-one. And I think that for funos, you'll have this type of result. So, K-stable funo and whatever, something all degrees like that will be higher, whatever, higher rational. So, fairly mind singularities. Singularities. So that's kind of why funnels are better to end that. So, and the second thing is this kind of phenomenon, which I mean, it was observed in dimension three, but kind of not fully digested. These bed singularities can be improved once you get to whatever fairly mild singularities and whatever. Then there is not much you can do. I mean, we only have necessity conditions. In equality. Of course, I mean. Yeah, I mean, our result is that if you have stuff that's not one U2, you can smooth it on the nose. I mean, globally. But the problem, I mean, it's kind of like a catch-22 situation. I mean, the problem is that with no abstractness, if you are not one, you want. You are not one, you want. So it's only one to first order. You see, so to first order, you have even smoothing in the strong sense, the total space is smooth in the hypersurface singularity. So you can prove that whatever to first order. But you cannot, you don't have an abstractness. What's happening in dimension three is that you have a very kind of whatever, something else happens in dimension three. Of whatever something else terminates in dimension three, and you have these results of Kawa Mata, not Namikawa, which says that terminals in dimension free have unobstructed deformations. That's not proved by T1. As I said, I mean, the T1 criterion of Kavamata runs its course. I mean, kind of our theorem is the optimal theorem there. So, like, one du bois, Calabi, Yaus, no other condition. And L C I. An LCI in the current version, but that's likely to be dropped eventually as Aronov's stuck out. So the module I have Calabi House with one duvoir is smooth. And actually I should maybe just okay, sorry I'm taking time, but so let me just put a funnel to your end. Let me put a funnel to your end. So the funnel, I mean the funnel I mean the final for us, you get better results of DRM. So final three-fold canonical isolated hypersurface singularities then a formation surface are unobstructed plus plus smooth forward. Let's move forward. Previously I so the punchline is that for funo you have better results in the sense you don't see this kind of topological obstruction that you see for caloric damage. And the reason is that for funos you have more negative You have more negativity, more positivity, you have more vanishing, you are using the anti-canonical divisor to that. I mean, in final case, I mean, it's not inconceivable that under some sort of LCI condition, you get productive performance and stuff like that. So funny is better behavior. Anyway, I'm just gonna go. So there are some questions about shadowing. Some questions of Shonder. Yeah, Shonda has two questions. First, in the K du Bois implies K minus one rational statement, do you expect or know that the L CIS empty is a necessary example of it being false? No, I mean I know no. The answer is no, I have no idea. But as I said, so there are two theorems. I put them kind of theorem item A and B, but it's really two theorems. So Two theorems. So K irrational implies K du Bois. I think that's true in absolute generality. And I mean, in my reading of Saito, I even have a proof, but I'll note that on that. Okay, but the other one is much more sensible than whatever. So that one I would assume that some LCI type. That some LCI-type condition is necessary. The second question then: Do you know an example of an LCI canonical singularity that is not one just flawed? Wait. Yeah, I mean, it's just I mean, you you can cool as I said, I mean, uh you have this sum of the weights. I mean it's weight i mean it is in the weighted homogeneous and you can cook up anything and actually actually we have i mean we i mean you can cook anything you want just by weighted homogeneous because whatever so we have a proof that that k liminal which is kind of like k du bois but not k rational exists in all dimensions and all kind of range of k just by weighted homogeneous because Homogeneous because just look after weights. So that's and I mean, yeah, I mean, so basically the typical rational singularity will not be one to one. Okay. Any other questions? Okay, so let's think we're going to again.
