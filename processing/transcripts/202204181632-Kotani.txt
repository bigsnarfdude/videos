Okay, so today I'm going to talk about something about non-linear integrable equations described by Sattle's Sager-Wilson theory. Okay, here is abstract. Sattle proposed a unified constructive way of treating certain class of Completing a certain class of nonlinear PDEs in 1980. Later in 1985, his idea was realized as a flow on a Grassmannian manifold, which I write by GR new, which is consisting of all closed subspaces W of W of the Hilbert space L2 on the circle with radius R with center the origin. And new, the index new here describes the invariance of this subspace. That means if we multiply Z to the power nu to the to W, it's contained in W. It's contained in W. So W is invariant under the multiplication operation Z to the power nu. Nu is an integer and positive integer. If nu equal to, we have a Grassmannian marker GR2 with this Z to the second power invariance. Then this flow generates the Then this flow generates the KDV flow. KDV equation is this one. The number, one over whole and three over two is not important. You can replace these numbers coefficient by any other real numbers. So this is the non-linear path. non-linear partial differential equation. And it is known that if you regard this solution for each fixed T, if you regard this solution as a potential for the one-dimensional shredding operator, then it was a great discovery in the 1960s that the Is that the spectrum of the shredding operator is invariant with respect? It does not depend on time t. So this was a great discovery and its discovery helped very much to solve this KDV equations. But the method of The method of solving this KDB equation crucially depends on the inverse spectral problems for the one-dimensional speeding operators. And the inverse spectral problems are very much deeply studied when the potential. when the potential is decaying or potential U is periodic. And so depending on the inverse spectral problems, one can solve the creative equation because of this invariance of the spectrum. But the study of inverse spectral problems is essentially Organs is essentially only in decaying potentials or periodic potentials. So we had the restriction to the initial data for solving the KDB equation. But later, recently, I could extend that situation to include the more general. To include the more general initial data, such as ergodic initial data. My method is to extend this observation of Sato and Sagar Wilson to a more general hilbert space. Hilbert space here, it was Hilbert space on the circle, it's a bounded curve on the complex plane. But to extend this theory, I had to consider their theory on the unbounded curve, the earth space on the unbounded curve. Okay, so So, but today I don't speak much about that extension, but today I would like to focus their method, the Satto-Sagar Horizon method, can be extended and to include more general nonlinear non-linear equations including bushiness equation and or nonlinear shredding equation okay so this is a list of integrable nonlinear pdes of course there are much more integrable nonlinear pdes non-linear PDEs other than this. But this list was this list of non-linear integrable PDEs was mentioned by Sato. And Satto's Grassmann Manihold method, he claimed that these non-linear equations can be also treated. Equation can be also treated by his method. But he did not concretely give the way how to include these equations to his theory. So, but at least for these three equations. These three equations, KDB or Bushnesk, and the non-linear Schwading equation, I would include these three equations to the Sattle-Sagar-Wilison theory. Hockey-digit equations, I already mentioned that Sagar-Wilison constructed the solution by Sattle's method. But Bush Ness. But Bushnesk or nonlinear Schwerdinger equations. I couldn't find any papers treating these two equations by Sato-Sagar-Wilson theory. So today I want to address how to include these two equations to the Sattl-Sagar equation. Sager equation, uh, Saturn-Sager-Orson uh theory. Okay, but uh, other uh, these uh equations, Savada, Cotela, Benjamin, Ono, Saint-Gordon, Lundbledge equation, I don't I don't know how to include this equation to the Sattle-Sigur equation, although Sattle Already mentioned that every equation in this list can be included in the Sattle theory. Okay. And I also mentioned that these equations has, every these equations has a physical background. So these equations have some meaning in fluid dynamics. Uh fluid dynamics or motion of surface. So, first of all, how what is the Sattl Segal theory? I want to explain. I want to explain the theory in KDB equations case. Before beginning the explanation of Saturn's ego recent theory, I want to mention one fundamental fact about rax payer. Sattle mentioned that these integrable equations has a Lux pair. What is Lux pair? Lux pair is a pair of differential operators, L and P. L is the so-called underlying differential operator, which takes this form. Nu is a positive integer. Nu is a positive integer. The top order is nu. And the second order is nu minus two. And so on. And P is a differential operator such that the order of the this is a commutator of P and L. The commutator of P and L is again a differential operator. And if the order of this commutator P and L is less than or equal to nu minus two, we call this pair L and P by the Lux pair, Lux pair. So this condition, the order of P and L is less than or equal to nu minus two is a very strong. Nu minus two is a very strong condition. And for given error, you can compute p with these properties. The commutator, the order of commutator is less than or equal to. You can find by hand calculation, you can find P if we are given L. But that computation is becoming very complicated if new. Very complicated if new getting larger and larger, okay. And uh, so suppose we have a lag spare L and P, okay, and I assume this commutator takes this home, because we are assuming the order of P, the commutator P and L is less than or equal to nu minus two, then this commutator should have this hormone. this home starting from nu minus two different derivative of nu minus two okay so uh if if uh f nu minus two is a coefficient of these differential operators okay so it is uh known uh this coefficient fj is a universal polynomials of uh derivative of this uh q. This Q Q K Q is a coefficient of L. Okay. Then if we consider this Q, the unknown coefficient Q, depend on time t and x, and if we consider this operator equation, which it is equivalent. which it is equivalent to this ordinary differential equation. So for a given L, if we could find P with lux pair, then one can consider this differential equation and which is equivalent to this operator equation. Therefore, if we consider the index new The index new is equal to, then L is a shredding operator and we can find the P in this form. And if we compute the commutator between P and L, then we have this scalar operation. This is the zero order differential operation. This is nothing but the operator. The operator multiplication operators by these functions. Okay, so if nu equals two, then this dark spare, the commutator P L should have order zero, which is nothing but this is a multiplication operators, zero order differential operator. So this This operator equation is equivalent to the KDB equation. So, KDB RAX found this beautiful relationship between shredding operators and KDV equations. And why this helps to study KDV equation? Is this because This is that because if we have gradification and suppose Q is a solution for the gradification, then we have this operator equation. This means since P is anti-symmetric, anti-symmetric or anti-self-adjoint operators, Operators, then this equation immediately implies that the spectrum or the shredding operator L does not depend on the time T. Because P generate the time evolution of P describes the unitary operators. So L T and L zero, these two shredding operators is unitarily equivalent. So this Lux pair, if you could find Lux pairs and if you consider these nonlinear equations, then you have some invariance. So and invariance, that invariance helps greatly to Possibly to solve the non-linear equations here. But also, this discovery is great, but this does not help to give a concrete solution to the credit equation. Solve this equation is not clear. Okay, especially what kind of initial data can be a candidate to solve these nonlinear equations. That is an open problem. But anyway, this structure helps you greatly to Structure helps you greatly to solve the nonlinear equations. So I want to explain briefly what is the Sattle Segal origin theory called the KDV equation. This theory actually gives a concrete way to construct a solution to the Solution to the Clay D B equations. So I want to explain their theory briefly. She is circle with center with the origin and the radius R. R is can be arbitrary, positive number. And on this circle, we define the hardy space H plus minus, which is nothing but all these functions. Fourier, if we expand the L2 function on the circle, then the H plus consisting of the all L2 function All electrical functions Fourier coefficient demand non-bunishing only for the positive index. It minus is the contrary and only the negative coefficient in the index coefficient remains. Okay, so H plus in other way uh in other way uh h plus is a consisting of all holomorphic analytic functions inside the circle and h minus is a consisting of all analytic functions outside the circle so but and l2 on the on this circle c uh is decomposed into two spaces Composed into two spaces, H plus and H minus. In this case, H plus and H minus is orthogonal. And I introduce the symbol space A. Here is a vector, vector varied functions A1 and A2. A1, A2 are both a bounded meterable function on the circle C. Circle C. And for giving a vector valued function A, we define the multiplication of the scalar scalar u is a scalar valued function. Border A is a vector, but I define the multiplication by this way. Then if we denote W A. If we denote W A as a product of A with H plus, H plus is the hardest space on the disk. Then WA satisfies this invariance. That to the power to second power invariant. Because of this multiplication. So, WA is a candidate of the Satos-Guras-Mannier manifold. And I define the projection from L2C to H plus minus by this Caucasian. Cauchy integral. Okay. And I define temperature operator with symbol vector symbol A on H plus by this identity. T plus is a projection onto H plus. So T A defines a bounded operator from the operator from H plus to H plus. And I denote the old symbol A with this property by A inverse. This templates operator, if this template operator has a bounded inverse, then I denote I denote all symbols A satisfying this properties by A A inverse. This property is very important, the existence of inverse operator of T Fritz operator T A. It is not trivial that whole It is not trivial that what kind of symbol A this inverse exists that is not a trivial question. So we consider a commutative group gamma, which is which is this one, g equal e to the power h. H is an analytic function in a neighborhood of the function in a neighborhood of the disk D plus. D plus is the inside of the circle. So D plus is a disk. Then one can multiply G to this function G to this symbol, vector value symbol usually. And we have a new symbol. So this is trivial. But this is not trivial. If we have a symbol which belonging to A inbus, and if we multiply G, then we don't know if the new symbol GA is again an element of Element of a inbus. So, but so this is one important, one difficult point. But anyway, I assume the whole some symbol A with these properties, G A is again A inverse. Imbus. So I pick up a very special element of gamma, which is this one. T and X is a real parameters. And as a function of G, E T X is an element of gamma. And I assume symbol A is always an element of A inverse. Is an element of A inverse after multiplication of E T X inverse for any parameter X and T from the real numbers. Then because of this, the definition of a impus, if we state that condition in another word, then this. In other words, then this condition is equivalent to this P plus projection from this space to H plus is one to one. So this condition is equivalent to say that this T plus is one to one. So I define this function f, a function of t x and z. X and Z that is complex numbers by this operation. Then this one is an element of constant one is an element of H plus. Therefore, if we multiply, if we operate T inverse to the one, then we have element of H plus. then we have an element of H plus because T price operator is an operation from H plus to H plus. So we have an element of H plus. And if we multiply A, then we have an element of W A. So as a function of Z, co fixed T and X, F is an element of W A pair. So one can easily see that one can easily see that from the definition of f has this home this this term is an element of h minus okay then if we take twice derivative then we have this form this is a polynomial part with respect to z and other time And other term is order of z minus. This term is an element of h minus. Then if we compute this one, then we have, we don't eliminate, we can eliminate this polynomial terms. So this difference is consisting... Differences consisting only of this factor and times this terms, which is an element of H minus. So if we apply P plus to this function, then we have zero because this is an element of H minus. And P plus is a projection from H plus to H plus. projection from H plus to H plus. Therefore, if we have applied this P plus to this function, we have zero. But we assume P plus is one to one. Therefore, this condition immediately implies this function vanishes, which means f satisfies as a function of x, f satisfies this trading equations. Okay. So if we So, if we are given simple A satisfying these properties, then we have, we can create a shredding equation. So, this term plays a lot of potentials. R1 is the first coefficient of this expansion. R1 is the first coefficient. And we can do a similar thing. Here we took a derivative with respect to the space and the second derivative. If we take a derivative with respect to t, then we have a similar expansion of that derivative. And if we eliminate, then we have a third power polynomials if we take the derivative with respect to t. Derivative with respect to t because with respect to t we have z to the power three. So if we take derivative with respect to t then we have z to the power three in front of the exponential, then we have here we have a polynomial of third order, third degree. So another next thing is to eliminate by linear combination by making linear combination of making linear combination of derivative of t and using derivative of x. And then we can eliminate the polynomial terms here by making these linear combinations. Then immediately, if we apply P plus, we have zero properties. zero properties. Okay. And then compared in this identity, if we compare the coefficient of z inverse, then we have this identity. And in another argument, one can show that these shows that these R2 and R3 or higher Rj, generally Rj can be described by R1 and their derivatives. Therefore, one can replace R2 or R3 by the derivative of R1. And one can immediately see that this equation is equivalent to this one. To this one. Just close the equation for the first coefficient R1. So this is nothing essentially credible equations. So this is a magic way to obtain KDV equations. So this method also give a method also give a concrete way to to have a solution for the care equation because r1 is a fast coefficient of f okay r1 here and how to obtain f is by this home f is defined by this expression so if we have a So if we have a symbol A and if we compute F in this way, then as a fast coefficient R1, one has a solution to the Kdb equation. And the derivative of first coefficient appears here as a potential of the spreading operators. So this is the So this is the equation obtained for this special function, ETX Z to the power 3. But if we replace Z to the power 3 to the other odd power n like here, then we have another nonlinear equation. Replacing this derivative by n's derivative here and some nonlinear term here. And so we have a countably many nonlinear equations belonging to this framework. That countably many nonlinear equations is called KDB hierarchies. Maybe hierarchies, okay. So, okay, and Sato also discovers that this solution, U, U here, here is a, I mistake, R1, R1 derivative. You have to replace A by R, okay. R1 derivative. One derivative. Then this u can be expressed by this form, where tau a is a so-called tau function, which is defined by this Frederuk determinant. T is a temporized operator. So this is a very simple form of the solution to the case. Solution to the KDV equation. Okay, so any other higher order KDV equations can be obtained by this way. And also, I want to mention that this expression, if we put t equals zero, then you have initial potentials. potentials. So this expression also mentioned how to obtain inverse spectral problems. For a given potential, if we construct this tau function, then you immediately obtain the potential ux if you put t equals zero. So this explained also So this explained also another way to obtain the in-bar spectral problem. So this method, although we have many nonlinear equations, if we that crucially depends on the invariance of this. Invariance of this space, this one, invariance of this space here, two appears. So if we consider other invariants, invariant space, for instance, three, if you replace three, what happens? That is the next theme, which Which is a Business equation. Business equation appears if we replace, if we consider new equals three, then the underlying operator L is the third order, three order differential operator of this form, which appeared in RAX pairs. Then the symbol space A is a three-dimensional vector vector functions, bounded functions on the circle C. And I denote omega is this number, complex number. This is the root of the if we If we take three power three, omega to the power three, then we have one. So omega is a root of that equation, a simple equation. Okay. So, and I define the multiplication between this symbol, three-dimensional symbol, and scarce function u by this summation. Mention. Okay. And then if we define WA by this way, then we can immediately see, we easily see that WA has invariance of this form. Then one can do a similar thing as before. In this case, ETX will take E to We take E to the power this one here, Z to the second power, okay, to the power two. Then one can do exactly the similar things. And one obtained that this Business equation. R1 is again the first coefficient. Then R1 satisfied this. Satisfied this nonlinear equation. And if we define Q1 as a multiplication of some constant times of R1, then we have this Business equation. So, but in this case, if we case, if nu equal to 2, then the underlying operator L is a shredding operator, which has a serjoint properties. But if nu equals 3, then L is no longer has a serjoint properties. Okay. So it is It is so if nu equals two to have a more general solution it is to have a more general solution we have to replace this circle by an unbounded curve but if nu equal to that If nu equals two, that extension was possible. But if nu equals three, then L is no longer a self-adjoint opera. So the extension to the unbounded curve is non-trivial. So for the business equations to the extension of The extension of extension to have more general solution is non-trivial because of the non-service adjointness of this underlying operator. Okay, so the next non-linear equation is non-linear shredding equation. In this way, okay, so I want to mention one thing more. If we one thing more uh if you if we consider uh another new uh four or five and countably uh you can consider countably many news then we have uh underlying operator higher order differential operators then one can do similar things then one has other class of non-linear equations non-linear equations. Okay. For new equals three, this for new equal two, that procedure consists of create a cadway hierarchy, countably many equations. But for new equals three, we have an other country many nonlinear equations, which I call it Business hierarchy. Hierarchy. Okay. So if we replace these two by other integers, then we have countably many another countably many nonlinear equations. So in this way, we have many nonlinear equations. But there is another way to construct other class of nonlinear equations. That is to construct. And that is to consider vector Hardy space, which is H plus product of H plus. Then the simple space is a matrix one, in this case, two by two matrix. Then we consider this W A which is closed subspace of Close subspace of this vector L2 space on the circle C. And the group gamma is a matrix group, G and G inverse. And G is a scalar function, E to the power H, which is an element of gamma. H is an analytic function on the function on the on the in a neighborhood of the circle at the disk disk and if we consider etx of this form here we have i here and capital i is the identity denotes the identity two by two matrix then if we consider this if we assume that this temperature operator has a bounded inverse Bounded inverse, and if we multiply symbol A, and if we consider this matrix varied function, then we have this expansion. Here we have a matrix Rj coefficient. Then if we consider drag operator of this form, and if we this first matrix coefficient, we denote this entry, q1, q2, other entry. Q1, Q2, other entries are not important. Okay. Then this F satisfies this equation. This T means denotes the transpose of F. So this L is the underlying operators. And this R1. Uh, R1 here, Q1 and Q2 are entries. Then Q1, Q2 satisfies with the same procedure as we did in the KDB case. We have this non-linear equations with respect to Q1 and Q2. And if we pick up Uh, pick up a special symbol, matrix symbol A, with this home, then we get one can show easily that Q2 is a Q1 conjugate, which gives this single, you can replace this Q2 by Q1 bar, which is a non-linear threading equation, which is called defocusing. This sign means This sign means the focusing non-linear shading equation. And in this case, the underlying Dirac operator, because Q2 is Q1 bar, this underlying operator, L, is a cell adjoint. If I assume if A takes this form minus A here, then Here, then you can show easily that Q2 is minus Q1, Q1 conjugate, which gives a plus sign here, which is a non-linear shredding activation, but which is called focusing non-linear shredding operation. But in this case, here, underlying operator L, if Q2 is minus Q1 bar, two is minus q1 bar so l is no longer self-adjoint but uh l satisfies these symmetries uh j is uh j is a this matrix c is a denotes the conjugate complex conjugate operations okay so j is this operation uh this matrix and with this matrix j l has this symmetry okay Symmetry. This kind of symmetry is called J cell adjoint, but itself is not serjoint. So if we consider defocusing NLS, then the underlying operator L is self-adjoint. Therefore, in this case, one can However, in this case, one can extend, I think one can extend without not much difficulty to obtain the more general solutions by replacing the circle C by with other unbounded curves C, which I did in the KDB case. But I haven't finished the computation, so I couldn't mention precise extension for the non-linear defocusing shielding equation to obtain the general solution. But at least if we consider only on the bounded circle C. Only on the banded circle C, then everything is very clear, and we can do exactly the same things as we did in the KDB equation if we consider only the focusing address. But if we want to consider focusing address, then we have some difficulty because of this lack of self-adjointness. A lack of self-adjointness. So this is how to connect the shredding operators, spectral quantities of the shredding operators and symbol A. Okay, so if we case the underlying operator L is the shredding operator. underlying operator L is a Schroding operator. So we have a while function m plus minus and from m plus minus we define another m function m by this way. Then we have this symbol, one can define symbol A with this m function by this way. And one can easily see that A is an element of A in bus. And this This symbols create a KDV equation and a potential Q also. And that potential has this value functions. Therefore, if we by this consider by this symbol A created by Created by wire function m, one can extend to to obtain, to extend the theory to more general curves. If we could find this symbol described by viral functions, then it is not difficult to extend the saddle-segular recent theory. Start of seller recent theory for unbounded curve C. Okay, so the focusing NRS, then if we denote phi by this way, by using the viral function m or the drag operator or the focusing NLS, the drag operator is self-adjoint, so we have a viral function. And if we define A in this way, Define A in this way, then one can easily see that A is a element of A inverse. And it is, I didn't finish the computation, but I think I believe that extension to get more general solution is possible. Okay. But okay. So Okay. So there are so we have open questions so so I explained two nonlinear equations, Bucinesk equation for and NLS nonlinear Sweden equation. But the essential The essential things which we need is that these properties, this is one-to-one properties. In other words, these properties is crucial to obtain non-linear shading solution equations or Bushinetsku equation. But to check, to verify these properties, To verify these properties for this group of we have to use the viral functions. In other words, we have to use self-adjointness of the underlying operators. Therefore, if we want to treat Bushnetsk equation or focusing NLS equations, the generalization to obtain the more general solution. To obtain the more general solutions is highly non-trivial because the underlying differential operator is non-zero joint. So this is my open question. How to obtain more general solution for these two non-linear equations. So also it is often problem to obtain how to to obtain uh how to obtain uh solution for more other non-linear equation I listed here okay but Sattle mentioned that these also these equations uh also can be obtained by his grass money and minehold method but they he did not give a concrete way Concrete way to give a solution to pair. So this is two main papers I referred. These are very good papers. Thank you for your attention. I stopped. I stop here. Thank you. Are there questions for Peterson? Questions? Thank you again. Well, for today, then you all in the morning.   Yeah, I don't know.
