I said I'll just click that so all the both are accepted. Yeah, exactly. Okay, those 330, we'll go ahead and get started. Happy to have Robert Neal kick off this next session. He's going to talk about non-marketing couplings of suburb money and diffusions. Thank you very much. And so Twitter is working. Special thanks to the organizers to Matsha Tai Jing and Tai. Jing and Tai. Thank you also to everyone for showing up for an afternoon talk. I know it's a late afternoon talk, so I'm aiming for fewer equations, more pictures. We'll see how I do. I should also say this is based on joint work with Yang Bing, who is in the audience. So you can also ask for her take on any of this. Also, Canada, so somehow thematically appropriate. So there's couplings and there's several money in manifolds. Sub-Riemannian manifolds. Hornander condition already came up, so maybe this is an audience that knows some sub-Riemannian geometry. I know some of it knows a lot of sub-Riemannian geometry. Also, couplings, I think, that come up, but for our first slide, we'll start from the ground floor and we'll point out, so as some diffusion, eto-diffusion, say, in general, I'm going to think of it as being an appropriate Brownian motion on some space. I'll be a little, you know, flexible with my use of Brownian motion. On some manifold, Riemannian, sub-Riemannian. He started from any. You started from anywhere, and the coupling is exactly what a coupling is. They have some joint law off the marginals or Brownian motion from the two points. What do you want to do? We're going to focus on this. We might swing back to this at the end. I hope there's something, a slide or two to say about that. But the goal is we're going to want the processes to meet quickly, so we're going to want the coupling time to be as small as possible. So the infumum of the first time that they meet, third. Time that they meet. They're diffusion, so once they meet, they can stay together. There's no reason they should separate because they're Markov, strong Markov processes. This needs a sort of reflection-style couplings, right? By way of contrast, the alternative would be you might want to keep them, say, almost surely as close as possible, application to like loss of diagnostic distance or something. And in that case, you're going to make them move kind of in lockstep. If you think about R2, you're not going to reflect them, so they come closer and flight. But we're going to try to reflect them. But we're going to try to reflect them so they come closer and collide as quickly as we can make them collide. So, why? There should be probably some reason to do this. I guess this goes by the name of the Aldus inequality. This will tell you that if script L, I didn't define script L as the law, so you look at the law of the Brownian motion at time t, the total variation distance between them is controlled by the coupling time. Between them is controlled by the coupling time, which if in particular probably would if they haven't coupled or that they have, it's one minus. If you think about that for a second, you're like, that makes sense. If they've coupled that masses together, it contributes nothing to the total variation difference. It's only masses that are at separate points that contribute to the total variation distance. And then it turns out you can also, and this is something we'll care about a little bit, if the dependence on the initial points and your initial distance is small, you get some. And your initial distance is small. You get some gradient estimates out of this. There's a connection to Louisville properties, sort of spectral gap information, eigenvalue, stuff like this. So those are the kind of questions that geometrically we want to come to, although we'll mostly focus on the probability here, I think, the construction of the coupling. There's sort of one idea, and it's a picture, as we'll see. So, quality of reflection couplings, a little bit of terminology. A little bit of terminology. If your goal is to make them meet, these are perhaps the things you're interested in. First of all, do they meet at all? It's successful if the coupling time is almost surely finite. Of course, it need not be the case, but okay, it's nice if it is. It's efficient if this ratio stays bounded. So if you think a central motivation is you want to try to control this total variation distance between the laws, or the total variation distance between the heat kernels, the heat kernel is the law of the ground in motion, just to put the standard terminology on it. To put the standard terminology on it, if you're already going to say Brownian motion, you may as well say heat kernel for the law. This is at least saying that asymptotically you have the right rate of decay. If your total variation norm decays at 1 over t, this is going to see the 1 over t, maybe not the right constant, but you're going to get the right order of decay or the right exponential order or whatever. And then stronger than efficient is this notion of a coupling being maximal. And I made the equal sign in red. Maybe you should have found a way to bold it. I don't know, because the point is. I don't know, because the point is that you always have the inequality one way here, but a maximal coupling makes us an exact equality. So you get precisely the total variation distance between the heat kernels from the coupling time and its tail probability. Okay, so all these things are good, I guess roughly in order of increasing power, though that's not quite strict. So motivation. When you do something subramanian, a natural When you do something sub-Romanian, a natural thing to do is point out the Romanian case and then explain why everything is worse. This is the pessimistic approach to sub-Romanian geometry, which I'm just sort of inclined to follow by personality, if nothing else. So the depressing approach. So we start with a pictorial, as I said, no equation but a picture. You understand from the picture, hopefully in a brief explanation exactly what's going on here. In the Romanian case here of the Kendall-Cranston mirror coupling, it's fairly well known. I should point out. Well known, I should point out. You get a very nice exposition of this from Elton's book. You should read Elton's book in general in life, but you should also read it for this. So, this is meant to be just some random minimal geodesic on some Riemannian manifold that has some perverture and no particular properties. So, you're at two points, you have a geodesic connecting them, and the way you couple them on a surface where you can draw it, and it's analogous in higher dimensions, is along the direction opposite, they should be kind of reflective. Opposite, they should be kind of reflective. So it's a pointwise reflection. And along the perpendicular direction or directions, they should move in lock step. And so I can't help but you know say like they go like this, like this, and like this, like this. So you get a reflection infinitesimally, and the driving Brownian motions are meant to be the same, right? These are not independent, they're very dependent. So there's one Brownian motion that drives the parallel directions, the second one that drives the perpendicular. The second one that drives the perpendicular directions, this is Markov, because at any point in time, it just evolves depending on the current position. You set up this geometry with the bundle of orthodox frames or whatever machinery you would like. It's this infinitesimal reflection. It gives an SDE on m cross m. And so you feel like you're going to get somewhere with Ito's rule and classical techniques like that, and you would be entirely correct. Entirely correct. I should hasten to point out that from a technical point of view, a cut locus is a bit of a problem. So if you want a completely correct construction, you should see this nice paper from 2004 by Ben Renesy. Take some random walks. Because of course, the previous picture breaks down when you're on the cut locus. There's not just one minimal geodesic, or things move discontinuously, or you have various troubles. Various troubles, but somehow, from the point of view of motivating that the Romanian situation is nice, you say, well, those difficulties can be overcome, and you essentially morally end up with the previous picture. This coupling exists. Moreover, if you want to understand if these particles are going to meet, you should write down Edo's lemma for the distance between them, which off of the cutlop is a smooth function, so there's no problem to take some derivatives. And the second nice thing you see. And the second nice thing you see is that Edo's lemma gives you a nice SDE for the distance, which is completely compatible with sort of standard comparison geometry. So if you have some Ricci curvature bound, what you're going to see, if it's positive Ricci curvature, this looks like a Brownian motion run at double speed because it's reflected two Brownian motions, and then a drift turn that pushes you to the other, bigger when the Ricci curvature is bigger. So bigger Ricci curvature drives your particles together. Reaching curvature drives your particles together faster. You should couple faster when you have more positive reaching curvature. And this fits, as I say, very nicely in with classical Jacobi field estimates, index forms, this kind of business. And it's justified in part because it works very nicely. You get the sharp lower bound on the first eigenvalue for a Riemannian manifold doing this in two situations of classical interest. Interest. Positive lower Ricci bound. Then you get the sharp bound on this in terms of the bound. How it looks depends on your normalization for Rui curvature, but you get the right answer. And then, even more interesting, as I learned from your book, because the argument in the PD point of view is harder in this case, but from the probabilistic point of view, it's extremely well motivated. Any compact manifold with non-negative Ricci and finite diameter, I guess it's compact, so it should have finite diameter, you get the sharp bound in terms. You get the sharp bound in terms of the diameter. So in that case, if the reaching curvature is zero, infinitesimally they're not being forced together, but kind of the cut locus at the diameter kind of kicks you back. And so you can again see that these things are driven together globally, if not infinitesimally. And in the long run, you get the sharp decay rate for the worst case scenario, and so you get exactly the sharp bound. Bound. And probabilistic proof goes back to 84. So, in a sense, fairly classical. Okay. So, that was nice for several reasons. One, it was nice in Markovs. You had a clean construction. You kind of knew what to do. It was compatible with this comparison geometry. And you got the right answer. You got the sharp bound. And if you come back to the sharpness, because maybe If you come back to the sharpness, because maybe you want to try to mirror something like this in sub-Ramadian geometry, construct reflection-type couplings, try to say something about spectral gaps, whatever. So what made this sharp? It's related to, related to is sufficiently vague that I feel no problem saying it. In fact, the mirror coupling is sort of maximal on model spaces. So you're getting the sharp answer because this is dead on in the worst case scenario. Think about positive reg. That's especially nice. Sort of the worst case with positive Special and nice sort of the worst case with positive reach, you're getting the sphere. And on the sphere, this Kendall-Cranston mirror coupling is getting the exact value. And therefore, anything that obeys one-sided comparison against the sphere obeys the right upper bound, and you're getting the sharp upper bound for that category of manifolds, right? For things with a certain region lower bound, you're getting something sharp. So the mere coupling is maximal. We're coming back to the terminology from several slides ago. Analogy from several slides ago. So, why is it the case? I mean, this Kendall-Cranzy-mirror coupling is, I think, well-motivated. It makes sense. If you want particles to go together, you should couple them so that they do nothing in this direction. They move together in this direction. But you say, why is it maximal for these spaces here? We'll come to that in a second, but it leads to the related question: where do you get maximal couplings from at all? Those are perhaps independent. Those are perhaps of independent interest and of interest intersecting this topic. So, in general, you kind of always have maximal couplings, but it's abstract. I guess the paper is hard to track down, at least in English. But I think the idea is whatever the laws overlap, you just need to pair up the mass and check that measurability and everything are okay. And so you have some abstract existence result. And so you have some abstract existence result that there always will be a maximal coupling, but that's not necessarily useful for using a maximal coupling. That was alarming. It's a maximal coupling for cycling up there. Okay. To study anything. Also, it's maybe worth pointing out, they're not unique even on R. You can sort of You have a lot of symmetries for real-valued value and motion. You can go back and, in some non-Markov way, like adjust them or something. So maximal couplings exist, and there are maybe a lot of them. You have a lot of freedom to go back and perturb the path in a way that didn't change the law at some previous time. But this is not good. I figured that was Okay. Maybe that was sufficient? Maybe the fixed problems are strange. We'll make do. Markovian maximal couplings, which is maybe a more constructive direction here, like, well, if it's Markovian, maybe I could build it. Those are closely related to global reflections, which is some not so not so ancient, certainly not. Not so ancient, certainly not back to 84, work of Kazumasa from those years. And so, to be a little bit more concrete with manual adjustment, what the heck? Here's sort of your Kendall-Cranston mirror coupling without the geodesic drawn on R2. On R2, and here's kind of what you get. The point is, on a generic Riemannian manifold, this infinitesimal reflection along the geodesic doesn't get promoted to anything more global. It's purely local infinitesimal construction. You get some SDEs. But on R2, you're exactly getting this global reflection. If you start here and here, and you want to couple these things, you should just run this process. I maybe should have ran it longer. Obviously, I didn't quite drew it. I should have drawn it longer. I should have drawn until it hit here. On until it hits here, and then once it hits here, you take exactly the mirror path here, and they couple right at the bisector at the y-axis or x2-axis, depending on your notation. And so you can build the Kendall-Cranston mirror coupling for R2 without messing with SDEs. It's much more straightforward. You just reflect through the bisector of the two starting points. And for reasons that will become apparent in a minute, once you pick the starting points, you know the reflection. Starting points, you know the reflection. Which is sort of why, even though my description here, that I should draw this path, hit here, and then afterwards draw this path and hit it here, that actually is Markov. Because you know the line of reflection from the start. So as you're drawing this, you know what to draw here. It exactly matches the fingerprints of your coupling. So everything fits together very nicely. And the same is true for SN. So you do get a maximum coupling for spheres as well because you can reflect across the great circle separating the points. Circle separating the points. Works on the hyperbolic plane. You get a geodesic line at the midpoint, the bisector. You can reflect across that. So for all the Romanian space forms, you get these maximal couplings through global reflection. This is the part where, first of all, I adjust the slide manually for whatever reason. And secondly, having explained that you have a rather nice situation for Ramanian geometry, you complete. For Riemannian geometry, you complete kind of a pessimistic journey, and we explain that you don't have a nice situation for sub-Riemannian geometry. And so the sub-Riemannian geometry here is going to be pretty light in some sense because already the situation is bad for the Heisenberg group. So if the only sub-Riemannian manifold you care about is the Heisenberg group, you actually see quite a bit there. It's already hard for the Heisenberg group. And so that is the 3D Heisenberg is the most fundamental cybermanium manifold for most purposes, including. For most purposes, including ours. And so this thing really doesn't like me. You won't try to fix it. We have a minute or two to fix it. We did try to fix it. But if you hit the arrow key on your laptop, will it answer correctly? I don't know. Did this get resized in some strange way? I just feel like automatically just put it in the slideshow again. I can try. Slideshow. I can try. Um take off continuous scroll. Okay. You I have to do it over my shoulder, but I can do it. All right. All right. Let's try this. Fortunately, that's recorded for posterity. So the Heisenberg group is topologically R3. We put Cartesian coordinates on it. This is familiar to many people. On it. This is familiar to many people, maybe most, but we'll have a slide for it anyway. It turns out to be a Lie group, as the name might suggest. So here are some vector fields. In terms of geometry, you declare these guys to be orthonormal. That gives you the horizontal distribution and the inner product because they're orthogonal. It's a Lie group. It has a group law. You introduce this third vector field Z. These guys are left invariant. You get this business here. You get this business here. If you already knew that, this didn't teach you anything. If you didn't, don't worry if you didn't learn anything because we're about to give a different description, which is more profitable for our current task. And that is, it's closely related to planar Brownian motion and levee area. So there's a kind of horizontal-vertical decomposition of this, right? So if you take the map, but you just forget the z variable, that's a submersion. Submersion. Horizontal curves on the total space come from curves in the xy plane that you lift to R3 by letting ztb descript the area from the origin, in the sense of Green's theorem from multivariable calculus. Their length is their R length. So geodesics are lift of circles. That's the Dido problem, Heisenparametric problem. Heisenberg-Brownian motion has generator given by sum of squares, just after this formander thing from David's talk. This should be in the subscript I wanted to have. This should be in the subscript. I wanted to have a little plastic horizontal, but it doesn't matter, it's the sum of squares. We flip the one-half. And more geometrically, Heisenberg-Brownian motion is Planar-Brownian motion lifted by the associated levy area. So horizontally, you have Planar Brownian motion, but then you've got this third variable, which is the associated levy area. You would like to couple these things because people care about doing geometry, geometric analysis, probability, et cetera, on the Heisenberg. Probability, et cetera, on the Heisenberg group. So, how do you do that? It's not even clear there should be a successful one, maybe, if you just look at that. Successful is certainly possible. Successful Markovian is possible. For many starting points, this goes back a while, and then Kendall. The dash here is because the papers just keep going. And I didn't track down the dates for every one of them. And then they mix with Kolmogorov type diffusions where he does similar things, but he's got a whole Similar things, but he's got a whole scheme, which maybe I won't explain quite at the moment. But you can do this in a Markovian way, which is pretty explicit. So there's a natural kind of geometry behind that, but they're not efficient. So you're not getting the sharp decay rate for the total variation norm. So it's interesting that it can be done, but if you're looking to do this to get some sort of geometric estimate, you're probably going in the wrong direction because you're not getting something that's sharp. Because you're not getting something that's sharp, even for this most basic model case. So, this follows from a relatively recent paper by Masha and Fanuel and Simon. So, the idea actually is quite nice. First, you need to know, which we'll prove and they proved and we'll see, that if you start on the same vertical fiber, the correct decay rate is 1 over t. That's the sharp total variation decay rate. But for R2, you know, because R2 is R2, you know, because R2 is well known, I showed you that reflection picture, the sharp decay rate is 1 over square root of t, which is worse. So if you start from the same fiber, if you don't move off the same fiber, you don't go anywhere. You're stuck like this. So you have to bring them off the same vertical fiber. If it's Markov, now you're starting from two points on different vertical fibers. Just the R2 marginals take time one over root t to meet. And that obstructs, obviously, the total coupling in all three dimensions. In all three dimensions. So once you come off that fiber, you're doomed, you're never going to do better than one over root t decay, even though you should be getting one over t. So you can't get one over t by falling off and doing something Markov. So you have to do something, something else. And our main point of the talk is the something else. And so they do succeed in constructing a non-Markovian, also known as co-adapted. If you were worried, it used the past but not the future. It uses the future. Efficient coupling, so they get the 1 over T decay. Coupling. So they get the 1 over t decay rate, which we'll see is the correct one in a minute, from the same fiber. They also give lots of geometric applications that I won't get to, but you can see the original paper from 2018. There's lots of things to do with that. The construction's a little bit intricate. You have this KL expansion, you look at the Brownian bridge, you iterate this. So the idea, which will be very coarse and I'm embarrassing you in front of one of the authors, but the point is, we're not going to need it in just a second. Need it in just a second. Is you let them come apart, but it's not Markov. So you're going to let them have a sojourn where their xy coordinates are different, and they're going to come back at some future time to the same point xy. And then their z values will have moved, either closer together or further apart. Z is a martingale, at any rate. And so you make a little bit of progress, and then you take another sojourn and another sojourn, and the time of the sojourns depends on how far apart you are, and you iterate this, and eventually you'll have a sojourn. This and eventually you'll have a sojourn where they meet in all three coordinates at the end of it. And like I said, this requires sort of the fine path properties in a sense of planner-Brownian motion to get them to move apart and come back together in a certain way. So before we come to the punchline of the talk, the whole talk is one picture in some sense, but I felt like I needed to put slides before and after the one picture. Maghali Bana Fist in her dissertation. Magali Vana Fist, in her dissertation, which was just finished up over the summer, took this idea and did it on SL2 and SU2. Her construction doesn't strictly generalize that. It's the same velocity, but it's a little bit bespoke to each geometry. If you put it back in the Heisenberg one, it doesn't have the right scaling. So it's clearly built off of the earlier work, but it's not quite a uniform scheme. And so, okay, she did something in that direction. I'll also mention here in parentheses: if you want to compose. Here in parentheses, if you want to compare coupling methods with gamma calculus methods of Komogorov's dice calculus, there's also work in that direction, which seems sort of associated. But the main point here of the talk is you can give an elementary maximal coupling. So an elementary construction, no KL expansion, no iteration. You do it in one go. It's maximal, and it has some other nice properties. Nice properties. So here's the heart of the talk. Without loss of generality, two points on the same fiber, you may as well pick coordinates so they're like this, right? Left translation, rotation, whatever. You take a Heisenberg-Brownian motion from the origin, and you go to the first time Zt hits the level A. This is kind of the best you could do. This is the midpoint plane between them, right? They're on the same fiber, 0 to A, you've got the plane at height A. You would like, motivated by what we saw for R2, to just sort of reflect. To just sort of reflect through the plane when that happens. But you can't, this isn't R3. For R3, that's what you do. It's the Heisenberg group. And so what you instead do is you reflect downstairs across the line. You reflect across the line where they meet. You see what that induces for the z-coordinate. And then when they meet, they go. So you get a Heisenberg-Browning motion, which couples at time. Browning motion, which couples at time sigma a. I thought for this I should write the equation, but let me show you the picture. So here's the point: this is what you do. One particle starts here, one starts above it, out of the screen at height 2A. You run BT until the first time its C coordinate hits A. So this blue shaded area, the levy area, should be A at sigma A. This gives you some point here in the plane. Here in the plane. You should reflect over that to get this Brownian motion here. What I drew is a planar Brownian motion. If you look at the associated Levy area, it's the green area, it's minus A because Levy area is side. And this picture is symmetric. Workshop test. So this guy starts at 0, 0, 0, ends up at some point x, y, a. The reflected path starts at 002A, comes here, finds the same point x, y, but now its z coordinate has dropped from 2a to a because it's picked up negative a. So what we're doing is in the total space of the Heisenberg group, we're inducing a reflection across the plane, but it comes with our corkscrew motion. Because you have to line up these things here. It needs to be a global isometry of the Heisenberg group, which it is. Of the Heisenberg group, which it is. You can write down the affine transformation that underlies that. And it's an orientation-preserving isometry of the Heisenberg group. So it takes this Brownian motion to this. This actually will be a Brownian motion. You can check that. You do end up in paper. Why is it non-Markov? In contrast to what the picture I showed you for R2, you don't know the theta in advance. Theta is actually uniform. It's rotationally symmetric, which is part of why this is a Brownian motion. Which is part of why this is a Brownian motion. This picture has a ton of symmetries. So you're going to do a global kind of reflection. You're going to do a global isometry on the Heisenberg group to construct your maximal coupling, but you don't know what the global isometry will be in advance. You only know it once you hit the plane Z equals A. Then you have to go back and reconstruct the history of your twin, the one that you pair with. But that's non-Markovian. Unlike R2, where you knew you'd reflect. Unlike R2, where you knew you would reflect over the y-axis as soon as you chose the starting points. So that's the contrast with R2. That's the non-Markovian nature. But to kind of say why I like this construction, why I thought it was worth a talk, so it's sort of elementary. You don't do anything with the paths. It's algebraic, right? You have an affine transformation that does this. The coupling time is reduced, or as we'll see, reduced, to a hitting time for a 1D marginal. So the coupling time, because it's So the coupling time, because it's maximal, is exactly the first hitting time sigma A when Zt goes from 0 to A. You get a reflection principle, exactly like you do for one-dimensional Brownian motion. You want to do first passage? How do you do first passage? Reflection principle. I want to do... I want to do first passage here because tau is going to be sigma a. So I do it by reflection principle. And also the reflection. And also, the reflection principle and the global symmetries immediately give you that it's maximal. That's a direct rounding motion reflection coupling. It's maximal. You see it, you see it in the same way. And you can directly generalize to SL2R, its universal cover, SU2, and isotropic Heisenberg, which we won't get to today of any dimension, probably beyond. You need enough global symmetries to try to make something like this work. But it's not just Heisenberg that has this level of symmetry. That has this level of symmetry. So let me say a few things here. So, first, we want to actually figure out tau for the Heisenberg group. So, it's more or less classical, but it has this density. You can see various people, including some online notes by Fabrice, where he does this rather efficiently. And you integrate that, you get exactly this. So, this right here is an exact expression for the total variation distance between the p-kernel. Variation distance between the kernel. Dead on, not up to a constant, not for large t. It's completely correct for every A and every T. Of course, arctan of tanch is annoying, so if you want to see the decay rate, here's your 1 over t. And it's sharp because it's bounded from below by 2a over t and from above by 2a over t, where there's a lower order correction down there. So you do exactly get decay rate 1 over t, as they found in 2018. It is the right rate. This is with a sharp, sharp constants. This is with a sharp, sharp constants, not arbitrary constants on it, because the coupling is maximal, not just efficient, where you have a C floating around. I'll put one theorem that's sort of geometric from this. As I say, you can see their paper to see many more applications of this. I didn't see it written anywhere, but I mean, it's immediate from the density. But the point is, if you have the heat semigroup on H, you look at an L infinity function, and you take kind of a vertical gradient, so this notation is. Vertical gradient. So, this notation is defined by this. The vertical gradient of the heat flow decays at 1 over t. This is a sharp constant. We get exactly 1 over t L infinity norm. And maybe I thought it was sort of interesting because it's stronger than a horizontal gradient bound or like an upper gradient bound for points on the same vertical fiber. Because if all you know is the vertical gradient bound, you can integrate over a distance that's a little bit longer. So this vertical gradient is. So, this vertical gradient is not just deduced from a horizontal gradient bound. Okay. I should say there's several things to do. One is, what about if you're not on the same fiber? So, in general, and this idea comes directly from the Bonnie Gardino-Mariano paper from 2018 in Analyst of Probability, we should run a two-stage coupling. Coupling. But the vertical stage is the hard stage in some sense. That's the non-Markovian stage. The first stage is Markovian. You just couple the x, y marginals by reflection coupling on R2. And the Z processes do whatever they do. They have some levy area, it's going to be what it is. They couple at some random time. And when they do, now you're on the same fiber at some random vertical displacement, right? So you get a random A at a random time. You need to control the joint. Time, you need to control the joint distribution. They did that quite artfully in their 2018 paper. And from my perspective, that's the right first stage. So we take the same first stage, but then I want to put the maximal coupling as the second stage, if nothing else, because it's easier to construct. And then you now run a vertical coupling for the points on the same fiber. I would say use the above construction, not the original, but from a random A. That will succeed. When that succeeds, they've coupled in the total space, and the overall coupling time is the And the overall coupling time is the sum of the time for both stages, which we, meaning they, already did basically all the heavy lifting to estimate. And so you get, for arbitrary initial points, which you should take, I should have said H and V are the only two parameters, horizontal displacement, vertical displacement, because you have so much symmetry, everything rotates down and translates down into that configuration. Up to some constant, you get root t decay for the whole. You get root t decay for the horizontal and t decay for the vertical. And so once time is large enough, you get this. You can get horizontal gradient estimates from that. You can do things about whether you couple before you leave a ball. So like I said, there's many, many things you can do with that once you have this. Let's instead focus on the vertical coupling, because that's kind of the novelty of our recent work. And so I said this generalized. And so I said this generalized, so let me largely pictorially explain how this generalizes to the other two 3D contact model spaces. So take the next natural one you want is actually SL2R universal cover. You can say a lot of things about what this is, but from our perspective, it's the Heisenberg group, except you take R2 and you replace it by the hyperbolic plane. So the downstairs Riemannian space form is no longer R2, it's hyperbolic plane. R to its hyperbolic plane, and the z-coordinate is the swept-out hyperbolic area. It's hyperbolic levy area, or whatever. And you do the same thing. So if you want, I put some equations, you can write down kind of cylindrical coordinates. This is r and theta from the hyperbolic plane in polar normal coordinates. You get a z, you get some nice system. Z ends up being a time change Brownian motion. The time change is by. Brownian motion, the time change is by via radial process, which is independent of it. The radial process is the hyperbolic two-dimensional Bessel process, essentially. So you get this nice structure. And the point is, if you want to couple from two points on the same vertical fiber, it's the same with the same picture. I should have maybe put the picture here again. Should have maybe put the picture here again. Just instead of viewing that picture as the XY plane at R2, view it as the hyperbolic plane. You go like this. Once you hit the midpoint, you reflect across the minimal, the geodesic that bisects, and the same construction works. So all of the qualitative aspects are the same. The issue becomes you want to actually estimate the coupling time. Now the actual constant. Coupling time, now the actual computations are different because the Z process evolves at a different speed. It's not the same Z process, right? It's structurally completely analogous, but it's a different time change of Brownian motion because it responds to the hyperbolic radial process, et cetera. And it turns out these stochastic area processes have been treated in great depth by Fabrice and Jing and co-author. They have a book. Co-author, they have a book. You had papers, now you have a book. The book just came out? The book just came out. So you can, the book is 24 because it just came out. The draft copy of the Bookman Archive is 23, so it's 23 plus. Lots of information about these things. But despite that, they're not necessarily well understood in general. So the kind of results you need for this go a bit beyond what they do, but in the hyperbolic plane case, you can do it. Hyperbolic plane case, you can do it. And so, what you can prove is this: the coupling time decays like 1 over root t. It's linear in A, so you get a vertical gradient. You can differentiate in A because you have linear A dependence. You get this coefficient, and it's basically sharp because you can bound it from below by another multiple of A times 1 over root T. So, this A over root T is sharp up to the constants in front. This tells you the coupling decay, but then it also tells you the total. Decay, but then it also tells you the total variation norm because sigma A is the coupling time. It is maximal for the same reason as before. It obeys your reflection principle. This is done by reflection principle, essentially. So everything goes in the same way. Now there's one more geometric wrinkle I can add. SL2 itself. Why'd we start with SL2 universal cover? It's a nicer space. From this perspective, SL2R itself is this with. SL2R itself is this with the Z taken mod 4π. So it's topologically R2 process 1. Were you supposed to couple? Oh, I gave it away. The point is, you're supposed to go halfway toward the other guy in Z, but now there's two halfways because you're on a circle. But that's fine. That's the only modification that you need. It still works. I'll give you the picture in one second. Still works the same way. Coupling's still maximal, still satisfies the reflection. Maximal, still satisfies the reflection principle, but just a circular reflection principle. Everything is formally identical. So you couple like this. Your particle starts here. What's sigma sub A? It's the first time it hits either here or here. This is just the vertical fiber. I haven't drawn the downstairs. So if you hit here, you reflect and this guy meets you here. If you come up and you hit here, you reflect and this guy comes around and meets you here. So you reflect on this diameter that divides. This diameter that divides your 2a from your zero like this. So sigma a is whenever the particle from the bottom hits the green line, and then the reflection in the hyperbolic plane upstairs induces reflection in the green line. So you again have this geometry where you're performing a reflection in a Romanian space form downstairs, and you're seeing what it induces on the total space. It induces a globalized symmetry of the total space, which on the fiber is Which on the fiber is exactly the reflection you would want for a maximal coupling and for a reflection principle. So, if you say that that level of generality, it's the same for every case we've considered. Just the fiber might be a line, but the fiber might be a circle. There's some small caveats of that form. The difficulty here is controlling this effectively. So, it's easy to see this exponential. So, it's easy to see there's an exponential tailbone. Why the fiber is compact and you have some continuity. So, if you run for time one, there's a lower bound independent of your starting point on your coupling probability. Now, iterate. You get a geometric upper bound. It extends to the exponential when you make a continuous time. So just by soft considerations, because you're on a compact fiber, you have to have some exponential decay. But what's the exponential rate? Some kind of like vertical spectral gap? I don't know. Spectral gap. I don't know, because it was already work to figure out when you had a linear fiber the time you hit A. Now the analog, this works out nicely, is Brownian motion. First passive time of Brownian motion is easy. Now ask for the first time Brownian motion leaves an interval. That's no good. If you do it stochastically, it's double reflection. You look at Karatis-Intreve, you get an infinite series for the Laplace transform of the hitting time. It's a huge mess. Hitting time, it's a huge mess. The smart way to do it is to already know the spectral gap by PDE methods and say that has to be right. But that's backwards from what we want here. So if you want to do this stochastically, this hitting time of one or the other of this is way worse than just this hitting time for a line. And the kind of estimates we have for a 1 over root t decay need to be much finer to pick up an exponential rate of decay, right? You need bounds that are. Bounds that are big O of t or whatever, big O of 1 over T are not good enough for something this fine. So you need much finer control of the Z T process to say anything concrete about that little C. Let me just say, SU2, you do the same thing. It's nicely compatible with the hot vibration, but a person who has four minutes left is not a person who uses the hop vibration in a talk. In a talk. So if you know, you know, now we have a circular fiber. The fiber picture looks the same. The base space is S2. Okay, so you play the same game. You just modify the base space to be a sphere. The fiber is a circle. Picture. The point is, you don't know which equator you're reflecting through if you start here until you hit sigma A. If sigma A was up here, it'd be a different equator. That's why it's non-Markov. But once you hit sigma A, But once you hit sigma A, you reflect over the equator, area is equal and opposite this area, so the things meet. You can promote that. If you put S3, because SU2 is S3, if you stick it in R4, you do get that in the total space, the transformation corresponding to this is an element of SO4 that preserves the hot fiber. That's the one-sentence version of respects to hot fibration, and everything is nice. So the geometry is as clean as you could want from this. You could want from this picture. It's not deceptive in that regard. So you have that. And then if you follow this again, you can say, well, it's got to be like this. But again, you can probably get this C because Fabrice and Michelle basically did the harmonic analysis, kind of the PDE version, like I was saying, like you would do for Brownian motion. You leave an interval by finding the spectral gap. Okay. But stochastically, it's not great. Also, I have to give credit where credit is. Also, I have to give credit where credit is due. Magali did the two-stage coupling here. She gives the corresponding horizontal gradient bounds. So, the two-stage coupling, you can do it every step of the way. It's different for SL2 because the first stage is on the hyperbolic plane, so it's not even successful. But okay. What you say. A code because So, yeah, that's enough to say about SU2. I won't put the horizontal gradient bounds. You can say something for SL2, even though it's not successful, but I didn't want to end with a laundry list of here's geometric consequences if you just see what falls in your lap from the preceding. You can look that up if you want. Maybe more interesting is to point out that a long time ago, relative to this talk, the very beginning, we mentioned you might have a different goal. You might have a different goal. You might try to keep the particles close for all time, Bosterstein infinity kind of bound, right, which is related to optical transport, Olivier-Ricci curvature, lots of applications of such a thing. And so again, the Ramadian case is very nice. We'll do one more, two slides worth of pessimistic arc. We'll say the Ramadan case is very nice. If you have a Ricci curvature bound from below, you get a Markov coupling that does the thing. If you haven't seen that before, think about R2. On R2, About R2. On R2, the parallel coupling keeps you exactly the same distance because the second particle is a fixed translation of the first. You couldn't have a more parallel coupling, right? Everything's in Lochstead. Very Markov, very elementary. And the general Romanian case is less elementary than R2, but it still works out very nicely. You have a nice explicit kind of Markov recipe. About Heisenberg. Again, the simplest sub-Romanian case. Already you have tons of trouble. Already, you have tons of trouble. You have an abstract existence result. Koada showed there's a constant such that for any given T, there exists a coupling. That's supposed to be a less than or equal to. I'm sorry. It doesn't draw it. I can only panicline it. This distance is less than or equal to C times the starting distance for that T. Potentially different coupling for every T, but it exists. But it can't be Markov. That was proven just a few years ago. No Markovian coupling can say bounded distance. So even for H, it's not clear what Coada's coupling looks like. There's no recipe for it, right? It's completely abstract existence. You can't get it from SDEs or from coordinating them in some straightforward way. More quantitatively, Ty and Bruce Driver showed a while ago that C's greater than or equal to root 2, conjectured to be root 2. equal to root 2, conjecture to be root 2, but there's no upper bound, as far as I know. So it's not just you might want something more explicit because you might want to know what it looks like. You might want to know, I don't know. So and then that's just for Heisenberg. So the idea that you would have a clean Markov parallel coupling to do the kind of stuff you do in the Romanian case already has a lot of trouble, even here for the Heisenberg group. So again, the Romanian case looks nice. In the Heisenberg case, it's not nice. But whatever Nice, but whatever it is has to be non-Markovian, so it still fits with the title. In both cases, you have a reflection coupling and you have some abstract non-Markovian parallel coupling, but this can't be Markovs. Even on the Heisenberg group, if you want any kind of geometrically useful couplings, you're going to have to deal with non-Markovian couplings. And that is, I guess, my final point. 4.15. We're on a little tighter schedule here, so maybe time for one or two quick questions. Since the reminding case has all these results all the easy to, of course, don't exist in so reminding. Is there any techniques? Yeah, so that's maybe what you would like, right? This is sort of varied by hand for model cases. And when I started with the Romanian case, I said, look, this respects comparison geometry. So you would want to say something like, oh, if I had something that had non-positive, three-dimensional contact subramaniate structure. Dimensional contact suburbaniate structure that had comparison against Heisenberg, right? It was like non-positive curvature. If Heisenberg is like flat, do I get some comparison? Not from this, you don't. Any kind of coupling based on any kind of comparison using gamma calculus stuff or whatever, this seems very hard. There is a paper and another preprint on an archive with me, Fabrice, Erland Grong, and Anton Bellmeyer, where we And Anton Fellmeyer, where we make some preliminary moves in that direction. And the reason there have only been preliminary moves so far is because it's hard. So it'd be nice to have some sort of coupling that respect, even if it was only Markov, that respected comparison geometry. But I can tell you more later about all the difficulties that arise. This is done just by like explicit, it's an explicit single structure. You just do it by hand. It's nothing comparison-ish. Just to follow, I have a different question, but the comparison would be only for what is it called? Well, step two, but kind of structures, because that's the only way to have it. So that should be a huge limitation anyway. But I have a very different question. But even 3D contact, yeah. So when you introduce this So, when you introduce this data, do you have some kind of interpretation for this as a random hypersurface? Because maybe it's a reflection for a random hypersurface with respect to it. And randomness actually depends on the ground erosion, and therefore you'll lose Markovian things. But that would be more in sync with whatever you do or mind. I just Yeah, yeah. Right, if you look at the affine map, yeah, you're getting something which, if you restrict just to Z is reflection, in the total spaces, this isometry, it's a kind of like twisted reflection. And so, yeah, it is. If you look at the, if you write down the full affine transformation, I think it's along the lines you're saying, where you're getting something, it's not a reflection on the overall spec, it's orientation for serving. Because minus one for the z and minus one downstairs gives you one for the determinant. Gives you one for her determinant. And so you are getting some sort of random isometry, which is once the A is fixed from the beginning. So you have a one-parameter family of random isometries given by a random theta, exactly as you're suggesting. So it kind of is the case that you're running your process, and once you get to sigma A, you know which member of your one parameter family of isometries you want to use, but you don't know in advance, unlike R2. But you don't know in advance, unlike our two. Thanks, Steve. Take a two-minute break and come back and get set up. I don't have to take a break, so yeah. So yeah, that's not a constant back up.
