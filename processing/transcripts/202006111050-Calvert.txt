So, with that said, so it's a pleasure now. Now, we'll have three shorter talks, about 20 minutes with questions. The first pair will actually be joint work between Jake, Milland, and Alan Hammond. And Jake and then Milland will speak about that. So, we'll start with Jake. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining. Thanks everyone for joining, and thank you to the organizers for the invitation to speak about this work. The new results I'll mention are all joint work with Alan and Milland. And as Ivan was just saying, Milland is going to speak immediately after this talk. And while I'll be discussing the main result of our recent work, Milland will be going into some of the details of the proof, the main idea of the proof. Idea of the proof. And he's got a lot of nice figures, so you should stick around for that. And part of the reason I'm excited to talk to you about this today is that it fits in really nicely with the lectures that Ivan gave earlier this week, in particular the second one. And it's also because one of the results he covered is, I think, our work is something of a sequel to it, in a very natural way that I'll talk about. That I'll talk about. Okay, so our path to discussing the main result is by asking what is meant by quantitatively Brownian nature. But in order for you to care about the answer to that question, I should say a few things about the ARIE2 process and the ARI line ensemble as motivation. So the ARIE2 process is worth studying in part because of its association with the KPZ. In part because of its association with the KPZ universality class. So there are models of interfaces, either directly modeling interfaces or models that can be associated to interfaces. And these are interfaces which are arising from a particular kind of growth. And perhaps after subtracting off some drift from these interfaces, after some characteristic rescaling that is characteristic of the KPZ universality class, and in the limit of advanced time, in some cases it's proved, but. In some cases, it's proved, but in other cases, it's just expected that those interfaces converge in distribution to the ARI2 process shifted by a parabola. So this thing has some global curvature because the ARI2 process is stationary. It's globally parabolic, and we'll see an image of that in a second. But I just want to say that some of these models to have in mind are like, for example, the narrow-edge solution of the KPZ equation, TASEP, Brownian-last. TASEP, Brownian last passage percolation, and there are many other examples. So the point is that the ARI2 process is worth studying because of the connections to these models. And if you learn something new about the ARI2 process, it can have ramifications for these other models. But if the ARI2 process is the thing that you care about, then why is it even worth talking about this whole ensemble of curves as a node? Curves. As a note, the Air2 process can be embedded as the top curve of the Airy Line ensemble. And what's depicted here is not the Airy Line ensemble, but a parabolically shifted version of it. And that's so that this top curve is this limiting scale description of the interfaces arising from certain growth models. Here are just depicted three curves, not all of them. But the reason for embedding the ARI2 process into a line-on. process into a line ensemble, even if you're just interested in the Yuri II process, is because the line ensemble has, the one that's depicted, has the non-intersecting Brownian Gibbs property. And in its simplest form, this means, for example, that you could take the top curve in this ensemble, erase it on a particular interval, sample a Brownian bridge that matches the endpoints, and so long as it doesn't intersect the curves around it. The curves around it, that whole procedure has not changed the distribution of the ensemble. So, by embedding it in this ensemble, you get a new tool, not only to study the other curves in the ensemble, but in particular to study the ARIE2 process. And of course, there are other reasons to study the Ari line ensemble, and Duncan was just talking about some of those. It has connections to these other objects of importance, like the Ari Line. Objects of importance like the Aries sheet and directed landscape. But getting back to the ARIE2 process, what does it look like after we've shifted it by a parabola? Well, of course, it has this global parabolic curvature, but the thing that we're going to focus on is the fact that it's locally Brownian. And there can be many senses in which the Ari2 process and this parabolically shifted version are locally Brownian. And local indicating that we're looking at a particular interval. And then, if you wanted to try to phrase locally Brownian, how would you do it? Well, if you were looking at this curve, you might think, well, I'd like to compare with Brownian motion, started from this same time here. So maybe instead of looking at the curve on the interval, I should look at its increment. And that's what we'll do. We'll compare the increment of this curve over an interval with. Of this curve over an interval with Browning motion started at the left endpoint of that same interval. But to set the interval, we need a parameter d. d is going to determine the length of this interval that we're looking at. And to more briefly talk about this Area 2 process minus the parabola, we'll write it as L. The Area II process is locally of rate 2, whereas Brownian motion is of rate 1. Whereas Brownian motion is of rate one. So, in order to compare them more easily, we just scale down by a factor of this two to the minus one half here. And in that way, comparing L and Brownian motion is easier. So here's the first sense in which now L is locally Brownian. This is a result that Ivan and Alan proved in 2014. And here's what it says. And here's what it says: the law of the increment of L is absolutely continuous with respect to Brownian motion. So, this result is generally interesting because it's providing the sense in which L is locally Brownian, a new sense in which it's locally Brownian, but also because it's useful. Getting estimates of the law of L can be challenging, and because it's such an important object, you would like to obtain those estimates. And in this particular case, And in this particular case, if your estimate for Browning motion for the corresponding event is zero, then this result can transfer that estimate to the law of L. And that's just by the definition of absolute continuity. And here's a nice application. At the time this result came out, there had been a conjecture that stood for about 10 years that said For about 10 years, that said that L attains its maximum at a unique location. And this result on absolute continuity proves it in short order. And that's because on any interval, a Brownian motion will take its maximum at a unique location almost surely. And so, in a sense, what this result does for you is that if you have some zero probability of Zero probability, even for Browning motion, it gives you that same thing for the law of L. And in just a leading question, it's natural to ask, well, can you do the same thing with events of a probability that is, say, epsilon? And of course, I'm saying this because the answer is yes, and I'll tell you about that in a second. But I think the quickest way there is to clear off these comments and Clear off these comments and rewrite absolute continuity in terms of its epsilon delta characterization. And so here's a characterization of absolute continuity. If you give me a delta, then I can find you an epsilon such that if A has Brownian motion probability less than epsilon, then that means that for the law of the increment of L for the same event, it has probability less than delta. The thing is that there is. The thing is that there is that there's no relation specified between epsilon and delta. And this is where our result comes in. You have a slightly, you have a delta epsilon notion of the traditional role of delta and epsilon or the other way around in analysis, I suppose it doesn't really matter. Sure, sure. Yeah, and in this case, we can get rid of delta altogether. All together, because in this case, we've sort of quantified their relationship. And the result is that if you have some event A and its Brownian motion probability is at most epsilon, then for the law of the increment of L, it's at most epsilon with some corrective factor. And I'll tell you in a second, I'll show you what the corrective factor is, and you'll understand why I didn't include it on this slide. But first, I want to speak to the general usefulness of this result. And it's aligned with the comments I made about the absolute continuity result. Obtaining estimates about L can be difficult, certainly more difficult than obtaining that same estimate for Brownian motion. And that's sort of the philosophy behind this result. If you want to get an estimate for L, why don't you get it for Brownian motion instead? And then using this result, you can get your corresponding Can you get your corresponding result about L. And in particular, in the context of this absolute continuity result and Johansson's conjecture, whereas originally with the absolute continuity result, you were asking the question, does L take its maximum at a unique location? And using this result, you can quantify that. You can ask how many. You can ask how many, how likely is it that there are, say, k near maximizers in a sense. So, you can ask more refined questions using this result. And next, I'll say that even though L is just a single curve, in fact, a similar estimate applies to any curve of the parabolically shifted paradigm ensemble. And in fact, it's even of broader scope than that. It's even of broader scope than that. You can go beyond the area line ensemble there. There are other ensembles. For example, you can apply this result to Brownian last passage percolation, although I certainly don't have time to talk about that model. And finally, as promised, here is the form of this corrective factor. So to see that this is actually less than the reciprocal of epsilon. Reciprocal of epsilon, you can imagine that because the reciprocal of epsilon is, say, something large, after you take its log, it's still something large. And then instead of having the five-sixth power, you can just raise it to the power of one, drop the constants, and the thing you get out is one over epsilon. So that shows that indeed this is a corrective factor and not the leading factor. Leading factor. Okay, so to conclude, I mentioned this version of Johansson's conjecture, where you quantify it. The corresponding result for Browning motion takes a little bit more time to prove. And so we've chosen for you a nice sample of how you could use this main theorem. So here's a tailbound on the supremum of the increment of... On the supremum of the increment of L over an interval. And the same quantity has been bounded before in the literature, but instead of x squared over 4d being this first term here, there's an unknown constant c, and instead of 2, it's 3 halves. So this is really the leading order term you'd like to get. And we can get it. And it's precisely because it's the term that you would expect for Brownian motion. Would expect for Brownian motion. The main result tells you how you should go about getting this bound. You should do it by simply considering the same thing for Brownian motion. And so, as opposed to considering the increment of L at S, you can consider Brownian motion at S, where that Brownian motion is started at minus D. And by the reflection principle, you know that the supremum of Brownian motion over an interval can be. Brownian motion over an interval can be related to Brownian motion at the end of that interval. And Brownian motion at the end of this interval of length 2d is just a normal random variable with variance 2d. And so in the language of our main result, you'll want to set epsilon to be some constant times this e to the minus x squared over 4d, 4d because the length of the interval is 2d. The length of the interval is 2d. And that's basically it, because all that's left to do is then identify this corrective factor. It has this form. So you plug an epsilon, and this is the correction you get. And so you plug that in, and you're done. So this is an illustration of the usefulness of this result. And there are many other examples that you can find in our paper. Okay. So just as a recap, So, just as a recap, you care about AL. Sometimes it's difficult to estimate their laws directly. So, instead, why don't you do it with Brownian motion? Thanks. Okay, thank you, Drick.
