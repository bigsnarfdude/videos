So if Rana is back, we can soon start the problem session. First, a quick question. If anyone brought any corona tests, then I would like to get one for one of our participants. So just come up to me. So yeah, for the problem session, we will start with some of the the in-person problems and then hopefully some of the online people can also present later. Later. So I wanted to just go by order of the overly files so then you know when you're up. So the first one I think is you, are you ready to present your colour? Me? Yeah? I am the first one? I think so, yeah. Maybe I maybe stayed. I'm not sure how much time they have. Yeah, maybe it really depends on the times. Maybe 10 minutes. 10 minutes, okay? One next okay. Let me first go uh big there's a conjecture just write her name. So that's her name is Topio Wu from Fudai University in Shah. There's a conjecture by Abbari and many others from the Center that We think that if we have a list for each vertices, it's smaller than its degree, let's say this way. Then it is an orientation such that the R degree does not belong to the list, it's forbidden list. List and then the Visa is with Moha and Russell and Ma or Moha and V. We prove that uh it is uh if Li is let's say equal to one-third. Say for the one-third minus one, okay, it's done. And if the maximum degree is sublinear than the minimum degree, okay, then we can get to improve to build 4.5 dv minus something like that with the local lemma. But the institution, this is the workshop on the colouring. On the coloring. So I want to say that the derivative of it, it is actually the derivative of coloring, this coloring, if we use the combatorial disparages. This is first observed by and then we formulate it. Just like the four coloring in planar graph is related to four floor, which is. Is related to fourth law, which is the orientation of class. And then it is also the dual problem is P is has, let's say is F P avoidable next day avoidable you have then transmitted data is their orientation. That just means that there is an orientation certified recognition. If there is this a subgraph with orientation, let's say, let me also use E, such that the R degree is equal to, let's say equal to the F E and then the it is a And then the it is uh Adonthasi. Maybe greater name for the it is Adonthasi that means that it will imply that the disc coloring for if you have F V choices of the colours and a stronger version of this We want to say that in the community of this talent as a way that if the we consider the coefficient of as a very strong conjecture, maybe not true, maybe it's shooting true and others. And others, the first auditor asked by Shiny True whether this is true. And I cannot remember, there should be some others who know. That for any orientation P of G, it says that there is this one we can remove. One OUR Edge. Let's say equal to the one OWR for each vertex to make it along hashes. If this one is true, I think it could be quite strong. And we have a theorem that... So what is anon tasi? Anantasi means that okay, that means that the number of odd sub binarian subgroup minus the even sub-inerian subgroup. Some earlier suburb is non-zero. Maybe I use the coefficient language. So we consider the graph polynomial. We consider this one equal to xd minus x and then the anonymous CD. And then anonymity means that you can see the coefficient of x alpha here. This is a vector. That means that, okay, maybe I can use xi, alpha i of this. It is not zero. The important thing is that it is not equal to zero. This corresponds to data. I don't pass the orientation without degree. So alpha set out degree scale. Yeah. Alpha I equal to the R degree of D. And then the reason that it is due to each other because we can write the We can write the if we can see the the outing we avoiding orientation this one equal to A U B times X U If we have this is come from the adjacency matrix, and then this EB incidence matrix for HE. And then corresponding this polynomial for the avoiding, it will be equal to for every vertices. For every vertices E, you have the A E B X E, Y E. Okay, let me just also use this one. And you will have alpha B. And your worry is that this one is not zero. So the question is that whether we can find the question. The question is conjecture is equivalent to: you see that if we look at the fog, they have a due. And then with Moha and others, we show that this kind of problem, there's always the due problem. If one one is not equal to zero, if only if the dual polynomial is not zero, the combinatorium is done in us. And then the problem is equivalent to The problem is equivalent to uh whether is it alpha we so great equal than greater equal than something like is it alpha with this one such that the coefficient of alpha of g alpha of g is y do not equal to zero. If we consider the combinatorial colonized form of the conjecture, original conjecture. Now basically the relation of the forbidden orientation to the least calorie problem, then the due problem in combatorial municipality does fall. Communicatorial installer does. Even so that it looks quite different. And then we have a theorem. First, there's a theorem also first by Shijin Zhu, but maybe we will also be involved. That if we change the we place each edge, Each edge of a tree by a dieton, then it is allotancy or equivalent it is that if you consider for each B. For each V, the degree of Rv, we consider the polynomial of retainer square of this rule that is not equal to 0. And this can impress that, for example, the complete graph, you can avoid two different numbers instead of one. And then, by using this one, we have a theorem that We have a theorem that together with, we call it decomposition theorem. I'm not sure about that time for that. Then it can imply that if given a graph G, if is this edge on the same vertices such that such that for every cut Cut. We have the number of edge times two on the cut is less than or equal to one half of the cut dG then we will have uh g is Is the DH avoidable? Okay. So my question is that if G has connectivity big Can we always find a subgroup? Let's say this is bar such that the our degree is big is almost one half of the original signal degree. That's the question. Can we cut get k kind of get a half graph? Kind of get a half wrap such that you satisfy each cut is not too big, but the degree for each vertices is not our degree, but just the degree is almost one half of the original one. So if we use the Cartesian single problem, if the effective resistance is big. Sorry, what's age? I'm sorry? What's age? H is a graph. Not necessarily. Graph. Not necessarily a subgraph, but on the same matrices itself. Just another subgraph, whether we can find another subgraph, not necessarily a subgraph, another graph such that on the same matrices and satisfy this condition with the start condition, the cut condition, such that the degree is about one half. One half. That's the question. Is it clear? For the average degree? Not the degree for each vertices. For any vertices. So one uh single is known by condition single problem, the solution of condition single problem. If each edges have a very large uh very small infected resistance. Small effective resistance which is close to the connectivity condition, then it is true. But whether we can replace that effective resistance by the connectivity condition, that's my question. If this one is replaced by Defective resistant. But maybe not everyone are familiar with this term, so I'll ask you whether the edge connectivity is true. Uh then we'll go on uh with spinning and then after that we'll add uh control online percentage. Okay, so my name is Senior Bhutta. And so the open problem that I suggested is basically extending the four colors here. We have two graphs that you can draw in the plane with just one crossing. And I will have a talk on this on Wednesday, so I don't want to go into details now. But if you are interested in this problem, come to me and we can discuss it. But let me actually present. But let me actually present a different problem. And so the problem a child stole from something, someone, and I think the someone is Andrew King, but I'm not entirely sure, and I'm not sure whether Andrew King didn't steal it from Blue Street or someone else, so it's not my problem. It's as follows. So what is the minimum Delta such that every angle free turn of graph has Has chromatic number at most, well, strictly less than delta. And you can also ask the same question for the list chromatic number. So, I mean, we know that asymptotically triangle-free graphs have graphs have chromatic number at post delta over log delta so certainly they at some point chromatic number becomes smaller than than degree of that so suddenly suddenly at some point the chromatic number becomes Number becomes less than delta. It's there's a nice argument that certainly don't use red. Oh, yeah. The left screen. So delta equals seven suffices. So this is an old argument by someone, I forgot. someone I forgot someone eighties or something uh basically what you can what you can uh what you can do you can divide the vertices into into two parts such that each part induces a subgraph of maximum degree at mean three and then you can hit each of the parts by the Brooks theorem and so it is a basic scalaring For the chromatic number, for the least chromatic number, delta equals to the value of, which may be certain suffices, and this I did recently with with my With my student, and it's basically some computed assisted analysis of a probabilistic argument. But probably it's so if you certainly if you if you believe in in the this this conjecture by by Reed that the chromatic number is most uh the average of The average of the tweak number and delta plus one bit somehow, I guess up. Then I mean there is also a list coloring version of this, I guess. Then this indicates that the right answer should be five. So maybe that is the right answer. We'll try to figure out how this voice goes down. I don't know how you can give access to the online. So I was hoping now Nicola Trotignot and Edouard Bonnet with some of their problems. Sorry? For the pictures to come up there, you have to turn the projector. Yeah. Yeah, can it yeah try that? Press the button and Can I just interrupt for one second? I just want to say I'm also here, so I wasn't sure if I would be here, but I'm here. So if it helps, I'm happy to present in this group. If it doesn't help, then I'm also happy to present. If it doesn't help then I'm also happy to present the next group but that is uh do all three in y in the row then so first Nicola then Edebert then Maria and it would be it would be great if you could put there is a webcam webcam Jon team in the Zoom if it could appear on the screen then I can draw stuff on a paper and all participants Can you see my hand? Not yet. No, no, it's yet. Yeah, I was thinking whether it was like a way to get it from. Together from a hands now? Oh? So this is should be the Zoom thing. Anyway, what I can do is we need to get Zoom working. You know, conference, that should be right. You're right, right. Projector on Google. We can do a laptop maybe and then put it on there. I mean, laptops I know how to work. We can always ask for something. I think they are. Are they random buttons? Let's move random products. Now laptop is here every No laptop is here. So yeah, but maybe run the zoom on the on the laptop. On the laptop. Yeah, put put the laptop on the screen and run the zoom on the laptop. This one? Yeah, yeah. And now we would probably need to connect to the car or joint the making like your thicker issues. Perfect. Can you see? Not yet. You can see Zoom now, at least. Yeah. You can see Maria's cards. The one on the right. Now I can see you. Okay. I don't know what the main issue is. I don't see it. You should present. Yeah, we can see it, Tom. I mean on the left you see this I think it's the internet video of the screen I think that almost ring the belly. Okay, and you can read it? Yes, yes. So she has no three connected supergraphs and girls 10 to the 9. And my question is chi at least 3? Of course uh uh this ten to the nine uh is uh arbitrary, you could say five this is open as far as I know and if you uh oh uh why this could be true, it is because uh if you forgot to say that the bears is at least ten to the nine uh Is at least 10 to 209 with several co-authors, including Alex Coe, Paul Simour, Trinidad, Carl Fegeni, Eduardo, and Stéphane Thomas. You have both a reference to the paper. We can prove that if we forget this story of girls at least 10 to the 9, we know that chi is at most 4. And as far as we can see, it is not really. Not trivial, it does not follow from the bound on the degree. If you have no connected supergraph, we know the mean degree is at most 4, so you obtain that chi is at most 5. But to obtain that chi is at most 4, you really need to play by induction with the colours, as far as we can see. So to prove this, obviously what you want to do, you say, okay, there is no three connected to graph. No three connected to the graph. So the graph itself is not three connected, so there is a two-vertext cut. And then you start to play with the induction hypothesis. But really, we tried, so it works to prove that chi is at most four when you have no assumption on the girls. And to have a graph where the chromatic number is actually four. So let me show you example. Let me show you examples. You have this graph. Call the brother spindle. This graph has no three connected subgraph and its chromatic number is four, but it has triangles. We have one that is triangle free. We have one that has no cycle of length four, but it has triangles. There are complicated graphs. But it becomes very, very hard to produce a graph with chromatic number 4 when the virus is getting higher. We could not do it. And we can neither have a fancy intuction hypothesis proving that the chromatic number is at most 3 by separating and then doing some solution. So really I don't know, and maybe playing with a And maybe playing with injection hypothesis is not the right idea. Maybe there's something else to be done. My open question. And you have reference in the workshop. Thanks a lot, Ibak. Then we can move one of the to other now. But I want you the I will not write more than what I wrote on the methods, but just to go through my question. So, the class of string graphs is not fair on it. So, there are triangle-free segment graphs with one-bonded chromatic number. But if, in addition to triangles, you forbid either C4 or C5, the chromatic number becomes bonded. So, here I'm interested. Becomes bounded. So here I'm interested in the direction of going to larger. So you can see the triangle of retailers, you have one percent satisfy. It's not enough to make the count yet. It's known, it's a paper of Aria, Alex and Paul, that if you let string graphs with odd gears, at least At least seven have only a chromatic number, and they have an explicit bound of 80 for if the others at least nine. And recently with Stadel for application for approximating vertex cover, we came up with an incomparable result. So the deal verse is larger, it's at least 13, but we get a better bound on the computing number. And for all, we can tell, it might be that what if the debug verse is Maybe that if the deep burst is large enough, string graphs are three chromatic. But this is something that asked before, I mean, a long time ago for the birds, the other birds. I mean, it's known that one screen graph, so when the strings are in pairs of strings are interse intersecting at most once, they are screen voluble in the direction that is state by a degeneracy argument, but if By degeneracy arguments, but if you're if you go with filters, it cannot be a degeneracy argument because you still have large titles. But yeah, that's the question. And actually, large enough auditors could be starting at seven. Thank you. So then we can hopefully move on to Marie. Hi. So I think I'll do what Edor did because I don't need many pictures either. Also, it's problem 12 in Sophia's write-up. And thank you, Sophia, for writing what it should say from my very descriptions. So my question is Ertis Porsche for induced minors. I've recently come to appreciate the Ertisch Porsche for planar minors with some delay compared to that. With some delay compared to the rest of the world, but now it was not induced by this, so I had to understand what happens there. So, and the case I currently wasn't when you think about binary tree-induced minors, but the problem also makes sense for any planar graph-induced planner. And I should also say that after I started studying this problem with separate social links, This is a separate society. They told me that it already applied. Some version of it already appears in a paper by Alm calling John Paul. But they suggested one version and I'm kind of interested in every possible version. So to keep it specific and possibly that's not the right way to say, if I tell you that things are binary to you, and I tell you that you don't have And I tell you that you don't have two pairs disjoint induced minors of this three in your graph. Is it true that you can hit all such induced minors with neighborhoods of hundred verses? So instead of a hitting set, I want a set of verses whose neighborhoods dominate the miners. And then that question is, what do you mean by making you? Making it use like should they be disjoint, should they be complete, should they be far apart? And all these versions make sense. So the first version I ask is they're disjoint and you want neighborhoods of 100 parties to be hidden. But you can ask boundaries, you can ask the minors that compete to each other. And what kind of guides me was this: so, just like for every quotia, you use For every ergosha, you use fast decompositions or 3D compositions to get the layer of bottom grid, you get the basic version of the result. Here I envision using bounded alpha tree computations. Bounded alpha tree computations, right, 3D competitions where every bag has bounded stability on them. And so if you could prove that excluding Excluding binary G is induced minus, and let's say excluding KTT is induced minus gives you boundary G alpha, then you would get, under these circumstances, this domination adjust portion for induced by the three minus. But the rating, any portion of this result. There may be any portion of the district out there. So is it probably interesting? Thank you very much, Maria. So then we'll switch back to in-person and pause the next question. Is that the screen again? So, this is a it's not my problem, this is just an old problem that that Alex and That Alex and Tug and I recently came across and we've been working on, but it's from about 1970, I think. But it's nice. So a kernel in a diagraph G is a set of vertices, it's a stable set, independent set. Independence, yeah? So it's that everybody else is joined from it, everybody else has an up is joined from it. I mean you can say join from or you can say join to by reversing all the ages. It's the same. Some people say join to, some people say join from. I prefer join from. Erebanos is joined from somebody in the stable. And it's not true that every digraph has a kernel. Every acyclic digraph has a kernel and diagram as a kernel and uh but every it's not but uh let's say a k kernel is again the same thing a stable set and everybody can be joined from it by a path of x it was k directed path of it most k edges and it was the theorem of of  Peter edition. And so he came up with the conjecture that, oh, well, first of all, there's a theorem of Fatal and Lovas. I'm omitting all accents because I never get away. Every diagraph has a two-kernel. And that's really easy. It's surprising, but it's really easy. The proof is, you just do it by induction. You choose a vertex, look at its out neighbours, and delete it. Now, over here, what remains is still a digraph, so it's still got a two kernel. There's a set here that can reach everyone. There's a stat here that can reach everyone else in two steps. There's no H form there because you've got rid of all these out neighbors. Maybe there's an H form there, then this is still a two kernel because you can reach all of those in two steps as well. And if there's no H, then you could just add that to the two kernels again. It's still a stable thing. So that's easy. But the conjecture There's every digraph without sources sources, I mean a vertex with 10 degree zeros, has a two curl containing at most of half the vertices, a small two curl. So is it most g of two? Number of L is divided by H2. And it's tied. And I mean, two currents are such easy things to produce. Why can't we get some control over this size? It's not even proved that in the ninety-nine hundredths. That's also open. That's also open. And there's no constant bound, which is absurd. The best bound is just recently proved by Spiral, Spiral. What? Spiral? That it's something like, you can get one which is all of the graph minus a little bit, something like quarter root n. I think it's something like root n log t or something. I forgot what it was, but something like that. Something like that. Yeah, important. Aha, an important number. So there's a huge guy here. I mean, how can that? Why can't we do better than that? If you were trying to prove this, then here's your graph. You're trying to prove it's got a two-kernel. It's got a two-kernel, not too big. And you know, there is a two-kernel. And two kernels are stable sets. So you can assume there's a two-kernel, and it's huge. It's more than 99 hundredths of all the graph. Oh, I've got a two-curn. Here it is. It's a giant stable set of more than 99 hundredths. And there's a little bit of graph left. This is where all the action is. There's edges here. This is where all the action is. There's edges here, and there's edges inside the thing, but this is a stable thing. So that's what the graph looks like. And if you wanted to do a special case, you'd say, what if this was a clique? You know, what if this was a tournament? Because that's the stable set. You know, you want to throw in some extra hypothesis to make something possible. Because the tournament case turns out to be an interesting case, not simply the extreme. Interesting case, lots of the extremal examples come from where that's a drawn up. So, and it was known in that case you could do two-thirds instead of you know, trying to get a half, but you could at least do two-thirds. So, there's a theorem that you can actually do a half in that case. Because the volume is a terminal, you can, the conjecture is true. So, so there, I mean, it's such a nice question. Why, how do we do better than this ridiculous banner? So what's the special case you can when can there's a special graph? When this is a tournament, that's the state. If the graph can be partitioned into a tournament, the stables. So if the whole graph is a split graph, but it's correct, then you can get a half. That's the theorem. That's the theorem, huh? Half or half. I mean, it was it was known to be a third, but we can prove a half, so that's our big achievement. But we can prove a half, so that's our big achievement. We've got a half there. So, did you want to do your power show that if the graph is full colorable? Yeah, there's lots of other special cases. So, it's known that if the graph is full colorable, then the conjecture is true. There's nothing to do with the pain. It's just. So I just went through some proof with a student of mine, and I think it's not a quarter but a half that his proof gives. So I'll just present his proof with maybe some applications. So suppose we want to prove this, that if so we want to prove the G's diagram. Um geez diagram no sources then there exist the two kernel of size plus n minus m and I claim that n can be taken to be f minus little one square root n log n. And local as Paul said, we can assume number one is you can assume the independence number is huge because in particular your stable your two kernel is a stable set. So if every independent set is of size less than n minus m, you're already happy. Than n minus m, you're already happy. You could also assume that maximum out degree is at most m. Why is this? Because the proof that Paul described by Fatal and I get Lovas says that you can always find in every diagram, you can o for every vertex, you can always find a two coordinate that's disjoint from its out neighborhood. From its out-neighborhood. So, this proves that for every B there exists an S2 kernel such that the neighborhood of B is disjoint from this show then? For every verte yes, because the proof, the way it works, is that you take a vertex and its odd neighborhood out. Neighborhood out, you induct here, right? And then if there exists an edge that goes, there can only be. So I don't understand, but it's stable, so automatically disjoint from its own. Well, there can be an edge that goes from S to V. So I don't understand what you're talking about. I'm saying for every vertex in my graph, I can always find the two kernel, which is disjoint. Two kernel which is disjoint from these out neighbors. Is that good? True. Because either I'm adding V to S if there is no edges going this way, or I'm adding V here. But in any case, the neighborhood, the plus neighborhood, is always disjoint. Are we good? Okay, so I can assume the max degree is also bounded. It's a plus time. Okay, so now peak. Now pick independent set of size at least n minus n. And what you do is, okay, so this is my i, and i is most of the graph. It's at least of size n minus n, like n minus square root n, okay. This is the leftover. Now I'll show that my goal is to prove that there exists a subset A inside L such that one, A is so G of A is acyclid and second if I look at the alternate If I look at the out neighborhood of A intersection with I, that's at least n. That's my goal. So why would I be done if I find this? So I want to find, so first of all, I is graph is sourceless, which means, and this is an independent set, which means for every vertex here, I have some edge that closing. Edge with closing. And now, if I found a set A here, which is this is my A with acyclic and it's sending a lot of neighbors to M, then I claim that I can find a two kernel, which is of size at most N minus M. N minus n that's because here, so why is that? So, why is that? Because I can find a kernel inside A. So if this is a cyclic and I can find S neighborhood of Shaw. I can find a one card out, but what about this? The leftover microphone. The leftover menu. Yeah, so I will just do inductively, right? I will just find you identify it. Delete how you find it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So here I will find S, M plus S and then N plus plus S, and then I will have to find the one kernel inside A and join it. Join it. So here this will be q n plus q. But let me say what there is a version for this as well. For every A which is inside D, such that D of A is a cyclic, there exists a two kernel of G which is disjoint. G, which is disjoint from A. Sorry, M plus A. So I didn't prove this, but the proof is exactly the same. It's very similar to this. So for every subset of G which is acyclic, I can always find a two kernel which is disjoint from the out neighborhood of A. So if I found an A whose out of A, found an A whose out neighborhood is at least of size m, then I can find a two card L which is of size at most n minus m so as long as I show this you are happy. You should be happy. Okay so now let me say why that's the case. So this is my independent z and this is my L. So for every edgy vertex here I know there is someone in going. One in going, there's an edge that's in going. So I'm going to identify for every vertex U, one of the vertices in L that sends an edge to it. I will call the phi of U. So this vertices, the phi, because this is huge, this is tiny, a lot of, like, you are seeing a lot of star forests. And I just identify for each vertex, for each vertex here, someone who's sending a message. Okay, and now I will partition this graph. I will partition this graph, this part into two pieces: L prime and LW prime. These are the guys who send few edges out. These are the edges who are hosts for many purposes here. And there will be a bunch of this. And what you do now is just first let L prime be all the same. L prime be all the vertices in L such that W is 5u or less than n over 2m many u's and let L double prime be all the other guys. Now I know that if I look at the phi of the entire set L, well everyone in I is getting someone. Getting someone. So, sorry, five minus one. Then this is at least n minus n. On the other hand, this is at most, what is it? So the ones which are in L double prime, the max degree is bounded. So it's at most L double prime times N. They can only be hosts for at most N line guys. And everyone else, if L minus L double prime, is N over 2N. Over 2n. Okay, and from here, let me not write the computation, but you can get that L double prime is at least something that minus n over 2m. And that gives you at least n over 2m. Assuming, so this is true for m half square root and log n. square that log n and n at least 25. Okay, so you found L double prime and now what you do is now you apply Ramsey on L double prime. So I guess I can do it first. Maybe I'll let me write it here. So L double prime is also at least n over to m. So if you look at D of L double prime, you can assume no two cycles. Why can I assume no two cycles? Because Because my goal is to prove there exists such an A in L double prime. And it's going to be large. I want it to be of size logarithmic. So I want to get rid of the two cycles. Well, I say that for every two cycles, I can delete one edge, one of them. And if I find an A there which is acyclic, it will still be acyclic even if I add this guy's in. Now and then you can add edges add edges to make it into a tournament and get to a tournament and of size well it doesn't matter get to tournament and the vertex size didn't change I just I did I just Vertex size didn't change. I just added edges to get to tournament. And now by Ramsay, there exists a transit into log of L double prime. But I edit some edges and I can deal, like the edges that I edit, they don't bother me. The point is that they give me directed acyclic graph. A cyclic graph, and this is of size log of n over 2m, and this is roughly half. So, it is something like half times log, and you have here n over squared log n. So this is like a half log n. I want to say like half minus that's a long log n. Okay. And oh, this should be sorry, there should be this was half scrubbed and logged in, so I got scrubbed and order and this. And now what's happening? So I found my yeah, so now I'm good because I found my transit like acyclic A here, right? And now what is the M plus of A intersection I is going to be at least each of them was sending at least M over two M edges out and there were And there were um this many uh number of it was log of half times log n and I want this to be as big as n. So from here you get that m squared That m squared is at most n works. That was a one half minus epsilon that I missed. So you get that this works in the most half minus epsilon times square root and oh yeah. And when some does this, instead of doing this like L prime, L double prime, he somehow partitions it into like intervals of almost regular vertices, which doesn't really change anything. And you actually lose a factor of two. But by doing it directly, you get exactly, well, half minus a little bit. So So I think we're also close to the vision of the first programme sessions where we launch these for the group as well. So let's thank Liana and I'm going to go ahead and do that.
