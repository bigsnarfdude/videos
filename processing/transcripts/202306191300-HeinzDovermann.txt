Good morning, everybody. And for me, it's early morning, and I'm happy to attend the meeting. I'm happy to get an opportunity to talk about some things that I've been doing for a few years. So, thank you for the organizers, and thank you for the audience. And here's a list of some collaborators that I had over the years from a number of places. The years from a number of places. And if anyone later on would like to read more what I have been doing, then you can go to my website, my department website, and there you find a lot of papers, mostly published ones. I don't really think preprints. So my point of departure a long time ago was some question from algebraic geometry, namely, if you take Namely, if you take an action of a reductive group on Cn, is it going to be algebraically conjugate to a linear action? So our actions really nice. And Jerry Schwartz showed this is wrong. And we weren't into complex edge-based geometry. We were topologists and we thought about it and we proved that at the time. At the time, if you take an action of A5, then it can act on Rn without a fixed point. And that means it's certainly not linear. And the proof at the time was you take some one fixed point action on a sphere, a speed we had constructed, then you make it with the algebraic, and then you remove the fixed point. If you remove a point, point if you remove a point from a sphere you get Euclidean space so philosophically the question is can you make some structures more rigid or nicer like can you triangulate a topological manifold can you make a P L manifold differentiable or C1 C infinity or maybe a smooth one analytic and the contact And the conjecture which was out there was: if you take a closed smooth manifold, is it a non-singular real algebraic variety? So in 1952, John Nash proved that a manifold is going to be a set of components of some non-singular real algebraic variety. Variety and in the last section of the paper, you asked this question whether you get actually a variety. Was called conjecture later. So we are going to go into the equivariant category. And for us in topology, this means G should be a compact Lie group and it would act linearly or orthogonally on airbyne space. Orthogonally on a fine space, call it a representation. And the objects that we are talking about are going to be real algebraic G varieties. So you take a zero set of a set of polynomials and you assume it's invariant and you restrict the action. And that's what's called a real algebraic variety. We will always assume they're non-singular. Always assume they are non-singular as Whitney defined it, and we use the Euclidean topology for not terroristic. And one example that we need throughout is the Grassmannian and introduce an inner product, introduce an orthonormal basis, then you can write subspaces as orthogonal projections on subspaces. On subspaces. And then you have your typical equations: L squared is L and L transpose is L. So you get polynomial equations in the entries of the matrices, and that gives you the Grassmannian as a real algebraic variety. And for your category, you would like to have more presence. So a regular map is one that extends so that the core. Extends so that the coordinates are polynomials. So the varieties were subsets of Euclidean space, so we want to extend it. And entire rational means that you have a regular function, but you're allowed to divide by a polynomial that does not vanish on x. So we want the functions to be defined everywhere. And our vector bundles. Our vector bundles will be called strongly algebraic, and there you assume that the classifying map is homotopic to an entire rational map. So a nice map in the category. Sometimes you just take the map as the vector bundle. And then some abbreviations, I mean, algebraic model. Algebraic model of a closed smooth G manifold is going to be a non-singular real algebraic variety that is equivariantly diffeomorphic to the manifold. And the strongly algebraic model is one so that all vector bundles over X are strongly algebraic. And the conjecture is then: well, take a compact leap loop and hope that every close smooth G. That every closed smooth G manifold has a strongly algebraic model. Little background: Zeifert in 1936 looked at codimension one sub-manifolds of Rn and he pushed them a little to make them components of varieties. And Nash continued this and he stated the conjecture as I just said. Conjecture, as I just said. And in 1973, Tonioli proved Nashville's conjecture. So, closed smooth manifolds have algebraic models. And then they added vector bundles a little later, so Benedetti and Van Yuri. And manifolds have strongly algebraic models. And there's a nice group by Ekboluten. A nice group by Ekbolut and King from 1981 that gives conceptualizes the group. But just unlike in other situations, these closed smooth manifolds have uncountably many vibrationally inequivalent models. So that's to me it's surprising, but here you have two varieties. But here you have two varieties. You have the tropos S1 cross S1 sitting in R4 and the one as you know it. And the truth is these two descriptions of the toros are not virationally equivalent. When you look at the ring of regular functions, then one has cool dimension infinity and one is cool dimension one. Dimension one. If you take a homogeneous space, then it has a unique algebraic structure, equivariantly. And you may want to go back. I mean, pretty much in Chevalier's book, you find that a compact Lie group has a unique algebraic structure. I mean, it's hinted at in there. And we proved ultimately. And we proved, I mean, we generalize this result of Borknach and Kuchart. And as long as MOG is of dimension bigger than one, so if you don't have just homogeneous spaces, then equivariantly you can also find uncountably many vibrationally inequivalent models, but you have to have one to begin with. So, the meta theorem is: if you have a situation that is coordinated to an algebraic situation, then it's also ideomorphic to one. And first of all, we generalize this theorem of a co-looking that let's say a map is algebraic if domain and range are non-singular real algebraic. Are non-singular real algebraic varieties and the map is entire rational. So we are just in that category. And then coordinate to an algebraic map means you can essentially assume it's an algebraic map up to diffeomorphism. So you have this diagram, you have a diffeomorphism from m to x to the variety, and the diagram commutes. One map is. One map is an entire rational. So we have the setup that Tonioli provided or output. And when you want to include bundles, maybe many bundles take the product of Grassmannians. And overall, the theorem would be: so every closed smooth G manifold has a strongly G manifold has a strongly algebraic model. If for a G like this, every class, every bodies and classes, an algebraic representative. So a map with domain, real algebraic variety, an entire rational map. And N is unoriented borders. So throughout the talk, I mean, no simplifications. No simplifications, no complex structures, just work with unoriented borders. The idea behind is so equivariant k-theory is finitely generated over the representation ring. And your standard operations like direct sum, intense subproduct, and orthogonal complements, they work with strongly algebraic bundles. Only algebraic bundles. And then, if you take some finite collection of vector bundles, classify them by a map to a product of Grassmannians. You assume that this map can be replaced by an algebraic map. You assumed it was forbidden to one, so you replace it by one. And then the component. And then the component gives you strongly algebraic fungals. Well, good and nice and easy example. Really nice and simple example. Take a free action of Z2. Take a free involution. And then you can take the mapping cylinder of the orbit map. And the boundary is going to be. And the boundary is going to be the manifold that you started out with. And on the interior, you have certainly fixed points. But the bundles extend and you have a bounding situation. And you conclude that every smooth 3Z2 action has a strongly algebraic model. Well, if you want to work on it, you need a bunch of tools. You need a bunch of tools. Sure. This joint union of varieties is a variety, includes strongly algebraic. You can do induction. So if you have a manifold, H manifold, and you say it's strongly L-G-wave, you can reduce it up to a G-manifold. Finite and infinite, no problem. But one word of caution: quotients really do not work in the algebraic category. So the quotient of the geometric and algebraic quotient are not the same. And think about Tarski-Zeidenberg. I mean, you have a variety and you take a quotient, you get. Take a quotient, you get inequalities, and then we looked around and said, What computations are known and what do we get? And we proved that semi-free actions or manifolds with semi-free actions have strongly algebraic models. A variation of what I just said: if you have a central element. If you have a central element of order two in the group, and then M will have a strongly algebraic model if the fixed point set does, but it's a G mailbox, not a, you cannot divide it out. And so also if you have strongly algebraic models for H manipulates and for H cross C2 and something for And some things for odd order groups were known, so you could use odd order class elementary abelian two group. What we would like to have, and that's one of our contractors, is take a finite group, take its 02 subgroup, and you would hope that if G2 manipulates. If G2 manifolds have strongly algebraic models, then G manifolds have. Right, I mean, the hope is that autism is a vector space over Z2 and only the 02 subgroup should matter. And there is some theorem of Bob Strong that implies this, but you have to assume that the That the isotropic groups of the action are of two-power order. So, how do we get rid of the other ones? As you said earlier, blow-ups or how to blow away. So, I want to take a G-manifold, I take an invariant sub-manifold with some normal bundle, and I want to blow up along with that sub-manifold. With that submanifold, and I take the normal bundle added where we want to take the projective bundle, and then both of them contain A and they have the same normal bundle, so I can remove disk neighborhoods and glue the resulting things together. And bundles extend, no problem. And the theorem that you prove is Group is if the blow-up has a strongly algebraic model and the sub-manifold along which you blew up, then M itself will have a strongly algebraic model. And the strategy would be, well, try and blow up the certain isotropic groups. The proof is what you expect. I mean, the manifold is coordinated to the blow-up and this projected. To the blow-up and this projective bundle. And the bundles over A were strongly algebraic, so they pulled back to something strongly algebraic over the projective bundle. And then you use your borderism. So, as I said, try and blow over. Said, try and blow away eight fixed point sets. First thing is it's not an invariant submanifold, but you have to look at the fixed point set of H and then also at fixed point sets for contradicts of H. And what would it mean to successfully blow up? Well, first of all, you want the blow-up to exist. Blow-up to exist. Secondly, you would like the fixed point set, H fixed point set, to be empty thereafter. And if a fixed point set was empty, you don't want to keep it that way. And then you want some general statement that if the blow-up is strongly algebraic, then the manifold itself was already. And sorry, to design this strategy, so you have to make sure that MH crime and MHW crime do not intersect if the groups are conjugate and not the same. Then you get that you have an invariant submanifold and you could And you could say sometimes we use that H is of order, then the fixed points, H fixed set goes away, but it's not the only option. And then assume that MH has a strongly algebraic model, but the action on it is just the normalizer of H in G. And all right, so let's. And all right, so let's look at a few very special cases. Suppose the group is trivial. So that's a totally classical case. Use a Tom homomorphism from the Bordism group to the homology of the classifying space. And then you remember that the Schubert varieties span the other fundamental classes of the Schubert variety. Of the Schubert varieties, they will span the homology of BO. And you have the inclusions that give you entire rational maps and they classify the bundle restricted to the Schubert variety. And that gives you algebraic representatives for all the classes in this border group. In this borders and group. So that case was totally classic and beautiful. Well, let's say the group acts trivially. And the theorem is still we have a strongly algebraic model. And there you go back to K-theory, like Atiel's book, and what you find. And what you find is a theorem that describes equivariant bundles as direct sums of certain other ones. So you break up your bundle according to how the group acts on the fiber. You take the homomorphisms of a product bundle with fiber and irreducible representation. To this particular bundle that gives you a non-equivariant bundle. So these bundles here, they give you a collection of vector bundles over a space on which the group acts trivially. So we know we can find a good model for those. And then you have this division ring, could be R, C, or the quaternion. The RC or the quaternions, depending on the group alpha, and then you tensor with the product bundle. Fiber is an irreducible reference intention, and that's an strongly algebraic bundle. So you reconstructed the bundle from its pieces, and each of them you made algebraic. All right, so we can prove that. All right, so we can prove the theorem if G acts trivially on the base space. Let's jump on a step further. Let's say whether we want to allow one isotropic type, assume it's normal. And there we get a theorem if every representation of H is a restriction of a representation of G. Representation of G, then we still have a strongly algebraic model. And the idea is like the one in Arthur. It's only that you can generalize that formula. You did not need that the action on the base was trivial. The assumption that the representation extends is what you Is what you need. And you can even generalize that more. There are other versions of this, but let's be happy with this. So if you have a one isotropy type action and the representations extend, you're fine. Well, even for Z4, that does not. Z4 that does not happen, and what you will do is so divide out the kernel of the action, then you get free bodies and classes. And maybe you don't take the entire fixed point set of this class mannion, but you just take a component. So you have the Borel construction that gives you an isomorphism. Gives you an isomorphism to a non-equivariant polison group. And then you apply again the Tom homomorphism to get to homology. And then you say, well, let me take a spectral sequence and compute the homology and then try to lift those classes back and hope that I can write down algebraic representation. Write down algebraic representatives. So, you want to really write down generators for equivariant borders. First problem is this spectral sequence does not even collapse for C4. And actually, it collapses at E3, so it's not that bad. But there is serious work involved from that point on. From that point on. So, one thing happens: sometimes you can take the fiber and you write it as some product of where the group acts trivially and maybe one part where it does not. So you can factor out the part with the trivial action. Because you can do this in homology, you get some type of Kinet formula for equivalent. For equivarian bodies. Well, under the assumption that you only have one isotropic type. And I'm really in need of Kundal formulas. And if anyone knows other nice formulas of this nature, I would really appreciate it. All right, let's try and go a little further. Let's try and go a little further. I mean, we are talking cyclic groups. Based on the computations that I showed you a moment ago, you can write down generators and show that they are electro-based. But it's not quick. It's like 25 pages. Like 25 pages. So thereafter, you say, well, with the tech technique of blow-ups, I can make sure that I have situations where I have two neighboring, two adjacent isotropic groups, one of index, two in the other one. And then I can look at some conablot sequence. And the most left term there. The most left term there by inductive assumption has already strongly algebraic classes, represented classes. So, what you need to show is that elements in the kernel of this connecting homomorphism live back to algebraically represented classes in this well second term in the top row. The second term in the top row. And you can compute. Well, a theorem says you can, but first of all, you write down a bunch of generators, you calculate characters and numbers for them, you calculate the rank of that group because nothing is natural. You can only calculate in cohomology and you. Calculating co-homology and you need homology. But then you make rank estimates and you say you had enough. Just like classical things. So the conclusion is closed smooth manifolds with cyclic actions do have strongly algebraic models. Okay, so Let's push it further. I mean, we had this role of the ZO2 subgroup earlier. Suppose the ZO2 subgroup is cyclic, then we would like to see that we get strongly algebraic models for these manifolds. And there you go back, there's some 19th century theory more proving yes. Theorem of Rouvenius, and it tells you in that situation you have a sort of exact sequence. You have a normal two complementary subgroup. So the group L and this sequence is of odd order. And what you want to do thereafter is successively and successfully blow up H. Possibly blow up H fixed point sets for subsets, subgroups of L. Right? I mean, they have they're of all order, so at least the fixed point set will go away. You have to struggle a little bit to make sure that you get some manifolds. You have to calculate intersections, and eventually, once you got rid of all of them, you apply storm. Of all of them, you apply Strong's result and reduce it to the cyclic case. Okay. Then there's something I don't see here. Okay. Okay. Then you say, oh, let me look at simple groups. And there's some old classification that tells you which simple groups have abelian, elementary abelian zero to subgroups. And they are those groups, PSL, Q, and Q has to be an odd power of a prime. Odd power of a prime that is three plus or minus three moduli. There are some regroups, and there's the Jenko group, J1. And I have a group theorist, Solomon Ohio, who always helps out when I have group theory questions. And then what I'm saying is also true for age. Also, is true for A4 and RB, which are simple. And so the theorem is even for these, I mean, if you take one of those groups and we take a closed smooth G manifold, then M will have a strongly algebraic model. And the technique is Is as before. You like to blow up fixed point sets for various subgroups and until you are left only with subgroups of two power order and apply Strong's result. And my technique is all Here you have the latest of subgroups of the contributory classes of subgroups. And then you have to sit down and devise a way to get from bottom to top and eliminate everything that is not of two power order. So, what next? Where does it leave us? We covered a lot of groups, but the only two groups that we covered were elementary ability, so product of C tools. So product of C2s and then cross it with a citric group. And so our next candidates would be dihedral D8. It's good enough if you study D8 and you have enough ideas to do any dihedral group. E6 we can do. The Paternionian group. And C4 cross C4. And so any of these will give you some substantial new insight that might lead you further. I mean, the truth is, if you look at Stong, he says, well, Bodhisattva is not computable. Computable if the spectral sequence does not collapse. And we actually have gone beyond it because our spectral sequence did not collapse. But we don't really want to calculate all of Odism. We only want to show that the generators are of a particular form. And I mean, I mean, if anyone wants to see some of the classical computations, there are some in Kozniovsky's book. So he did some computations for the variant groups, but he doesn't get really much further explicitly than the secret group. But some ideas come from there. So But nobody believes that you can compute voltage. And I heard so many generators or about so many generators in the earlier groups talks. And I have to know them explicitly. And sure, you can't really write. Can't really write down much more than something in terms of algebraic equations, but you still have to prove it. So I'm working on these three groups and I've made progress, some progress on all, but I have big problems left for each of them also. For each of them, also. So mostly spectral sequence type problems, computational problems. And even what to do with conoploid sequences if you have too many isotropic groups. And I do apologize because I talk too fast or I rushed with. What I rushed with because I didn't see my sliding dumbestone yet. So I'll be happy to answer questions. You hear me? Yeah, I know. Yeah, I hear you. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, I hear you. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Thank you very much, Professor. So interesting problem. So we pass to the questions. Yeah, go ahead. Hello, this is Eric. So in this theorem here, I wanted to ask about the slide. So how did you organize H here? How did you pick the H's to work through? I mean, for any of for our three, let's say. Let's say well, you try to start at the bottom and then work your way up. And actually, if you go into gap, they will organize the subgroups with the previous one and below linearly for you. Okay. So, otherwise, I mean, look at this diagram. And otherwise, I mean, if you look in the classic. I mean, if you look in the classification of finite groups, there's Dixon's theorem. And for, let's say, the PSL groups, it gives you a good idea of the subgroups and divisibility. So you use mostly divisibility to say, oh, one group is not above another one. And after I blew up, And after I blew up something, this is now a largest isotropic loop. If it's not of odd order, you try and go one step up and you show that it's still a manifold and you can still blow up. So it's combinatorical playing around. So is it casework? You have to go through lots of cases through this lattice? So, sorry, is it casework then? Like, depending on what you know about the stabilizer? Okay. One group after another. Okay. So, you make a long table and you say case one, two, three, four, five, and maybe you get up to 15 steps that you have to go through. Sometimes you can gather them in groups. Okay. And just to clarify, so is this diagram all of the subgroups of Re3? All of the subgroups of Re3? No, that's for the Re3. That's the conjugacy classes of subgroups. Okay, yeah. Great. And you have to be a little bit careful, like you see a C9 prime and C9 double prime. Sure. So they are isomorphic, but not conjugate. Sure. So conjugate ones. Conjugate ones, you can deal with at the same time. Sure. Other questions? I can pass the mic. Hello? Yeah. Where is the camera? There. So I was wondering what is the difficulty in the quaternions? Where does it lie the difficulty? There are very few subgroups, so one can exactly. Exactly. So it's just five. So, where is the where does it lie? The difficulty? The problem. Let me go back a couple of slides. If we go here, okay. So this relative term, you can write as k h fixed point set. A H fixed point set plus normal bundle data. And then, if you look at the boundary, you also get to one dimension lower. And then the difference is whether it bounds as an H manifold or as a K manifold. And that will depend on the representations. And And when you take one of those, what I call bad representation, if you look at, say, even C4 and you take the real representation of C2 with antibodal map with multiplied with negative one. This representation is a This representation is a real representation, but it's not the restriction of a representation of G. So, in this calculation, you are changing from BO to BU and that causes a lot of trouble. Thank you, thank you. So, when you look at the spectral sequence, it doesn't collapse. Sequence, it doesn't collapse. In some columns, you don't worry, but then later on, you have to compare trend classes versus Whitney classes and really compute. So, as I said earlier, in this one theorem, as long as the representation extends, life is kind of easy. Life is kind of easy if it does not, then things get bad. Okay, thank you, Professor. Is there another question? Is anything known for positive dimensional Lie groups? Like, is this work? Is it known for human, for example? I mean, the earlier theorems that we had, if you have a semi-free action. If you have a semi-reaction, they work in general. And that's about it. The other aspect, I mean, that you had those uncountably many examples, they work for compactly groups, no problem. But otherwise, Otherwise, I don't know how to handle many, many isotopic groups. I also don't even know S1. Another questions? Less thanks to Professor. Thank you very much, Professor. So, thank you.
