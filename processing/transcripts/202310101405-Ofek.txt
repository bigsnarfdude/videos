So we're making each device a screen. It's not entirely justified by some of them. So I'm going to be talking about the central dimension of raw and width classes using vibrations. And I'll start with the plan. So we'll start with some general definitions and context of the definition of essential dimension and so on. Then we'll talk about the essential dimension of a central simple algebra versus the essential dimension of versus the essential dimension of our class. So our main results for in the context of simple simple algebras are bounds that work for Blauer classes, but those bounds actually work in slightly greater generality. So I'll sketch them for Law homology classes of higher degree as well. Give a sketch of the proof. And then I'll talk about. And then I'll talk about essential dimension of how mission forms versus the essential dimension of the root process. So some notation, k is a field and p is some line different from the characteristic. I'm also assuming that I have all primitive roots of unity of order p to the n, m would be something over k. L would be some field over K. Nu is evaluation over K on L, and it will be evaluation of high rank, so R is the rank. L nu and nu L will the node, the residue field value group of nu. We'll need Meinler K theory and C S A N is isomorphism classes of central simple idealized of the k the start of the general definition. Start with the general definition, but maybe this is known for most people. Um so we start with just an arbitrary functor of fields, uh but you should think of like some this spam causing some isomorphism classes of some object, like maybe central simple algebra, something like this. Uh then we define the essential dimension of an object x over some field L as the minimum number of uh algebraically independent parameters we need to define it. Independent parameters in the way to define it. The way to formalize it is like this: so I look at all subfields to which X descends, and I take the minimum of their consensus data. It's a very natural kind of definition, but obviously there's nothing to be said in this generality, and it's in general very hard to compute. Another definition that we often use is that the central dimension of the entire functor basically supreme. Dimension of the entire functor thus the supremum over the central dimension of all objects in the universe. Okay, one more general definition before I get to examples and so on. So we can also talk about the essential dimension at a prime p. That's just defined by ignoring extensions of degree prime to p. So again, the definition is the same, but before descending x, Before descending x, I allow to base change to a degree prime to be extension L prime. So first I base change x, and then I descend it to an arbitrary field, and I take the minimum of transcendent statements. Similarly, we talk about the central dimension p of a functor. The reason to make this slightly more general definition is because it gives us a little bit more flexibility, and this number is often computed. Number is often computable while even if the central dimension itself is not computable. This definition clear. I assume it's familiar to most people. And we clearly always have that the essential dimension of an object is greater than the essential dimension at P just because we are allowing more fields in our definition. Of course, it can be strict because X can be, for example, Because x can be, for example, split by a degree of pi and p. Okay? So a little bit of context. So this was, the original definition was made by Zinovi and Joe Mueller in 1997 for tosses of finite groups. And then later Zinovi defined it for tosses of algebraic groups. Defined in four toses of a tubular group. So here the functor is just given by an abelian cohomology. And this kind of framework also includes, so we just saw this before, you can also talk here about like vertic forms, inter-simple algebra, mission forms, and so on, because those ends are classified like G2 says. And then there's the notation from Mullier's talk, the essential dimension of the grouping. That the essential dimension of the group is the essential dimension of this functor of torsions. So this is the common information. There are many interesting and open questions within this framework. It's very rich. And yet it's also interesting to talk about the more general functors. So this definition was made later by Coir and written up with some nice exposition by Beru and Favi, 2003. Now coming to Now, coming to what more specific things we talk about today, so if you look at the kind of development of the subject, vibrations are far from very useful for producing lower bounds on essential dimensions and showing that some object doesn't descend to a field of low transcendental degree, especially when kind of the first parts always. Like, usually, you learn valuations very much. One of the main reasons I wanted to highlight here, like a very fundamental reason for this, is the following inequality on consensus degrees field. So, I have here a value field over k. So, mu is trivial of k. Then we have this in Cartier and conservance degree. The consent degree of L is at least the conservative degree of the residue field. It concerns the field, the residue field, plus the rank of the valuation. Basically, the reason is that elements with linearly independent valuation are in fact algebraic independent. This is very nice because it allows us to linearize the problem showing that some field by slabs transcendentally and Agree, and that's very useful. So, basically, what we did is we looked at two functors where there were no results known before, or maybe very few results known before, for value groups and with classes of omission forms or omission forms. And we try to find a way to apply this inequality. This is kind of the end of the general context if anybody has any questions. So let's talk about the central dimension of central simple algebras. So this really starts in 1967 for Chesse, that he defined universal division algebras of index n for any n. And these are, so these are versal torses. If we refer back to the previous talk, and he raised the problem of computing the essential dimension, basically considered as a central symbol algebra. Considered as a central simple algebra over the center of this thing, which is the same thing as the essential dimension of the entire functor central simple algebra of the Kn, because this is corresponding to also this person. So I'm not going to expand this. And I think he gave some weak upper bounds. And those were maybe slightly improved. But in terms of lower bounds, I don't think anything was known. Of lower bounds, I don't think anything was known until Zinovi's first paper on process of algebraic groups. He gave this example. So here, this is an algebra of degree p to the r along this Fashion and field and two R variables. It's this kind of product of our cyclic algebras kind of independent from each other. And Zinovi proved that Prove that this algebra A doesn't descend to a fit of smaller consent degree, even if you allow grant to be extensions. Proof is basically that there are many ways to see it, but I think all of them are just hold on to some valuation theory. So there's the proof and then there were some small improvements. I think the most important one is Emer Courier from twenty ten. Emil Courier from 2010. He constructed this generic abelian cost product, which are algebras of degree P to the R. And he showed that they don't descend to a subfeed of the sense degree less than this number, which is roughly like R times P to the R. So it's much, much larger. And here I wanted to maybe say that there's a big difference in the techniques here. So Sinovi's technique is Techniques here. So Sinovi's technique is at the heart of it, I think, there are valuations, and Makuyov uses valuations, but really uses much more. So the kind of differences coming from formulas for the essential dimension of algebraic tor i, this is kind of the magnitude here, so coming from the essential dimension of some torus. Okay, so. So, our talk is going to stay in the realm of the simple algebra's, the first realm. So, this is set of simple algebras. Let's talk about power classes. So, of course, it's very connected because every power class is the power class of some central simple algebra. And so, we have so every power class is the power class of some central simpler algebra A, and if the Central simple algebra A, and if the algebra descends, then it's clear that the power class descends as well. So we have this inequality on essential dimensions, right? But this inequality can be strict. So we know of one example. For example, from the Courier's bound, but this was known before. The essential dimension of the universal division algebra of the. Of the universal division algebra of degree four is five. But it turns out that if you go to a matrix algebra over that algebra, it suddenly becomes defined over a small fee. And this was shown by Lorentz Eisenhower and Solfland, 2003, by kind of a hands-on calculation. And we kind of asked But so the thing is, we don't know of any other examples. So we don't, there are other examples, of course, in degree four, but we don't know any examples with higher index, so the picture was really unclear what happens in general. And I think this is an open question, like just producing more examples. We still don't know what is the relation here. It's still working. So, but what was known, so the Diego's talk in the morning, we heard about comological dimension, right? So, in the case where K contains an algebraically closed field, we know that the cohomological dimension is bounded by the transcendence degree, and so we get this lower bound on the essential dimension of a cohomology class. So, if I have a class So, if I have a class, cohomology class of degree D, and it descends to a subfield of transcendence degree less than D, it has to be in fact trivial because a lower cohomology is trivial there, like in that degree. That follows from cell vanishing. This in particular gives lower bound of essential dimension at least two on the Bravo class of any non-trivial Bravo class. But as I put this more general theory, As I put this more general theorem here, even though maybe it's simpler to see this with SEN, is that I'm going to sketch the proof for general homology classes of higher degree as well, and the story is the same. As far as I can see, there was no better bound than this. And so we do kind of generalize the statement also for higher degrees. So let me state the theorem about viral classes. It's a very concrete theorem and simple. So we start again with the valuation of high rank R over the field, okay, and the power class beta. And we decompose it to the sum of symbols. So I have M symbols. Then we can define the following anti-symmetric matrix for the integral. Matrix over the integers just given by applying the valuation to the symbols and kind of taking the elementary anti-symmetric matrix defined by two vectors. Anti-symmetric and then we get the condition on the essential dimension in terms of the elementary divisors of this matrix albeta. So um the elementary devices are you know the elements that show up in the Smith normal form, if you forgot. Um so if you can compute those and it's very easy to compute then you get the lower bound. So in particular if the determinant of this matrix is not divisible by p to the n, then the central dimension is as large as the rank of evaluation. Be one more thing to say here. Here that if it turns out that the feed is strictly Enzelian, so Enzelian with separably closed present UFE, then this is actually precise. This is any questions about the statement of this here about symbols. Okay, I wanted to give uh Okay, I wanted to give uh an example or two. So, uh first of all we can apply to Zenobi's example, algebra from before. Again, we're working over the same field, the same algebra A, and we can choose a valuation. So choose an evaluation that takes the variables to The variables to standard basis vectors. You apply that valuation to the Rauer class, you just get this kind of block-diagonal anti-symmetric matrix, which has determinant one. So that means that the essential dimension at B is 2R, which is the same as the essential dimension of the algebra. But in this case, there's no surprises. You can't simplify by going to matrix algebra or simple algebra. And I just wanted to give another Wanted to give another example here. So part of the motivation is to apply these kind of techniques to homological invariant variants. So here we have quadratic form of discriminant one in four independent variables. And you can check that we have a concrete decomposition of the Clifford algebra, our class of the Clifford algebra of Q. Algebra, Bar class of the Clifford algebra of Q. Here's the quadratic form, and we have the pointer. Then we have the Clifford algebra of Q. Its bar class decomposes is the sum of quaternion algebras. And if you do the computation, again, you get this matrix, and again, the determinant is one. So the essential dimension of the Blau trust is the same as the essential dimension of the. The bio class is the same as the essential dimension of the quadratic form. So it's another way of computing the essential dimension of some quadratic forms. And you can do it more generally for other quadratic forms with higher shifts. So on you can try. So you don't get the precise, always the precise essential number change. Sometimes it's different. For example, if I looked at the same quadratic form with five variables, then I would get different essential numbers. Different essential dimensions for the passion value and then for the covatic term. Okay, for the proof sketch, I want to say a word about that characteristic. Here, just for this slide, k is a field of characteristic p. And here we have the surprising fact that the essential dimension of p of the Holt-Brauer group functor is 2. For me, this was very simple. Two. For me, this was very surprising, or maybe it's obvious for people who work with P algebras. This follows from Albert's theorem, which says that every P algebra is similar to cyclic algebra. And also, so cyclic algebras are more complicated than like cyclic P algebras are more complicated than cyclic algebra, so there's a little bit more work, but it is true. True. Not surprising, but it's not the end of the story. So there's a little bit more questions to ask here. So for example, if I replace the power group functor by the p-tossion part, so here the functor takes the field L to the p-toshen part of the particle. Then suddenly there's a film of McKinney which shows for this functor actually the essential dimension is infinity. The essential dimension is infinity, she constructs a family of examples, which are interesting for other reasons as well, but this is one thing which you can learn from her examples. The difference, so let me just highlight the difference, is that what happened here is that when now I'm asking, so the first thing I'm saying, if I start with the algebra, I can go to an extension I am to P and then to some matrix algebra. And then to some matrix algebra over the algebra, and that descends to the function field of a surface. But now, when I descend, I require that whatever algebra I descend to, it's still B torsion, right? It's still exponent B. So that makes the descent problem more complicated somehow. And then there are interesting questions to be asked. We also don't know what happens not at P. So again, this prime to B extension is necessary. Is necessary. So I just chose one example. I mean, the only example I could find of a simple lower bound imposed for p-algebra was the example of Samuel Bayk. In 2014, he constructed a central simple algebra of degree 4 and used the cohomological invariant to show its essential dimension is at least 4. So one can ask what happens to the Bower class, and I don't want it. I think it's interesting, but I don't. I don't know. I think it's interesting, but I don't know enough about homologically violence and characteristic to something to look at. Maybe the simplest example. And the difference here is that I'm not allowing extension span to be. Okay, so that's for the dial characteristic. So I want to give the proof sketch. So again, I'll be doing it for my logo classes. Welcome on to classes. Okay, so it's going to be very straightforward. So start with the evaluation of our rank of field L. We're going to use the non-residual isomorphism. So one can check there's a natural homomorphism of graded rings for min k-theory of L and exterior algebra on the value group, which takes just a symbol. Which takes just a symbol, its wedge product, apply the valuation to the symbol, and take the wedge. It's a very easy exercise to check that this is well defined. Once you, so then we want to relate this to the logic homology, or you can use the non-residual isomorphism. So, because L5 contains all element roots of unity, and it's good. Relevant roots of unity and its good characteristic. Normally isomorphism tells us that the Galois homology classes we're interested in are isomorphic to QB mod ZB tensor with minor KT. Maybe not the standard formulation, but it's not hard derived from the standard formulation. And then therefore we get a homomorphism from the Gadois homology, we get the variant. Draw a homology, we're going to get the variant into this group, which is QP mod Z T tensor with exterior algebra on the value group. And the formula is as simple as can be. You just apply the valuation to a symbol. You just apply the valuation to each element, you wedge them together, and you divide by the power of p appearing in the symbol. Now we have this invariant, and our goal is to show that if the invariant is complicated enough, then the Enough, then the class doesn't descend to a small field. So, how do we do it? We introduce a notion of complexity, which is very natural. So, if you look at, now just take some arbitrary class in this group, QP mods with P tensor with steel algebra, and let's just define rho of omega. So, omega is the name of the class, rho omega is this number, which is defined similarly to central dimensions. Which is defined similarly to central dimension. You look at all subgroups of the value group, such that omega actually lies in the smaller exterior algebra on that subgroup. I take the minimum of the ranks over Z. This is very similar to the previous definition we saw. Now we do some tautological observations. Observation. So assume that beta is a class of cohomology class over M descends to a cohomology class over E for some subfield, then it follows that the invariant, this wedge mu of beta, actually lies in the exterior algebra on the value group of E. So just by definition of rho, um the rank of the value group of E has to be at least uh rho of of the um invariant of beta. Of the invariant of beta. This should be clear. And then, therefore, we get the raw abundance of Pacanist degree by the fact that we started with right. So, the Pacanist degree is at least the rank, which is at least this raw. So, this gives us a lower bound. And the point is that, so this is a lower bound in the section dimension of theta because you took an arbitrary field to which theta descends. But the point is that one can compute well. That one can compute by contracting with co-vectors in the exterior algebra. And if you do that computation, you just end up with the theorem that I stated before in the case of the green. In general, it's a slightly different, more complicated criteria that I want to include here. So, a few remarks here. So, first of all, If the field is thickly inzelian, then this homomorphism that we defined is an isomorphism. This invariant was used by Eric Rassel in 2001, who studied the logo of the stitching field. And also, I wanted to say that we don't really need the norm-residue isomorphism theorem, and I'll explain in a second. Yeah, it's a complete overlook. But I still think that it's nice to state it like this because it's very simple. So any questions before I explain why we don't need the long-term device which isn't? Well, the proof is simple enough. I don't think anybody has any questions. So the reason is the following: so, we can do this also for cycle modules, or similar. For cycle modules or similar objects. So, a cycle module is a type of functor defined by Rost to be coefficient systems for his child groups of coefficients. So, kind of it's a complicated definition, but here are two properties of a cycle module. So, it comes with an action of Minnel K-Terry. So, it's a graded module of a Minnela K-Terry in a functorial way. And then also, we have residue maps for any. For any geometric discrete valuation. So it goes from the, so if my second module is M, it goes from M of L to M of the residue field and it decreases the degree by one. This satisfy a bunch of axioms which are generalizations of properties of mineral k theory and Gadois homology, things like that. So it turns out that there's a way to do this kind of abstract linear algebra. This kind of abstract linear algebra just using this structure. So, in particular, it doesn't use Doccato, of course, because Doccato is not true for an albutary cycle module. And you get a similar lower bound, but I don't present it because it's a little more involved. I presented it in Ottoline, I think very few people. I think very few people actually follow it. So I think probably, because it's too much motivation. It's too technical. And we still don't have strong enough applications to justify that technical kind of complication. But I put one example here. So you have a cycle, and you actually only need a cycle pre-module, for those of you who know what that is. It's a weaker structure. So if you have a cycle pre-module, and So if you have a cycle pre-module and its zero-created part is not identically zero, then as a functor, the essential dimension of any created part of degree at least two is infinite. And the way to see it is just you produce these classes by acting with mineral KTE similar to the classes we saw in Zenovi's example. Just like products of algebraically. A few examples here. So we have a few examples of cycle modules. There's minimal KT or equivalent KT or fields. There's a Gadoa cohort with coefficients in some torsion module, which is torsion co-prime to the characteristic. And there's also more fancy examples coming from cohomology theories with good properties. So for example, Theories with good properties. So, for example, the Grees show that if you have a projective variety over C, then you can look at this functor, it takes a field L to one of the diagonals in the motivo homology of X-base change 12. There's all kinds of examples, which most of them I don't understand at all, and I hope some people here understand them, so I can ask them questions about them. Okay, so this is all I had to say about the think about the first part, about value classes, cohomology classes. Move on to admission forms. So here also we are generalizing some film of Chenosov and Ser 2006. So they looked at these quadratic forms over a Quadratic forms of a field rational field. So here L is a rational field in R variables. And you look at this quadratic form, which is diagonal with entries which are monomials, the Ti's. Here V1 up to V D are exponent vectors. Can you get the corresponding monomials with those powers? And then there's a formula to compute the essential dimension. You reduce the exponent vectors mark 2, you get. Exponent vectors mod 2, you get elements of a vector space over F2, and the rank of that subset is the essential dimension. Yeah, so again, it's using valuation theory, and the main tool is to bring a decomposition theorem, which gives you esity maps. Why did they do it? Well, the main application in that paper is to give low back. The paper is to give lower bounds on essential dimensions of groups and positive characteristic. So I don't want to go too much into that, but the point is that, so here the statement is just you start with some split simple algebraic group of one of these many types, and there actually be many more types. In other cases, the statement is just slightly different. And assume that it's of rank r minus 1. So ranking is the dimension of the maximum toy. Maximum toy. Then, if you look at this field L without variables, Archional field without variables, they produce a G-toi serve of essential dimension at least R over this field. So again, they actually proved more, but the point is that you started the film on quadratic forms and then you create a torso that kind of corresponds to a quadratic form in some factorial way, and then you get the lower bound, the sensitivity. Actually, the same year that they published their paper, there was a generalization of Schringer decomposition theorem to emission forms, due to learn more. And using that theorem, we generalize the theorem to emission forms. So here we're working with the division algebra with the evolution E sigma. Is sigma, okay, such that the fixed field of the involution on the center is k. And we take some overfield L and assume there's a valuation on D base change to L of high rank of rank R that is trivial on the base field. Okay, and we get a similar lower bound. So, if I have an omission form just this diagonalization, then if I have Then, if I apply the valuation, I get something that is analogous to the exponent vectors from before. I reduce that mod 2, and I get, so then I reduce the exponent vectors mod 2. I get elements in a vector space over F2, and the rank of that subset is lower bound on the essential dimension F2. Maybe I should say what is the value on the vision algebra? On division algebra, just in case you haven't seen it before, it's just the same thing. It's just a homomorphism, it's just a homomorphism to a totally ordered group which preserves the triangle, satisfies the triangle inequality. Yeah, so and I should say that this lower bound also applies to the width class of H, similar to the bounds of Jonus O and C. So and cell. Okay, and immediate kind of an immediate collary is that if you start with the Hermitian vector space of a quadratic field extension of K, so think of like C over R, so you have Hermitian forms, and you let U be the associated unitary group. You can compute the essential dimension of that unitary group. Dimension of that unitary group. It's just the dimension of the underlying vector space. The reason is that the tosses of the unitary group classify Hermitian forms on V or some Bayesians of V. And using this film, you can compute the essential dimension. Similarly, you can compute the essential dimension of the special model group. It's wireless. And we can go further than that. So, 2010, it's a paper of Ronald Lotcher. He computed the essential dimension of algebraic groups of this form. So, groups of isometries of some division algebraic involution of degree 2 to the r. And so, kind of. Updating these techniques and applying the theorem from before, taking it a step further, we are able to show this expected theorem. So it has not yet been fully hitting up and checked, so I don't want to call it theorem just like completely, but it is true, I believe. So here I start with a simple algebra with involution again and again of a k. And again, of a case of case the fixed field of the involution, and the degree of a power of 2, because it's the same restriction coming from Ronard's paper. Then we can compute the essential dimension of the group isometries. It depends on the type of the involution, if it's orthogonal, symplectic, or unitary. And you see that in the unitary case. You don't get it by size. Don't get it precisely. So we get it up to a factor that's roughly like the degree of A over the index of A. So this is because of the difference between the group of isometries, the group of similitudes. Yeah, so and again the idea is the same And again, the B has the same TOSAS classified omission forms, and so kind of we are able to use evaluation theory to compute the essential dimension of the functor of Hermitian force. Yeah, this is all. So, this is the expected theorem. And then, one question I wanted to finish with is the following. This is a question that came up in Januso Sera's paper of 2006. So we can ask about the weight classes of the emission form. I didn't define it, so I thought I would not have time, and I actually did have time, so I couldn't define that. So again, we start with some division algebraic involution and some emission form of a d base change to L. And assume that the width class ascends to some subfield F. To some subfield F. So if I add some number of copies of that body plane, I can descend H to a smaller field. Then does H itself descend to a finite extension of F containing that? That is the question. And specifically, I'm interested in the case of one-dimensional forms. So, Chinoofsov and Sel raised this problem in Januf Servancel raised this problem in the paper, and it's still open in many, many cases. It's quite complicated. So, why ask it for emission forms where things are more complicated? The reason is that I'm interested in the one-dimensional case, and the one-dimensional case for characteric forms is immediate. You have the discriminant determines the form. You don't have the, the discriminant doesn't determine the form for Hermitian forms. And if we add the positive. And if we add a positive answer for the one-dimensional case, then we can compute the essential dimension of the width class of a generic emission form of a kipperic. So that's why I'm asking this question. And it seems like it should be easy, but I don't know how to do that. Other questions? Yes, I Yes, yes, uh at the end where you can create those extension dimensions for emission forms and red cases, etc. It's always the um dimension either two or away from two. I don't know how we're central dimension at two and not at two coins. Okay, yes, so that's what's careful of like how far is it from the actual it actually turns out to be the same thing. When we can compute it, I mean, for example, in the unitary case, Case we don't have the upper bound, it's not necessarily the same. It could be different. Okay, so it's not an arc. It's not always accurate, just the computation shows that it is the same. About the definition of your map from the 60th power. So, to define that, actually, in meritus. Absolutely. And then you can things that directly are helpful to say the valuation are quadruped and then it's much easier to spin into the composer if you know the spectrum and then by that it's much easier. That's another way to avoid logos. And someone you say avoid the message. Yeah, I start with galaxy homology and I use the fact that it satisfies the axioms of cycle modules, right, when I have what it's a property. And then there's a way to formulate the construction. To formulate the construction, you kind of utilize it and you formulate it in terms of these maps. You get the same role. I mean, you can get slightly stronger things, as well as all things. Is it just because you have an action of normal case here, you need the compatibility a little bit as well? Yes, of course, but that's all you need. So you don't need normal maps, although I think they might simplify that too. File. All you need is like residue maps. Other questions? I might know. If you go back on your slides, yeah, this one, like the corollary, did it for quadratic extensions. There, of course, the next case would be like quadratic algebra. They have to have a result of. You have a result of that sort also for unitary standard evolution or whatever. Yeah, so that's covered by has quaternion algebra of K2. So if you take some emission form of a qu uh quaternion um algebra depends on the diameter of the vectors. Depends on the diameter of the right version. So, this is the thing: that here it's a simple algebra, it's not a division algebra. So, I'll get the matrix algebra of the endomorphisms of that space. And in there, I find diisometries. So, die isometries are determined by the dimension. And the point is just the dimension just multiplies the essential dimension. So, you can separate out the variables, whatever you get for the case of. Get for the case of dimension one, you just multiply that by there. One of the things you're doing is you're taking symbols of like the Aperia and you're in some sense computing some kind of temperature for them. But what happens if you start by But what happens if you start by putting Velner VidK theory there? Then you have that that comprises a Velma K theory and quadratic form. So I wish I had a way to, I mean of course they map to both things. So we can do general subset and we can do what we did for the power class, but for higher classes, but the question of how to combine them, I think there are some formal ways to do it maybe, but yeah. Yeah, so you can do it this way. I mean, I think you can combine them. But I cannot see any applications. Even for cycle modules, I'm not sure what are the interesting applications. So it seems that to write down the field, the module case would probably be how they have a planet. Like if you want to look at the interaction between the two parts, the weak wing and theory and probably being more complicated there because also the lesser. Probably be more complicated because also the lesson maps depend on uniformizers. And then what would we do with it once? It makes sense. Yeah, absolutely. I think you can do it. That's my answer, but I haven't got cycle module on undermining. I have a notion. I think maybe, I don't know, it's talk about it. I'm not sure if it will work the same automatically. Maybe you need to ask something more. And that's like our speaker. And you
