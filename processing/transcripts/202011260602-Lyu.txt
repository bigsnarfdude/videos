So today I will speak about the homogenization of study in Navier-Stoke's Fourier system. And this is based on the joint work with Milan Pogoni from Charles University in Prague, where I did my postdoc several years ago. I mean, that's seven years ago. No, no, no. Yes. So 104. Yes. So 10 flies. With the under the support of the more project, which the for which the boss is Joseph Malek. Okay, that was a long sentence. And we have, so it follows to the, it falls in the framework of homogenization problem in fluid mechanics. And for this homogenization problem in fluid mechanics, Problem in fluid mechanics, we are concerned with the behavior of the fluid flows in domains perforated with a large number of small holes. And mathematically, we want to know the solution describing this fluid flows in this perforated domain how this solution behaves when the host, the size of the host goes zero and the number of hosts goes. Goes to zero and the number of holes goes to infinity. And so, for the equations describing the fluid flows, we can consider different ones depending on different background. For example, the Stokes equations, the Navier-Stokes equations, even the Euler equations. And we can also consider, for example, some non-Newtonian fluid models like P-Stokes. And we can consider incompressible K fluids or compressed fluid. Fluid or compressed fluid. And we can also study the stationary equations or the non-stationary equations. And in this study, the main typical thing is the domain, which is provided with a large number of very small holes. And so it's very important to it is crucial also to know the distribution of the holes in this proverbial domain. And for this distribution, And for this distribution, there are mainly two important parameters. The first one is the mature distance between the host, and where we use epsilon here. And another one is the size of the hose. And typically, there are two cases. One is for the size of the hose A epsilon. It could be like epsilon to some power alpha, and alpha is larger than one. And another one is for A epsilon, which is of this kind, like exponential. This kind, like exponentially small. And for the first one, it's used to study the problem in dimensions larger or equal to three. And the second one is more properly to study the equations in two dimensional settings. And here is the typical description of the host. And we use it t epsilon k to denote. Use it t epsilon k to denote the holes. And it has a center point, which is epsilon xk. And it has a model hole, like a shape, T, and it has a size A epsilon here. So this is included in this epsilon QK, where this QK is the cubes that is used to cover the whole domain, R D, for example. Why? What happened? I'm sorry. I don't so yeah, so and uh I mean in this distribution we are assuming actually the hosts are periodically distributed. And this is actually the simplest setting for the distribution of holes. And in this case, the epsilon here hidden here is Hidden here is used to describe the mature distance. Every hole is located in some cube of size epsilon and like this. And the distance between one central point to another one, the one next to it, is epsilon. And this A epsilon is used to describe the size. And we assume all the holes look like the same. It's all similar to this typical model. Similar to this typical model of T. And the ratio defined by this quantity, all this quantity, is very important. And we will see later on that the behavior of this ratio crucially determine the limit behavior of the equations or the solution to the equation describing the fluid flows. So the preferred domain omega epsilon is this domain omega, that minus all the Omega, Z minus all the holes. And here is like two photos, two pictures for this profile domain omega epsilon. And this one is the case like given in the previous slide. The holes are periodically distributed. And you have this omega, which is the bounded domain, and you have all the holes, which is the black ones. And this omega epsilon is omega, 7 minus all these holes. So there is a systematic study by Alex. So he considered the Stokes equations in two or higher dimensional settings, and with the right-hand side F in L2 omega, with Debris free condition and non-slick boundary condition. And this ratio is sigma epsilon is defined in the previous slide, the slide before, and we know it's given in this form. So the behavior of this ratio determines Of this ratio determines the limited behavior of these equations. And more precisely, if this sigma epsilon goes to infinity, what does it mean if it goes to infinity? If sigma epsilon goes to infinity, it means the denominator A epsilon to the power of D minus 2, I mean, D is larger than 3, so this is positive. So the denominator is very, very small compared to this epsilon to the power D. So it means the size of the holes are very, very small. And in the limit, you don't see. And in the limit, you don't see any influence of the holes. That means in the limit, you get Stokes equations again. And if the limit of sigma epsilon is zero, it's opposite to the first one, it means the denominator is relatively large. So it means the size of the holes are relatively large, is relatively large. So in the limit, the equation is, I mean, it's much influenced by this by. By this, by the presence of the host, and you get the Darcy law, which is used to describe the power. Sorry, so you get Darcy law in the limit. And for the second is the critical case, where the limit of sigma m epsilon is not zero or infinity, it's just a positive number. And in the limit, you get the Brinkman. Limit, you get the Brinkman law, Brinkman equation, which is which looks like a combination of the Stokes equations and the Darty law. And in 2D, it's a little bit different. So in 2D, you have this sigma epsilon defining this way, where, I mean, this log epsilon, if you consider the limit of sigma epsilon, this log epsilon does not care. The crucial thing is epsilon times log A epsilon to the power one half. So you have to consider A epsilon looks like the A epsilon looks like the exponentially small case where this log A epsilon to the power of one half is something like epsilon minus one. And then you know this stigma epsilon goes to zero infinity or some positive number. So there are different ways to explain this stigma epsilon. One thing comes from the point guide inequality in the domain, like in the cube, said minus a whole of size epsilon, I mean of size. I mean, of size A epsilon over epsilon. From there, and if you, because the hosts are very, it's this ratio, I mean, this ratio A epsilon over epsilon is a ratio when you rescue the domain by epsilon and such that the cube, like the mature distance, become one, and the size of the host become A epsilon over epsilon. And if you take out each cube, you have a cube of size one, and in the center, you have a domain. You have a domain, a hole, which is that A epsilon over epsilon. I mean, in general, A epsilon over epsilon goes to zero, such that these holes are very small. But still, you have like kind of this Tata's idea of cell problem. I mean, he used this cell problem to modify the text functions. Okay, I don't want to go to very details, but from there and Poang inequality, you have this number. You will see sigma epsilon exactly. So, in Point Gai inequality, Exactly. So in the Point inequality, you have u L to norm less than sigma epsilon greater than u L to norm. The same as this. Another way to explain or to see this sigma epsilon is the two capacity of all the holes. So sigma epsilon to the power two, which is like this quantity, or sigma epsilon to power two, that is epsilon squared, this quantity, is exactly the upper bound for all the two. All the two capacities or for the two capacity of all the holes. So imagine for one, I mean, not the capacity, the capacity inverse. Imagine for like this case. So for the two capacity of a hole of size A epsilon, the two capacity has the upper bound, which is A epsilon to the power of D minus two. And how many holes you have? And because the major distance is epsilon, so the total. is epsilon, so the total number of the holes is epsilon to the power minus d. So the total capacity you have estimate, which is, I mean, this one inverse. So you see exactly this case. So you have this result. And this is typically for 3D case where epsilon should be compared to epsilon to the power alpha and alpha should be compared to 3 because now this denominator. This denominator is epsilon to the power of one, and the nominator is epsilon three. So, if alpha larger than three, you have very, very small holes. You don't see the difference in the equity in the limit. And if alpha is smaller than three, it converges to some couple which satisfy the Darcy law. And here, it's not the U epsilon itself convergence to the solution of Darcy law, it's U epsilon over this power. epsilon over this power over this epsilon to the power three minus alpha where this power three minus alpha is positive because alpha is smaller than three it means in the case of large holes the hose actually slow down substantially the velocity field such that the atom norm of this quantity isn't uniformly bounded and then you get dusky law i mean this tilde means extension because before passing to the limit you have to Passing through the lamin, you have to extend the solution from omega epsilon to some fixed domain like omega. So, this is a critical size of holes where you have a limit couple which satisfy the Brinkman law. And here you see you have additional damping term from this original Stokes equation. I mean, if you throw away this damping term, you get Stokes. If you throw away this minus La Blacien, you get... It is minus Laplacian, you get the Darcy law from the previous slide. So it's like a combination of those two. And then for there are many other results on Poisson or Stokes equations, I mean homogenization of these equations in this performed domain. Much earlier than Tata results, Alex's results, Taktal should also derive also Darcy law from the homogenization of Stokes system. And I mean, he can, he has a, it's a He can, he has a rather short note, and he can say this typical case where A epsilon is proportional to epsilon. It means the size of holes are proportional to the mature distance. And Tiolanescu and Miha, they considered the Poisson equation and they derived the Brinkman law in the limit in this 2D case, where the size of the host is to this power. I mean, it's exponentially small, and this absence is exactly. Small and this absence is x to the power minus two, which is critical size. I mean, for different ones, for minus alpha, alpha, smaller, or larger than two, you have different thing, different limit, which is, I mean, given by L, you know, systematic study. Okay, Takta and Chiang Lesko Muha used different methods to modify the test function because originally you have an equation omega epsilon, you have test functions, test functions like C C infinity omega epsilon, but again the limit. Infinity omega epsilon, but again the limit you have uh equation in omega for which proper text functions are C C infinity omega. So if you want to have the limit equation which is defined in omega, you have to modify the text function from C C omega epsilon to C C omega C C infinite omega to C C infinite omega epsilon. I mean they use the rather abstract framework and then Aleph followed this framework but for Tartan he used his cell problem. Cell problem, which here is like a local problem, a different one. It's like an equation defined in X-ray domain. Here is the equation defined in each cube. It's also like oscillating test function thing. And when Jajing from Tsinghua University and myself, we can show different, we use, I mean, Tata's method, a generalized one, to prove the same thing as ALAM. To prove the same thing as RM for plus one stores. And here I also consider the homeless in the whole space. I mean, where this domain omega epsilon is defined by omega side and minus all the host, the omega there is taken to be R D, the whole domain, meaning that the hosts are distributed in the whole domain, no matter how far away. And also considered this Stokes problem, but with nine zero boundary values, and before it's the zero boundary And before the zero boundary values are considered, and also periodic setting, mainly periodic setting. But Eli had considered this Stokes problem with non-zero boundary values. He allowed the velocity field to be a constant vector on each hole. And he employed the method of reflection, which is also mentioned by David Jihava in the first day of the workshop. And How for and Velasquez, they How for the Velascase, they also use the method of reflection to show many things. Along with other results, they give a homogeneization result for Poisson of Stokes problem without the periodicity in Rd in the whole domain. And they consider only this critical case, the critical size of holes, where in the limit you get the Brinkman law. And for the other two, it seems their method is not very applicable. And GMT and Hoffer, they consider random. They considered like a random distributed holes, and as mentioned by David, there are this study for effective viscosity of suspension and by Yila Han Wu and also Jiaven and many others. So there are another direction for this study is to consider more complicated models. I mean, the first direction of extension is to consider more general distribution. More general distribution of holes. Another one, I mean, is I think is to consider more complicated models like incompressible Navier stokes or compressible Navier stokes. In Alex's thesis, he studied also this stationary Navier-Stokes equations. I mean, the same limited equations are pertinent for different size of holes. For different ratios, you have different limited models. Oh, sorry, the time passes so fast. The tempest so fast. So, I mean, then there are many other results. I will just skip it for compressible models. And here we are focusing on this compressible Navier-Stokes Fouvier system, the steady one, where you have the balance of mass and balance of linear momentum, balance of energy. And this density, U velocity field, is the total energy Q heat flux as a Cauchy stress sensor. So I will not repeat all the meaning. So, I will not repeat all the meaning. And here is the model, the setting, and this is the setting for the distribution of holes. We do not assume any periodicity, but we assume that the host of size epsilon power alpha and the motor distance is epsilon. And we impose some constraints on the viscosity coefficient, which behaves like mu. For mu theta, it behaves like one plus theta. Like one plus theta, and for this one, it has this form. I mean, this is rather, I mean, quite standard in the study of Navier-Sto-Fouchi system. And this is, uh, I mean, here we also assume that the heat conductivity is as one plus eta to the power m. And I will skip this. And you have the definition of weak solutions, which is quite standard. And in a renormalized things, I will skip it. And there exists weak solutions. The there exists weak solutions if gamma larger than five over three and m larger than one, and if the like boundary value of the temperature is a strict positive and like the boundary is boundary value is L1. Moreover, it satisfies its entropy inequality. And this is proved by Novotini and Poconi for the existence. We want to know the behavior as epsilon equals zero, and this is the result. We assume the total mass has The total mass has a strictly lower positive lower bound and upper band. And it's the same. But we have to assume like we consider the smaller small holes, alpha larger than three and gamma larger than two, m larger than two, m is from the heat conductivity coefficient. And we have to have this constraint. And then we have the uniform bound for rho in our gamma plot theta. And this theta in W And this theta W12 intersect L3M. And theta is defined in this way. It depends on gamma and m, the minimum of it. This is the integrability of rho we can have like we can improve. So the thing is to get the estimates, we take psi equals to one, the test function in the energy balance, and entropy inequality to have uniform estimates. Have uniform estimates. It's a typical thing to do. Well, the thing is, from here, you don't have the estimates for theta epsilon itself, the integrability, for example, itself. We have the like gradient theta epsilon is L2, L to norm is bounded, but what about sigma epsilon itself? Oh, we can use the Poincaré inequality because we have the boundary value of zeta is bounded in L1, controlled by this. We can use the Poincaré equality and to have this thing, and then you will arrive at it. Then you will arrive at it. So, on one hand, this coefficient depending on omega epsilon, depending on the Leapist character of omega epsilon, goes to infinity because the Leapist character of omega epsilon is unbounded at epsilon goes to zero. Another thing is you have this term, you don't have estimate for the density yet. And to get the estimate for the density, you use the so-called Pogovsky operator, but only for the first thing you have, we have to overcome this. Have we have to overcome this difficult to do so? We have to have a proper extension for the temperature. This is what we have. Only the thing important or special is the gradient norm. The gradient norm is controlled by the gradient norm. So usually you have gradient norm controlled by the whole W12 norm, but here you have only gradient norm by careful construction. Then you have this. And then you have this Bogowski operator in this profile. Bogovsky operator in this profile domain from the paper with Dini and Ferezo. And you have the estimate with this coefficient. Again, this is the 3 minus QR times upper minus 3. If this is not negative, we have uniform bound for this Pogovsky operator. What is this? This is nothing but the upper bound for the Q capacity of all the holes. If q equals to 2, for example, the 2 capital is nothing but alpha minus 3, it goes back to the magic number appeared before. And in the paper with variance, we already construct such a thing for q equal to 2 by using r's construction of restriction operator. And for q between this quantum, this thing, we can also use it, but we have to have another thing included. Okay, then you use this hex function to the equation. And to the equation to the momentum equation, you write it. This is rather standard for studying compressible Navier-Dose or Navier-Stree systems. And on the left-hand side, you have our gamma-platina norm. So you estimate the right-hand side term by term. I will just show you one, for example, this one. And for you, you already have in our six by solar embedding. You use holder inequality, you have a Q1, and you use this. And you use this Gaussian operator estimate that appears this A epsilon Q1. We want A epsilon Q1 to be bounded. And we want to gain maximum regular integrability for the density. So we impose Q1 such that Q1 theta equals to gamma plus theta, which appears on the left-hand side. And you have, you can, direct computation give you this, and this give you this Q. This gives you this quantity appearing in this thing, the power of epsilon, like this. So it is non-negative as long as this is larger than one. This is the first condition appearing in the serine. And for this one, you also have an epsilon Q2 from here by holder inequality. And you want to have a maximal integral for the density. So Q2 theta equals to gamma plus theta. Choose Q2 properly. Choose Q2 properly, and then you have this number appearing in this epsilon q2 in this. So this is non-negative, this is bounded, and this is non-negative such as epsilon as this. And this is also appearing in the theorem for the constraint on alpha, such that this two. Of course, it is also used to derive the limit model when passing to the limit. Now you have uniform estimates. You have the Uniform estimates. You have the uniform estimates and you have the extension, zero, zero extension, and this extension is again done by this extension lemma we had. So this is all I want to say. Sorry for the time.
