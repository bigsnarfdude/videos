Okay, good afternoon, everyone, online and in person. So, this is the last lecture of concluding our first week, and it's a great pleasure to conclude it with Professor Ram Murti, who's going to tell us about applications of Chibotar F density theorem. Thank you. Let me begin by thanking the organizers, Alia, Nathan, Habiba, and Nathan, Habiba, and Greg Martin for their kind invitation to come to this place and see the beautiful scenery and enjoy the company of all of these distinguished mathematicians. So this lecture is for two hours, but certainly the mental stamina for concentration for the full two hours might be a little wanting. Therefore, it's not your, it wouldn't be your fault, it might be mine. So after the full So, after the first hour, we'll have a five-10-minute break and then continue. So, with respect to applications of the Chabataro density theorem, which is the topic that I was assigned, I thought that I will devote the first half to the proof of the Art and primitive root conjecture Allahouli, which is a spectacular application of the Chevatara density theorem. And then the second half, I will devote to further applications connect. Applications connected with related themes. One of the themes that I would like to touch upon is the divisibility of Fourier coefficients of modular forms. So let me begin by talking about the Artin primitive root conjecture. I'm just hoping. I'm just hoping that this is big enough for people. Good, and hopefully, also valid for people online. The Artin criminal root conjecture, actually, was formulated by Emil Artin in 1927. And the interesting thing is that the is there audio problem? No, no, no, it's just I didn't realize that pin doesn't make it big, needs to spotlight. You're good to keep going. Okay, so the interesting thing is that the art and primitive root conjecture was formulated by Art. By Artin specifically in response to a taunt. The taunt was: What good are your non-abelian L functions? And he was trying to say, well, here's a very classical problem, but you can't solve it any other way. And to this day, actually, we don't know how to solve it without using Art Nell series. The problem is, given a natural number. A natural number A bigger than one, not a perfect square. There are infinitely many prime ministers, many primes p such that A is a X that A is a generator mod P. A is a primitive root that is a generator mod P i.e the subgroup generated the group generated by A mod P mod P equals the The group of residue classes mod P. So he formulated this conjecture in 1927 and indicated heuristically, of course, how Art and L-series could be used to prove that there are infinitely many such primes. Not only that, you get a certain density of positive density of primes. The heuristic proof lay dormant. Lay dormant, and there was no way to make it rigorous simply because I don't think anyone knew how to deal with the error terms. And there's quite a bit of very colorful history, actually, with the art and primitive root conjecture. Let me just kind of maybe devote two minutes to telling a remarkable story. So, Haase was apparently interested in the art. Apparently, interested in the art from the root conjecture, and he himself tried to prove it. And then, when one of his students, Bill Harts, came over and asked for a thesis problem, Haas assigned him the art and primitive root conjecture as a PhD thesis problem. This was in 1933. And apparently, around the same time, Paul Erdős had announced. Erdős had announced that he had solved the Barton primitive root conjecture, assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis. And poor Bill Hartz was completely stunned, depressed. And there's a correspondence that takes place between Arten, Haasa, and Hasa is trying to communicate to Artin that my student is now devastated. That my student is now devastated because Erdős had proved the Artin primer root conjecture. Is there something else to do? And then Artin suggests that the function field case is still open to that. And that's what Bill Hartz works on. Of course, in the function field case, as you probably know, the congruent zeta functions that show up, Haas had just finished proving the Riemann hypothesis for that famous Haas inequality. Is for the famous Haas inequality a sub p is less than two root p. And then these other higher zeta functions that emerged from that kind of calculation were still mysterious. People did not know how to prove the Riemann hypothesis for those curves. So Artin suggested to Bill Hartz, just assume it, assume the Riemann hypothesis, and then finish the Artin primitive root conjecture for the function field case. So that's Bill Hartz's thesis, PhD thesis. And then after the whole thing, And then, after the whole thing is over, Erdős announced: no, no, I made a mistake, I don't have a proof. Very dangerous thing for a graduate student to encounter. And of course, to this day, we don't know how Erdős could have done it. I was asked by Peter Roquette, did I have any ideas? I didn't really have any ideas on how he would have tried to do it. But the first Tried to do it, but the first definitive attack on the art and primitive root conjecture, which made sense, is due to Hooley. There were other people who also worked on it, by the way. I think Heilbrenn tried to work on it. So Hooley's 1967 paper is a precursor to the Ligarius Uttarska paper, effective Chibotarov density theorem. Effect of Chibatarov density theorem. So, the idea the effect of Chibataro density theorem is going to be an important theorem in mathematics emerged slowly through this particular firstly. Hooley definitely had the template. And so if you take the template of Hooley's paper, combine it with the book of Davenport, Multiplicative Number Theory, and just forge ahead with the properties of Art and L series. Properties of art and L series, you end up getting the Ligarians of this code paper. Now, the Hooley method is actually instructive and very simple. It forms a chapter in this beautiful book, which apparently won a prize. And so I'm going to outline that method here. So let's begin in a naive sort of way, as naively as Artin would have liked it, and in some sense, as naively as Artin actually thought about this thing. Artin actually thought about this thing. So you want A to be a primitive root. So A is a primitive root mod P. What does that mean? It means that the order of A mod P is P minus one. Is p minus 1. In other words, the order is not any smaller. So for all primes q dividing p minus 1, we have a to the power p minus 1 over q should not be congruent to 1 p. So, so far, so good. That's just elementary number theory. Elementary number theory. Here's a criterion for something to be a primitive root. Just a very naive formulation. Now, the next step is to understand, this is elementary number theory two, that this condition a to the p minus one over q is just Euler's criterion. So it happens if and only if x to the q congruent to a mod p has. Has no solution. So we know that Euler's criterion tells you a to the power p minus 1 over q is congruent to 1 if and only if a is a qth power. That's exercise for the learning activity for this particular lecture. So you have this criteria. Now, sorry, x has no solution. So when does x to the q? When does x to the q congruent a have a solution? Well, what does this thing mean? Keep in mind that we have p congruent to one mod q. So this is p is congruent to one mod q. Q. So, this is now where Artin's thought process enters the picture. So, we have the cyclotomic field. We have also this non-Galva extension, A to the 1 over Q. And then I drew the picture badly, but anyway, there's a compositum of the two, which is a Galva extension, which Which looks like this. So, this particular elementary number theory problem, x to the q congruent to a mod p, having a solution can be reinterpreted in terms of algebraic number fields. P congruent to one mod q is the same as p splitting completely in the q subatomic field. And x to the q congruent to a having a solution means the prime p. The prime P has a first-degree prime ideal factor upstairs by a famous elementary criterion of Dedekind. So, Dedekind tells you factorization of prime ideals in number fields is tantamount to solving polynomial congruences. Where's the polynomial coming from? The polynomial that defines the extension. Okay, so this is x to the q equals a x to the q. X to the cube minus A is the polynomial that defines this extension. Can you people see from with these? Oh, okay, okay. So so this means, therefore, that A is a primitive root mod P if and only if. So now we said it splits completely. We said it splits completely here, it has a first-degree prime ideal factor here. In the compositum, which is a Galois extension, it has to split completely because, as Alia told us this morning, all the Galois action tells you once one prime has degree one, all the other factors also have degree one. So, in other words, A is a proto-root mod P if and only if P does not split completely. Completely in these fields L sub Q composed by taking the qth root of unity and a to the one over q. So in other words, we want to make this happen for all the fields q. So this looks like a combinatorial problem now, an inclusion. Problem now, an inclusion-exclusion process. So we take all the primes and we remove primes which split completely in some extension. So clearly, therefore. Let n sub A n sub a of x be the number of primes primes p less than x such that a generates fp a is a primitive root this is equal to um the set of primes let's say um let me just put a Let me just put A minus union Q A sub Q where A is a set of primes and A sub Q is the set of primes P as an X. P splits completely in L sub Q. L sub q. So this would be the number of primes for which a is a primitive root is the cardinality. Take the primes and remove all the primes which split completely in one of these fields because you want this to happen for all q. P does not split completely in L Q for all Q, oops, for all Q. So for all primes Q, you have to check. All primes q, you have to check that it doesn't split completely in those things. So, this looks like a typical inclusion-exclusion problem. So, by the inclusion-exclusion method exclusion principle What we have is. What we have is, I'm just going to write it down: n sub A of x is equal to, well, you have to take, take, and put back, take and put back, and so on and so forth. So when you think about it for a second, it boils down to some sort of inclusion, exclusion. We can neatly calibrate that using the Mobius function pi x. X L L Q L K. What is L K? Where L K is the compositum, compositum of all the fields LQ, and pi X L K is the number of primes that split completely. Split completely in L L K in this compositum. So we look at these compositum of fields and we calculate, we do this inclusion exclusion. Now, this is really not an infinite sum because if P is splitting completely in In L K, P has to be congruent to one mod K and P is less than X, so K is less than X. So we can make this sum a little better, make it a finite sum. In a simple text. This, I think, Artin knew. This, I think, Arten probably was quite aware of this. And now, let's see what happens when we put the effect of Chibator density theorem into the picture. So, from Aaliyah's lecture in the morning, we know that the The number of primes whose Artin symbol is a specified conjugacy class is given by the Chabotara effect of Chabotara density theorem. The Artin symbol turns out to be the trivial element if and only if P splits completely in that exception. So recall. The Art and Symbol L K Q P equals one if and only if P splits completely in L K. So P Aha. So peace splitting completely in LK now has been translated into an Art and symbol thing. And therefore, by the Chapatara density theorem, by the effective, at that time there was no such effective Chapatara density theorem. This was asymptotic of Chapatarov, but there was no attention paid to error terms. By the effective Chevatarov density theorem. That's an ethereal. Pi XLK is equal to pi of X divided by the degree. The conjugacy class is one. The size of the conjugacy class is one. The field extension. What is the field extension? The field extension, we're talking about L K. Extension: We're talking about LK, which is the compositum of the cyclotomic 8, cyclotomic field, and A to the 1 over K. And I'm not going to get into the technicalities of this, but has degree, has degree K phi of K. Let's not worry. For the sake of precision, perhaps you can take A to be a square free number, and this is fine. So, if we do that, then here the order of the Galois group is K5K, and then the error term on the Riemann hypothesis would be, well, the size of the conjugacy class we agreed was one, then there's that x to the half coming from the Riemann hypothesis, and then there's a log something or other x term. X term. What is that something or other? That something or other has to do with ramification in a field. And you have to wonder what are the primes that are ramifying in this field. Well, they're the prime divisors of K along with the prime divisors of A. Okay, that small algebraic number theory calculation. So once you do that small algebraic number theory calculation, which was done in OLE, you end up getting here log KAX. So on the Riemann hypothesis, the main term is pi of x over the degree, and the error term is x to the half log kax. Now, you're almost there. So you go back here and say, hey, I can shove that in. So let's do that. So therefore, n sub A of x. Of x equals k less than or equal to x mu of k and then pi x l k happens to be pi of x k phi of k plus an error term of x to the half log k a x and you know You know, it looks like, may I have the envelope, please? You know, that moment. And the first term is the term you expect. The pi of x comes out neatly. Beautiful convergence series. But let's not worry about the error for a moment. You got it. I mean, this I think Art knew. I think Art knew this. And so you can see. Oh, this is a nice. So let me just deal with the convergent series. So what you do with these, it's clearly a convergent series. So what you do with these such series is you take k less than or equal to x mu of k phi of k. k5k and then you say well let me extend it to infinity mu k a five k minus the tail a bigger than x view of k a five k and so this is nice because you have a multiplicative you know called the artin constant attached to a Artin constant attached to a plus O of one over essentially one over x five k's like k one over k squared o one so it's pretty good so pi of x times this artin constant this is a multiplicative function a of a of a is just this is not quite correct i'll talk about it at the very end of this of this talk but this is good enough for now um so this is over all the Now, so this is over all the primes q, and you get something like q phi q q times q minus one. So it's a nice art and constant multiplicative function. You can write it as an infinite product. And everything is hunky-dory. And the only problem is now the error term. So the error term, each error here is x to the half. And I have a range of summation of going up to x. Of going up to x. So, unfortunately, when you see the Mobius function in an error term, you put an absolute value. Sometimes I have to tell this to various people, but you cannot simply take that into see the cancellation. No, you can't do that. So, anyway, you've got an error term of x to the three halves modulo logarithms. So, it didn't quite work. It didn't quite work. And I just don't get it. You know, in retrospect, people were aware of this. And yet, nobody sat down to write down an effective Chabotar density theorem to kind of handle these kind of error terms. Okay, so clearly you have to, you just, this method, although it works almost, but it doesn't quite work. So you can't, you can't. Work. So you can't go up to X. So here's where Hooley's civ ideas come in. So still, let me kind of modify this a little bit. So, for the purpose, what I'm going to describe is what's called a simple asymptotic synth. And what is that? And what is that? Well, I have to remove these sets AQ. And because I was removing all the possible sets, I was getting in trouble. So don't remove all of them. Only remove those which are less than or equal. So therefore, it's clear that NAX is less than or equal to cardinality of A minus A sub Q's, but Q. Q's, but q's are now. I'm going to choose a parameter z. So I only remove, I'm supposed to remove all the a sub q's, but I will only remove a sub q up to z with q up to z. And therefore, I'll get an upper bound. Okay. And then, so let's call this. So this, this actually we can figure out. And if I do this now, we see. And if I do this now, we see that this is less than or equal to the same idea with the Mobius function, k less than or equal to x, except all the prime divisors are less than or equal to z. That means k is z smooth or whatever you want to call it. K is z smooth. So q dividing k. Q dividing K implies Q less than or equal to Z. This is what they call smooth numbers. Everybody happy? Understanding this brilliant idea, actually. So now we can play our game again. I admit it's an upper bound, but let's continue. We play the same game this time here. A less than or equal to X, except Q dividing K implies Q is less than or equal to Z, and this is an upper bound. Right? Then you have Have main term 5x times some series which seems to converge. Let me just put a dash to mean it's z smooth. Mu of k k phi of k. And now the question is the error term. Well, each error is x to the half log log x. Let's keep in mind that k is less than or equal to x, so log x. Log x. A is fixed, so let's not worry about it. And the question is: how many numbers are there floating around? So we're using all the primes up to z and forming all the square free numbers from those primes. Number of primes up to z is pi of z. And the number of numbers that you can form, square free numbers that you can form using pi of z primes is two to the pi of z. So you're going to get an. So, you're going to get an error term of something like that. Now, pi of z, we'll estimate it as z for the moment. Pi of z is, of course, less than z over log z, but we'll just put z. We'll just put Z certainly fine. And now you can see that Z better be constrained considerably, like maybe constant log X, where the constant is strictly less than a half. This forces us to choose. We choose Z to be. Let's say one quarter. Actually, you'll see in a second that, yeah, it's this forces us to choose z to be constant log x, where this constant is really small. Everybody okay with this so far? I'll have to change this in a little while anyway. Let's keep it like this. Okay, so we got an upper bound of the right type, and this series now. Right type, and this series now is just the K, the prime factors of K are smooth, Z smooth. Okay, and there's that smooth, and you can still, I'm not going to do this, but you can still make an analysis of this convergent series, and it still turns out to be an infinite prop. And the error term is not as good as before, but manageable. Good as before, but manageable. You need to bring in some smooth operators. Okay, so that's one idea here. At least we're getting the right, so this does turn out to be the right term. So unconditionally, oh sorry, conditionally with the Riemann hypothesis, we're able to get this far. And I don't know if you've introduced this notation or not, but it's called less than or equal to asymptotically. Just put a squiggle underneath. Okay, so this is the upper bound for the number of primes less than x, for which does not split completely in all these LQs up to constant log x. Up to constant log x. So, in order to get a lower bound, I need to remove any of the bad guys. So, clearly, so from here, clearly, n sub A of x is bigger than or equal to, this a of a, okay, I should be precise here, is bigger than or. But precise here is bigger than or equal to with a with a squiggle minus m z x where m z x is equal to the number of primes less than x, p splits completely. P splits completely in LQ for some Q for some Q between Z and X. Oops, close back. Big tech will refuse to take it. You don't close that. Refuse to take it, you don't close that stupid bracket. Okay, so that's MZX. Any questions so far? Very simple idea, actually, right? Very simple idea. So now we would like to handle this term. And this is where the elegance of Foley's work comes into the picture. So we all know it's this x to the half here that will constrain this mzx. So mzx, we want to estimate this and make sure that mzx is essentially little of x, little of pi of x. Little of pi of x. So m z x is certainly less than or equal to m z y plus m y w plus m w x, where the notation m M alpha beta is the number of primes k splits completely in LQ with the Q between alpha and beta. I mean, this is analytic number theory. I mean, this is analytic number theory. This is what analytic number theorists do. The first step is always intuition. The first step is a heuristic intuition, where you chart out exactly what is to be expected. And then once you have an understanding of that and then realize, darn it, I missed it, then you keep subdividing. Then you keep subdividing and choosing intervals so that you can apply what you know. And then, on the stuff that you don't know, you will have to use some new method. Okay. This is completely in the orbit of the Erdesian psyche. You know, he would know how to do all this stuff. So we now see that, okay, as long. That, okay, as long as I choose y to be slightly less than x to the half, I can use this error term. I can use the Riemann hypothesis error term. Everybody follow that? So clearly, this tells us clearly. Keep in mind, my choice of z here was some constant log x c big less than a half. So clearly, m of z x to the half over powers of log. I think I have. I think I have seen, I see you've already used this notation. Script L is log x always. One of the artistic innovations of analytic number theory. Script, you know, if the ATAL Cohenology people introduced script little L, we introduced script capital L. Okay. Now this sky is bounded by by this By this by using this well q, q is lying between everybody everybody everybody follow that and so each each of these terms so we have it's less than or equal to It's less than or equal to summation z less than q less than x to the half over L to the a times pi of x over q q minus 1 plus o of x to the half log log x. I'm going to drop the a for now. Okay, so because I'm summing over up to the range x to the half over arbitrary. To the range x to the half over arbitrary powers of log. Let's say capital A is 100 or something. That was also introduced in a previous lecture, right? The number 100. So we get that this is manageable. So let's say A to be 100. Let's say A is 101. Then the error term turns out to be O of X over log X to the 100. And then the first term is pi of X. is pi of x over qq minus one q bigger than z so that's a convergent series and the tail of a convergent series goes to zero so pi of x over q times q minus one q times q minus one is like q squared so z is constant log x since the log x x is going to infinity that Infinity, that tail goes to zero. So this is perfectly under control. So this is certainly bounded by, so less than, less than pi of x over log x. Straightforward. So with the choice y equal to x to the half over L to the a we have handled this term so now we need to handle these terms I didn't tell you what the w was I could have just said my x but now I want to decompose myx into my w plus w You know, you know, blackboard technique is a fading art. You know what Blackboard technique is? To put the formulas exactly where you need them when you need to come back to it. And with these slideshows, we're going to lose that. It's an art, an art form. There's this famous dialogues of Plato, you know, and Plato told Socrates: I have exciting news for you. Humanity has made a technological breakthrough. We have discovered writing. And Socrates said, There goes the power of memory. Okay. Now we've handled this. Let's handle this. So we're going to pick, we will choose. So y is equal to x to the half over a huge power of log. We're going to choose w equal to x to the half some big power. And let's handle, let's take care of m of w x. So what is that? So, what is Mwx? It's the number of primes that set P splits completely LQ with W less than Q less than X. Now, what is splitting? It splits completely. Splitting it splits completely, so that means since if p splits completely in LQ, what does that mean? It means p is congruent to one mod q and a to the power p minus one over q actually is one mod p. Okay, so p is less than x. And q is bigger than w. We'll worry about this choice afterwards, but p is bigger than w. Therefore, p minus 1 over q is less than x over w. Let's call this u for a moment. Therefore, if p splits completely. Therefore, if P splits completely in LQ with W less than Q less than X, then P divides the product of 2 to the J minus 1, sorry, A to the J minus 1 with J less than U. This is holy strict. It's actually the simple asymptotic version of the Chen switching, where you kind of take the problem with tail, push it back to the first control. So this is a switching issue. So the thing that was large has now been shoved to a smaller range. And now the question is, I give you a number n. And now, the question is: I give you a number n, how many possible prime divisors can it have? Well, at most, log n. Although you can do better than that, but anyway, log n is good enough. At most, logarithm of that. So the number of primes that we're trying to count in here can at most be the number of prime divisors of this. And the number of prime divisors of this is at most logarithm. And therefore, the number of primes. Number of primes is therefore less than or equal to the number of primes divisors of that number, product j less than u, a to the j minus one. And that number has at most log of that. Therefore, it has j less than u, j log a prime divisors, and that's less than less than u. And that's less than less than u squared. So w is x to the half times power of log. What is u? u is x to the half divided by a power of block. Therefore, if I square that, I'm in business. Choose a hundred and kill the problem. Very good. This has been taken care of. This has been taken care of. I just need to do this intermediate range. Intermediate range. So far, so good. Good. Now, how to deal with how to How to estimate M x to the half over log to the a and x to the half times log a. So very, it's a very narrow range, very constrained near extra math. Well, remember. Well, remember that we're trying to count how many primes are there that split completely in those in LQ, where Q is lying between these two things. And if it splits completely, if the prime splits completely in LQ, then P has to be congruent to one mod Q. So in particular, this is bounded by, we have, this is bounded by oops, this is. Oops, this is off that is certainly bounded by pi x q one q line in this range. Where pi x q one is the number of primes. Less than X congruent one mark. Now we need a result from CIF theory called the Bruntich-Mars theorem. So the Bruntich-Mars theorem Tells us that pi xq one is less than two x over five q log x over q for q less than x. So when q is between x to the half over powers of log, you can see Over powers of log, you can see that log x over q is like log of square root of x. So the log of square root of x is like log x. We can just ignore constants here. And therefore, this is less than less than x over log x. And pi of q is like q minus one, but let's just call it q for the moment. And q is in this range q prime, of course. So we have this. And now we need to do some elementary number theory. So, recall some basic facts from elementary number theory, namely what's called Merten's theorem, something like that. Merton's theorem. Summation Q up to W of one over Q is like log log W plus some constant plus O of one over log W. Okay, so this is the exercise. And so I'm going to use this result in this range. And you may say, how am I going to? And you may say, How am I going to gain something in this tiny range? This is one of the neat things in analytic number theorist. If you're not an analytic number theorist, you wouldn't spend your time looking at this very narrow range, but you win. Okay? So, what we have here, we have our firm. term is bounded by well bounded by and constants x over log x times what log log x to the half times log divided by log log x to the half. Except the half over log and the constants cancel, and then this is negligible. This is all one over log x. Yes, the stage, right? Yes, you're right. So I would need to put in order to correct this. Put this log that okay gets a difference of logs get this and you can now see that what is this? This is log of one half log x plus Plus a log log x divided by one half log x minus a log log x so which can be rewritten as this is where the prowess of analytic number comes into picture. So one, so I basically So one, so I've basically written the numerator as one half log x minus a log log x plus two, so it's plus two a log log x divided by one half sorry, that's one half um Everybody following? The denominator is essentially log x, half log x. It's behaving like one half log x. And the numerator is behaving like log log x. So we essentially have something like log log x with log x. Log of some one plus epsilon, it behaves like epsilon. So this behaves like. So this behaves like log log x over log x. And you win. You win because that intermediate range is now x over log x times something that's going to zero. This is how you do this. This is how fully did it, assuming the Assuming the remote process. There are other comments that could be made. I'll make them now. Maybe I can sneak in these editorial remarks on the second half of the talk. But for now, I think this is good enough. All right, so let's start. I hope everyone's back. So this is the second half of applications of Chevotra density theorems. Interestingly enough, Here? Yeah. Okay. So the art and primitive root conjecture, I think, inspired quite a bit of activity afterwards. I think that the effect of chibotorical density theory. The effect of Chabatarov density theorem started drawing the attention of various algebraists, most notably Sayre, Lange, and his colleague Trotter, Hale Trotter, and various other people started looking at potential applications of Chabotarov to other questions. And one of the natural things that comes up is. Is an elliptic analog of the Art and Prometheus root conjecture. So, this is what I want to discuss. Want to discuss. This begins with the work of Lang and Trotter. And a second application that I want to look at is to the study of Fourier coefficients. Of modular forms. This is a big topic. I'll probably just scratch the surface. So I'm going to devote maybe 30 minutes to the first one and 30 minutes to the second one. So the elliptic analog of Art and Prime Root conjecture is actually pretty easy to formulate if you just know something about elliptic curves. Curves and some people ask: How is it that I was able to prove something non-trivial on the classical art and probable root conjecture without using Chapatar, of course, but Civ theory? And it's interesting that the motivation comes from elliptic curves. And I'll tell you how that works in a second. So, what Lang and Trotter did is they considered an elliptic curve. Elliptic curve, let's say defined over the rational numbers. So an elliptic curve can be just taken to be something x cubed plus ax plus b, something like this, with a and b, let's say integers for now. Let's not bother too much about this thing. And the famous theorem of Mordell, generalized by Wave for arbitrary number fields and abelian varieties, says that the group of rational points. The group of rational points on the elliptic curve is a finitely generated abelian group of the Mordel Vay theorem. And in other words, that means there exist generators such that all rational points This is an amazing theorem, isn't it? All rational points of E of Q are given, all elements of this are given by M1 P1 MR PR, where the MIs are integers. So, in other words, if you have a classical picture of an elliptic curve, you have a Yeah, but let's say it's got three real roots, something like this. The addition law is that P plus Q plus R is zero. That's the addition law. It turns out to be beautiful law associative if this operation is non-trivial, but can be done. And what this theorem says is that if you want to look at all the points with rational coordinates on this curve, Coordinates on this curve, a knowledge of a finite number of them gives you the knowledge of all of them. Amazing, amazing theorem. Just by this addition, it's amazing. And so, I suppose the analogy that surprising, I think I'm just guessing what they were doing. Somehow, maybe looking at this, so the question of Lang and Trotter is: suppose we fix a rational point A, using A deliberately, fix a rational point A, how often Does A generate the group of points modulo P? So this is the Langtrotter question first before they made the conjecture. I take a global rational point, I reduce it modulo P. Of course, there's this issue about denominators. Let's ignore that. You can, for practically all the primes, you can reduce. For practically all the primes, you can reduce it. And then you have the group of points mod P. So, this additional law, which we derive, makes sense over any field. And the question is, how often does A generate, i.e., the group generated by A is E of F P? And, you know, Lang and Trotter carried out numerical Carried out numerical experiments to check that if I took a point, if A, of course, if you took a torsion point, this is not going to be any good. It has to be infinite order. A has to be of infinite order. Take a point of infinite order. Then we don't see any obvious reason why this should not be the case, that infinitely many primes should have this property. And so this. Property. And so this they formed, they thought of this as the elliptic analog of the Artin relative root conjecture. And by the way, this is a general theme in mathematics. We have classical analytic number theory, which is probably. Classical analytic number theory, which is roughly looking at the algebraic q-cross, and somehow you can move into the world of elliptic curves, you can also move into the world of elliptic abelian varieties and so on and so forth, and or algebraic groups in general. There are all generalizations of the Artin conjecture to those settings as well. Now, this is the Lang-Trotter conjecture that there are, unless otherwise, unless there's some obvious reasons for this not to happen, they just conjecture. For this not to happen, they just conjectured there are numerical evidence seems to suggest that there are infinitely many primes for which this happens. In fact, a positive density of primes. And like a comical act, Sayre said now, just wait a minute here. How do we even know that EFFP is a cyclic group infinitely often? There's no reason for that to happen. So, Sair's question. Do we even have to do it? Do we even have this? This is this question. And Fortunately, I was a first-year graduate student back in 1976. Back in 1976, when Sayer asked this question, and I was lucky enough to be in the course where he was trying to answer it. And the course was about the Chabotar density theorem. And a good chunk of the course was dedicated to proving that unless there's some obvious obstruction, this happens. Instruction. This happens modulo the Riemann hypothesis. And he more or less used Ulli's template in the course. And that was where I picked up my PhD thesis topic. I noticed that for complex multiplication curves, you could use the large sieve and number fields and kill the, get rid of the Riemann hypothesis. So that was my small contribution to this topic. Small contribution to this topic. So let me try to explain how one would handle this. And once handling this, you go back to the Lang Trotter question. So in the Lang Trotter question, they were asking not only take a number A, rational point, and ask how often it generates, you can take R points because the group has rank R. You can take R independent points and ask. You can take our independent points and ask. And then that's what led to the thing: wait a minute now, nobody formulated the higher-rank art and primitive root kind of thing. And once you do that, you start seeing more insight. So this is a case in point where the generalization of a problem has not been done purely for generalization's sake, but rather leads to insights in solving the original problem in a good sort of way. So, how do we approach this question? How do we approach this question? How to approach this problem about simplicity of EFFP. Okay, so we need to have some basic. So, we need to have some basic knowledgeable elliptic curves. E of FP is an abelian group. And as an abelian fundamental theorem of Boolean group says, it's the direct sum of cyclic groups. Let me just put secret groups. Now, direct sum of cyclic groups, if the cyclic groups are of co-prime order, if A is a cyclic group and B is a cyclic group and they're of co-prime order, the direct sum is a cyclic group. Fair enough, good. The only problem arises when A and B. When A and B have some common prime component. So it's not difficult to see that E of F P is cyclic if and only if there is no cue. Let me put it this way. Yeah, if it is not, let's say, is not cyclic. Not cyclic if and only if for some Q for some prime Q E of F P contains some sort of Q Q group in the type of abelian series. The type, there's a cyclic group of order Q, cyclic group of order Q as directs. Cyclic group order Q as direct sum inside that group. Okay. A Q group. Now, if the interesting thing, and this is, I think, an important motivation for the study of elliptic curves, and I'm sure that. And I'm sure that, what is it? Okay. I think that one of the key ideas that perhaps motivated the study of elliptic curves, especially in the context of Sayre, is that Sayre seems to have noticed. Noticed a kind of an analogy between two kinds of extensions. So here we are familiar with the cyclotomic fields. Q cyclotomic field. And we know that the Galois group here is a set of co-prime residue classes mod Q, which I will say is. Say is to be suggestive is GL1FQ. Okay. And if you look at early papers of Sayre, he's trying to show that the Galois group of this extension when E has no Cm and Q is sufficiently large. And Q is sufficiently large that the Galois group is GL2 of Q. So it's kind of like a two-dimensional world, which probably imitates the cyclotomic world. And if you look at the early papers of Sayre, he's trying to develop cyclotomic theory for these elliptic curves. And motivated by that, he, you know, one of the things that is responsible for the theory. Responsible for this field having this Galois group and study of this thing is the irreducibility of the cyclotromic polynomial. And so similar ideas emerge here as well. These are the Q division points I should have told. So this is the group of Q division points. In other words, points on the curve, points in here, Q bar, which are killed by Q. Okay, so that. Q. Okay, so that the Q torsion points of E of Q bar are isomorphic to Z mod Q cross Z mod Q. It's a QQ group. Now, when we say that E of F P contains a QQ group, a little bit of Galois theory, Alessair, shows that P splits completely. That means those Q division points. That means those Q division points, which are isomorphic to Q direct sum of Q plus Q, are left intact by the Galois automorphism. And therefore, the Galois is acting trivially on the Q division point. So the Galois group G of Q bar over Q is acting trivially on this. And it's tantamount to saying that this particular condition is tantamount to saying. Is tantamount to saying that the art and symbol, so let's call this now KQ KQ over Q, the art and symbol is one. So if it contains a subgroup of type QQ, then the art and symbol turns out to be. Then the Art and symbol turns out to be one in this Galois extension. Therefore, we're back to the splitting completely situation again. So if you want E of FP to be cyclic, it shouldn't split completely in any of these extensions. We're back to the same business. So you now, yes. Yeah. So Yeah, so this, if you look at EFFP bar, the Q division points in this field, in this group, are of type QQ. So, okay. To say that EFFP contains QQ means that means the Galva automorphism corresponding to this particular artin symbol. To this particular art and symbol is acting trivially, the Galois is acting trivially, and the Q division points remain intact. Yeah. Just as in the case of the civil atomic polynomial, when it's splitting completely, the Galois automorphism is acting trivially. And that's what boils down to peak common to one mod Q. Okay, so hope that's clear, Don? Yeah, yeah, okay, good. So you have this. So, you have this condition now, which is a Chabotarov condition. And so, the method used before can be transported mutatis mutandis, which means more or less the same. More or less the same can be used here. However, that switching problem never arises. The switching problem never arises because, as Ser observed, I think he was lucky, he was counting his blessings that it didn't arise. Things that it didn't arise. It doesn't arise because if you're counting primes less than x, we're counting primes. We want to count primes p less than x, like that e of f p is cyclic. A cyclic. By the way, you know, the question of division points. So there are these two division points are actually given by the roots of the cubic. So if the roots of the cubic are irrational, there will be primes for which the two division points are not going to be an obstruction. So let's not worry about these minor obstructions. So we want to count primes p less than x e of f p cyclic, and this boils down to. And this boils down to the same as saying we want to count the number of primes p less than x, so that p does not split completely in KQ for all Q. And when we try to write this down, we will. Do as before. This number is going to be pi x kq k. I'm sorry, k sub k times, did I use k sub? Yeah, okay. Sorry, sorry, the notation of previous is something like this, I think. And now I didn't, I deliberately didn't put down where this k is going because now notice that p is less than x. That p is less than x in this count. P is less than x. What's the cardinality of the e of f p? It's p plus 1 minus a sub p. By Haas's inequality, a sub p is bounded by 2 root p. So ignore it. So p is still less than x. So the whole thing is less than x. Therefore, if a q q group divides it, then the order of this group is q squared, at least has to be less than x. And therefore, k squared has to be less than x. And therefore, k is less than root x. Is less than root x. So when you're doing your sieving, you need only consider primes less than or equal to root x. And of course, as we know, this naive thing won't work again because you use the effect of Chabotar density theorem and there will be issues. And so you modify the method. And that's how Ser spent, you know. Spent two weeks in that course showing us how to modify the method of Hooley using the theory of elliptic curves to handle all the error terms. So let me just say, no need for that ingenious flipping trick in this case. And another important point is, and this is the beautiful aspect of this theory, these are actually not disjoint pairs. These are actually not disjoint pictures. The cyclotonic field is sitting inside the Q division points. Beautiful idea. So in the case of non-CM curves, you use this theory. In the case of CM curves, you can use a classical class field theory and do everything uncontrolled. And do everything unconditionally. That was my thesis. Okay, so this sieving algebraic number theory has a nice application. And sure enough, you can answer this question. Yes, for a positive density of primes, there are influence, you know, you have E of F P cyclic. So now you can ask the Langtrotter question. Now that you know it's cyclic, if I took a specific If I took a specific global generator, will the reduction still generate the group? So that, um, yeah, so by the way, the cyclicity question has been answered unconditionally by myself and Rajiv Gupta in a series of papers. So in the CM case, of course, I told you that that was my thesis. In the non-CM case, Rajiv and I had proved that you can do it unconditionally, but we don't get positive density. Positive density. Interesting problem, open problem for anyone who's thinking about these questions. So now that I've reached the halfway point, let me now shift gears and talk about the second application, application to Fourier coefficients of modular forms. Okay, instead of talking in generalities, let me focus my attention on a specific example, which is illustrative of the general idea. So, let me obviously, I can't assume everybody knows about modular forms, but let's just to Modular forms, but let's just to take this case in point, let's uh just look at Romanogen's cuss form. The Romanogen's cuss form is given by this infinite product, product n going from 1 to infinity, 1 minus q to the n to the power 24. 24 and when I expand it as a power series, I get a coefficient of q dm, and this coefficient here is called the Ramonian bell function. And in a fundamental paper in 1916, Romanogen made three conjectures about this function. Three conjectures about this function. First conjecture was that it's a multiplicative function, not obvious at all from that silly definition. Romolyn's conjectures. One, tau of n is multiplicative, so tau of m n is equal to tau m times tau n whenever m and n are relatively prime. 2 tau of p to the r as a function of r satisfies a second-order recurrence relation. I'm not going to write it down. Satisfies a second-order recurrence, and the third conjecture is. And the third conjecture is the famous Ramonogen conjecture, Ramon inequality, 2p to the 11 halves. So these are the conjectures that Ramonogen made. And I think all of you know that the first two conjectures were proved by Mordel in 1917, one year after Ramonogen formulated the conjecture. And somehow the third conjecture was mysterious. It's still mysterious even today, although we have solved it using algebraic geometry. There is yet There is yet no insight from an analytic perspective of why that's. You need geometry. We need heavy-duty geometry for this. And in the course of this particular result, Dylan, who proved the result, discovered a new connection called the eladic representation. Called the eladic representation, which allows us to study divisibility properties of the tau function using algebraic number theory. So, there's a famous conjecture of Lamer. So, this, I mean, this is. So, this, I mean, this is, you don't need to, you don't need to discuss the theory of modular forms to talk about the tau function. Although, this is a modular form, which I'll not define. You can just define it purely as a power series and leave it at that. There's a famous conjecture of Lehmer the tau of p is never zero. So here's a conjecture. Again, there's a plethora of conjectures in the literature, but things become exciting when you can bring some sort of theory to bear upon that conjecture in some concrete way. So until Dylan's work and until Sayre had Had told us how to use Dylan's work in this context. We really didn't know whether, you know, this can, are there infinitely many primes for which tau of p is not zero? We do now know that it's not zero. There are infinitely many primes. We didn't know that until. So, Sayer showed GRA. GRH implies, I forgot the bound, but the number of primes p less than x with the tau of p is zero is big O of x to the theta. I can't remember theta, I think theta is four or five or something like that. Let's not worry, theta, but theta is certainly less than one. So, Riemann hypothesis implies this. And then he used the unconditional Chabotara density theorem, which Aliyah mentioned this morning. The unconditional Chabatara to show the number is O of X over log X to the To the one plus some delta delta is positive and small. I'm not going to bother about what these numbers are, but so that's little of pi of x. So unconditionally, we do know that there are infinitely many primes p is that the tau of p is not zero. And Lehmer made the conjecture, are there even infinitely many? We don't know. We didn't know that. But thanks to the unconditional version of Chobotaro, we do know this. And how do we And how does this work? Well, remarkably, this is how it works. Dylan showed, specializing to the case of the tau function, but Dylan showed there exists an eladic representation, Rho L from Galva Q bar over Q into G. Into GL2 of the eladic integers such that we didn't talk about the art and symbol for infinite extensions, but I think that we have an art and symbol for q r over q, okay? And we'll just use that notation. So row L, so the art and symbol p It's a two by two matrix in this over the eladic integers, two by two matrix. I take the trace, and the trace turns out to be tau of p. Isn't that amazing? There exists an eladic representation such that the trace of Roel of the Frobenius automorphism is Automorphism is tau of p. And this is nothing special to tau. You can do this for any Hecke eigenform, if that means anything to you. But let's just concentrate our attention on this. What does this mean? Well, if you know something about pro-finite Galois theory, everything really factors. That's why I said the art and symbol. The art and symbol is really defined, has been defined. It's defined for finite extensions, and this is just a pro-finite business. So we can just say that if I mod out, so therefore there exists a Galois extension, KL, Q, cites that KL of Q is Galois. And the let's use Zigma because I don't want to use tau in maybe well, I'm using Zigma P. Maybe it's well, I'm using σp there, so let's use some other letter eta. The bell crossed the 11th hour. So, this do don't worry about that last bit piece, okay? It has to do with the determinant of the. To do with the determinant of the characteristic polynomial. The characteristic polynomial, tau of p is coming from the characteristic polynomial of, so I should say here, determinant of rho L of sigma p actually turns out to be p to the 11th. So there's a there's an analytic representation. The determinant is an 11th power, and the trace turns out to be tau of p. And therefore, Because Z L is an inverse limit, it's an inverse limit of Z mod L to the N Z. You can now, I'm just trying to see modulo L. So maybe I shouldn't write F L here. I should just write Z mod L. It's the same thing, but let's just do that. So the trace is that. The traces that all these determinants have to be 11th powers. So, this is the largest it can possibly be just simply by looking at the structure of this result. And Ribbett showed that for L sufficiently large, this is true. One can find out how large it has to be. But so you have an explicit description of the Galois group cut out by this thing. And therefore, if I'm trying to, it's like a sieve again, if I'm trying to count the number of primes p less than x, such that tau of p is zero, well, that's bounded by the number of primes p less than x. The number of primes p less than x, such that tau of p is zero modulo l for any prime l. Right? I mean, no one can argue with that. And then I'm going to bound this using this Galois representation and the Chabatara density theorem, and then choose L option. Theorem, and then choose L optimally to minimize the error. So tau of p is zero modulo L. Well, if tau of p is zero modulo L, the trace of rho L of sigma p is zero modulo L. Tau of P, oops. tau of p oops tau of p zero modulo l is equivalent to the trace of rho l of sigma p zero modulo l so now i need to count how many matrices are there this is just a finite group how many two by two matrices are there modulo l whose determinant is an 11th power how many How many are there? Well, you can see the GL2ZL has roughly L to the four elements, right? Four, two by two matrix, four entries. You have to be a bit careful, but let's not worry about that. Roughly L to the four elements. And when you work this out, the number of elements of trace zero in this galaxy. In this Galois group, let's call this GL is of the order L cubed. It's a group theory calculation. So it's a group theory calculation. You just rank it out. You know, the Jordan form, you find out what are the possible Jordan forms of a finite field of L. Jordan forms of a finite field of finite elements of number of trace and count the number of elements in the conjugacy class. It's a nice exercise. So you have roughly L cubed elements of trace zero, roughly L to the four elements in the group. So the probability of hitting that is one over L. So the number of elements of trace zero forms not a conjugacy class, but a union of conjugacy classes. So now we want to use Chabotara density theorem for each of those conjugacy classes. Our density theorem for each of those conjugacy classes whose trace is zero, and you take the union, and now you can see why that conjugacy class to the half versus the conjugacy class comes is important. So if you apply Chabatarov effect of Chabotarov, GRH gives you Gives you this number is less than pi of x over L plus an error term of, well, there was a size of the conjugacy class, there was an x to the half, and if you work out all this ramification stuff that goes into this picture, it's roughly log lx. This is true for any L. The number of primes for which the The number of primes for which tau of p is zero is bounded by the number of primes p such that tau of p is congruent to zero modulo l for any prime l. It's a kind of a very elementary sieve. And now I have this bound and I can now choose my l optimally. So what is it? I have x over l and I want to make it like l cubed x to the half. So that means l to the four is like x to the half. L should be like x to the one eighth. L should be like x to the one eighth, and therefore you end up getting seven eighths. x, you know, you end up getting seven eighths. So the theta equal to seven over eight, this is true on the Riemann hypothesis. And if you don't want to use, assume the Riemann hypothesis, you have to now do a bit more work and do careful, but it'll boil down to the same thing and you'll have to. Boil down to the same thing. And you'd have to choose your L very small. You can't choose L to be a power of X. It turns out L has to be a power of log X, which is very small. Then that's how he gets that tiny, tiny improvement. Now, I said four fifths. I think that's correct. There's more structure theory that can be invoked, a few more algebraic tricks that can be weaved into the argument, which Ser does, and he ends up getting slow. Does, and he ends up getting a slightly better result. Now, so this is one way of attacking the Lamer conjecture. Of course, you can't prove it because this is just a density argument. So there's something obviously deeper going on. What does this mean? There are connections to Poincare series and things vanishing of Poincaré series, which one can reformulate this whole problem in terms of, but I don't see any. But I don't see any use of the Chabatara density there in that, those kinds of approaches. One of the things that attracted attention of Kumar and myself with respect to the tau function and modular forms in general is to see the arithmetic nature of these Fourier coefficients. So, for example, one of the questions that one can ask is: so, let's assume. Is so let's assume that tau of p is never zero and tau of n consequently is never zero. By the way, it's a small exercise to show tau of p not vanishing for all primes p implies tau of n never vanishes. Okay, it's not difficult. So then if we, this is an integer, tau of n is an integer, and we can ask how does tau omega of tau of n behave, omega of tau n being the number of prime divisors. Or tau of p. Let's simplify light for a moment, tau of p. One can analyze tau n2, but we won't go there. It's a little harder. Let's look at this. Okay, so now. Look at this. Okay, so now what is the definition of tau omega of tau of p well? It's a set of all primes that divide tau of p. One. And if I'm trying to figure out, let's say, the average order, then that would be l less than x, well, p less than x. P less than x. Summation L divides tau of p 1 l less than, now tau of p is less than 2 times p to the 11 halves. So L has to be less than, looks like 2x to the 11 halves. And then you have primes less than x, 1, L divides tau of p. And now And now we can try to use this connection to Chebotarov and do this analysis a little more carefully. Here, we're all interested in upper bound estimates, but you really have to calculate that density carefully and then the error term. And you can try to plug that in, but as you can see, it's the same old problem that if you have x to the half and you're summing the error term. The half, and you're summing the error terms over a big range, you're not going to get that error term, is going to explode. Therefore, you just ask yourself: wait a minute now, how many prime divisors can tau of p have bigger than x to the one over a million? Well, only finitely many, because tau of p is bounded by p to the 11 halves. Therefore, you can rewrite this. plus all one. You can do this calculation, so that means you can actually ignore. So here I would break up. So here I would break up the thing into x to the eta and l bigger than x to the eta. And the number bigger than x to the eta is bounded, and therefore I would get an error term of pi of x. And if you think of tau of p as a random number, it should have log log tau of p prime divisors according to the Hardiver-Monogan philosophy. And therefore, you would expect x pi of x log log x. So this can now be made. So, this can now be made into a viable proof by choosing eta sufficiently small and controlling the error term in the prime number theorem. Unfortunately, we need the Riemann hypothesis. So using the Riemann hypothesis, or actually a quasi-Riemann hypothesis, you can show that this is pi of x log log x plus O of pi of x. And then not only can you do this, but you can do all the higher modes. Can you do this, but you can do all the higher moments? And once you have all the higher moments, you can ask whether the central limit theorem, Erdős Katz type style theorems work, and they do. And one can prove these things. But unfortunately, in all of these cases, we need to assume a quasi-GRH. No. No, no, yeah, zero for you line. So line, so there are no zeros to the right of some theta with theta less than one. That's a quasi. Yeah. So we need that. That's what suggests to me that all of these things can be reformulated in the context of large sieve. So if one had So, if one had large sieve-type estimates for these kinds of quantities that emerge, you could get rid of the Riemann hypothesis. So, it seems to me that there's probably some scope for analytic number theory to try to enter this field of schalatic representations, algebraic number theory, Barton-L series, and see what can be done with respect to unconditional theorems. So, in these cases, you don't need the full strength of the Riemann puzzles, maybe even something. Full strength of the Riemann puzzles, maybe even something slightly weaker will work. But at least I hope I have given you some illustration of the interface between Chobatarov density theorem and classical questions of ambient. Okay, thank you. Anybody? Yeah, what's sort of or what's the RHD mean? Like, no, I think it's theta. Oh, any theta, any theta less than one, any theta less than one. That's the quasi. Any theta. In fact, something like the error terms that Aksha was illustrating in her talk about log one minus log log t over log t. I think if you had that uniformly for Art and L series, I think you. For Art and L series, I think you can do the unconditional version of this, but we don't have that, of course. Yeah, did you have a question, Asif? Yeah, yeah, sure. East Edward, so that kind of explicitly writes out the representations of that Galois station, and like. Extension. And like in terms of ideally the Dirschleich character, like the lower extensions. Yeah, that's a semi-direct product. And one can write down, and the Artin conjecture, that is the Artin holomorphic conjecture for those non-abelian extensions is true. And the Hecke L series also are analyzable, you know, you can amenable to analysis. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Well, no, actually, it's very interesting. The primes not congruent to one mod Q have a very clearly defined splitting process. And it can be reduced to primes and arithmetic recursions. It's the primes common one mod Q that kind of branch off into two split. They either split. Off into two split, they either split completely or they don't split completely, and it's this problem that cannot be handled so easily. Yeah, interesting. So, I think there's a room for a lot of research there. Yeah. It's kind of a beginner question, but you mentioned at some point that L of B maybe you can think of it as a random number. As a random number, so wouldn't the Liemer conjecture that L of P is never zero kind of, you know, why would there be such a bias? Yeah, well, random number, all the non-zero numbers can still be random. You're just pointing out every time you kind of get a lot of interest in the beginning of course. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, I think the non-vanishing of the tau function is probably more profound as a conjecture, but we really just don't simply don't understand. But we really just don't simply don't understand the meaning of it. It's random, we expect randomness, but in this context, yes, it's never going to hit zero. I mean, one could reformulate this in terms of Poincaré series, and people have been doing that. But the non-vanishing of Poincaré series can be formulated. But I think just as the case with the Riemann hypothesis, we don't know what zero means or that. means or vanishing here what would it mean we just don't if one could say that whenever it vanishes there's some for example there is a variety floating around here the background and tau of p does count the number of points on that variety it's not a very difficult variety to describe by the way unlike some books seem to say it's not difficult so there is a variety and what tau of p vanishing means that the number of points That the number of points is exactly a polynomial in P without any further error. Can that happen? So maybe it's intertwined with that variety. I'm thinking it's a geometric question. Yeah. I guess just to add it to the question as well, so if you normalize tau of d by like root d, it's between minus two and two. And then this is Saddle-K theorem where it's sort of just the slope approach. Theorem where it's sort of just the correct statistical scale to think at random is to divide it by root p. But then once you do that, you lose an understanding of what zero means. Yeah, zero and what like both root p look at the same. Yeah, that's right. Should I have a dispute with this idea about that? Yeah, which seems very circle. Yeah. Question? Any online questions? No, I think I don't see any. Let's thank Ram and all the speakers who gave really excellent talks this week. Thank you so much for giving the talk. So let's thank for coming. As I'm just guessing that I'm probably the most senior speaker here. Am I? I'm not sure. Anyway. And it gives me a privilege to thank the organizers on behalf of all the participants. So let's do that.
