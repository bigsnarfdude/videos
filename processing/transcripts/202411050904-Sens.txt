So, we're going to change scale and to move to tissue mechanics now. And I want to tell you about a story, which is a collaboration between theory and experiments. So, theory is trying to meet experiments there, where we are looking at a morphogenetic process that involves friction. Friction. And so the modeling is done by Mathieu de Denon, who was a PhD with me, who's now a postdoc in Geneva. And we were motivated and collaborated with the team of Daniel Lavignevich in Curie, who did the experiments. The team of Javier Skrepa in Barcelona also did some biophysical quantifications. And we have two publications, well, one publication. Two publications, well, one publication and one submission that reports this story. And the story is about how, so it is motivated by the mechanics of cancerous tumors in general. It's going to be much more simplified than what I'm showing here, but it's just to motivate. So the idea is how does the environment of a tumor can shape the tumor and can influence the way it develops? And the particular And the particular part of the stroma of the tumor that we're looking at here are these green cells, which are cancer-associated fibroblasts called CAFs, which are highly contractile fibroblasts. And so they tend to form a shell around the tumor. And there's different reports on how this shell influence the behavior of the tumor. Some teams say that the Some teams say that the shell is going to sort of confine the tumor and prevent it from growth, so it would be beneficial in that case. Other people say that actually the calves can grab on cancer cells and pull them out of the tumor and therefore create the potential for metastasis. So that would be detrimental. And so these are the general questions. What do the environment of the tumor, how does it influence? Influence the way the tumor is going to evolve. And so the team of Daniel La Vignevich did a lot of in vivo studies in mice and what they concluded was that this environment might be responsible or at least influential on the process which is called tumor budding. This is the process by which a small cluster of cells may be pinched off a may. Pinched off a main tumor and creates these little small spherical aggregates, which can then eventually lead to metastasis. And so, if you see in this 3D imaging in vivo, that the green part is a tumor and the pink part are the cancer, the calves. And you can see clearly that the calves are somehow deforming the tumor into two lobbed structures. To two-lobed structure, either by penetrating in it and sort of ripping it apart or by mechanically confining it. And so, this is the main motivation for the studies, but this is in a very complex environment. The geometry is very complicated. It's all in vivo. So, we wanted to try to deal with a much easier setup for the experiments, but especially for the modeling. And so, what Especially for the modeling. And so, what they did was to try to reconstitute the phenomenon in vitro, but that led to also a change of dimension for mostly 3D to mostly 2D dimension. So, what they did was that they plated their cancer cells on a circular pattern. They can change the size of the circular pattern, and then they add the calf around this. And what you can see then is that the calves are sort of moving and sliding on top of the calf. Top of the cancer cell monolayer, and they tend to basically climb on top and close on top of this cancer cell monolayer. And in the process, it might lead to the formation of these little buds here, which end up being squeezed out of the main tumor, forming a multi-layer structure and being stuck there. And so the calves actually get stuck and they cannot close on top of this. Here you see. Closed on top of this. Here you see a 3D reconstruction, which is cut in the top, but where you can see the formation of this multi-layer structure. There will be better examples later. And so basically, so here you see a side view. This is the cancer cell monolayer. These are the calves that are basically moving to climb on top of this thing. Here you see another view where you see a bud that has formed and clearly has been formed due to Clearly, it has been formed due to the effect of the calves on the monolayer. And here you're going to see a top view of the two main phenotypes that is observed. So the first one is, so here what you see, this is the circular tumor. The calves are all around here. You will see a lot of dynamics, and then you will see that the calf, which is also essentially a monolayer like this, is basically going to climb on top of the cancer cell monolayer. And in this case, it will manage to complete. Case it will manage to completely close on top of the model layer. That's what you can see here, and there, the sort of hole that existed is gone, and the whole thing is closed. So that's one example. In this particular example, they knocked down some adhesion molecule, cell cell adhesion molecule, some catarine, but you also see that phenotypes were in wild-type cells. And the other phenotype is this one, where you can see that the calves managed to climb on top of the cancer cell monolayer. Cancer cell monolayer, but eventually they get stuck at a level in which you have this bud that is formed. And so we thought that this resembled quite a bit the process of tumor budding and that we're going to try to study this quantitatively and to try to make a model of this. So the team of Daniela and Xavier Trepa as well did a lot of biophysical quantification. The first thing that they, well, maybe not the first thing, but one thing that is clear is Thing, but one thing that is clear is that you can use laser ablation to try to measure or at least visualize the stress that exists in this monolayer. So the first thing that is quite clear is that, so this is the periphery of the calf monolayer. So the calf are here. Here you have the cancer cells on which the calf are climbing. And the first thing that you can see is that there is a high concentration of, I think this is my. I can't. I think this is myosin. A high concentration of actin and myosin at the periphery, which basically forms a very dense actomyosin ring. And if you use a laser and cut that ring, you will see that, oh, it's not here. Okay, so this is the next movie. Sorry. So you will see a strong recoil. So that means that basically this part of the calves is under very high tension. You can also measure this tension in another way by replacing This tension in another way by replacing the cancer cells by a pillar. So, this is an artificial pillar, which happens to be deformable. So, you can measure the tension exerted by the calves, which are these things, on the pillar, by just looking at the deformation of the pillar. And you can look at the deformation as a function of the radius of the pillar. This is what you see here. And this is the relative deformation. And you can see that the relative deformation decreases as you increase the radius of the pillar. And this is The radius of the pillar, and this is consistent with the idea that these calves, or especially this spring of actomyaosin, would exert a line tension, it would be a line tension that, because of its curvature, is compressing the pillar. And so you can use something that is equivalent to Laplaceau, to expect that the 2D pressure exerted by this line tension would be inversely proportional with a radius. And by fitting, crudely fitting, you get a value for the line tension, which is. Value for the line tension, which is then a force, which is extremely high. This is a micro Newton, so it's a multicellular ring, but it's a very, very highly contractile system. And then finally, they did three 2D traction force measurements to measure the forces involved in the displacement of the calf on top of the cancer cells. That I won't detail very much. And the one thing that we were attracted by. And the one thing that we were attracted by as theorists was that you could vary some parameters systematically. And one of the parameters that they varied was the size of the cancer cell pattern. So they can vary, they have mostly three different size, going from 100 micrometer to 200 micrometer in radius. And what you can observe then is that the probability that you will form this multicellular bud depends on the size in quite a dramatic way. For small size, these For small size, the frequency of this budding event is less than one-third, and for large size, it's basically 100%. You can also look at the size of the bud that is formed, and you see the same correlation. And so, our idea was to try to reproduce these quantitative results by making a model where the so basically it's a model of how one kind of tissue can influence another one, but influence it through a friction. Because what's happening is that you have one tissue that's climbing onto. Is that you have one tissue that's climbing on top of the other one? There is adhesion, but this is a very slow process. So, at this scale, adhesion is effectively a friction force because of the binding and unbinding of the molecules that we heard about in the previous talk that leads to a sort of viscous behavior in this case. And so, the idea would be that you have one layer of cells that is climbing on top of the other one. The reason it's moving is because of this ring that basically makes it. Because of this ring that basically makes it close, and the interaction it has with the other layer is through friction. And then this is going to create a stress profile in the bottom layer. This is going to change, to create a shear, to change the pressure, and eventually to lead to some event where one cell is going to climb on top of the other cells. And that will trigger a morphological change where you end up with this multicellular structure. So that's basically the idea. Basically, the idea. And so that's the same thing we produce here. You can see some more examples of the deformation where you can see. So, here in this case, the multi-layering has already happened. You can see that you've got several nuclei or several cells on top of one another. You can see that the deformation is potentially very complicated. So, I'm not claiming that I can explain quantitatively this sort of shape, but I'm going to use a much more coarse-grained description of the elasticity of this. The elasticity of this tissue, in order to basically describe how the movement of one type of cell on top of the other one can influence the pressure distribution in this layer and leads to this sort of deformation. Right. So this, I am going to use a very continuous model, a little bit like the talk that we heard previously, where there was one Jung modulus, which is basically some sort of coarse-grain description of very... Some sort of coarse-grained description of very complex microscopic processes. And here I'm going to draw inspiration from some much simpler processes. For instance, here what you have is a drop of water that has been spread on a substrate by spinning the substrate. So because of strancrifugal force, this drop is completely flat. And then they stop spinning, and the drop is obviously going to go back to its spherical shape. And in doing that, you will see that you've got a In doing that, you will see that you've got a shape deformation which is highly non-trivial. In particular, you can see that you have rims that form at the edge. I replay that again. So you have rims here. So the deformation is not trivial. And the reason you have rims is because the driving force, which is the surface tension in this case, has to well is basically balanced by viscous dissipation in the drop. And the viscous dissipation end up creating these sort of rims here. And this looks a little bit like what we have. A little bit like what we have in our situation, where the rim would be basically this local deformation of the cancer cells right next to the calves that are basically moving. And we believe that this is the initiation of the bud. So when this rim gets large enough, cells climb on top of one another. And then from then on, the bud has no way to escape for me. All right, so we've got several quantifications that we can. We've got several quantifications that we can work with. For instance, you can look at how the radius of, so this, let's see. So, this is the radius of the calves here that is going down almost linearly in time. This is right, so right here. And so, of course, at some point, it closes and then it stops moving. And we can try to understand these dynamics by doing some very crude force balance. And so, the force balance. Force balance, and so the force balance is sketch here. We know that driving force, the driving force is this line tension, which is this orange thing here, which gives you a driving force that is then inversely proportional with the radius, right? So, this driving force eventually is going to divert as the radius goes to zero. That's one thing. And this driving force is opposed by many opposing forces. First, you have the fact that there is a tension in the calf, which is pulling against this ring. But, okay, so that's one thing. This is a sort of Okay, so that's one thing. This is a sort of static tension. This is equivalent to the E infinity that we heard before. It's due to the actomasin contraction, except that here it gives a tension. But you also have a lot of viscous phenomena, which are mostly due to the viscosity of this monolayer and the fact that you have friction. And the friction is very important for us because that's what drives the deformation. You can have friction either in the surface or on the line below the ring. And then if you have. The ring, and then if you have the bud that forms, you also have the resisting force of the bud that is forming here. And so, you basically equate the driving force with the resisting force, and that gives you an equation for the velocity. So, this is the closure velocity. The driving force is that. This is the Laplace pressure, basically, due to line tension. This is the tension in the calf. This is the bud resistance, which we forget at the moment because there's no bud. And these are different dissipation mechanisms. So, this is the vessel. Dissipation mechanisms. So, this is the viscosity in the actomycin ring. This is the viscosity in the cathmenolayer. These are the frictions that depend on the radius in various ways. So, here we observe that the velocity is almost independent of the radius, at least at early time. And that suggests that the resisting force is, in fact, the viscosity of the calf monolayer. That would give you a velocity that would be independent of the radius. So, we're going to assume that this is. Of the radius, so we're going to assume that this is the main resisting force and forget about the other ones just for simplicity. This one is the friction, this is what is going to drive the deformation. So we are going to keep this, but assume that it's a small perturbation for the velocity compared to that term here. Right, and then we need to write equations to explain how the stress is going to propagate within the cancer cell monolayer. And this is, these are, I mean, it's these are. And these are really very simple expressions. So, the main idea is to say that these cells have a preferred height and width. And if you deviate from that preferred height, you pay some elastic cost. And so, this is actually associated to an elastic modulus. So, in this case, I use an elastic description, but this elasticity is really due to the cortical tension. So, again, this is related to the E infinity. So again, this is related to the E infinity that we heard about in the previous talk, except that here this tension is acting all the time. It's acting at long time. So if you pull a cell against this tension, you feel an elastic modulus here. Then we also say that there is a surface tension associated to the apical surface of the cells. And so you have a surface tension parameter. And that's basically it. So we have two elastic parameters. We also have a preferred thickness. We also have a preferred thickness, which we can measure. And so we have a pressure that is as this elastic term and has a term that is basically Laplace pressure due to deformation of the interface here. So this is for the, right, let's, so this is for the part that is not covered by calf, you have this thing. For the part that is covered by calf, you have the same thing, except that here the surface tension also includes the tension in the calf monolayer, which itself depends on space. Layer which itself depends on space because of friction, so it's a bit more complicated. And then you write an equation to tell you how things propagate. And this equation looks like this. You basically are saying that if you have gradients of pressure within this, gradients of pressure are going to create flow. And this flow is going to involve some friction force. So here, this is the friction between the cancer cells and the substrate. And so you end up with a And so you end up with a propagation of stress equation that is basically due to gradient of pressure equal friction force. On this part, which is the part that is covered by the calf, you have the same thing, but you also have the driving force, which is the fact that the calf movement is actually creating the deformation by having a friction on the substrate. So you have these two type of equations, and you have to solve them. And if you do that, knowing what the calf velocity is like from the previous study, then you can, in principle, calculate the time evolution. Principle calculate the time evolution of the whole system. So, for those who actually like other kinds of models, such as the vertex model, where you would consider each cell independently, and you would actually assume that this monolayer is a bunch of cells that you can describe independently. Those two descriptions are equivalent in some limits, and the limits are basically when the deformation are small compared, well, small, pretty much, and that typically is okay for columnar epithelia. Is okay for columnar epithelia, which are thicker than they are white, basically. And then you can have a relationship between these elastic coefficients and the cortical tensions that we heard about already yesterday. All right, so the colours grain equation that you end up with, this is an equation for the thickness of the cancer cell monolayer. It looks like this. So basically, you have a diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient that is a ratio of an elastic parameter over a friction parameter. Over a friction parameter. And you have this term, which comes from the surface tension, which gives you a higher order derivative. So it makes things a bit more complicated. You have quite a few parameters. Some of them you know. For instance, the velocity of the calf. You can measure it directly. And you also measure the line tension with this pillar experiment. So that gives you an idea of what the viscosity is. So the velocity we're talking about here is micrometer per hour. And so the whole process of closure takes several hours, like 40 hours or something. Several hours, like 40 hours or something. So it's a very slow process. You can also compare the velocity of the calves and of the cancer cells, and that gives you an idea of the ratio between these two friction parameters, which turn out to be of order one. So yeah, there's several parameters that you can determine from the observations. Okay, so you can do some scaling analysis, which I won't really get into the details of. And so the typical result. So, the typical results of the equations look like this. So, here this is in a simplified assumption where I assume that the calves are under such high tension that they don't deform. So, the part that is covered by the calf is going to remain flat, is going to be closing. So, this point here is this point here. It's going to be closing in that direction. And you look at the deformation of the free part, and it looks like this. So, typically, this calves are closing, the free part is getting deformed, the deformation gets really high, and at the end of the day, Get really high, and at the end of the day, in this model, the calves always manage to close because basically there's nothing to prevent the closure. The reaction of the cancer cells is purely viscous, so it's not going to react elastically. And at the end of the day, everything closes. So that was one example, which I'm going to play again, where, let's see, here we go, where you can see that the deformation is localized. So here you have a rim. And this is when the frame. This is when the friction parameter, the friction is very high. So the diffusion coefficient is fairly low. In the other limits, here you don't have a rim. Here, the deformation propagates throughout the sample and you have a different kind of evolution, but qualitatively gives the same thing. So basically, the deformation increases in time, it goes back to zero at the end when everything closes, and at some point you have a maximum deformation. And the question is basically whether this maximum deformation is sufficient to trigger multilayering. Sufficient to trigger multi-layering. So then you can do phase diagrams, and this is basically a phase diagram that tells you how much is the maximum deformation as a function of the parameters. So here, this is the bug, the original size of the cancer cells. Here, this is a friction parameter. And you can see that in this case, you observe indeed that the deformation, the peak deformation, increases with the size of the system. So that would tell you that if you need... So that would tell you that if you need a given deformation to do multilayering, then this is more likely to happen when the system, when the cluster of cancer cells is larger. You can also obtain some analytical results, which I won't really describe. Okay, so in the most natural and the most relevant case where the calf can also lead to the deformation of the cancer cell below them, then you have different kinds of evolution. So here again, this is the case of a very strong friction where Of a very strong friction where the deformation gets very localized. This is the case of a very weak friction where the deformation spreads out, and here you get some intermediate regime. So, the main idea is how do the different parameters influence the maximum deformation you can get? And can you reproduce these experimental results? And so, there's some fitting involved, but at the end of the day, by fitting the parameters, we could indeed reproduce this probability. Could indeed reproduce this probability, this budding probability, which increases with the size of the pattern in a way that we can quantitatively reproduce. And one comment I guess I want to make here is that this correlation is actually not really always the case. You can have opposite behavior, meaning that butting could be more probable for small clusters if you were in a different parameter regime, in particular if the friction with the substrate was much higher. This substrate was much higher. All right, so this is the first part of the story: is basically that we think we can understand quantitatively how the friction between two tissues of different type can lead to morphological changes and in this case, to the formation of a multi-layer structure. Right, and then for the last part of this talk, I want to touch upon another phenomenon, which is somewhat surprising. It's somewhat surprising in some ways is that once a bud is formed, you have these calves that are trying to pinch the bud, but the bud remains stable and doesn't evolve for many, many hours. So how is that possible? So this is maybe I yes. So this is just the traction force that tells you that you can actually see from the forces that the body is forming. So that's not really the point. So what is interesting is you can actually remain in a situation where Can actually remain in a situation where the calves are trying to squeeze the bud, but the bud doesn't go away. And that brings a question: which is what would be the proper mechanical description of this tissue? So we already heard about viscous elastic or viscoelastic. But if the, I mean, in principle, if you wait for a very long time, you would expect that cells could move with respect to one another, and that should lead to some sort of viscous behavior for this tissue. But then if For this tissue. But then, if you have a viscous spherical bud that is being squeezed by an elastic ring, there's no way that this ring will be stable. The ring will completely pinch off and the bud should basically be detached from the main monolayer. And this is not what we observe. So, the purely fluid behavior doesn't seem to be appropriate. On the other hand, if it was. On the other hand, if it was an elastic behavior, then you would expect no cell rearrangement. And in this case, you should have a monolayer that should remain a monolayer, and eventually this could buckle. So it could detach from the substrate and form a deformed monolayer, but you would not end up with a multicellular butt. So somehow you have to describe things by some intermediate description. And in this case, it's not a visco-elastic description. It's not a matter of time scale because you can wait for a very long time and the thing. For a very long time and the thing remains stable. So it's not that at a very long time you become fluid. It's more like an elastoplastic description, which means that it's a yield stress system. You need to reach a given level of elastic stress or mechanical stress in order to yield a fluid transition. And if you don't, then the system remains elastic. So that's why we tried to describe the stability of the bud this way. And in this, we drew some inspiration from other studies. We drew some inspiration from other studies where they looked at the way a spherical aggregate of cells can spread. So it's basically the opposite behavior, it's the spreading. And here also, you basically go from a 3D to a 2D structure, and that also requires cell-cell rearrangement. And in this particular case, you need cells to squeeze between layers. I mean, of course, the system is not very well layered, but you still have cells that are on top that needs to go down. And so for this, they need to change. And so, for this, they need to change layer. And so, we describe this the same way, except that here, what we have is we have some sort of a cellar cylinder that we squeeze by a ring. So, this is the actomycin ring, and we ask whether that thing can be stable. And the stability would tell you that the Laplace pressure, which is the ratio of the line tension over the radius, should be equal to some elastic resisting force that would depend. Resisting force that would depend on some parameters, such so it would depend in some ways on the total height of the cylinder and the height of the ring. And if you consider an elastic cylinder that you squeeze in the center, what you will notice is that this resisting force is very quickly independent of the total height of the cylinder. If the height is of the order it's a radius, then the Then the resisting force increases with the height, but as soon as the height reaches some large size, it saturates. So, basically, the reason why this thing would be stable is not because you have a very long cylinder. You need stability at this point where the resisting force still depends on the height. And so, the sort of description we try to do looks like this. So, before the multilayering starts, you have the calf monolayer. You have the calf monolayer, which shears the cancer cells, and eventually the pressure is going to build up here. And this will lead to a transition to multi-layering. So, when the pressure reaches some critical value, which is a parameter, it's our yield stress, cells start climbing on top of one another. When that happens, then this layer starts exerting a pressure that also prevents the ring to close. So there's an additional resisting force which comes from the pressure in this layer. From the pressure in this layer. But if ever this pressure becomes too high above that yield stress, then you form a third layer, and then a fourth layer, and etc. So that tells you that if the pressure exerted by the ring is too large, the whole system is going to behave as a fluid because you reach the yield stress. And so, in order for the whole thing to be stable, what you need is the pressure hindering. Pressure in the ring to be below the one that would lead to that would be the yield stress. And so this the stability diagram looks something like this. In red here, you have the pressure exerted by the ring, which again diverges as one over R for the Laplace pressure. And in green, you have the resistance from this bug that is being formed, which has this form, it saturates when the radius becomes small, because this is. Small because this is the effect that the height of the cylinder does not come into play. And so, in order to be stable, you need intersection between these two curves. You need basically to have, so intersections, you will necessarily have two intersection. One is a stable equilibrium, one is an unstable one. And whether you have this intersection or not depends on the parameter. If the line tension is too high, you will not have it. If the yield stress is too low, you will not have it either. So, you will not have it either. And so, you can now again make another phase diagram. So, here this is for the stability of the bud at long time. Here, you have the yield stress, here you have the ring tension. And you only can get incomplete buds, which is what is observed often in the experiments in this intermediate regime where the line tension is not too high, but it's still sufficiently high to close the system, and where the yield stress is intermediate if it's too low. Intermediate. If it's too low, then the whole thing becomes fluid. If it's too high, then you don't have body. Right. So, this is the story I want to tell you. So this is my summary. So basically, two kind of stories. One is about friction force linked to morphological changes due to the interaction between two types of tissues. And the second story was about how to describe the stability of multicellular structures on the structure. Of multicellular structures under stress using a sort of visco-plastic model. Thank you for your attention. Looking for questions.
