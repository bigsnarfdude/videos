Wonderful. Hello, everybody. I am very sorry for not joining you, not joining you in person today. I actually was traveling from another conference in Spain, very close to our here. We had a solid state magnetic material-related conference. And on the way back, I felt a bit sick. So, sorry for not being able to join in person. But after each. But after eating a lot of medicine, I feel quite excited. So, hopefully, I can pull it together. So, okay. So, I'll discuss with you today how we can use liquid crystalline soft matter systems as model systems to realize and understand analogs of other physical systems, ranging all the way. Range all the way from subatomic particles to cosmology. And in this, my motivation is these words of Rich Feynman, who say that what I cannot create, I do not understand. What soft matter provides us is a unique ability of creating models of everything from subatomic particles to cosmological objects. And I hope to illustrate. And I hope to illustrate today some examples of that. I also would like to start from highlighting the new international institute that I have a pleasure and honor directing over the last two years or so. So it's an institute, International Institute for Sustainability with noted chiral matter matter. Is not at Chiral Mathematia, where mathematics, as you can see, plays a very key role in connecting very different, very distant fields, ranging from different types of condensed matter systems like quantum systems, magnetic solids, and liquid crystals and colloids and biopolymers and gels, as well as subatomic systems and cosmological systems. And in doing this, we develop not Develop knots as designable building blocks of matter, establishing a new paradigm of knotted chiral metamatter, and cross-pollinate topology and chirality knowledge across disciplines and scales, creating also foundations for technological innovations that can solve global naughty problems such as growing energy demand and climate change. And you can see in here a team of Here, a team of leaders internationally who are prominent in this very broad area of research, the new research field that we try to create. And so I would like to give this historic interlude first. So we know that nodes have been part of culture and history in many nations around the world. Here are just some examples. Here are just some examples, and in here you can see examples of knots like Mizuhiki knots, a part of Japanese culture, but also we find such knot symbols and parts of culture in the millennia of history around the world for different nations. Also, of course, knots became very important part of the Part of the mathematical knot series, so a branch of pure mass where we have constructs such as these knots and multi-component links that are very important objects to study. And in different physical systems, we often use, for example, homotopy theory to classify different topological objects, and we know. Objects, and we know that you cannot have knots in two dimensions because you have too little dimensions to tie knots. And you cannot have knots in four dimensions, but in three dimensions, you can have knots. And so, some of the most spectacular objects that need to be studied, but remain somewhat understudied, in particular in condensed matter systems like liquid crystals. Like liquid crystals, are the knots in the objects in three-dimensional space, where we can have different types of knot solitons and vortices tied into knots. And in here, there are a lot of opportunities to study such objects. And I will focus on some examples of those. So, I would like to very briefly highlight the To very briefly highlight this kind of spectrum of universality, of not topology, chirality in very different systems. And so examples here include, for example, the bacteria, cyanobacteria in living matter that existed here on Earth some 3.5 billion years. 5 billion years and are responsible for oxygen of the atmosphere we know as of today and the different forms of life that emerged enabled by that oxygen atmosphere that they created. They formed the different types of ordered actinumetic type of behavior with topological objects in them. We also have such types of behavior. Such types of behavior in more conventional liquid crystals, like the ones we use in these plates, in chiral liquid crystals, where we can form solitonic analogs of macromolecules, different types of other solitons and topological objects like mobiusons, we discovered it recently. And these objects can also interact with topological and non-topical. With topological and non-topological solitons of light as a types of topological solitons as well. And finally, when, for example, we create tonguelet fibers, for example, from nanocellulose, we create materials that have physical properties that are not encountered in naturally occurring materials. Naturally occurring material systems. In this very practical example, you can see how you can use elements of mathematical note theory to solve some very practical problems, such as energy efficiency of Windows. And in this particular case, you can see that by creating such aeragel suis, tanglet fibers. Tonglet fibers of nanocellulose one can make windows more energy efficient than building walls because you can see in here that they stop heat escape through windows much better than the building walls around us as you can judge based on this temperature measure it with infrared camera. So okay, returning to this table. Table in here where I was summarizing the homotopy theory classification of different topological objects, both solitonic and singular defects as well. So in the case of topological solitons, whenever we have uniform five-field background, we can compactify multi-dimensional spaces such as R1, R2, R3. R2, R3 on the corresponding spheres, so the compact spaces such as S1, S2, and 3. And then the topological solitons that are embedded in these different multi-dimensional spaces can be classified with the help of homotopy group theory, thinking about them as maps from different spheres, in this case, to the spheres corresponding to the order parameter. Corresponding to the order parameter space. And so, of course, very familiar examples of those different types of singular defects we already saw being discussed today. And also topological solitons, such as domain walls, studied for, well, a century or so in different condensed matter systems, as well as baby skirmions, which are lower-dimensional analogues of. Dimensional analogues of scarum topological solitons that are elements of this third homotopy group of S3 spheres. And so today I will discuss with you objects that are called Hopfion, so elements of the third homotopy group of S2 sphere, as well as S2 mod Z2, for the case of non-polar liquid crystals, but also polar ferromagnetic. So, polar ferromagnetic hydroliquid crystals, and also the topological objects that are very close to this grown-up high-energy physics skirmians that you can see in here. And so, the particle nuclear physics theories that introduced these three-dimensional skirmions, right, that gave a lot of excitement across the spectrum of physics. Spectrum of physical systems from particle physics to cosmology, in many cases, a motivation for us because we can recreate different types of topological analogs of these. And so, in here, I remind everyone that this Z corresponds to nothing else but baryon number, or you can connect it also to atomic number in nuclear physics. And therefore, by creating Therefore, by creating analogues of these types of particles in condensed matter systems, we can understand a lot of things about their behavior as well. And so in the core of my study or my discussion today, we'll have this ferromagnetic chiral liquid crystal colloidal systems where the liquid crystal director field formed by molecules like Formed by molecules like 5CB, very classic ones, is decorated by magnetization field, which comes from magnetically monodomain biomed hexaphorite nanoplates that can be prepared in a colloidal dispersion in a way that essentially vectorizes the unit, the director field with a unit vector field of magnetization. And these types of systems are very. And these types of systems are very similar to magnetic solids. Well, actually, the other conference that I was attending in Spain was on magnetic solids, where quantum effects are, of course, very important. And people there, of course, talk a lot about things such as magnetic hysteresis and different domain walls and so on. Different domain walls and so on. In there, the magnetic Hamiltonian, micromagnetic Hamiltonian takes this form. You can see in here for chiral magnetic solids, where the first term is the exchange energy term. The second one is called Zelyshinsky-Mourier term. And the third term describes the coupling, linear coupling to external applied magnetic field. External applied magnetic field. When we have this magnetic colloidal system that I was describing, the expression for free energy takes a form a little bit more complicated, but you can write it in a form that has separately, explicitly written this chiral term in here. And then there are, of course, additional coupling terms. So to electric field, we couple. So, to electric field, we couple quadratically, and then because magnetization field is coupled to director field, and it's a liquid crystal molecular system that responds more strongly to magnetic field. And then to magnetic field, we couple linearly in this case. And now, for magnetic solids, we know that we can go from Can go from well, helical state for chiromagnetic solids to ferromagnetic states through the conical states of different kind with different cone angles. And the similar type of behavior can be now mimicked in non-polar liquid crystals, where, for example, we would have mixtures of 5 Cb, Cb7Cb, and the chiral additive like Cb15. I'll return to this. I'll return to this a little bit later in my talk. And so these two systems become very similar from the physical behavior standpoint of view because in one constant approximation, and actually, as I already mentioned, we can create these days mixtures of different liquid crystal compounds like the ones in here and mimic this. Here and mimic this type of behavior where the constants become close to equal to each other. And then, for these relations, you can actually map this liquid crystal free energy functional to micromagnetic Samiltonian with this term also being part of it. And so this shows us that we can now use colloidal magnetic liquid crystals as a model system for magnetic solids and beyond. Solids and beyond. And of course, one very interesting object to look at are the three-dimensional topological solitons, which are called Hop solitons. So I would like to remind you, these are elements of the third homotopy group, because here we compactify this R3 space where in the far-field background, the magnetization field is uniform. For that condition, we can compactify it in compact space. Compactified in compact space of S3. And then the topological invariance describing topology of the objects we can have in the third homotopy group elements, nothing else but have geometric interpretation of the linking number of pre-images. So, reminding you, pre-images are regions in space that have a single value of the order parameter, which in this case, Order parameter, which in this case is magnetization unit vector field. And so, for us to have a Hoppeon for every single combination of points on the S2 sphere, we need to have the preimages linked with each other one time for Q equal one. And then, of course, for the Hopfion with Hopfield index equal two, they need to be double linked. So, instead of Hoplink here, we have a Solomon link. Hoplink here, we have a Solomon link, and so on. So, such objects have been studied in liquid crystal systems quite widely, including the non-polar systems, including magnetic colloidal systems, and including combinations of those. This is a cross-section of such Hop soliton in a plane perpendicular to far-field magnetization, where you can see that the spin technology is a very important. Where you can see that the spin texture magnetization field is uniform everywhere. But as we look in the cross-section perpendicular to this plane in here containing far-field magnetization, you see that the texture is uniform everywhere, continuous everywhere, but topological non-trivial, no matter how you would wiggle these little cones, you will not be able to remove it. And indeed, as we would look at pre-images. As we would look at pre-images, they all take the form of closed loops. And for every pair of points on S2 order parameter space, the closed loops are linked exactly one time. So now we, of course, discover such objects experimentally. This is a non-linear optical imaging setup that's built around the femtosecond oscillator laser source and contains a lot of things like. Contains a lot of things like pulse shapers based on spatial light modulators, of course, liquid crystalline light modulators. And with the help of such an imaging system, we can image such three-dimensional structure either in the mode of three-photon absorption-based luminescence, which is polarized in nature, and therefore, based on polarization, the Or based on the polarization dependence of the signal, we can, coming, for example, from molecules like 5CB or CB15, we can detect these signals and map the field configurations. We can also do it in coherent anti-Stokes-Raman scattering mode based on the triple bond CN as in here. So, in here, you can see. So, in here, you can see how different slices of such topological soliton were obtained in this row for different polarizations of excitation, femtosecond, laser light, linear and circular in different cross-sectional planes, parallel to substrates and perpendicular to them. And you can see that experimental results very closely mimic numeric. Very closely mimic numerically simulated ones. So, from such images, we can reconstruct pre-images corresponding to different points in the order parameter space. And you can see that they indeed match each other, not just up to topology, but very fine geometric features in experiment closely agree with those predicted by our own theories. By our own theory as well. And then, point by point, you can reconstruct pre-images for all points in the order parameter space, so leaving no doubt that the topological soliton we obtained in here is a Hopfion with all pre-images corresponding to different orientations of unit vector magnetization field packed into volume in here of this torus, where in the periphery. Taurus, where in the periphery of Taurus, the far-field magnetization is uniform, corresponding to the North Pole. And inside of that Taurus, we have all possible values of the order parameter space, all taking the form of pre-images in the form of closed loops that are linked with other pre-images just exactly one time. Now, we, of course, can obtain different types of solar. Um, different types of solitons with different hop indices, and in here you can see some examples of those. It's very beautiful behavior that actually is fascinating the pure mass people we talk about in this other SK Sim Square Mathematical Institute that I was describing. What's beautiful is that just by changing the magnetization and the range of few milletes. Few millites, and note that this is just a couple times larger field than that of Earth's magnetic field. That's a very low magnetic fields to which this system responds. We can create different types of topological solitons with different types of linking of pre-images and different hop indices, and we can obtain transitions between them. Well, now back to inspiration. Well, now back to inspiration for the physical systems where the study of such objects is not as accessible as in our soft matter media. So this modeling we did for magnetic solids. And in here, what we could not have in soft matter is the quantum phenomenon that comes from this. Phenomenon that comes from this emergent field. You can see in here, we can calculate it based on this expression. And what's beautiful is that that emergent field also takes the topology of Hop vibration for elementary Hop soliton in the magnetization field. And there are other types of topological objects that we discovered, including things like half-hour. Things like half-hoppins that analogues of half-skirmions that people also study in, say, magnetic solids. Now, going beyond this, we found a very fascinating object that we called Harry Norton. Here is where the name comes from, these words that you can see in here. For the reason that in the order parameters. In the order parameter field of director of liquid crystal or unit vector magnetization of magnetic colloidal system, we have hop vibration-like topology. So we have a hopion. But in the helical axis field and tau field, which are orthogonal to the director field, we have vertex lines making nodes, including in this elementary case of q equals one. case of Q equals one hop hop index heli-nauton this would be a trephoid node so it's a beautiful fascinating topology that we discover what's amazing is that we can reproduce this behavior in in model very closely numerical modeling very closely matching the experimental results you can see that by changing by just one volt One volt voltage applied to the sample, we morph this object dramatically. But nevertheless, topology does not change. The HOP index, the type of knot we have remain the same, just morphed, just stretched without changing topology. What's more is that these objects can self-assemble into a whole different range of crystals, including closed-packed crystals and all. Packed crystals and open crystals, which for colloidal systems are almost not possible to obtain. People struggled with obtaining such open crystals for very long time until very recently. And here we just find them under a microscope. We also observe giant electrostriction because by changing applied electric field by just one or few volts, we see the A few volts, we see the lattice parameter changes 50% or more, something that is two or three orders of magnitude larger than in conventional solid crystals. So it's a giant electrostriction. And then we discover all kinds of three-dimensional crystallites forming. You can see in here some, for example, crystallines in different focal planes of this image. And including the lowest symmetry triclinic crystals of helium notons that we observe in here, all packed in a helical background of unit vector magnetization field or director field. Well, so we can find them in liquid crystals and liquid crystal colloids and also in magnetic solids, as I'll show you in a few minutes. And so, this is the actually detailed. And so, this is the actually detailed structure of such a topological soliton in different cross-sectional planes where we vectorize the director field. And for magnetic colloidal dispersion, this is the magnetization field. And this is what we have in helical axis fields. And you can see that there are regions of discontinuity corresponding to vertex lines that I was showing you. That I was showing you earlier. So now, the same thing, you know, as I mentioned, so this work in here, I hope you can also read is Nazin related to soft matter. It's purely magnetic solid type of systems such as iron-germannion, such as MNSI that we consider in this work. Yet, the topology of Hop solitons of heliumoton time is the very same. The very same. And so, but what's interesting is how exactly the pre-images pack in the three-dimensional space. So, you can see in here for North and South Pole, we have this nice hop link. And then we see that the pre-images corresponding to different polar angles on the astrosphere are tiling into this torrent of pre-images differently geometrically than. Geometrically, than in the Hopfion that we looked at earlier, which was embedded in a uniform ferromagnetic background. Now, we also can obtain such objects in a conical background as we apply magnetic field, right, in a liquid crystal, magnetic colloidal chiral liquid crystal system. We see the magnetization going on a cone, and this cone angle depends on the magnetization field. Magnetization field. And then this pre-image packing morphs. And so you go through some very interesting behavior as you pass the cone angle corresponding polar angle on the S2 sphere. So, these types of objects are currently studied theoretically, also following our work. Following our work in magnetic solids, and here's an example of one of the groups that is following up on this other study. Again, all inspiration comes from us finding such objects in magnetic colloidal dispersions experimentally. And these are the Lorentz TM images we predicted for people to find them in magnetic solids experimentally. So now in So, now in magnetic solids, what's interesting is that such object location along the helical axis can be controlled by magnetic field. And so you might know that topological solitons like skirmions and hopians are very strong interest for the magnetic racetrack memory applications. And what's beautiful is. And what's beautiful is by using this magnetic control, we can now have magnetic racetrack memories that are three-dimensional in nature. Moreover, in other studies, when expanding, going beyond from soft matter to solid state, we considered magnetic crystalline anisotropy for different types, including the cases of easy plane, easy axis, cubic, and so on. Plane, easy axis cubic, and so on. And so, there are lots of predictions that are currently being tested by people in solid-state physics in terms of their behavior. So, again, in a similar way, just like in liquid crystalline colloidal systems, we have formation of crystals of the topological solutions, such as helium atons. And here, in the same way, we see. And here, in the same way, we see a clustering of such topological solitons. And that resembles in many ways how in nuclear and subatomic particle physics, people think about the nucleons with different high baryon numbers being formed by the elementary ones coming together to fuse into the higher baryon number nucleons. Uh, the higher baryon number nucleons now. But yeah, I understand their dynamics is totally different, right? We have like viscous dynamics and liquid crystals. They have some completely different dynamics. I understand that the statics are the same, but are we supposed to believe these shapes? The dynamics is coming next. You're supposed to be two slides, two slides from now. Two slides from now is the dynamics. All right. Okay. So all right. So let me kind of continue with details on this. So, okay, in here we can see such an object embedded in a liquid crystalline medium, right? So it's something called reddish. It's something I already showed you in the helical background, an elementary heli-noton. And this is our diagram of stability, which we constructed for a mixture of CB7CB5CB and chiral additive CB15. And so for this point, it exactly mimics the solid state magnet like iron-germanium or MNSI, for which this constant. For which these constants are equal to each other. And then, as we apply magnetic field, we see this structure morph and then being embedded in a conical background. But as you can see, pre-images are linked topological in the same way. And at yet higher field, we can see that we obtain a soliton of Hopfion type because. Hoppion type because the far-field background is now fully unwound, but pre-image linking stays the same. So by applying electric field in here, we can go through these different states. And by the way, these contour lines correspond to the cone angles of the different systems. And then the same thing, the same type of stability diagram can be also obtained from. Also obtained for magnetic materials where instead we have the crystal anisotropy and also as one axis and then also the magnetic field in here. And in both cases, we can morph the heli-noton into Hoppion without changing the topology of pre-image linking. So Hopf index stays conserved. It's very simple. It's very similar to how you would morph a Taurus into coffee, mark, and back in our imagination as topologists, right? But preserving the topology. So here are the experimental videos showing you this transformation from uniform ferromagnetic-like background, which between cross-polarizers looks dark, to the helical and conical backgrounds as we change. Backgrounds as we change applied fields, and you can see this textures morphing without any introduction of singular defects in between. But topology stays the same. Geometric embodiment of this system is quite different in these extremes while topology is preserved, right? And so here you can see from comparison of experimental and computer simulation. Experimental and computer-simulated results. We have very good agreement of polarizing optical microscopy images and experiments and then computation, sorry, experiment is at top, computational POMs at the bottom. And these are the pre-image linking geometric embodiments that we have them corresponding to. So, again, as I already mentioned, we can morph the background going. Morph the background going from uniform ferromagnetic to helical to conical, and in that we can morph the topological soliton, which is embedded in that background without changing topology. Moreover, when we do it periodically by sending pulses of electric fields, as you can see in here, we see that such a topological solitons become effectively an active particle. An active particle because, at the scale of this topological object, it converts electric energy into motion because of non-reciprocal evolution of the magnetization in director fields, which again then results in translation, very much like you would have a translation of a wave on a stadium. And here we have a translation of a localized. Of a localized field configuration that is moving while evolving between different embodiments of the same topological objects, analogous to that I showed you with the help of Coffee Mark and Donner. Now, it's important to know that we can have lowest symmetry by axial ferromagnetic colloids. So, this is what we studied some time ago. Some time ago, you know, this can be of polar and non-polar types. Some particles can be magnetic or non-polar. And again, these objects, this type of condensed matter system show a lot of beautiful behavior, reminiscent to that of magnetic solids, but also much richer. And in here, we can have different order parameter spaces, such as, for example, in the case of In the case of the ferromagnetic biaxial colloidal system, the order parameter space is S3 mod Z2 for the orthorhombic type of system where we have non-polar plates and three orthogonal director fields. System is that of orthorhombic biaxial nematic S3 mod Q. In these types of systems, we have closer analogy. We have a closer analogy to that of magnetic of the subatomic particles. And so, in there, as you remember, SU2 order parameter space is compactified on S3. And in this case, we can have topological solitons that localized in all three spatial dimensions. So, this is a certain homotopy group, but also the order parameters. Group, but also the order parameter space is S3 mod either Z2 or Q. And in this case, we can have topological solitons as well. So because they're also described by elements that are integers. And so in both cases, it's z. And so in here, you can see pictorial representation. Pictorial representation of such topological solitons, where for each of the components of the field, we can see hop vibration-like behavior. But in here, you can see the three different fields plotted separately. And again, again, only very, very distantly, very distantly at some level of topology, mimicking what people thought. What people thought about the topological solitons in nuclear and subatomic particle physics. But now I would like to switch gears a little bit and talk actually about knots as analogues of particles and atoms or elementary particles in particular. We know that it was Gauss who was thinking about knots as particles first. He was saying, First, he was saying if, say, magnetic field lines like ones in here were not allowed to cross, then these knots would behave like particles. And then Lord Calvin took the, well, he did not know about this idea, but he developed his own, saying that maybe the atoms corresponding to different elements in the periodical table are described by noted vertex lines. Vortex lines in either, which was believed at that time to exist. Well, we know this theory is not true, but nevertheless, it gave origins to the entire branch of mathematics, not theory, and also to many models across different branches of physics. And actually, at that time, Lord Calvin thought that atoms were the elementary particles. That's where the name atom even comes from. Where the name atom even comes from. But later we know elementary particles are, you know, something different. And modeling such objects in quantum field theories, Ed Wheaton was able actually to provide a lot of physics insights into mathematical note theory. And these are only physicists to receive the highest honor for mathematicians, which is the Fields Medal. Mathematicians, which is the Fields model. Well, in the original model that Lord Calvin, Maxwell, Tite, and other brilliant physicists of previous century or two centuries ago were thinking about as models of atoms, you would have vortex lines like the ones here created by this dolphin in water, right? And so you can see, you know, this dolphin lots of. Know this dolphin, lots of beautiful videos you can find online dolphins playing with such vertex and knots. But people recently can create knots and vertex lines. Unfortunately, these just simply disappear and as beautiful as they are, very sadly we just watch them go away. Now, of course, in Lord Kelvin's vision, the knots would be realized in a perfect way. Realized in a perfect fluid, in a medium that can stabilize such objects. And of course, for these objects to really serve as particles, they would need to reproduce behavior of the subatomic particles like nucleons, as well, including nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. And you know that nuclear fusion recently generates a lot of excitement. Generates a lot of excitement as a source of renewable energy, yet it's very difficult to make it work, right? It's extremely hard, even though there is some recent progress. Well, in liquid crystals, it's easier. So here is a video playing and showing you that happening. So in here, we have trefoil notes. Trefoil knots fusing together to form a composite knot. And visualizations are done in two different fields, orthogonal to each other. I'll skip some details, but we can think, considering the time, I will rush a little bit, we can think about this type of effects as the mathematical embodiment of the connected sum of knots. So we can have. So, we can have connected some of notes with this created with this band surgery, as you can see in here. And these are the snapshots showing you how such things work in our liquid crystalline systems. What's more is that we can electrically control these processes to go back and forth. We can switch them by pulses of electric fields. By pulses of electric field, we can induce fusion and fission effortlessly by just changing the applied voltage by one volt or so. You can go from trefoil knot to this connected sum of knots and back as many times as you want. Moreover, we can induce the so-called double-connected sum of knots where the knots reconnect in two different places at the same time. At the same time. And here are the details of how this happens. And again, it's a very beautiful type of pure mass that we observe in the front of our eyes. What's more is that by just simply applying voltage to a medium with our knots, we can induce fusion and then with the help of non-linear optical imaging, we can. Of non-linear optical imaging, we can reconstruct this behavior and then we can model numerically and we can reproduce this behavior, right? Because we can calculate the free energy maps when we have these particles, particle-like topological objects at different separation separations and different separation vectors, orientation. Orientations with respect to each other and helical axis of the chiral medium in which they embedded. And again, we can induce these multiple reconnections with the results that we see in experiment being very closely matched by what we find in computations. And here, the different summary of different reconnections. Summary of different reconnection pathways. So, band surgeries that we observed experimentally. I will not go into details, not to bother you with very technical stuff. And so in here, you can see an example of fusion through co-aligning the material field of three fields in our system, right, describing this order parameter field. And then one of the fields. Then one of the fields is matched. So you can see the colors during this reconnection exactly the same as it happens. And so by changing field, we can stabilize different types of multi-component links as well or notes. And so you can see in here how by changing field, we can stabilize all of these different objects that. These different objects that you're seeing here. And again, the videos may be possible for everyone to follow and appreciate the beauty of this knotted chiral metamatter that rather than disappearing like in knotted vortices in water in here becomes more knotted, more complex, more beautiful. So we can sequentially fuse different objects in different types of nodes. Uh, we in different types of knots, and you can see with that process we can create more and more complex knots. For example, in this case, a six-component link with one of them being a node. And in here is yet even more complex example and even more complex example arising from fusion of larger array of such knotted objects. Well, this brings me. Well, this brings me to the conclusions. I was able, I hope I was able to show you that the liquid crystals, liquid crystal colloids are very beautiful systems to study, to understand the more complex world around us, which is not always experimentally accessible. And an example of that is solid state magnets. That is solid-state magnets, but also many other physical systems. I demonstrated to use self-assembly of crystals of particle-like topological solitons that are not solitons. And I also demonstrated emergent dynamics of different topological soliton objects, such as particle-like active matter-like motion, hopping. Motion hopping of hopping on the re-knotting of the knots. So, you know that as you go from three dimensions to four dimensions, all knots can be unknotted. You cannot have knots in four dimensions. But that colored scheme that I was using in my visualizations in some way, which I will not detail today, can be thought of as an. Can be thought of as an extra dimension and really showing off us how we can unknot or renot any knot we want. And in many ways, I hope what I showed illustrates how knotted chiral matter matter mimics the natural matter around us, but also in some ways overcomes its limitations. As an example, I would want to remind you, we could Would want to remind you, we could have three orders of magnitude stronger electrostriction of crystal made out of heli-noton solitons in these triclinic crystals as compared to anything you could have in a solid-state crystalline world. Thank you for your attention. Thank you very much. I'm just excited that you saw we have time for some questions, although we have to go around. Can you go back to my question? You talked about dynamic, but you talked about the dynamics of the liquid crystals. I'm asking about the dynamics of the particles. So the particle physics models don't have viscosity and they don't have the kind of dynamics we study in liquid crystals. So even though the space So, even though the space of solutions, static solutions, is the same, what can we take away from this to know about the dynamics of, say, particle physics, where you watch nuclei crash into each other? I understand that the static solutions have the same topology. Yeah, sorry, am I supposed to talk on the same topic? Yes, yes. Well, thank you for kind of clarifying your question. You know, let me remind you that what we talk about. Remind you that what we talk about is, you know, things up to topology in many ways, right? So, again, this is the type of object I'm discussing with you about, right? And even that model, that theory, you know, that, for example, people like Paul Sutcliffe work very extensively on recently. On recently, still many particle physicists, nuclear physicists would say does not capture everything you would want to capture, and that you need to use the lattice models in order to capture that physics very precisely. So, even these types of models These types of models describe a lot of behavior, but not everything. Now I have something that mimics it in a different physical system. And of course, I do not expect that a certain aspect from, for example, as an example, this type of model has a prediction of binding energy as a function of baryon number. Right, as a function of baryon number, and it does capture behavior where you go over, you know, like fusion of elementary ones versus fission of higher battery number ones, you know, and then the highest energy in between, as we have also in regular system. That's captured, but the details, you know, you have like 20%, 10% difference in prediction. Difference in predictions versus what they find in experiments. So it's not very precise, right? In a similar way, we can only up to topology recreate this behavior, right, for that particular type of system. And you could see that, you know, I was showing you the I was showing you the examples of fusion and fission. And what's very beautiful is that we also see such behavior that the fusion and fission energies as we change voltage have behavior that mimics that. Well, I cannot say that this is super illuminating for particle physicists, but But coming back to Feynman, who said, I cannot and I do not understand what I cannot recreate. Well, here in some form, I recreated that system, but maybe you, Randy, can do it better. You're welcome. No, I'm sorry, I guess it was a silly question. Okay, oh, I guess there's one question. Thank you. Yes, I just want to check if I understood correctly the big difference, but in between Atali Tugai and Omega students will be correct. So we have deep technologies and our notes are deep technologies. There are four minutes specific notes. Excuse me, can I ask you somehow the voice is double? Ask you somehow, the voice is doubling over Zoom. I don't know why, maybe there are two microphones. If you stop technique, maybe you are a lifestyle with the oh yeah. No, no, it's just uh want to double-check if I understand the big picture in simple terms. So you have defect lines, right? And those defect lines are formed the knots, right? That's pretty much. Right, that's pretty much what you're doing, and then you're applying electric field to recreate fission or fusion in analogy to what happens in nucleus. Yes, correct. But what's more, it's electrofusion, electrofusion. You cannot apply fields to your nucleon and make it undergo. You know, it undergoes fusion or fission just by changing one volt or so. So, this is where our system, in many ways, goes way beyond what you can have or dream about in nuclear physics. You need to have super big facility, as you could see, in order to produce fusion even. And this is still a very big effort currently going on in order to make it as a source of. Order to make it as a source of future energy. Beautiful. And then when you talk about weak electric field, which are medium electric field and strong electric field, what is the approximate voltage or the approximate, you know, yes, voltage per meter that you will be applying? Yeah, it's all under 10 volt. It's all under 10. So there were some other plots where I had voltages. Where I had voltages, you know, in the graphs. Yeah. It's all about one or two volts change, very small voltage change. So in fact, the setting is very similar to that in displays. Currently, you're just switching the uniformly aligned field to some distorted field in your display pixel. One day, we might be switching one note into another in order. Into another in order to display information better or maybe record information or maybe do something crazy. Like, you know, in some other recent work, we demonstrated that we can use knotted vortices to localize light spatially, beams of laser light in particular. Thank you. Thank you very much. So, So thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
