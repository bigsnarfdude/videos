People know to show up. Our speaker this morning is Simeon Philippe, speaking on equivariant currents and heights on the boundary of the ample cone of a K3 surface. All right, so Jason, thanks for the introduction and thanks to the organizers for the opportunity to speak here. So it's my first time speaking in Banff. So I hope I'll have another occasion. I hope they'll have another occasion to speak at banned, but it's still very nice to see everybody. And thank you for coming. So I will talk about joint work with Valentina Tossari. And as the title says, it's about currents and heights on the boundary of the ample cone, so of a K3 surface. So I'll explain what all these words mean. But let me just say that the Uh, let me just say that the pictures that you see here. So, yeah, you can you see my pointer? Yeah, so these pictures, they represent these canonical heights that one can associate to points on K3 surfaces. So, I'll explain in what sense these pictures represent such a height. But before then, I have to introduce a little bit of To introduce a little bit of notation and tell you what kind of setup we're considering. So, first of all, what are K3 surfaces? Well, for this discussion, I'm always going to consider algebraic K3 surfaces. So, it's an algebraic surface over some field. And most often, we're going to consider a number field, but frequently it'll be useful to just consider the complex numbers if we want to look at kind of local properties. The key property. Local properties. The key property of K3 services is that they have a nor vanishing two-form. Another needed condition is that they're either simply connected or some kind of form of vanishing of the H1 homology group. But these two conditions, this existence of an area form or two form that is non-degenerate everywhere, and the simple connectedness time condition or triviality of H1 is. Of H1 is what characterizes K3 surfaces. So the Neuron-Severi group is kind of the key invariant for algebraic surfaces, K3 surfaces, especially since we assume that there's no H1, so there's no Picard group. So the line bundles form some finely generated abelian group. And so I'm going to denote it by n, and rho is going to be the rank of the neurons-vari group. The neuroanseveric group. So, this is just notation, and I'm going to make some simplifying assumptions for this discussion just to kind of put you in the right frame of mind of what kind of objects we're trying to consider. So, I'm going to assume that a row, this rank, is at least three. So, they're fairly, you know, non-well, depending on how you want to look at it, but typically for an Want to look at it, but typically for an algebraic surface, for a generic, for example, quartic surface and P3, this rank is one. So, assuming that rank is at least three, is you know, it's putting some conditions on the family. They're not completely generic K3 surfaces. And I'm also going to assume that the automorphism group of the K3 surface is large, namely, when you map it to the orthogonal group, and I don't know why. Know why this got cut off on keynote, but this row, we have the orthogonal group of the neuron severity group. So let me remind you that the neuron-severi group has rank rho and it has an intersection pairing of signature one, rho minus one. So one positive definite direction and rho minus one negative directions. Sorry, one positive row minus one. Sorry, one positive rho minus one negative. And this is an indefinite orthogonal group, it's non-compact, so we're requiring there to be a lot of automorphisms. So that's kind of this is the kind of case we're interested in. And again, just for simplicity, although since I'm not gonna explain in too much detail any of the proofs, it's convenient to assume that. So for those of you who know, For those of you who know, I'll just assume that. So sometimes these elliptic, these K3 surfaces map to P1. So it's a surface mapping to P1 with fibers of genus 1. And when that happens, I want to assume that the fibers that are not smooth are reduced and irreducible. So this is just some simplifying assumption on the singularities of these vibrations, but it's not again, it's not strictly necessary. Not strictly necessary, but I think it's just easier technically to say it this way so that somebody doesn't ask, and what about that case? I didn't quite catch what the assumption is on the automorphism group. So the automorphism group is some group. It certainly acts on the neuron several group by transformations. This is This is, you know, so the Norent-Verry group is isomorphic to Z to the, well, it's not quite Z, it has, right, it really has a rank rho. So it's isomorphic to Z to the row, but then it has this intersection pairing of signature one rho minus one. So then if I put the real Neurons a variable. Put the real Neuron-Severi group. This is going to be isomorphic to R to the one rho minus one. A space of a real vector space with this indefinite pairing, and it has an orthogonal group. And I'm asking that the map from this group of automorphisms to this orthogonal group gives a lattice. Lattice in the Lie group means that it is cofinite volume. Is cofinite volume, right? Does that mean that okay, thank you, yeah? Okay, any other questions? Okay, so let me give now an example just to have something concrete to keep in mind. And so, we're going to just take some concrete equation. So, here's one specific equation. Maybe I'll make a comment here. Last time I gave a related talk, I managed to pick an equation that wasn't quite generic, and some people point it out. And when I was doing these numerical experiments, trying to generate those pictures, I also somehow managed to pick a K3 surface that wasn't generic. And for a while, the experiments weren't working out. So let me just say that it can be tricky to sometimes. Tricky to sometimes write down a K3 surface that satisfies, to actually prove that it satisfies the kind of assumptions one wants. It is possible, but it is sometimes trickier to show that something is generic than to write it down. So here I wrote this surface in an affined patch. So the equation is to be read in A1 times A1 times A1, but it's homogenized or compactified inside. Homogenized or compactified inside P1 times P1 times P1. So the condition that we had earlier about the existence of an over-vanishing two-form is equivalent to saying that this surface X has trivial canonical bundle. And the reason why it has trivial canonical bundle is because the canonical bundle of this P1 times P1 times P1, as you know, it's so the canonical bundle of P1 is O of minus 2. So you get this tensor product of This tensor product of these canonical bundles, and this surface is kind of a section of given by a section of the anti-canonical. So you can take a residue. So if you were to write a differential form on P1 cross P1 cross P1, a differential three-form, you could write it to have a pole of order one exactly along such a surface. When you take the residue, you get a two-form of Of that's vanishing away on this particular surface. So, this is if you were to want to write down explicitly that form omega. Okay, so the Neuron-Severic group of such a surface has rank three, typically. So, if you would write, if you take some equation that has generic coefficients and it is of by degree two, two, two in each of the variables, then you. Variables, then you would get the surface, then you would get the neuron several group to have rank three. So the reason why it has rank three is because you have in each of the P1 factors, you can pull back one line bundle from each of these P1s, or equivalently, you can cut the surface with a hyperplane in each of the coordinates, and each of them will give you a curve on that surface. And this is the intersection matrix. And this is the intersection matrix of that configuration. If the coefficients are generic, then this is all there is. And finally, I need to tell you what are automorphisms. So I'm going to just write down one of them. So how do you write down such an automorphism, sigma of x? So notice I'm not changing the y and z coordinates. I'm just keeping them the same. I'm only changing the x coordinate. So the way to write x-coordinate. So the way to write down this formula is you look at this equation and you think of it with y and z as constants and x as a variable. So then it's a quadratic equation in x. And for a quadratic equation in x, there are two roots. And the sum of the roots is exactly this coefficient in front of x, normalized by the coefficient in front of x squared. And so if you subtract one of the roots, you obtain the other one. So if you were to plug in this. So, if you were to plug in this expression into this equation and know that the triple XYZ satisfies this equation, you would check that this new triple also satisfies this previous equation. And similarly, you can do transformations for y and z coordinates. Okay, so here's a picture of how this particular surface looks like, and I cut it with a hyperplane. With a hyperplane of constant x, and you get a curve in P1 cross P1 of by degree 2, 2. And that you can check is an elliptic curve because it maps with degree 2 to P1 when it will have four ramification points. So this blue curve here that you see, this is going to be an elliptic curve. And as this plane moves, you're going to have a vibration of your surface by elliptic curves. Curves and generically, there will be 24 singular fibers. All right, so this is kind of just as an example. Now, the key object that kind of appears in many of the theorems, and I need to explain this, so is an in fact I need to convince you that these three automorphisms generate a lattice. So in order to do that, so In order to do that, so let me draw a picture. So, this is the Neuron-Severi group. This is the class of vectors. So, these are the isotropic vectors, namely V such that V cross V is equal to zero. And strictly speaking, there's another, oh, sorry, so it's a little bit faster than I want. So, there's another colon. Faster than I want. So there's another cone on this side, but there's a distinguished cone, distinguished connected component of this cone given by the classes that are represented by ample line bundles. So here you could normalize this to be ample classes. Let me call them LA, such that LA times LA is equal to 1. So you can normalize it. one so you can normalize it to have self-intersection one and then you get the hyperbolic plane so let me draw this picture again this is this hyperboloid i drew it as a hyperbolic plane and you have three classes on the boundary corresponding to the three fibrations so by cutting by kind of sweeping out your surface by these planes By these planes, you get a family of elliptic curves on your surface. These curves have a self-intersection zero because you can move them off themselves. So you get one for each component, for each coordinate. And if you are to draw the action of these involutions, so actually what I didn't say. Actually, what I didn't say, and I apologize, let me go back one step. These transformations are involutions. If I apply it twice, I get back the same thing. Because you can check, I mean, this is some constant, I subtract x. If I do it twice, I get back x. So there are certain evolutions. And these involutions act as reflections in these hyperbolic geodesics that. That connect these three elliptic curves, classes on the boundary, and together they generate a group which is a lattice because this fundamental domain, this triangle, has finite hyperbolic area. Okay, so this is one example of the situation in which our Theorems will apply. Let me make the following remarks. So, this is, so I told you what the ample cone is. So, because of the assumptions that I made on the K3 surface, the ample cone in this case is all of this thing here. So, the interior of all of these, you know, all the classes that, so the ample cone is going to be all the V such that V times V. Such that v times v is bigger than zero, and you take one connected component, the one that corresponds to the ample classes. In this case, I'm just drawing it as the upwards one. And the boundary, these isotropic vectors, I'm denoting it by this. And for the main theorems, we'll need to work with a space which is slightly larger, and I denoted it by this. And I denoted it by this kind of notation, some decorations, and it will be explained. So I will explain a little bit what this space means. But let me just say that for the main theorems, you need the variation on this boundary. You need some different kind of object, slightly bigger. Okay, but for the time being, at least for this particular example, you can actually think these two objects are the same. So you can just think when I write the boundary of the ample concept. When I write the boundary of the ample cone, you can think of this null cone in this vector space of signature 1,2. Okay. Questions so far? No. All right, so I can now move on to the main theorems. So there are two theorems. One is kind of just the Archimedean incarnation of the other, although they're not quite kind of completely equivalent. So the theorem about currents is the So, the theorem about currents is the following. So, this says the following: there exists a unique map from this boundary of the ample colon, so if we get these declarations, to a closed positive 1,1 current on X, which is characterized by the following properties. So it is equivariant, meaning that you have an action of the automorphism group on the left and on the right, and this map. right and this map is equivariant so if you apply the automorphism group to an automorphism to an ample boundary of to an ample to a class on the boundary of the ample cone it's the same as mapping the the class by this boundary map eta and then applying the automorphism to that current close positive current this map is continuous if you put the weak topology of currents or you can also put c0 topology on C0 topology on potentials. And these currents that you get here, they have continuous potentials. So this is a kind of complex geometric statement. It has a kind of more arithmetic dynamics version, which is if you think of the complex numbers as kind of just one of the places, then you could try to imagine that there's such a theorem at all the other places. At all the other places. I'm not going to. So, we didn't prove a theorem that would be the analog at the P-adic places of this complex analytic statement, but there is a global statement, which is that there exists a unique map, again, from the same source, so this boundary of the ample cone, to heights, height functions on x, so heights and the usual kind of height, which is again characterized by the following properties. Again, characterized by the following properties. So it is equivariant. It agrees. So let me make one remark about canonical heights on K3 surfaces. So Silverman constructed for hyperbolic automorphisms. He constructed canonical heights again on the boundary, but for homology classes that are expanded or contracted by these automorphisms. So if you go back To this picture that I had. You know, I mean, sorry, I'll go back because I'm going to have to flash through all these slides. But if you have a hyperbolic automorphism, it will have a geodesic that it translates along, and this will correspond to classes on the boundary that are being explained. Classes on the boundary that are being expanded and contracted. And so Silverman constructed in kind of analogy with this neuron date height for abelian varieties, he constructed canonical heights for these specific boundary classes. And what we can do is we can extend this kind of construction of Silverman of these canonical heights so that you have such a canonical height representative for every class on the High representative for every class on the boundary. And furthermore, if you fix a point in a Q bar point of X, then as you vary the class, so you can kind of try to scan the height of this point for different points on the boundary. And this is going to be a continuous function in alpha. And it's going to be homogeneous. So if you scale the height, if you Height, if you scale the class, then you scale the height. So it's a homogeneous function on this cone of homogeneity one for every point, and it's some continuous function. All right. Does this all make sense? Any questions? Yeah? We have a question from Serge Canta. There is a natural section on the interior of the ample cone given by Ricci flat metrics. Is there a way to glue this with your construction at the boundary? So, in general, Uh so in in general the the answer is uh kind of no. Uh I think uh so I'll I'll explain where the well it's it's uh no in the most general form. I think in probably in some situations it is possible, but it's not uh basically um uh yes, so there there's okay there's some some way to glue the uh these objects together and obtain uh Together and obtain a map from the whole ample cone, kind of the not just the boundary, but also have an equivariant map like this from the interior. But on the interior, it's not going to be canonical in any way that I can think of. So it is possible to use the Ricci-flat metrics, which are kind of canonical representatives for metrics. So if you restrict to this hyperboloid or just the interior, you could use these metrics that come from differential geometry. These metrics that come from differential geometry. And I think that they have better properties. And in fact, maybe a little bit later, I'll comment on if somebody reminds me, I'll try to comment why this is a natural thing. We try to do this, but ultimately, somehow it doesn't work out as neatly. And ultimately, whether it's Richie Flatmatrics or any other metrics, it kind of doesn't matter for this construction. So I'll try to. I'll try to, if Serger, you remind me, I'll try to comment on this a little bit later to kind of explain where the obstruction or the difficulty kind of comes from. Right. Are there any other questions? Yeah. So Yosuki Matsuzawa has a question. Do these canonical heights have Northcote property? So I let me see. So I I don't think so in an obvious way. I need to think for a second because they're not ample. So I don't think silvermans have the North Cot property, if I remember correctly. So if you fix one of these heights, I'm not sure that they. So if I interpret this question as if you fix one of these heights, one specific height like this, then does it have the North Carolin property? Uh, does it have the North Cut property? And I think the answer is no because I don't think Silverman's canonical height for a single such class has this property, but I could be wrong. Yeah, but I think the periodic points over a fixed number field they're fine finer than many, no? Or fixed number fields? Yeah, all right, so um So let me say a few words. So I can finally explain to you what the pictures are, these pictures. So if you fix a point and you take a K3 surface on this boundary, so remember we had this boundary, what you can do, now you have this function and you can just project it. That's why some of these pictures look a little squished. Look a little squished, and you can project it. And you can consider the region, so there's some jagged curve here, the region where that specific point has height one. So let me note that kind of the reason why sometimes this picture looks very jagged is because if the point has very small height for one of these heights, then the place where it has height one is very far away. And so, but you can still kind of you have. But you can still kind of, you have this curve of points where the of classes where the specific point has height one, and you can project it, and this is what you get. This is the blue curve here. The red curve, this was, it's kind of what happens if you were to cut this cone basically at Basically, at kind of chop it off like this, just cut it and project. So I did that. But actually, the points plotted here, the way this kind of simulation is done, they actually, you start with an apple class, you apply some sequence of automorphisms, and you normalize. And these are actually obtained, these are not actually points on the boundary, but they're extremely close to the boundary that you can't really distinguish. Once you normalize, they're extremely close. Okay? Yeah, so actually, I see. Yeah, the search says that you can have the NorthCode property if you sum two of the heights. That's right, because then you get a representative in an ample class, and that will have the NorthCut property. Okay. Are there any other questions or comments? Sorry, I have a quick question. For these pictures, these were for these four images were for four different. These four images were for four different examples. I didn't catch what these images were supposed to be. Yeah, yeah. So they're different points on different surfaces. Or it's possible that it's the same point, but on different surfaces in the sense that I didn't change the coordinates, but I just changed other parameters. But yeah, they're different surfaces and different points in some sense. Okay, thanks. Okay, so now let me kind of try to explain a little bit what the issue with. Explain a little bit what the issue with elliptic vibrations is. And so, I'm going to make, as I said, this assumption that singular fibers are reduced and irreducible. And then there's the following theorem of Silverman and Tate. So they prove the following. So suppose quite generally, X doesn't have to be a K3 surface. It's fibered over base B, fibers have genus 1, and everything is over some base number field. Then silverman and H. Then Silverman and Tate showed the following. That, oh, so let me make one remark. I'm assuming the fibers have genus one, but I'm not assuming that there's a section, so I don't fix a section. And so Silmar and T are the following, that if you take two sections and you think of one of them as the origin, and then so that's your base point, and then sigma one is an actual point of this elliptic curve over this of the function field of b. Over this, the function field of b then you have a map on the k-bar point on the q-bar points of b, which does the following: you take a point on the base, now you get an elliptic curve, xb. So it's really an elliptic curve because it's the fiber of genus 1, and you use the base point, sigma 0, as your reference point, as your origin. So then you have a canonical neuron tate height, and you can evaluate that neuron tate height at sigma 1 of b. At sigma one of B. Sigma one is the other section. So you have, here's your elliptic vibration, here's sigma zero, or maybe let me draw it like this, and then you have sigma one. And you do what I was saying, you view sigma zero as your origin. View sigma zero as your origin. So maybe in order to do that, I'll just put it at infinity. And you think of sigma one as your section, and you measure the heights, the canonical heights of these points on the red curve. On each fiber, you use this point at infinity, and you have this canonical height. And so Vernette proved that this is a height function on the base B, and they specify which homology class, which line bundle, sorry, which line bundle is associated. Bundle is associated to that height function and is given by what I wrote here. So, this is Silverman and Tate's theorem. We need a slight variation on this where we so the way it was always stated by them, at least as far as I could find in the literature, it's always you always start with an elliptic surface, namely you always fix a section and everything is stated relative to that section. We need a slight variation on this theorem where basically we have to Where basically we have to forget that there was a section. Our elliptic vibrations, our genus one vibrations might not have any section at all. However, they have automorphisms. So if you think about it, if you go back to the picture that I had earlier of this, oops, sorry, let me try to draw some. So this was our K3 surface. Then Then the automorphism is that if I compose only two of those involutions, I would get twists along this elliptic vibration. And I have a non-trivial automorphism, even though I don't have a priori any section. In fact, for an elliptic surface, elliptic K3 surface, if you have the section, it would have to be something that's called a minus two curve. And at least for this discussion, I'm assuming that there are no minus two curves. So you can have automorphisms even. You can have automorphisms even if you don't have points, if you don't have sections. And that has to do with the fact that if you have an elliptic, a genus one vibration, you can always take a Jacobian vibration. And so that's a different elliptic surface, but the points and the sections of that other elliptic surface are the same as the automorphisms of the original one. The automorphisms of the original one. And then there's a pairing where you have some relative Picard group, which I'm not going to define here for just for simplicity, but which so you get a pairing that goes to heights. And in fact, you can also compute that what it does on what the Picard group is. So in other words, you can kind of get rid of this data and observe that somehow you can associate these, so these high. So, these height functions Silverman calls the variation of canonical height, and they really depend to some extent only on the difference of these two sections as an automorphism, not on the sections themselves. So, there's a way to kind of rephrase all of that story using automorphisms instead of sections. So, you can work on elliptic surfaces without a section, or rather, genus one surfaces without vibrations without a section. Okay. Okay, other questions? No. All right. So, the kind of technical thing that we need and which is useful, I think it could be useful for other things, is a notion of, so we're calling it preferred heights on elliptic vibrations. So, the reason I'm saying they're preferred, they're not canonical, is because they're not quite unique. They're not uniquely determined, but they're uniquely determined up to. But they're uniquely determined up to certain constants, and but they have some nice properties. And it says the following: so again, we have our elliptic vibration, and I take a line bundle L0 on the whole surface X. So this is B receiving a map from X, and I take a line bundle. And I take a line bundle of relative degree zero. So I'm assuming that if I restrict it to any of the, let's say, smooth fibers, I have a degree zero line bundle. So that's an assumption. And in particular, it's definitely not an ample line bundle. Then I claim that there exists a height function in this, on all of x. So it's a height function on x. This is kind of the important part, in the class of L0, so associated with line bundle L0. So, associated line bundle is zero, and it's this preferred height and has the following property. If you restrict it to any fiber, so for any b, you restrict it to the fiber xb, then you get a height function on that fiber, and this height function is going to be a fine for the group law on the q bar points of that fiber. So, let me uh remark that uh Let me remark that this is so the fiber doesn't have a reference point, but there's certainly kind of an affine structure. You know what's the difference of two points? That's an element of some group. And I mean that if you kind of you know what I mean here. Alice, if you don't, I can try to explain. But I think you know what's in the fine structure on this, the point of a genus one. The point of a genus one curve. And let me kind of remark the following: that if we were to take an arbitrary height function on in this represent give associated to line bundle L0, then if I restrict it to any fiber, this high function is going to be a bounded distance away from the canonical height associated to that fiber. But, and if I fix it, I have to also fix a reference base point to speak about the canonical height. But the constants that they differ by can change with the base point B. And so what we're making, stating here is that there's a uniform way to compare, to choose these high functions so that independently of the base point, they give you these nice high functions. Let me note that this is definitely not true if I took L instead of. Took L instead of L0 if I took an ample line bundle. So if this were true, certainly the statement of silver minute would follow very easily, but also it's not a true statement that if you take an ample line bundle, you can make this, you can choose a representative of the height function, which is quadratic. So if you have a ample line bundle, you have to take a quadratic function on the pick a quadratic function on these fibers. So you cannot choose that quadratic function uniformly across all fibers. And as I said, this is kind of the global kind of height statement. There's also an Archimedean version. And this is kind of closer in spirit to something in the Archimedean situation, is known as the Berry form. So suppose you have a smooth closed 1,1 form. I forgot to state that. That's 1,1. 1, 1, then, and assume that it integrates to zero on the fibers. So, since this is closed, this is a homological condition, which is just assuming what I wrote here, that the line bundle has degree zero. Then the claims that you can modify your 1,1 form by a continuous potential globally, continuous globally on X. This is the key point. On every smooth fiber, this is. On every smooth fiber, this is not really a problem, but you can modify globally your 1,1 form by continuous potential such that if you consider your new 1,1 form, omega plus ddc phi, when you restrict it to every fiber, you get identically zero. So note, this is not stating that this form is zero, it's just saying that it's zero in the fiber directions. So in particular, so let me just remark that, you know, why am I saying this is kind of similar to the Berry form? This is kind of similar to the Betty form. The Betty form would be the case when omega would integrate, let's say, to one or some positive constant, and then you would get a representative which is flat on the fibers. But those representatives, once you move in the fibers, when you approach the singular fibers, those representatives do not extend to the whole surface. All right. So so these are kind of the kind of tools that Of tools that go to the proof of the previous theorems, and that I think might be useful for other applications. Okay, so let me say a few words about the proof. So the proofs, as I said, they're kind of, as it says here, they're kind of pedestrian in the sense that you kind of just take automorphisms, you apply, you ask the automorphisms, you estimate, you kind of put together these estimates, and I try to be careful about the cusps. And it's somewhat inelegant, and it's natural. We thought, and in fact, initially, we thought that maybe there's a more elegant way to do this. And the answer is that yes and no. There is kind of an object which makes this. Yeah, so Laura is maybe half a slide ahead. So the reason why we cannot do better is that exactly because of this decoration. Is that exactly because of this decorated or more complicated ample boundary of the amplicone? So, yeah, so this is the reason why we can't do kind of a very elegant, I mean, a more conceptual proof is because of this ample cone and its blown-up boundary. So, what you have to do is do the following. So, you have the ample cone, let me draw it, and it's boundary, and you have to bound it. Boundary, and you have these rays, you have the rational rays in the sample. Oops, let me try to use maybe green. So you have these rational rays. I mean, they're dense, but you can order them by height, let's say, of the generating vector. And there's kind of a projective limit of blow-ups where you blow up the ample cone along these lines, the rational rays. The rational rays. And when you blow it up in this particular case, so the picture that I drew here, where you have the rank is just three, blowing up a line on a two-dimensional surface, you know, doesn't do anything. So really, this decorated boundary and the usual boundary are the same thing. But in higher dimensions, so once your Picard rank is higher, this blow-up does do something. Does do something. And what you have to do is so you have to put in these rational arrays, you have to put in Silverman's, so these variations of canonical height that I mentioned on the previous slide. So let me try to explain a little bit what the issue kind of is. So if you have your elliptic vibration, suppose you have two automorphisms. So you have, let me call them gamma one. We call them gamma one and gamma two. They're two commuting automorphisms of this elliptic vibration. So they commute or the identity really groups. So you can imagine doing something like this. So you start with a point and you apply gamma one, you know, n times where n is large, and you normalize by, divide the height by n squared. So that will converge to Silverman's canonical height. Silverman's canonical height, variation of canonical height associated to this sigma one. Now, if you do the same thing for sigma two, this will converge to Silverman's variation of canonical height associated to this other, sorry, not sigma two, but gamma two, the automorphism. And these two canonical heights are in general different. And, you know, and then you can also imagine applying some combination. Let's say you apply gamma one once and gamma two three times, and then you take 2 three times, and then you take this new automorphism and you apply it n times divide by n squared. This will converge yet to another limit. So each of these limits have to be put in. And so that's why it doesn't work so simply. And let's see. Right. And so to go back to Serious question, from the Ricci-Flat metrics, you would also have a candidate. Metrics, you would also have a candidate for what to put. So, optimistically, you would think that you don't need this boundary, this blown-up boundary, but from Richie flat metrics, you also know that as your Reachy-flat metric degenerates, you also have a semi-flat metric on this base B. So, there's this collapse of elliptic vibrations that happens, and people have studied a lot. And you do get a canonical class on the boundary, but it doesn't. On the boundary, but it doesn't glue in nicely with the other degenerations of the Richie-Fat metrics. So, I don't know if this answers Sergei's question, but that's why you can't kind of glue in general in high rank, you can't glue in these Richie flat metrics in a continuous way because as you approach the boundary in different directions, you get different limits. Yeah, good answer. So, I think. So I heard something very faintly, but I think Serge was happy or satisfied with this answer. Okay, so let me say then, so this I said why no, let me say why yes, why can we try to do a little bit better, is to do the following construction. So this is a construction that's quite standard in dynamics. And what you can do is the following. So you go back to the neuron-severi group and you Severi group, and you take the orthogonal group associated to this. Remember, this is SO1 rho minus one. Gamma is a lattice, and you can do the following. If you take the quotient g mod gamma, this is a homogeneous space. But now you can also take the product with x, where x is your K3 surface, and you take the diagonal action here, your quotient by the diagonal action. And I call this space curly X. Space curliex. And basically, if you're familiar, for example, with the procedure from going from a representation of the fundamental group to a local system on the space, this is the same thing. But instead of having a local system of vector spaces, you have a local system of x's of your fixed surface x. And now you have an action of the group G, it's a big group G, it acts both. Group G, it acts both here on this base, on this homogeneous space, and it acts also by kind of parallel transport along the fibers of this fibration. And you can restate most statements about the action of the group of automorphisms on X in terms of the action of group G or its subgroups on this curly space X. So So, the reason why some of the other theorems I didn't state in terms of this space curly X is because exactly of this issue with this decorated ample cone, because some of the systems that you would want to say are uniformly hyperbolic or have some kind of nice properties. It's actually not true because you have to consider some of this kind of more complicated boundary and so. And so, what do I mean when I say that studying the action of the automorphism group on X is the same as studying the action of G, the Lie group on curly X. For example, understanding the dynamics of G on curly X is the same as understanding the dynamics of the full group of automorphisms on the space X. So, for example, invariant measures or orbit closures or You know, orbit closures or any that kind of stuff, you can kind of pass back and forth between these two objects. So, this is done by Serge and Lan Wang also had some kind of early contributions to this, kind of set up trying to classify what are the invariant measures and invariant sets for these action closed invariant sets. Now, more recently, if you consider the action. If you consider the action of P a parabolic subgroup, so it's a Lie group, a semi-simple Lie group has a parabolic subgroup. Basically, Serge and Romain, this is what they've been doing in a kind of different language, studying the dynamics of random walks for the group gamma on this surface X for the group of automorphisms is essentially the same as studying the dynamics of the parabolic subgroup P on this. A suspended curly space X. And so let me now say, for example, what's one consequence of the previous constructions for this space Curly X. So if you take the geodesic flow, so remember we had the hydrobolic manifold of finite volume, which we obtained by taking the region where the amplicon has volume one. So this is omega squared. This is omega squared equals one. So if you quotient by the automorphism group, you get a finite volume hyperbolic manifold and you have the geodesic flow in it. Then every time you have an invariant measure on that base manifold, this is your hyperbolic manifold, if you have a GT invariant measure for the geodesic flow on this. The geodesic flow on this manifold, which is something from homogeneous dynamics, using these currents that you have on the boundary, you can lift and construct a measure on the space curly x, which will have relative entropy one. So for instance, two examples, if you take a closed geodesic that corresponds to a hyperbolic automorphism of your surface, and if you apply this construction, you'll get the measure of maximal entropy. You'll get the measure of maximal entropy for this hyperbolic automorphism. You can also take the Haar measure on this homogeneous space, the unit tangent bundle of the surface. Unfortunately, these don't propagate through slides. So this is the surface. So if you take a closed geodesic on the surface, this corresponds to the measure maximum entropy for a single automorphism. If you take hard measure, you get kind of If you take hard measure, you get kind of the measure of the most maximum entropy in this kind of system. Okay, you can also, for example, construct invariants of orbits of the automorphism group acting on the Q-bar points. For example, the volume of this set, the hard measure, I mean the area in this case, of this set contained in the blue curve, that's invariant by the. Blue curve, and that's invariant by the automorphism of gamma. And so that's an invariant of the orbit of the rational point. And if you are familiar with Silverman's work, where there's a kind of an expanding and contracting direction, a single hyperbolic automorphism, then Silverman observed that if you take the product of those two heights, that that product is invariant by the application of the automorphism. By the application of the automorphism, and that is an invariant of the warp bit itself. So you can compute it on any point on the warp bit. Okay, so let me end with a couple of questions. One is, I think maybe this is the most interesting kind of question about this spaces: what happens for unipod and subgroups? Than subgroups. So in homogeneous dynamics, there's kind of a big difference between that, depending on what subgroup you consider, you have different behavior for the dynamics. And as I said earlier, so a lot is known about the dynamics of the foo group G. A lot is being now learned about the dynamics of the parabolic subgroup. And I think what What would be interesting and useful to know is to understand what happens for unipotent subgroups. So, I think this would be quite challenging, but also potentially very useful. I should also note that I think considering unipotent subgroups is not something that I know how to restate using just the group of automorphisms. So it's kind of something that really needs to use the homogeneous structure, at least as far as I can tell. Maybe there's some way to formulate the question about what are your invariant. The question about what are your invariant measures in terms of the group of automorphisms alone. There are some ways to do it, but I think they're kind of slightly not entirely accurate. I mean, they're more involved. They're not short. Another question is whether one can use, for example, these homogeneous dynamics techniques to count points in orbits of the automorphism group if you order them by height to get precise counts and maybe with error terms. Precise counts and maybe with error terms for these kinds of things. And I think there are many, many other questions. I think on Friday, most likely, Serge will talk about some related questions that can be interpreted in terms of these objects. So I'll stop here. Thanks. Are there any questions? If you want, you can unmute yourself and ask. I had a special question. Yes. I was just wondering how rare these K3 services are. Are there only countably many of them? Or I assume there are no moduli of such K3 services, right? Well, if you depend, I mean, of course I mean, over Q, there's only are only countably many. But for example, in the picture that I had earlier, any equation of by degree 2 to 2, so I take the variables x, y, and z, and I allow any generic monomials where the degrees of x, y, and z do not go above 2, and that will satisfy it. So I can't tell exactly the dimension, it's either 19 or 16. The dimension, it's either 19 or 16 or some number. They are more like, okay, good, thank you. Yeah, yeah, they're very, yeah, thank you. Thank you. Are there other questions? Yes, I have a question. At some point, you made a comment. When you don't have sections, you view the difference of two sections as related to an automorphism. I didn't catch what you said there. Yeah, so what I was saying, So, what I was saying is really something like this. In general, you don't have, even if you don't have sections, no, let me go back. If you have a section, the group of automorphisms is the same as the group of sections. Because you have a reference section, and every time you apply an automorphism that acts on the fibers, that gives you a new section. So, if you have a section, there's a then If you have a section, there's an identification between the group of sections and the group of automorphisms. If you don't have a section, well, yeah, Serge is kind of twisting his head. You need to say a few things about singular fibers, but that's why I was working in that simplified setting. But if you don't have a section, you still have the group of automorphisms, and the group of automorphisms can be non-trivial even if you don't have a section. So an example would be these two-to-two surfaces where An example would be these two-to-two surfaces where you have a parabolic automorphism, you apply two of these involutions, and they twist in the direction of the fibers, but in general, you don't have a section. I see, thank you. Are there other questions? Maybe someone else has another question. Feel free. I think Serge. Serge, I see you saying something, but I can't hear you. Okay, I write it. Oh, no, no. Okay, I write it. Oh, no, no, now I can do it. Okay, so you can listen to me. Okay, thanks. Can you state your result when there is no elliptic vibration? Right. But assuming still that there is a lattice of automorphisms? Yeah, so then I think you can use the usual. So if the action is co-compact, then you can use the regular ample. You can use the regular ample cone, the boundary of the ample cone. Okay, I'm just saying that because you didn't say it, and I think it's interesting for people to know that. Yeah, so one thing that I don't know is are there any good examples where, because once your Picard rank is high enough, you start having, let me see if I can quite jump. So is there a class of examples where you have a co-compact group of automorphisms that's not kind of exactly Kumer? Yeah? Yes, I think so. Yeah, because in those examples, I mean, imagine erbodicity is a little bit harder, but this kind of stuff is easier. And the second question I had is, can you do the same thing for some examples on rational surfaces? On rational surfaces? Would you try? Yeah, so we haven't thought about the rational surface case so much, but there somehow, I mean, I don't know how large the group of automorphisms are, but I imagine that the kind of limit set the so is probably much smaller. So, so the I'm guessing, I don't know exactly. Sorry, you have examples with a very large limit set and examples. Very large limit set and examples with very small limit sets. But can you get the limit set to be the full boundary of the ample column? That seems like yes, there are examples which are closely related to K3 surfaces, the so-called cobalt surfaces. I guess you can do the same for these examples, but maybe it's too close to K3 surfaces. Yeah, but if you have a lattice where I mean, I think you can say something about. I mean, I think you can say something about points in the limit set. I think that is reasonable to do. I think in most cases. Are there other questions? We still have some time or not. If we don't, let's unmute again and thank Simeon once more for very next time. Very next topic. And I'll point out that we have Dragos speaking at noon. This is Burr's time, probably not your time. And probably this room will stay open, I hope, but there's also two breakout rooms. I'll put it in the chat for the breakout rooms. And we have a coffee break. Um and we have a coffee break and in three minutes. So if you want to come there, you can but you can stay here as well. So thank you.
