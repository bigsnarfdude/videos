So, today I'm going to talk about the Meromorphic solutions of the autonomous Watson differential equation. So, this talk is based on joint work with Professor Liao from Nanjing University and Zhang and Zhao from China University of Mining and Technology. So, let me start with some background and motivation of our research. Research. So the celebrated result by Melchis said that if this differential equation where R is rational in two variables, it means a non-rational Meromorphic solution, then R is a polynomial. And moreover, the degree of R is at most true. In other words, it's either a linear differential equation or a recurring differential equation, whenever it has a Whenever it has a concidential Meromorphic solution, and later, with the birth of Navalina theory, Yoseda found that a proof of Melke's result can be simplified significantly. And here, Navalina theory is a very deep theory in complex analysis and can be viewed as a qualitative generalization of Little Kita theorem. Generalization of Little Kita theorem. Okay. And so a further analysis shows that their work can be easily generalized to the case when on the left-hand side, we have the derivative of y to the power of n, where n can be any integer. In this case, if it has a Meromorphic, non-rational Meromorphic solution, then on the right-hand side, R should be a polynomial in Y, the degree. The degree I found it from above by two times n. So this is a most general case. And later, it has been proved that by damage that the results by Melquist and Laucida can be further refined. And we prove the following. Okay, so in this case, actually, after mobile transformation. Is actually after mobile transformation, there are only six canonical forms which are given as follows, okay, which are listed here. And here, all the A, B, and C are rational functions, and all the tau days are complex constants. So, in other words, if a differential equation has a transcendental meromotic solution, then we only need to study this six. We only need to study these six cases. Here, transcendental in the context of Meromorphic functions, rational is equivalent to non-rational, sorry, is equivalent to transcendental. And later, Fenck and Kaufman give a different proof and moreover they obtained a much more precise growth estimate on the Meromorphic solutions of the equation two. Okay, so this is a brief introduction about the MELPIS type result. And following this line, later there are many generalizations of these results from various viewpoints. So next, I will talk about three of them. Okay. So the first one is the generalization to the second order OD. And this conjecture says that. And this conjecture said that if equation three were on the left-hand side, again, we have a rational function in three variables, if it has a transcendental Meromorphic solution or a non-rational Meromorphic solution, then the convector said that it should reduce to this point, equation four, where on the right-hand side, it should be a polynomial of degree two in F prime. So in general, this conjecture remains open, and there are only some partial results. And there are only some partial results, which, for instance, it was proved by Liao, Zu, and Yang that this convector is true if it possesses a Meromorphic solution of infinite order. This is the generalization from the viewpoint of the order of derivative. And the second generalization is from the viewpoint of discretization. So then it's very natural to study equation five, where this is a first-order difference equation, right? And again, on the right-hand side, we have a reactional function in two variables. And the first two results on this equation were due to Yanagi Hara. And for the simplest case, namely, when n is equal to one, if it has a finite order. If it has a finite order Meromorphic solution, then the degree R should be one. And if you consider the general case, namely when smaller can be any positive integer, and also we assume that R is independent of C, namely the autonomous case. And again, we also assume that after the finite order, then there are only essentially two cases which admit transcendental Meromorphic distributions. Meromorphic field and specialist here. Okay. And as for the most general case, it was completely solved by Cofonen and Zhang recently. And actually, their results consist of two papers. In the first paper, they were dealing with the case when the degree of R is equal to N, where N is the given on the left-hand side. And in the case of The degree is not equal to n. Okay, the five equation file can be reduced to one of 16 canonical types. So, totally, there are 28 canonical types of differential equations which admit transcendental Meromorphic solutions. So, consider with the continuous ones, where we only have six canonical types. Here we have much more. And as for this, And as for this generalization of the second-order differential equation, I think one of the first results is as follows. It was proved by Abelowitz, Halbert, and Herb. And they proved that if equation six, again, on the left-hand side, we have second-order display its pretitiation. On the right-hand side, again, it's a rational function of two variables. So if it was meets a So, if it was meets a finite order Meromorphic solution, then the degree of R can only be two. This is the first Melko step without the discrete second order difference equations. And later, the general case was proved by Halber and Cochonen. They have shown that the only cases is that The only cases is that either F satisfies a different Switchati equation or it belongs to one of canonical types. And here are the list of these eight types of equations. Okay, so this is the second generalization from the viewpoint of discretization. So next, I would like to show you the third one. Viewpoint is a little bit special in the sense that, so remember that for the Malchis result on the left-hand side, we have the derivative of Y to the power of n, right? So in this case, Ishizaki, I think it was first proposed by Ishizaki. Sorry, I didn't show the reference. The reference will be shown later. I should put it here, but sorry for the mistake. Sorry for the mistake. Anyway, this was first proposed by Ishizaki and he replaced the ordinary derivative by the Swassen derivative. Of course, the reason that this derivative has many interesting properties. And again, we can ask similar questions. So when does equation selling process a transcendental Meromorphic solution? Okay. And for the simplest And for the simplest case, namely when p is equal to one and p here refers to the degree on the left-hand side, when p is equal to one, it proves that there are essentially four cases. The first one is that it satisfies a Ricardi differential equation. The second case is that it may satisfy a differential equation which is degree two in F5. Okay, the third one and the fourth one I follows. So, this is for the simplest given p is equal to one. But when p is higher than one, bigger than one, in general, this remains open. But if we consider another special case, namely when the differential equation is autonomous, in other words, the sorry, let me go back. Namely, when R is independent of Z. When R is independent of Z. When it's independent of Z. In this case, there are a complete classification. And similar to the Melchised list, there are also six canonical types, again, up to certain Mobile transformation. Okay. And here is a list of them. So when I first met this differential equation, a natural question arrived is immediately to me. Alright, this immediately to me. Okay, I think they look very symmetric. And so I was wondering whether it's possible to solve them completely. I mean, to find all the differential transcendental Meromorphic solution explicitly. And it turns out that eventually, after several years' work, we completely solved this problem, which consists of two papers. Okay. So, summarizing these two papers, the result is very These two papers, the result is very, it can be stated as follows. So, all transcendental Meromorphic solutions of this autonomous differential equation can be constructed explicitly. And the reason why we published two papers as follows. For the first one, we can find almost all of them except the right one, the right one. For the other five cases, we can solve them completely. But for the right one, because the solution structure is quite different from the other, so Is quite different from the other. So, our work, our idea does not work for this one. However, if we make if we add some assumption, namely, we assume that the solution has at least equal exceptional value. And in this case, we can use other methods, so-called rescuing technique to solve it, but only under the condition that it has a Pico-exceptional value. And two years later, after we published, although it's years later after we published although it was published in 2002 actually we finished this product uh maybe in 2000 at the end of 2010 uh 2020 sorry and after two years we uh find another idea to deal with the remaining case okay namely uh whether or not the solution must help because it's that accepting value and eventually we prove this without this is our uh recent work we have shown Uh, recent work, we have shown that for this uh equation, every transcendental Meromorphic theory should have at least one Pica accepting value on its complex plane. Although it looks very, very simple, its proof is highly non-trivial, and the techniques we use is completely different from the first one. It's mainly makes use of we mainly prove it by contradiction, but the computation and argument are quite involved. Are quite involved. And since the probe has nothing to do with background remote from theory, so it's better for me not to bother too much. So instead, I just show you a table of our results. So in the first column, we listed all the canonical types of Swartzen differential equation. And the second column are the corresponding solutions. And the last one are the And the last one are the constraints of the parameter values. And you can see from the second column that the first four equations, the first four solutions are elliptic functions, which can be expressed in terms of the wave source p function. Okay. Okay, so this is the whole story about the transcendental or non-rational Meromorphic solution. Follow-up question then. Solution. The follow-up question is that what about the rational solutions, right? And here we only studied non-rational solutions. And motivated by this, we also considered the rational case. But it turns out that the classification results due to Ishizaki does not hold for the rational case. For example, we can be easily checked that this function satisfies the Swarsian differential equation as u equals u. equation S U equals U and it can be easily seen that this equation can be cannot be transformed into any of the six canonical types where modulus transformations and also eventually we I found that for the rational case there are only two canonical types two canonical types and the first line is given by equation 2 equation 17 on the left hand side we have the slots and derivative to the power of t and T and we have also solved its solution. So the second form is given by equation 18. But right now we are not able to find its rational solution. But our guess is that it has no rational solutions. But at this moment, we are not able to prove it. And we are still working on this problem and hope that we can finish this part before. Part before the next workshop. So that I can report it to you. Okay, so this is our work on the Swartzian differential equation. So now let's come back to the, again, to this table. Remember that we have six canonical types, and for four of them, the solutions are elliptic functions. So in other words, elliptic functions play a very important role in the study of in the construction. In the construction of meromotic solutions. And this, indeed, is not only for this case, it also is also the case for many other differential equations. So next, I'm going to show two of them. Okay. The first one can be traced back to one century hemika for local. So Bruy and Bouquet prove that if the every Meromorphic solution of the equation 19 where P is polynomial. 19, where P is polynomial in two variables belongs to class W. And here, class W refers to elliptic functions and their degenerations, because we know that elliptic functions have two periods. And if we can let one or two of them tend to infinity, then it will degenerate to other if it will degenerate to some elementary functions. Here, class W, W is chosen like Will Strass, and he proved that. Like Wilshart, he proved that these are the only Meromorphic functions satisfying an algebraic addition theorem, where Q is a non-zero polynomial in three variables. And for the higher order cases, namely we have a polynomial again in two variables. And here we replace the derivative of y by the case derivative of y. Okay. And actually for the second order case, it was proved by Picard. Was approved by Picard in 1880. But it was very unfortunate that Picard's result was forgotten in some sense. And some people listed this as an open problem, even in some very standard textbooks. Okay, this was very interesting. And so this led to another proof due to bank and government in 1981. After this paper was published, I think. This paper was published, and I think some experts immediately realized that told them that their proved this much longer ago, even more than 100 years ago. This is for the second order case. And for the higher order case, namely when the case bigger than two, in general, the conclusion is false. It's very easy to construct some counter examples. Okay. Okay, one term is as follows. So, the counter example is given by this. We consider the third derivative of y, minus y equals to zero. So, this is a counter example. And although this is the case, it has been proved by Armenical that if we make further assumption, namely when the Meromorphic function has at least one pole on the complex plane, then the congruence still holds. But this again also consists of two parts. In the first paper, In the first paper, Armenco himself considered the case when k is odd, and later eventually for the case when k is unit was proved that Armenco Law and N. That's the same conclusion still holds for the even case. Okay, so this is the first application of elliptic functions in real and volcanic differential equilibrium. So now let me talk about another. Let me talk about another application. So, in 2006, again, Aramanco proved that all transcendental, all Meromorphic solutions, including rational ones, of this third-order differential equation belong to the class W. And here, the equation 21 comes from the traveling wave reduction of Grammotto-Simashinsky equation. And in the same paper, he showed that this. He showed that this proof can actually be generalized to study a very large class of differential equations as long as it satisfies two conditions. So if we consider this autonomous differential equation, and if it satisfies two conditions, the first one is that there's only one top degree. Here the degree is defined by the sum of all the The sum of all of all the indices i0 plus i1 and up i and this is the first and the second condition is the so-called financial property which says that there are only a finitely many choice of Lauren expansion around the poles. And by using this method, a lot of results have been obtained. For example, it has been applied to solve the real swift Openberg equation and complex With Ottenberg equation and complex inberg roundup. But there are still some questions remain. For instance, in order to use apply elemental method, we need to check two conditions. The first one, of course, is very easy to check, but for the second one, in general, it's not that easy. Because in order to check whether it satisfies finance probably. Whether it satisfies Spanish problem is equivalent to compute the zeros of a polynomial. But here, the degree of polynomial is equal to the order of this differential equation. We know that when the degree of polynomial is bigger than or equal to five, there's no formula to find its roots there. Okay, so this is a difficulty in applying Erin Manco's method to deal with. Ironical's method to deal with higher-order differential equations. Okay, so motivated by this, we consider a particular type of the autonomous equation, which are given as follows. Here D is the differential operator, and all the IP are linear functions in mu. And we name this as Leroy. And we name this as the Rig factorizable every week differential equations. And for this case, we have proved that for most of the cases, Manchurical results approved can be used to can be applied. And this was done maybe four or six years ago. Years ago, together with my this advisor, Professor from the University of Hong Kong. And another question is that, as I mentioned, that the result only work for general cases, for most of the cases, right? And so, natural question is that how about the non-general case? How about the non-general? So, motivated by this, we considered the second order. Second order case. And so eventually, again, for the second order case, we are able to find most of their transcendental Meromorphic solution up to with certain exceptions, which are given here. As long as this number is not equal to does not belong to this set, but then we have found other Meromorphic. Meromorphic solutions. And from the result, it can be easily seen that the conclusion does not hold because they are doing these solutions outside the class W. And here are some examples. And for instance, in the first one, we can see that it involves the competition. P competent with exponential function, and the second one involves the basal functions of the first and second point, and the last one involves the iterative exponential. And another term belongs to the class W, which tells us that if the two conditions in remotes without dark non-colour, then the Without Daft Nonpro, then the conclusion will be different. Okay, I think that's all that I want to talk about, and thank you very much for the attention.
