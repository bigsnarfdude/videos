I just got a funded project to start to investigate some of the bound preserving continuous finite olivent methods and investigate higher order methods in particular for Richard's equation. And so I appreciate it. I appreciate the invitation and kind of am just doing my best here to try to present some interesting material that dovetails with the theme of the workshop. But it's been about 15 years since I've done any serious work in this particular area of variably saturated flow, although that's what I did a lot of my dissertation work on. So apologies if this is a little Apologies if this is a little boring to some of you who may already have a background in this area, but I do think there's some opportunities in some of these models. So first of all, a little motivation. You know, as we all have seen a lot of in the news lately, we're increasingly faced with urban flooding and coastal and riverine flooding related. Riverine flooding related to climate change, also connected with the patterns of development and population growth. A critical component when you're doing analysis or hydrologic analyses for design of stormwater systems and flood and coastal protection systems is the infiltration into the subsurface. Infiltration into the subsurface. So here we're talking about fluid porous media in the water table aquifer, the part of the subsurface that's directly connected with surface water. In the engineering community, most of the techniques that are used for doing analyses are fairly large scale and they're either empirical or semi-empirical, which is a concern, especially when we're dealing with climate change. When we're dealing with climate change, because there are aspects of those models that may be tied to the prevailing climate conditions over the last century or half century, as opposed to what we face now and are quickly going to be facing. And so, in that case, looking at physics-based infiltration models that have parameters that can be more directly measured. Directly measured would be potentially very helpful. But the problem is, they have a bad reputation, certainly in the engineering community, for being slow and for also being brittle or unrobust. So solvers that crash all the time and that sort of thing. And so I'm going to try to talk a little bit about the underlying theory and models and why I think that a lot of the And why I think that a lot of the computational models have this reputation. And then a little bit about, I'll do a little review of some of the important work in the area and then some important recent work. And I'll conclude with some ideas on future work. Yeah, so first of all, just again, as a review, I'll start with the single-phase flow in porous media. The single-phase flow in porous media. So, if you're not familiar with porous media models, you can take as your starting point a Stokes flow in a periodic medium. And if you do homogenization on that, you can yield as a sort of a lowest order approximation these equations, which is the first equation here is just mass conservation. So, I have the change in the density of. Density of water potentially changes in the porosity of the medium omega and in the divergence of the mass flux, where V is given by, sometimes called the Darcy velocity. It's given by Darcy's law, which is this gradient relationship. Ki is the intrinsic permeability of the medium, and it's typically, in real cases, anisotropic. Real cases anisotropic. So it's a tensor, and it also varies in space by many orders of magnitude in lots of common scenarios. So if you're lucky, you might just be working in a forest medium that's all sand, but most of the time you have layers of clay and organic soils and things like that. And in that case, this permeability tensor is doing all kinds of difficult things. Difficult things. The porosity, the density you can consider as functions of pressure as well as the viscosity, but all of those pressure dependencies are typically neglected for particularly for shallow subsurface simulation because we're not dealing with high pressures and things like that, which you may might be necessary to deal with in, say, reservoir simulation for a petroleum reservoir. So the main challenges that come to you from the basic single-phase equation are the anisotropic anisotropy. Equation are the anisotropic permeability and the heterogeneity of that. And I'll talk a little bit about what methods have been used to address those problems when I get to that part of the presentation. So as I mentioned, in the shallow subsurface, we can usually neglect the compressibility of the medium. And so in that case, that equation, the single phase flow, really does reduce to just an elliptic equation. To just an elliptic equation. So we can redefine a single potential. So here, Ïˆ plus z would be the hydraulic head. So just with some simple transformations and scalings, you get back Poisson's equation. And then as I, but you know, as I mentioned, this still dealing with the, even though that's a classic straightforward equation, dealing with the permeability is an issue, also dealing with issues like local conservation. Like local conservation is important because typically, in many situations, you want to use that velocity for something else. And so, you have to pay some attention to the quality of the velocity that's produced out of your scheme. So, next, the extension to two-phase flow, which is what we're interested in, because we want to look at infiltration, which is water flowing into unsaturated. Water flowing into unsaturated soil or variably saturated soil. So, one way to do that, or the most general approach we can take, is looking at air water flow in porous media. And so, I present it, I'll present it this way as just two mass conservation equations. So we have a mass conservation equation for the water in the porous medium and for the non-wetting phase, which in so we can consider that to be the air. So, we have mass conservation for each phase. So, we have mass conservation for each phase, and then we have velocities that are given by extensions of Darcy's law to multi-phase or variably saturated medium. So we still have the intrinsic permeability with all the issues that come along with it, but now we have the so-called relative permeabilities, which are functions of the saturation as well as potentially functions of space. And those give us this modification to the Darcy coefficient. To the Darcy coefficient based on the saturation level of the porous medium. So really the first four equations here are a mixed parabolic system. And then our closure relations are a constraint on the saturation. So the sum of the saturation should be one. And then we have a relationship between the capillary pressure, which is the difference. The capillary pressure, which is the difference between the non-wetting phase pressure and the wetting phase pressure, and the saturation. So we have a saturation or capillary pressure-saturation relationship, and then those relative permeabilities that I already mentioned. And these extensions are apparently due to Ms. Scott. So there's a book that I'll cite several times by Siobhan and Jappre from 86 that has a lot of the details and comments. And comments like that. That there's been a lot of work on the theory of porous media trying to derive things in different ways. But as far as I know, their comment there is correct. This initial extension is due to Ms. Scott. So, one thing that now becomes an issue: we've got two equations. We have to choose our unknowns. And the And the typically favored by engineers would be to choose the water saturation and the water pressure. And this is because those two variables are kind of always defined and typically are involved in the boundary conditions that we would be setting. So you can think that we might know the moisture content at the edge of our domain. We might also know the water pressure there, but it becomes trickier to write things. Trickier to write things in terms of air pressures and air saturations or some other combination. So that's an issue that comes up from time to time is what the choice of variables are. And I'll show examples of these relationships, but it also has to do when we talk about bound preserving methods, you know, which variables we choose has an effect on which variables we can enforce. An effect on which variables we can enforce bound properties on. So it comes into play in the numerics. So an important, I think, step forward or a window into how to understand these is an approach that it's called the fractional flow approach. And this comes up in the literature. And this comes up in the literature. And again, that textbook by Siobhan Jaffrey does a really good job of presenting the mechanics of it. And it has a little, you know, again, you may be completely familiar with these types of tricks, but the talk yesterday on atmospheric problems had some manipulations at the PDE level. And that's essentially what we're doing is kind of doing like a block factorization of the PDE. Factorization of the PDE itself to uncover some structure. So, in the fractional flow approach, you take the two equations on the preceding slide, and then observing that we have this simple relationship between the two saturations. So the non-wetting saturation is just one minus the saturation. Then we can see, well, if I just add these two equations together, then I'm going to cancel out that term, or I'm going to get a one. And so the time derivative of that's going to be zero. And so, the time derivative that's going to be zero. So, particularly in the case when there's no change in the porosity. So, summing those two things together and doing some rewriting, you can discover that really underlying that nonlinear parabolic system is an elliptic parabolic system. So, you have one equation that's an elliptic equation that's kind of weakly nonlinear. So, it just has the sum of the two relative permeabilities in it. And then I'm not going to go through all the I'm not going to go through all the calculations. Again, these are covered in Siobhan and Jeff Ray, but you can do some manipulations to work this into a single global pressure or a global potential, which makes this an elliptic equation with a weakly nonlinear coefficient. And then the first equation, with some rewriting, we can write it as a kind of a standard looking nonlinear advection diffusion equation. Linear advection diffusion equation. It looks like I've dropped my W subscript off here, but these are just an advective flux of the wetting saturation and a diffusion coefficient of the wetting saturation and the gradient. So that allows us to look a little bit at some of the structure of solutions. If I write those diffusive and invective fluxes out, I get some expressions here, which I'll come back to, but this F. Come back to, but this F function is related to the, again, these are functions of the permeabilities and the viscosities, also the gravity and the density ratios. So one thing that it also kind of helps uncover is an alternative way to derive Richard's equations. So I didn't, so Richard's paper I think was from 31, and I forgot. Think was from 31, and I forgot to put a reference in here, but he derived it based on physical considerations, kind of conceptualizing the medium as having active connected water in capillaries. So we didn't really derive it from a two-phase approach, but obviously these two things should have a connection. And when you use a fractional flow approach, you can see what that connection is. So if we take the limit in the small In the small density ratio, so the density of water divided by the density, I'm sorry, the density of air divided by the density of water, and small viscosity ratios, and then just do some simple cancellations. Then I actually end up with a form of Richards equation, initially at least in terms of the saturation, but then that can be rewritten using the capillary pressure saturation relationship into an equation for the pressure. An equation for the pressure. So the other thing we'll see in just a second is how that changes some of the solutions that arise when using Richard's equation as opposed to using two-phase flow. I should mention also that the, at least the way that I'm doing it here, assuming these two ratios are small, you need one more trick, which is to assume that the air pressure is atmospheric, and that allows you to And that allows you to essentially equate the capillary pressure with minus one times the water pressure. So, water pressure and capillary pressure in Richard's equation are essentially equivalent, just the difference in sign. But in any case, this is the equation that you end up with. And like I said, often you'll see this Richards equation written in terms of psi, which is the pressure head, the pressure divided by the water density and the magnitude of gravity. Magnitude of gravity. And you can write it either way, but again, the choice of variable matters in terms of how you can discretize it numerically and what states you can actually cover. Okay, so moving on to what these actual nonlinearities look like, the first relationship that's really important is the relationship between capillary pressure and saturation. In saturation. So, I suppose I should have maybe defined what saturation actually is. Saturation is just the fraction of the pore space, the area between the grains that is water. So a saturation of one would be completely full of water in the pore space, and zero would be completely full of air. And there are two popular constituent relations that are used. These are based. That are used. These are based on fitting data. Sometimes these are called soil retention curves in the hydrology literature. But these are things that can be measured. One is the Van-Genuchten relationship, and the other is the Brooks-Quarry relationship. And at low saturations, so there's very little water left, they both have very similar behavior. And this is a reflection of the fact that, you know, in nature, water is the wetting fluid, it coats the The wetting fluid, it coats the solid, and so it takes increasing amounts of energy to remove water from the solid phase, which really you can't actually remove it with mechanical processes alone. You have to introduce more, you know, heating and things like that. And so, these equations tend to go to infinity as you reduce the saturation, so requiring higher and higher capillary pressures. An important An important other difference is that the Van Gnuchten model transitions smoothly to a capillary pressure of zero at a saturation of one, whereas the Brooks-Cori relationship has a finite jump. And this, in terms of Brooks-Cori, is sometimes known as the displacement pressure. It's particularly important, I think, in oil reservoir simulation where you're potentially doing something like water. Doing something like water flooding or some type of pumping process where this finite effect, this idea that for the non-wetting phase to invade the pore space, you have to have a finite difference in a finite capillary pressure is important to get the right dynamics. And in this particular case, when you try to simulate it, it introduces a numerical issue, which is that you need to make sure that your numerical scheme. Sure, that your numerical scheme doesn't produce invasion of certain layers too early, but it needs to actually kind of numerically abide by that finite entry pressure. And there's been numerical work on that by Van Dyne and a number of other people that, again, I forgot to put in a reference to that one, but that's yet another. One, but that's yet another kind of qualitative property that needs to be considered in some cases. So, the relative permeabilities, not as controversial, you can write them down as integrals of the set, you know, based on the saturation-pressure relationship. And so, here I've just kind of shown you a general picture of it. They don't sum to one, the permeabilities don't. The permeabilities don't always do exactly what you think they might do. You can get intermediate states of saturation where the material, the fluid, the mixture as a whole can still not flow like it would if it were pure water or pure air. And it's not necessarily symmetric in the saturation either. But it's again, these are pretty standard approaches. Pretty standard approaches that produce these types of curves. Okay, so I can take those constituent relations and I can plug them in. I'll just run back to that formulation real quick. So here, again, this is my vective flux F and my diffusive flux D. And this first will be considering the full two-phase flow model. And one thing that you can do is consider just the one-dimensional case. Is consider just the one-dimensional case. And in that case, because this you have this steady-state elliptic block here, if you have no flow, then the velocity has to be constant. And so this term here, the first term in the advective flux with the Vt here, I should have said, sorry, this Vt is just the stuff in brackets here, the total flow of the mixture. Well, that's just zero if you have no flow balance. If you have no flow boundary conditions in a one-dimensional column. And that's the case that I'm going to consider, partly because of time and also because it is kind of important to consider something like that when you're looking at infiltration. So I'm thinking of physically the situation of, you know, it's been really hot for the last two weeks, things are dry, and then you have a thunderstorm or a hurricane that comes and dumps a lot of water. And so you kind of have a one-dimensional. And so you kind of have a one-dimensional flow scenario where you just have a slug at one end of your domain and you have maybe an impermeable layer at the other. So it's not a pathological case at all. It's relevant. And the addition of the VT just gives you some other interesting aspects of the solutions, but we'll see most of what we need from this particular problem. It's also sometimes called gravity segregation. Also, sometimes called gravity segregation. So, in that particular case, if I plot my advective flux and my diffusive flux, I see some interesting things happening. So, for the blue line here, these two parameters, again, I won't go into detail. They just happen to be the parameters that guide the behavior of the Van Gnuchten saturation permeability model. And I've just chosen two values. Most of the values that are used in practice. Most of the values that are used in practice look like the blue line. And so that is a, as a flux, it's non-monotone, it's non-convex, but it's smooth, you know, and we can understand, we can get, you know, I'll show you in a second what the Riemann solutions of that look like. But in some extremes, we get some kind of weird stuff going on here. So in this case, we're actually losing that inflection point on this. Point on this side of the curve as we approach saturation. And also, the slope is becoming infinite at that right-hand state. So we'll come back to that. But so there's already apparently some degeneracies potential there, but based on the physical parameters. And then, pretty much, regardless of the parameters that are chosen, the diffusion coefficient is doubly degenerate. So it's degenerate at two states. That's s equals zero and s equals zero. That's s equals zero and s equals one. And then it has moderate values in intermediate stages. And then again, in this kind of pathological parameter case, I even get an infinite slope to my diffusion coefficient at one bound. Yeah, so that's this certainly introduces a true, a real degeneracy that needs to be addressed if you're doing. That needs to be addressed if you're developing numerical solutions of these problems because these zero diffusion coefficients are a common aspect of the constituent relations derived from real data. Okay, like I said, we can use that flux if we're going to ignore the diffusion term and we can build numerical solutions. So here I've just kind of drawn out the convex hole construction. out the convex hole construction of the Riemann solution. And once again, I'm just, again, you could consider the Riemann problem that I'm solving here is that you take a graduated cylinder full of sand and you fill it halfway full of water and then you flip it over. And so that water is going to redistribute. And so you expect to have water flowing down through the unsaturated supported, unsaturated. Unsaturated portion of the medium. But you also would expect potentially an air airflow, some airflow kind of bubbling up through the water as it flows down. And that's exactly what the Riemann solution shows. So we have one shock that's represented by this chord. And it's large. So it separates the zero state from something up around 0.8 or 0.9. Around 0.8 or 0.9 saturation has a negative slope, so that's moving down. So that's my water draining down. And then the red line here represents a second shock, which with a positive slope. And it's fairly small. It's just a value between one and maybe 0.95 or 92 here in this particular case. And then those two shocks are connected by a rarefaction wave. Faction wave. So, again, from a perspective of the physics, it seems reasonable what we're getting here. And so, here's just a little animation of that. So, you see, you have this fast-moving shock going to the right. That's the air going up. And then you have a slower-moving, large shock going down. That's the water infiltrating down through the column. So, you know, again, there is an interesting aspect here that may have shed some light on some of the difficulties that are particularly involved with using these models for production kind of infiltration simulation. And that is, if these air shocks that are moving up in this case, are important and really present, then that's going to affect the time scale of our solver. Of our solver, especially if we're trying to use an explicit method. So here's an example of a numerical solution. So the full solution using not assuming a zero diffusion. So in this case, we have capillary effects as well that come in through that D coefficient. And here I'm using backward Euler. And here I'm using backward Euler, God and Ald's method. So I'm using an actual Riemann solver for the evictive flux for a simple finite volume scheme. And I'm using a centered difference for the capillary diffusion. And I present two solutions. One is for the case we were just looking at with fairly reasonable parameters. And again, it mimics the Riemann solution as you would expect. I should also mention you could derive traveling wave solutions to this, at least that you can resolve numerically. At least that you can resolve numerically in some cases, and you'll get this full solution. But again, you have a fast-moving air wave moving to the right or up, and you have a slower-moving, larger water saturation wave moving down. Something interesting is happening with that kind of pathological choice, though, and that is the essentially the right-moving air wave has disappeared and been replaced with a rarefaction wave. With a rarefaction wave, and the right edge of that wave is moving at least very fast, or with in some cases with infinite speed. And that's why I ended up having to use backward Euler here with the upwind scheme. So it's not really feasible to choose the time step small enough. Certainly in this pathological case, not at all, because the characteristic speeds actually are infinite. But even in more moderate cases, that wave is moving so fast that. Wave is moving so fast that an implicit scheme is potentially the only choice for a reasonable size time steps. Yeah, so that's the two-phase case. Here's a full numerical solution. I actually did this a long time ago when I was at one of David Ketcheson's HPC3 Geo workshops. So this is using ClawPack. This is so. This is using Clawpack. I don't remember all of the aspects of the scheme, but just to kind of let you see and think through that, again, that case of taking a cylinder half full of porce media, flipping it over, keeping the boundaries closed. This is what's happening. And one of the things that's nice about it is you see that you have, you know, in a relatively simple situation, you have a number of different time scales that are all interacting in the same domain. So you have the speed. Domain. So you have the speed of that initial downward wave, the much faster speed of the upward wave, and then this phase here is what's called redistribution. And the time scale there is quite slow. But you still, this is with capillary diffusion. And so you have some pretty sharp behavior to your solution. Okay, so now looking at Richard's equation, if we think of it as a nonlinear advection diffusion system and write it out just as we did for the two-phase case, what you see is that Richard's equation is kind of just chopping off that air behavior. So now we actually have a convex flux or monotone. And it's so we're only going to So, we're only going to have the downward wave. So, we just have, you know, water moving down. On the other hand, life has gotten harder with the diffusion coefficient. If you use saturation as the unknown, then the diffusion coefficient for that formulation is actually infinite as you approach the saturation of one. And so, I've seen that called hyperdiffusion, or you know, again, if you. Fusion, or you know, again, if you change variables, you can get things back so that the coefficients themselves behave okay. But essentially, what's happening here is that the equation is becoming elliptic and there's really nothing you can do about it. It's not just a parametric pathology. All the models are going to behave like this as you approach saturation. And in this case, we can use the same collection. Case we can use the same collection of methods, so upwind implicit scheme, and we, you know, we can simulate it numerically, and it's reasonably efficient, except for the fact that we have to solve a nonlinear system. Yeah, so that's again some just some background on the models and just some demonstrations of the behavior of solutions. Demonstrations of the behavior of solutions. So the, you know, some of the things that I think are challenges that have been, some have been addressed, some are still kind of open is this, you know, this fact that you have some very fast-moving waves if you're going to use the full two-phase model for air water flow. A very well-known scheme that you'll see, it's based on this structure that we uncovered with the fractional flow approach that shows you that the nonlinear parabolic system, you can write that as an elliptic equation coupled to a parabolic, a degenerate parabolic equation. It's called impes or implicit pressure, explicit saturation. You know, that's an effective method, but in that case, if you're doing explicit saturation, you still have to resolve those fast air waves. Those fast error waves. There's another thing about that that some people dislike, and that is they don't really like this transformation of variables and the use of this global pressure, which in some ways lacks physical meaning. It's a function of the pressures and the saturations. So that's again, that's something you see in the literature: that kind of search for a better set of variables. For Richard's equation, as I said, any case of interest is going to activate the elliptic degeneracy. So you've got to deal with that. That's simply just what happens when the domain becomes saturated. And certainly we care about that case in hydrology. So, the idea that you could just kind of assume that there's a little bit of air present everywhere is not so good there. Everywhere is not so good there. So, in that case, using the pressure head is more robust, but it's, you know, again, that has some has some downsides to it as well. The pressure, when you do that with the Richards equation, it still has sharp fronts and potentially has like a non-smoothness to it. It's not, it doesn't produce quite the same shocks as the saturation, but it's. The same shocks as the saturation, but it's uh, you know, it's it's uh doesn't just solve everything to switch to the pressure head. Um, we still need to preserve bounds on saturations and pressures and monotonicity, or you know, we want to eliminate non-physical oscillations. And we need to deal with nearly impermeable layers and anisotropic permeability. Something that has received less attention. That received less attention in the literature, but still a fair amount of attention is the application or the approximation of complex boundary conditions. One in particular, known as a seepage phase, is a it's basically what you want to apply to the side of a levee. So you have that the soil is exposed to the atmosphere, and you really end up needing to provide a boundary condition that switches between a Neumann condition. Switches between a Neumann condition and a Dirichlet condition. And it's not some combination, just like a Roban condition or something like that. You actually need the switching. And then lastly, of course, much of the time we need to be using the resulting velocity field and giving it to other codes and other models to use. And so we have to pay attention to the quality of the velocity field that we produce. So, in terms of significant. So, in terms of significant work, you know, this received, especially two-phase flow received heavy attention, kind of, I guess, in the heyday of development of enhanced oil recovery techniques. And so, these books are still really good that if you can get your hands on them, by Peisman and Aziz and Satari, and Siobhan and Jeff Ray. Particularly, the one by Siobhan and Jeff Ray is interesting just because, you know. interesting just because you know i think you know the date on that's 86 uh and it but at the you know at that point they're already doing uh mixed finite elements with discontinuous galurkin although at least i don't think in the book they they don't actually call it discontinuous galerkin but but that's what they're doing uh they're using slope limiters to try to recover bounds on their saturation um you know so it's and i cite a lot of the the the papers uh some of which are well known some of which are less well known Known, some of which are less well-known. So, there was certainly they generated a lot of interesting work and finded methods based on this underlying two-phase flow problem, at least in the context of petroleum engineering. And then another important paper is the one by Alton Lookhaus on quasi-linear parabolic PDEs, which is what Richard's equation is. So, they presented some existence and uniqueness theory. And really, And really, there wasn't much in addition to that, I think, until recently, which I'll mention on the next slide. Then, in terms of continuous finite elements, there's this paper that I really liked by Forsyth and Kropinski from 97, where they derive a piecewise linear continuous Galerkin method, which is, they call it a control-volume finite element method. And they derive, they, you know, they. And they derive they you know they they prove they define and prove monotonicity for the pressures under certain conditions so and that that scheme is really what some even some of the papers I'll cite on the next page is still essentially what they're doing and and I didn't write it out but I'll just step back to the Richards equation real quick to to kind of do some hand waving here essentially what Forsyth is is doing is is doing is once you can rewrite once you formulate your finite element scheme and you can write an edge-based numerical flux then you simply upwind the relative permeability in that case you know with a kind of a looking at this as a as a as a numerical flux As a numerical flux, the fact that it's diffusive doesn't really matter. You just look upwind and you make sure that you take the vertex value of the relative permeability from the upwind direction and then you recover their monotonicity constraint. Again, it's implicit, still requires a nonlinear solver, but I've used. You know, I've used the scheme, it works well. You also have to, of course, do mass lumping as well. I guess I forgot to mention that, but I'm sure most of you guys here know that. So that's, again, some of the, I would say, early kind of foundational work in spatial discourtizations, especially. And then, kind of more recently, I guess say over the last two decades. So, this IMARD paper in terms Our paper, in terms of very significant work, would be their presentation of a finite volume scheme and convergence proof for entropy-weak solutions, including the degenerate states, for two-phase flow. Actually, these next ones are insignificant, but I stuck them in here anyway because something that I'm familiar with was, you know, we did attempt to try to get better behavior for the implicit timing discretizations that were required by looking at adaptive BDF methods. By looking at adaptive BEF methods, there I was using upwind finite volume schemes. So, in a sense, very similar to these control-volume finite element schemes. And then later, just because of some quirks, I guess, in, or I guess it's just to go ahead and say politics. You know, people are demanding that they have locally conservative velocity fields. We did some work applying a method. A method from Mats Larson that I meant to stick in here that allows you to post-process the result of a continuous Kalerkin find an element solution of Richard's equation into either the RT0 velocity space or the BDM1 velocity space. And so that's kind of just a proof of concept that you can still use a non-mixed formulation or a monolithic single equation formulation of Richard's equation with continuous Galerkin. Equation with continuous Galerkin and produce locally conservative velocity fields in the sense of RT0 or BDM1, if that's what your partners need for whatever they're doing, particle tracking or whatnot. Unfortunately, we use VMS there and not Forsyth's scheme. We could have. Just at the time, I was thinking that the VMS approach was going to kind of give us what we needed. But of course, you end up using. But of course, you end up using nonlinear shock capturing and things like that to recover non-oscillatory results out of Richard's equation because of those sharp fronts. And then I think what is exciting work, especially for this group, is the recent work. Not sure I know how to pronounce the name, but Uhaj and really, I guess, Konick, who's produced a number of different papers on these control volume schemes, as well as the accompanying analysis. You know, you showed not. You know, you show nonlinear stability and essentially good low-order convergence, including anisotropy or arbitrary, not unconstrained or less constraints on the mesh than the original Forsyth paper, and they include those degenerate states. So essentially, the groundwork for a good low-order scheme here. And then Giraud and Vivette Giraud and Beatrice Riviera just recently. Beatrice Riviera just recently, this is a paper that Dimitri passed on to me. Have recently applied a very similar control volume finite element scheme to the full two-phase flow formulation in the primitive parabolic form. So they use these, I would say, engineer preferred variables like wetting phase saturation and wedding phase pressure. And so that includes the degenerate states and really is a And really brings the work of IMARD on finite volume schemes kind of into the finite element arena. So future work, as I mentioned, I have a small project just started to try to apply some of these techniques to the Richards equation, particularly for infiltration in water resources and hydrology applications. So I'll be working on that again. I plan to pursue. Again, I plan to pursue using continuous formulations, but would like to use this work that's already laid the groundwork for the low order scheme to extend it to higher order methods. I think there's still issues out there on time integration and nonlinear solver issues. I think those are, in some ways, some of the underlying issues that having good upwind type stable spatial discorization. Spatial discretizations help a lot, but it doesn't solve all of the problems. And so I think that is an issue that still needs some work. And then also, again, paying attention to the quality of the velocity fields for transport, things like density-dependent flow, salinity intrusion is increasingly a problem. So you're in a situation where you end up needing to couple the equations to something that's going to give you density. To something that's going to give you density variation, not full compressibility, just variations in the density due to transported constituents. And then, of course, there are all some hidden things that I mentioned earlier, which is some of these strange boundary conditions and really the coupling of the subsurface to the surface in a robust and fast way and dealing with the discrepancy in time scales there. So, that's really all I have. So that's really all I have. I did include as many of the references I could in the slides. In case anybody's interested, I'll be glad to share my slides so you can pull some of these references. And with that, I'll wrap up and take questions. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much for your nice presentation. Is there any question? Hey, Chris, so I. Here, so I do have a question. Um, I was wondering if there is a consensus with respect to which variable of Richard's equation is more convenient to solve for, if the pressure or the saturation. And also, as a follow-up question to that, if there's like a main advantage of using one versus the other one. Thank you. Yep. Thanks. It's a good question. So, you know, here I presented it in kind of advection diffusion form in terms of the saturation. In terms of the saturation. And so there you can see that it's really not workable to use the saturation if you're going to have fully saturated conditions, which for in my cases, it's always you're going to have fully saturated conditions. And so I would say there's some consensus that you should use the pressure head. Pressure head. That, when you substitute in the pressure head here, so that S becomes nonlinear function of P. Now the mass term is nonlinear, but the diffusion term is well behaved. And so there, the transition from a parabolic to an elliptic problem is everything is nice and smooth in that case. And so I think that's, you know, that's that's kind of one answer. There's some concerns. Answer. There's some agreement there. Still, there are papers. Again, I don't have these in my references, but there's been a lot of work to try to figure out, well, maybe there's a way that you could switch variables. Because if you're really just working, if you could use saturation and you could say, make sure that you're only doing things from here, saturation of 0.0, 0.7, 0.7 to the left, then this is a pretty nice nonlinear advection. Pretty nice nonlinear advection diffusion equations with reasonable wave speeds, and you could use an explicit method for that. So, the problem really comes in that you're kind of stuck with two things happening in the domain at once at any time, which is a purely elliptic equation, often even a linear elliptic equation. And then in the other part of the domain, it's really behaving like a degenerate parabolic equation or even a hyperbolic equation with a nonlinear flux. And there, you would really rather. Your flux, and there you would really rather use the saturation. From the perspective of bound preservation, you know, it's a monotone relationship, you know, so in some ways you can relate bounds on one variable to bounds on the other variable. But yeah, so that's that's kind of that's what I would say. This newer work, you know, it's using the pressure head. But it's using the pressure head. The only thing you have to be careful about when you use the pressure head, and there's a well-known paper on this, is that don't use the chain rule on the mass, otherwise, you get the wrong wave speeds if you use the pressure head. So there was early work where you would just differentiate the saturation with respect to the pressure and then approximate the d psi dt using the chain rule. And you can't do that and recover the correct wave speeds. And I'm sorry, I forgot your second part of your. And I'm sorry, I forgot your second part of your question. No, actually, you kind of answered it also along the way. I was basically also wondering about the advantages of using one versus the other, but you didn't mention that as well. So, yeah, thank you.
