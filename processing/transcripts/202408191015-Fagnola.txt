I would like to, first of all, to join Luigi thanking the organizers for this one that is the third meeting here in Oaxaca. And as far as I remember, the previous meetings were in 2015, organized by Roberto, then 2018, and after the pandemic. So after the pandemic, we resume the tradition with the soul of the organization of this meeting. I also would like to greet those who are online and unfortunately could not come here for different reasons. And well, as you see, the subject of my talk is what we call Gaussian quantum marker semigroups that are the quantum analog of classical Austinullam semigroup. For a classical Austin UlmX semi-group, you have a certain A certain well, the state the Hilbert of Banach space constructed out of functions on R D. Here you have not only the position, but also momenta. You have the well, the non-commutative character of the picture, and as a result, The picture, and as a result, you have an object which is the natural generalization of the classical one I just said. So, this is a short outline of what I would like to discuss. It is only an introduction because, well, for a classical For classical post-Inuli Mexemigroups, many deep properties are established and well known. But here, well, there are still some several indeed open problems. And there are some difficulties arising from the fact that position and The fact that position and momenta do not commute, so you have always to keep into account some inequalities that come out of the Eisenberg principle, essentially. So this is, I said, it's just a short introduction, and then I will try to discuss the first results we got on the structure. There will be other talks. There will be other talks today by Manuela, Damiano, and Veroni, well, not Veronia, tomorrow, that we will concern the same kind of problem. But the problem I would like to address mostly today would be the discussion about invariant densities and Densities and well, and the related issue of irreducibility, which implies uniqueness of the invariant density and some property of the structure. So today also Federico will talk about this problem. Okay, so first of all, a short reminder about what I have in mind as the classical Australian. Mind as the classical Ostein-Uhlenbeck semigroup or the classical Gaussian semi-group, it is the one explicitly given on functions by this formula. And it can be well, functions L can be in many Hilbert or Banach spaces. Everything makes sense and defines. sense and defines a semi-group of contractions where this Z is a real matrix, real D by D matrix, which is the drift matrix. Well, you can see the meaning of Z and this Sigma here. If you compare Sigma here if you compute the generator. So this Z is the twist matrix, and this sigma is related to the diffusion part. It is well, there's another matrix C, which is hidden here in this. Hidden here in this sigma, and this is the generator. So, there is a diffusion with a drift that, well, often in the application is considered to be an attractive drift towards the origin, which corresponds to a matrix Z with which is stable. So, as I can As eigenvalues with negative real part. And well, maybe to be even more concrete, one could consider the one-dimensional situation. There is a one-dimensional diffusion with certain potential that tries to bring the evolution. The evolution towards the origin. Okay, so this is the classical situation in which everything, the action of the semigroup is explicit on all the functions of the space. Well, the generator up to domain issues is complete, well, it's explicit there, and one knows many deep properties. Properties. Well, I have not written heat, but here, but for example, one can express symmetry with respect to the invariant, to an invariant measure in terms of Z and C and so on. But I am mostly interested in the general case. Well, and now to move to the To the quantum Markov semigroup, I consider this intermediate step. In the quantum case, the explicit formula is not available on all operators of the space, but only on certain operators that are a non-commutative version of Version of these trigonometric exponentials. And well, so x becomes the position, but there are also momenta and one considering these operators, well, linear combinations of certain linear combinations of position and momentum. And they are exponential. And their exponential, one finds a formula that is similar to the classical one, but only on this type of functions. Okay, and so now what we look in the one-to-one version is a one-to-mark of semi-group which Semigroup, which is an object with the following properties. So the semigroup property, the preservation of the identity, well, complete positivity that I will not say discuss in detail what it is, but and then the usual. Usual continuity, well, the natural continuity properties in the operator argument and in time. And well, in this sequel, I am going to consider semigroups on an algebra on the phonoiman algebra all bounded operators on a certain Fox space, which is in the natural duality with the Trace class of. Duality with the trace class operators. And well, since I am considering this algebra, I would like to recall some notation about creations and annihilation operators. These are the usual boson ones, not the general one discussed by Luigi in the previous talk. So here one has a So here one has the Fox space on a D mode, well, on a D dimensional Library space. And creation and annihilation are defined in this way on particle vectors and satisfy the commutational relations. And well, this is just a reminder. Well, this is just a reminder of notation what is position and what are positions and what are momenta. I would like to stress that in each coordinate one has the symmetric workspace, but there is no symmetrization, of course, in the index j. Okay, and in this space, there are many explicit objects that allow one to work as in, well, to use many tools of classical stochastic analysis. Well, one of them is the vial operator. The while operator, which is the non-commutative version of sinuses and cosinuses. Because if one considers this vector Z complex vector as a real vector, one recovers, well, I times Well, i times a real vector, one recovers exactly this function, the multiplication by i square root of two and so on. And one sees also that, well, in a similar way for z, which is real, one has that ergonomic exponent. That ergonometric exponential in momenta and not in positions. But one has on vial operators, so on these non-commutative ergonometric functions, this explicit formula, which was the starting point for introducing such semi-groups of completely positive. Semi-groups of completely positive maps in the 70s. They were also called quasi-free semi-group. Okay, there are, well, why are they called Gaussian? Well, to be precise, I need the notion of a quantum. Notion of a quantum Gaussian state. Well, here one has 2D coordinates, the P's and the Q's and the P's, but here one has to take into account also the fact that the positions and momenta do not commute. Do not commute. Therefore, one cannot just consider a classical Orstein-Ulenbeck process on a doubled-dimensional space. One has to keep into account that there are some restrictions, for example, on possible states densities, because you know very well from the Eisenberg answer. Well, from the Eisenberg uncertainty principle, the variance, the product or the variance of the position and the momentum in a coordinate must be bigger than one. So you cannot allow any 2D dimensional density, classical density, but you have to keep this restriction. Keep this restriction, which comes from the uncertainty principle. So a quantum Gaussian state is a certain density, so a trace class operator on the Fox space with this characteristic function. So WZ is a while operator, so it is a EIT, well, EIZ. And so a quantum state is Gaussian if its characteristic function is of this form, so it is a quadratic in Z, and you reconstruct the covariance matrix capital S and mean mu in this way. But the covariance matrix must satisfy this condition, which is essentially the Eisenberg uncertainty principle. And then it is, of course, related with first and second order momenta by another identity. Okay, so these semi-groups, so the semi-groups that So the semigroups that act explicitly in this way on value operators are called Gaussian because first of all they preserve Gaussian state. You can easily see from this formula that if a value operator is mapped into well up to this constant another value operator then Another value operator, then a quantum characteristic function of a Gaussian state is mapped into another quantum characteristic function of a Gaussian state. And you can compute, if you start from an initial Gaussian state, the mean and the variance at any time t. And moreover, one can show that this is a characteristic property of these semi-groups. So if you have a certain semi-group, So if you have a certain semigroup on the CCR algebra that maps a Gaussian state, quantum Gaussian states, quantum Gaussian states, well, then you can find the Z and the C in such a way that you have this formula. Okay, but for the moment, well, I haven't said much about Much about the definition and the construction of the semi-group on the whole algebra. For the moment, there is only this explicit formula. One could go on by considering the sister algebra generated by while operators. Do all the analytic work and all the closures, and construct in the end a semi-group on the CCR algebra. This was the path followed by the mathematical physicists who first considered these objects in the 70s. But we prefer, well, we're all one. Well, or one can also follow another alternative path through the so-called GKLS form, which became, which indeed was, well, this result indeed was proved after the introduction of quasi-free or Gaussian quantum Marko semigroup. And well, this is useful because Because in the analysis of semigroups, one can reduce problems on super operators, so operators acting on operators, to many times to problems concerning only these operators that are usual operators on the e-box space, so the H and the DL. And it turns out, well, this theorem is for norm continuous quantum market. norm continuous quantum markers. Gaussian quantum Marko semi-groups are not norm continuous, but there is a straightforward, well, straightforward, at least at the formal level is straightforward. There is an analytical work to do. One can generalize the Gorhini, Kostakovsky, Sudarshan, Limbler theorem to the case where this operator G generates a strongly continuous. G generates a strongly continuous contraction semigroup on the Hebert space, and these operators are well behaved, they are sort of square roots of G. And through this alternative construction, if one starts from ah, well, first let's give up which was the right one, okay. which was the right one okay if one starts from the right here kraus operators or noise operators and write Hamiltonian one can get a quantum Marko semi-group Gaussian quantum Marko semi-group well and this is the the other way to get this the construction of semi-group one considers One considers an Hamiltonian which is quadratic in A in creation and equations, Krauss operators that are linear, and moreover, to avoid redundancies in the representation of the generator, you cannot have more noises than twice the dimension of the space. So there are these natural constraints. Natural constraints. And so these VUR parameters, complex valued parameters with a restriction coming from symmetry of the Hamiltonian H. This must be symmetric, then it will be self-adjoint by standard results because it is a very simple symmetric operator. Metric operators, and the properties are that this matrix omega must be Hermitian, and the other matrix K must be symmetric. And out of this, if you follow the minimal semigroup method, which is an extension for two possible unbounded generators of the GKLS construction, one finds One finds a quantum macro semigroup, so a weak star continuous semigroup on the algebra of all bounded operators of the Hilbert space, on the Hilbert space, with this explicit action on vial operators. And the operators C and Z, the matrices C and Z, that are only real linear. Only real linear are related to the parameters of the model by this formula. Okay. Ah, yeah, the omega is here. I was wondering where was the omega. Well, there's a new object that enters in the pictures. That enters in the picture, the symplectic structure of the CCR, because these operators here are only real linear. But if one doubles the dimension of the space, one can consider them as complex linear on a space of dimension 2D. Okay, now I the the the the first problems. The first problems we tried to start in view of a construction of a well, I would say, a little theory or the study of the structure of these objects depending on the parameters or on the matrix C and Z that are there. There, where, well, the existence of the variant density and then possibly the structure. So, invariant, the existence is not really difficult to begin, to study, because since you have the explicit formula on value operators, you can write explicitly. Write explicitly the evolution of the characteristic function of a certain initial state. And it turns out to be this one. So if you start from a Gaussian state, what happens? I have already shown the formula before, indeed. You have a certain initial S and And this will go to another, oops, the other way, sorry. Yeah, to another S at time t the same for the mean. So, if you have if you start from an initial Gaussian state, it turns It turns out that the only way to have invariance is to have this identity. And so it turns out that you have an invariant Gaussian state if and only if you have a solution of this equation on. Of this equation on matrices, which is essentially the same that you have also for classical Hosteinulenbeck-Semigroup. But this is an equation that appears also in linear control in many situations. And it turns out that you can find a solution S, so you can find a Gaussian invariant density. For example, For example, when Z is stable, so eigenvalues have negative real parts, so this integral is convergent and you have this explicit formula. Or the kernel of C is well behaved with respect to the semi-group generated by Z in such a way that you cut possible unboundedness coming from eigenvalue. Coming from eigenvalues of Z with positive real path. Well, and if you do with some more care this analysis, it turns out that you can prove immediately this result. So, if the matrix Z is stable, then Then the Gaussian quantum Markov semigroup has a unique invariant density, unique not only among Gaussian densities, among all densities, with covariance matrix given by this integral and mean given by this. This vector. Here, I have been a bit quick with the notation and I overlooked also some little details because this Z is not the original Z that was here in this formula. Where is it? It's not this one which is here in this formula. But it is the operator that you. The operator that you get, the complex linear operator on a doubled-dimensional space here, that you get if you want, well, if you want to write the Z as a complex linear operator indeed. And again, you get here the same equation. Here, there is a transpose missing. Is a transpose missing in the first one, the first Z here. Okay, okay. Well, then when following a traditional path that you have when you study Markov semigroups, what is qualitative value? What is qualitatively, I mean, what are the invariant densities? What is the structure of the invariant densities? If you have convergence towards invariant densities and in what sense. Well, a problem that we attacked was irreducibility or more precisely to find which are the regions of the The regions of the space from which you do not go out in classical language, but in the quantum language, it means what are the projections in the algebra where the semigroup is defined that satisfy this property. Because if you have a projection with this property, if you begin from an initial density. From an initial density supported in this projection, then you do not go out through time evolution. This is the equivalent property, which is the natural notion of irreducibility for quantum macro semigroups. Okay. And Oh, okay. And well, here you can reduce this problem of finding the so-called increasing or subharmonic projections, increasing because of this inequality or subharmonic in the sense of Marcos Amigo. This is a problem on essentially on the generator. You look for projections P such that L of P, the super operator L applied to P, is bigger or equal than zero. But since you have the GKLS structure, you can reduce the problem on super operators to a problem on operators. And in this, this is what we did. This is what we did with Rolando Rebolledo a long time ago for Macro Semigroups with a generator in a generalized GKLS form. So a projection has this property if and only if, well, this PT is the semigroup generated by G. If and only if. So this projection. If and only if. So this projection is an invariant subspace. This projection little p is an invariant subspace for the semigrou. Sorry, this p should be indeed here, meaning bay and subspace means this. And moreover, so this projection P reduces, little p reduces the semi-group capital P. Semi-group capital P. And moreover, noise operators leave this domain invariant and leave this domain invariant. If you forget about the domain issues, this just means that this little p is an invariant subspace for G and all the noise operators LL. But we wanted to reduce irregularity, to express irreducibility in terms of the parameters of the model, so in terms of the v and the u's and the omega and so on. And in this way, taking inspiration from what you have with classical diffusions. With classical diffusions, if you have noise in many directions, you expect to have irreducibility because you can visit all the space. So, with many LL, with many noise operators, LL, the candidate invariant subspaces Invariant subspaces must be invariant here for many operators. And so you expect that if you have invariance for the LLs and the G, for many LLs and the G in particular, if you have all the possible creators and an equation, so if you have all the possible noises. So, if you have all the possible noises, then it will be irreducible. Well, now, but invariance is not only for the operator cell L, it is also for the G, and so it is also for the commutator. Now, the commutator of G and L L gives well through the standard. Through the standard formula, other operators here, because well, this in light blue is a scalar, because the commutator of two first order operators in Preetos and Anikiles is a scalar. So here you have another L that you can forget because it was already there. So if you consider this commutator, This commutator, which is another operator under which the given projection must be, the given subspace must be invariant, you reconstruct another first order operator in creation and an equations, and which has this, which is determined by a certain vector. So if you go on with commutators, you Go on with commutators, you generate more and more vectors, and uh so you start at the step zero step, you have noises, so you have m linearly independent vectors. Then, first order commutators, you add other vectors, they are all in C to D. C to D is a finite dimensional space, so sooner or later, well, in a Later, well, in a finite number of steps, you stabilize the dimension. And of course, you expect that you get irreducibility, so triviality of invariant subspaces, if and only if the dimension at which you stabilize everything is a maximal one. So in this Maximal one. So, in this way, you recover the Hermander maximal rank condition also in this context, as in the case of a classical Austin Maximi group. Well, up to a little detail, that one has to keep into account all the domain issues. Because if you don't control the domains of the operators, then you Domains of the operators, then you, and of the commutators, you cannot go on because you are only doing a formal differentiation and you don't know whether it makes sense. Well, well, but in this special situation, when the domain of G is equal to the domain of the number operator, you can do this. You can control the domains and go on. Domains and gone. And it turns out that the given quantum Markov semi-loop is irreducible if and only if this vector subspace of C to D has maximal dimension. Well, I should say, okay, I should say that in the one-dimensional case, when D is equal to one, you can get rid of this. We have many other. Get rid of this. We have many other situations, but special situations in which we can go through. For example, also if the manifold that you get here is a symplectic manifold and so on, but we do not have the general result as one would expect. Would expect. Okay, so it's better if I stop here. Well, you will see in the following talks other problems that have been addressed and solved in a more or less satisfactory way. So, thank you. Thank you. Are there any questions? Yes. The definition of irreducibility. Yes, this one. So your definition of irreducibility events and maybe not that the top looks like the events definition. And the basis definition of a projection, and you look at I mean, are your is there no distinction between the Schrodinger and Heisenberg picture here at this time? Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This is ah, uh yes, this is in the um Heisenberg picture and the other one is in the Schrodinger picture. Man is in the Schrodinger picture, yeah. No, the dagger on the TOT. Sorry, this is an opted. The dagger on the T of T fold below. It is a star. Ah, yeah, no, I'm sorry. Yes, this is the dagger, if you want. This one. No, this is not a row, it's a P. is a P. This one here. This is also a P. Sorry, the row indeed looks like very much to the P. It may create confusion. This one already non-uniquely several variant states not unlike yes, this is indeed the subject that will be discussed in detail by Federico in the afternoon. Yes, what you can see. Yes, what you can see is that if Z is not stable and has eigenvalues with strictly positive real part, then essentially you cannot have invariant states because you escape at infinity. If you have eigenvalues with a zero real part, then you have a variety of situations. Variety of situations. They are also related with the usability, but Fidel Federico will discuss it today. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not necessarily. The well, no, the other way around. No, the goal. No, the Gaussian state is faithful if and only if this inequality is strict as far as I remember. If you have a subspace, well, if this has a non-trivial kernel, then the Gaussian state is not faithful. Yes, it is possible to get this. Well, it is possible, and well, I had no time to discuss this condition, but we have another. Another conjecture for the moment that the semi-group is irreducible if and only if, well, it was more related to this. If and only if there are no non-trivial Z-invariant subspaces into the kernel of the diffusion part. So it is, well, like for the So it is a well like for hypoelleity essentially. So you can have also well if you if this condition does not hold, you can have many quantum Gaussian invariant states. But we have not a complete picture of all the possibilities. Complete picture of all the possible structures for the moment, but we can easily produce by hands examples in which you have many Gaussian invariant states. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, absolutely. Yes. Further questions? Okay, well, let's thank the speaker again.
