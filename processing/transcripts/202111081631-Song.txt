Happy to announce the next speaker. It's Jian Song from Rutgers who will speak about long-term solutions of the Catalychi flow. Jan, you're using. Thanks, Richard. I'd like to thank the organizers for the kind invitation. It's a shame I couldn't be in Benf. I apologize for not making it due to family obligations. So today I'll talk about some recent results. Some recent results on long-term solutions of the K-Ricci flow. So, the main result is a joint work with Wang Jianjian at Chinese Academy of Science. So, let me first give the outline of the talk. Well, first, I'll give some background. And then I'll talk about so-called Then I'll talk about a so-called minimal model, analytic minimum model. This is the analytic one with Richie Flow. So this is kind of the conjectural type of a program proposed by Tian and myself. And then I'll talk about. And then I'll talk about the main result. And if I have a bit more time, I'll talk about the proof. So first, let me start with the background. So here we're looking at a Kayla manifold. So, here I assume that the complex dimension is equal to n. And usually, I assume n is greater than or equal to 2, because when complex dimension equal to 1, it's just a standard Ricci flow on a Riemann surface, a closed Riemann surface. So, here I also assume that the pin manifold is always closed without boundary. Closed without boundary. So here, G is a kilometric. What does it mean by a kilometric? Well, so locally, of course, this is a complex manifold. So locally, you always have a chart sitting inside the Euclidean Cn. So locally, you can always write down the complex metric in local coordinates, let's say Gij bar, and then I can make. G i j bar, and then I can make it into a two form. So, this is in fact a real two form. It's actually a symptomatic form and it's closed, sitting on the original of the underlying manifold. So, this is closed and also. So Gij bar, if you at any given point, this is an n by n Hermitian matrix. So it's positive definite at each point. So this kilometric is nice in the sense that it's kind of the intersection of a simpler geometry and Riemannian geometry. And let me give you some examples. And let me give you some examples. Well, the simplest one is just closed Riemann surface. So given a Riemann surface, of course, it's equipped with a complex structure or conformal structure, more or less the same. And you can pick any. Any permission metric on the Riemann surface. Using the complex structure, you can build a Riemannian metric, which is also a Hermitian metric. And that's the simplest kilo manifold. Because this is a real dimension two manifold. So for any two form, it has to be closed. Closed. Well, the other family of examples would be algebraic manifolds. One can look at any complex submanifold of complex projective manifold. And turns out that such a complex manifold will always. Complex manifold will always be a Killer manifold. The simplest Killer metric will be just taken by the Foumini-Studi metric inherited from the ambient projective space. And in particular, these complex sub-manifolds, they are very special. By collar embedding theorem, they're actually algebraic manifolds. They're projective manifolds or algebraic manifolds. So they can be just studied both by complex geometry and algebraic geometry. Geometry and algebraic geometry, and particularly directional geometry. So, the question is: what canonical metrics or kilometer metrics can be put on such manifolds. Well, obviously, I want to look at constant curvature metrics. Constant Einstein metric, or constant scalar curvature metrics. So there are different categories of canonical metrics. And here we can always use the Ricci flow. Obviously, Ricci flow is the most natural and canonical deformation for Riemannian metrics on a Riemannian manifold. But in this case, we have a Keeler manifold. What happens if we apply the Riesy flow on any? On any kilometer manifold with any initial kilometric. So here we consider the following unnormalized wiki flow on a cleaner manifold with complex. with complex dimension n. So the Riemanni metric is deformed in the negative direction of the Ricci curvature. Here in the complex case, we always drop this metric two, the number two. And the initial metric we assume to be K L. So, the nice thing about the Ricci flow and Kayla manifold is that the Kayla condition is preserved by the Ricci flow. So, if you start with a Kayla metric G0, as long as you have a smooth solution, the solution will always be a Kalometric. So that's why we call this flow the Kayla Ricci flow. It's identical to the original Ricci flow, except that the initial metric is special. It's Caleb. Well, we have Uh, well, we have uh uh so on the killer uh manifolds, uh, things are a bit nicer. Uh, we can get some uh fairly neat results. For example, Hua Dong Tao derived an alternative proof of Yao's celebrated solution to the Calabi conjecture. The Calabi conjecture. So, what Don Tao proved is that, well, in order to, if you look at the long-term solutions, suppose the first chain class of the underlying kilo manifold is negative. Then you have a long-time solution for the unnormalized Rucci flow. Usually, if the C1 is navigating. Usually, if the C1 is negative, the Richard curve is negative. So, minus the Richie curve will be a positive symmetric to tensor. So, you would imagine the metric will grow exponentially, in terms of T, not expression. So, what we have is that we can normalize the flow to the, or one can directly normalize the metric. So, in this case, The normalized solution converges smoothly to the limiting solution. Well, this limiting solution satisfies the Einstein equation on the original manifold. So everything converges smoothly and nicely. And this gives an alternative proof to Yao and Alvine. To Yao and align. For the existence of a K-line standometric, K-Limmer for the negative first-chain class. Well, one would also like to look at the case when the first chain class vanishes. So, in this case, if you look at the class, the Ricci curvature sitting minus the Ricci curvature is exactly. A minus the Richie curvature is exactly sitting inside the first chain class. So, if the first gen class vanishes, you would imagine that in terms of the Kayla class, it's not moving. So, once you fix the initial Kayla metric, the evolving metrics will stay in the same Kayla class. You will never go out of that category. So, in this case, one can show that the metric converges smoothly. Converges smoothly, the long-time solution converges smoothly also to a unique limit, smooth limit metric. And such a limit metric is a Ricci-flat metric, is a Carlabya metric. So, this gives an alternative proof of Yao's solution to the Cadabi conjecture. Well, so in these Well, so in these two cases, they're fairly strong. You would assume either strong negativity for the friction class or the vanishing condition for the friction class. There are lots of manifolds sitting in between. In fact, many many, most of the manifolds might fail in these two categories. So naturally, one would like to look at some semi-positivity. So when the friction class So, when the friction class is kind of a semi-negative, right? So, this so a natural generalization would be the following. So, this is a theorem due to 2G in the special case, and also Tian and Zhou Zhang, in the general case. So, if you look at the unnormalized Kilorici flow sitting on the Kilo manifold, so the flow has a long time existence, if and only if the first chunk class. The Flushian class of the underlying manifold is sort of semi-positive. So, here I'm looking at the minus Flushen class. So, when I say it's semi-positive, it's kind of a vague. One indeed have to use the algebraic condition or topological conditions to define this kind of a weak positivity. So, the right notion is nef, so-called numerically effective. I mentioned it in a I'll mention it in a minute. Well, this minus the Frozen class is exactly the canonical Land Bounder on the underlying manifold. What is the canonical Land Bounder? That's exactly the determinant bundle of the cotangent bundle. Cotangent boundary. So, if you look at the cotangent boundaries, it's complex dimension, the rank is complex dimension, and you take the determinant, you get a line boundary, and that is called the canonical boundary. And it turns out that it's the same as the minus first chain class. So, when we say the minus first-chain class is negative, that's more or less just saying that you look at the canonical line boundary on M, and you look at any Riemann holomorphic Riemann surface. Riemann holomorphic Riemann surface sitting on the manifold n, the intersection number is positive. So, this is the algebraic definition for this semi-positivity. This is nav. Here, C is a Riemann surface. Any Riemann surface on F. So, the long-time existence can be characterized for the region, for the K-reach flow can be perfectly characterized by topological conditions. And then what I have to ask, since one have long-time existence for the Kedorici flow, does the flow always converge? Because naturally, you can easily construct some examples that it could. Easily construct some examples that it could collapse, you could divide up singularities along some sub-varieties, some sub-manifolds, all kinds of things could happen. So, naturally, we want to ask what happens if you look at the limits of such a long-time solution. So, we start, we can just look at the surface case. So, in this case, the complex dimension is equal to two. Right, so here we assume that I have a complex dimension, a kinetic surface. And also, I assume that since by the previous theorem, we know that there is. There exists a long-term solution if, and only if the canonical Lamb bundle is kind of semi-positive. So let's also assume this condition. So naturally, we have a long-time solution. And our interest is to be able to do that. And our interest is to find out the convergence of such a long-term solution for any initial kilometric. So it doesn't matter what initial metric you pick. So the following scenarios would happen. First, let's just look at the picture. The first case is that the Riemann surface Might have a bunch of bad somatophobes sitting on it. So, what are these? These are the so-called minus two curves. These are holomorphic sphere, holomorphic S2 with self-intersection number minus one. So S2 dot S2 is equal to minus. S2 is equal to minus one. That's two cycles, both of them are two cycles sitting inside the full manifold. So you look at the self-intersection number for such holomorphic S2. Yeah. So these are the problems. These are the problems of getting smooth convergence. So what happens is that the flow would always converge smoothly outside these bad points. Outside these bad points are bad curves, bad holomorphic curves, remote surfaces. Instead, these bad curves would become isolated orbital singularities, these called ADE singularities. So in this case, you normalize the solution, you divide it by t, this converges. To a new manifold. This is M. This is the new manifold M prime. And the limiting metric is a Kiel-Leinster metric. And this is smooth orbifold key lines the metric. So, the convergence is smooth outside these bad holomorphic S2, but near this holomorphic S2, it's a little bit tricky to describe because singularities are forming. So, all the singularities coming from these bad Riemann surfaces, sitting special Riemann surfaces, sitting inside the Kale Manor, a Kala surface. So, this is the first case. Is the first case well if there's no minus one these minus two curves, then flow will always be convergent. It goes back to uh quaidantal's result when the first chain class is negative. So here the first chain class vanishes, degenerate along these special obstructions, these special curves. The second case is that the original manifold Manifold is actually a torus vibration, a holomorphic torus vibration sitting over another remote surface. So this is M. But M admits a torus vibration over a unique Riemann surface in C. unique Riemann surface in C. So this is dimension complex dimension two this is complex dimension one i should also say that this is also derived by 2g and tian and jau. The surface case is special, especially interesting in the case that you can understand the similarities very well. The singularities very well. Now, the second case, when you have kind of a collapsing, so these torus fibers will be collapsed. The diameter of the general smooth nice fibers will go to zero and the flow kind of converges as well. After appropriate normalization, what happens is that it converges to the base manifold, the base Riemann surface. But you might have some singularity. But you might have some singularities because you have this type of special singular fiber because the most of the general fibers are nice torus, but then you might have some finally many singular fibers where singularities appear to you. So then you have this type of singularity developing on the base. So this limiting manifold. Limiting manifold is Z, and the limiting matrix is G infinity sitting on a Riemann surface of different dimension. And then the limiting metric satisfy this twisted K-line standometric, where you have a correction term coming from the variation of complex structure of the term. Uh, complex structure of the torus. So, this is the Will-Peterson metric. So, this is derived by Tiana and myself or Balo though. And the third case is that Kuai Dong Tao's case, where you don't have to normalize the flow. Everything converges smoothly to the same manifold. And this is the original. Original manifold equipped with the Cavabia metric. So, for surfaces, for long-time solution of the surfaces, these are the only three scenarios. And the most difficult one is actually this one, the second case where you indeed have collapsing. In this case, it's a little bit nicer because outside these singular fibers, the curvature is indeed bounded, but in high-dimensional case, it could be tricky. So, these three situations. So these three situations actually can be generalized to high dimension by the work of myself, Tiana and myself. But the surface is relatively easy to understand in terms of geometric description. So here, the drawback is that what we derived is that the flow converges nicely away from the bat set. So here you have the bat holomorphic S2, here you have singular fiber. S2. Here you have singular fibers. So it's a little bit difficult to understand the behavior or to obtain some geometric control around these degenerate set or singular set. So this is the goal of this talk. So let me also move to the next part, which is the analytic minimum. Which is the analytic minimum model program with Richie flow? So, I also mentioned a little bit about the finite time singularity. So, this is the program proposed by TN and myself. And it's kind of straightforward. It's kind of a running a computer program. What we do is that want to start with a With a kilometer manifold with arbitrary initial kilometric. So you just pick any kilometer. In fact, later we would allow singularities. So you start with a kid manifold equipped with a kilometric G0. Now, step one, we can just apply. Supply the unnormalized Kilo-Ricci flow, starting with this prepet kilometric, arbitrary initial metric. Then we could look at the maximum time. Okay, so t will be the maximum time for the K2H flow. Well, of course, here we assume that everything is smooth, but later on you can allow certain mild singularities. So this is the capital is just the maximum time for the flow. So step two. So, step two: if t is finite, well, that means it will be finite time singularities in play. And what happens is that, let me just, well, this is a conjectural picture, so let me just draw the picture. What happens is, just like the, a little bit like a dimension two case. Here, you have the original manifold with a smooth solution. With a smooth solution. So as T approaches the singular time from the left, generic case is that the flow would converge smoothly outside. This is the original manifold M. But the singularity will be taking place in about In a bunch of bad sub-variety or some manifold. So it's always occurred. The singularities always occurred on some analytic sub-varieties of the original manifold. And these sub-varieties, the singularity is contained only in this sub-variety. Outside this red set, everything converts. Red set, everything converges smoothly. The trade-off is that you might develop singularities, especially some part of the, you have a bunch of S2 fibration. So essentially, you're contracting a bunch of S2, a special S2, a family of a special family of S2 would be contract to points. So you have this type of singularity here. So this is a limiting manifold. So, this is a limiting manifold. And you can look at, since it converges smoothly outside this bad set, you can look at the metric completion on the nice part. That's called this metric space, big M at T. But then we conjecture that the flow can keep flowing. What happens is that the flow will resolve singularities. Of course, by resolving singularity, you're not going to necessarily get a smooth manifold, but get Get a smooth manifold, but get the optimal mild singularities. So, what happens is that the singularities get better and the flow can be continued. So, all of this should be continuous in terms of kind of a clomophile topology. Actually, it's stronger. One should be able to talk about singularity models. But the flow will continue. But the flow will continue on the new map. And if you look at T goes back to the singular time, you still should have some geometric convergence back to this one. So the flow is going through singularities. In fact, since we are running on Kilimanifold, there should be some unique correspondence to the Correspondence to the algebraic surgery. So, what we conjecture is that this is so-called the flip. In this implemented geometry, it's a little bit like the wall crossing. So, what happens is that here you're contracting in this direction. It's a little bit just like some bad holomorphic S2, a family of special. Holomorphic S2, a family of special holomorphic S2. These are kind of a back set which cannot be moved, moved around. And then the flow should contract these special S2. And then since you get something very, very singular, but then the flow will resolve the singularity in an optimal way. You can blow up in certain other directions. You blow up, you get actually, you gain some other family of S2. Some other family of S2, and you keep flow. So, what happens is that the flow just goes through this algebraic surgery continuously using metric. So, algebraically, this is called the flip in birational geometry. This is due to Maui's middle model program. So, somehow, the Ricci flow is doing, should be doing exactly the same thing as the Same thing as the so-called minimum model with the scaling, where the scaling turns out to be exactly in the same direction of the Ricci flow. So, this is a perfect correspondence there. So, well, what does it mean by, so here the picture looks kind of reasonable, but one also have to understand what the singularity should look like. So, of course, you can do some blow-up. If you do some blow-up, in fact, there should be certain some kind of the transition of canonical metrics. It's a little bit like canonical transition in mirror symmetry in mathematical physics. What happens is that suppose you can blow things up and everything converges nicely. So, locally around these bad sets. Bath set. So these bad sets are around here. If you take the limit, they're more or less still there, but of course the compact structure might change a little bit. So here it could be a little bit tricky because it involves with the modular space of singularities. What happens is that the flow will contract these bad sets and you get a cone. The limiting space should be a cone. Space should be a tone. And then the flow will continue when it passes in your time and it will blow up in some other direction. So in fact, let me just draw a little better. Me, just draw it in a better way. So, the original batch set, let's say, looks like a horizontal piece, but then the flow will just get a singularity here. But then using the flow, you resolve the singularity, you blow it up. But the blow-up set is kind of vertical. You just turn 90 degrees. You would go to some other part of, you have to glue in some other piece. So geometrically, this corresponds to the shrinking, which is shrinking zonotone. And this is the expanding silotone. And the cone in the middle should be the tangent cone at infinity. So this is what be the perfect conjectural picture. We call it Local uniformization to understand algebraic singularity. These singularities are kind of pretty bad, mild, but still pretty bad algebraic singularities. So this is about the finite time singularity, the generic case where you have to perform certain surgery, but the surgery is done by PV and by Romani metric in a continuous way in Gromov, let's say Gromafan's Gromafan's doctor. And after you're growing up, Post of the particle after growing up, the local models should be reflected. The singularity models should be reflected by the transition of solitons from shrinking solitons to expanding silicons. And once you get the new manifold, we replace the original manifold by the new manifold. Okay, by this one and go back to step one. So we just go back to step one and apply the reach of flow again. So every time you have some singularity, you perform a surgery and you keep going until you reach step three when you have long-term solutions. So by the hints from By the hints from directional geometry, we know that these surgeries should be finite. Generically, you're not going to have infinite many surgeries, it should be finite. Then, once you have long-term solutions, it breaks down into three cases, just like in the surface case. Either the flow is not collapsing, but then you have to contract a bunch of But then you have to contract a bunch of that set and it converges to a new manifold, which is Einstein. The dimension will be the same. And the convergence is smooth outside these, sorry, a singular set. So everything's nice, at least away from. Nice, at least away from this bad set. This corresponds to the surface case over here, where the flow just contracts a bunch of special holomorphic S2, you get orbital singularities. And the limiting metric is orbital QST metric. Of course, in this case, it's much more complicated. But at least in many cases, we can understand the In many cases, we can understand the limiting space quite well. So, the second case is when the flow collapse, because again, the original manifold is kind of a collabial fabrication. So, you have a bunch of replacing the torus in the surface case, you have calabia fabrication. Case, you have Calabian fibrillation over a complex manifold, possibly with singularity. And then the flow also converges to the base. And you have a twisted pi-mass dynamic. Here, in general, you're not going to get smooth convergence, but you get pretty good, more or less C-alpha convergence on generic. Convergence on the generic part. This is done by Valentino and Wancofender Young. So in this case, this is Einstein. So the limiting metric is Einstein. This is Einstein. This is twisted Einstein. Just with a real-Peterson metric is a correction. Peterson metric is a correction because you have Calabia fabrication. You have the L2, Peterson metrics, the L2 curvature for the variation of the Calabia structures. The last case is that the convergence is nice, corresponds to the Calabia case. You don't have to do any normalization, the flow just converges to the same manifold shouldn't be. Shouldn't be any modification. And you get a Richie flat can imagine in a limit. So this is the general picture. So in the surface, one can understand this. For example, in this case, in the finite time singularities, in the surface case, these special singularities coming from a minus one curves or holomorphic S2 with self-interception number minus one. Interception number minus one, these are the special holomorphic curves. So, the more interesting thing for us for this talk is this case, the long-time solutions. You have kind of three categories. This one is not particularly interesting for our purpose because it's more or less in the category of Yao's solution to the Calabi conjecture and can be interpreted using Quadon-Tau's theorem. So, for us, the most interesting thing. us uh the most interesting thing is this part even for this part things a little bit easier because the convergence one can show it's smooth away from here so all you have to understand is the limiting structure so the limiting structure actually in this case uh so what i show is uh a while ago i can show this actually uh is a finite compact matrix space in fact this is also a algebraic variety one can show this uh pretty well it's everything This pretty well. It's everything's works out as expected. So, the difficult one is this part. It's also the difficult part in algebraic geometry because it corresponds to the famous abounds conjecture. So this one is really because analytically, the PD, the corresponding PD, you don't have uniform ellipticity. In fact, at every point, the uniformity of ellipticity fails. Uniformity of electricity fails. Second of all, you have these singular fibers. In algebraic geometry, it's the same thing because you lose positivity of the canonical bundle. So this have a kind of a correspondence there because of losing positivity or losing curvature control. So this is kind of the big picture. And of course, the final time singularity somehow is a little bit more difficult to understand. Is a little bit more difficult to understand. Somehow, the long-term solution is slightly better. It's a little bit counterintuitive because usually the long-term solution is a little bit difficult to keep track of. But in the KLA case, since we understand the limiting models, so it makes things actually quite relatively simple. So also, what we did before, even in the surface case, we can only Surface case, we can only have some local convergence, analytic convergence. We have some nice control locally, but from this bad set, usually we don't have any control. So the problem is to understand geometric behavior around this bad set. So now I can talk about our main result. Okay. So this is a joint work with Wang Jianjian from Beijing. So of course it's built on the early work of Tiana myself and also Jin Li Zhang. The new input here is that we're able We are able to apply some recent, very important work of Richard. This is kind of the new perspective for us, especially from the point of view using Palmer's work. So let me state our result. So here, let's assume I have a Kayla manifold with any initial Kayla metric G0. With any initial kilometric G0. And we, since we're going to have looking at long-term solutions, so we have to assume certain weak positivity of the canonical boundary or the minus fluxion class is kind of non-negative. Well, then we can, of course, we get a long-term solution. Of the unnormalized flow starting with G0. So, what can we say about the geometric control of G of T? So, the conclusion is there exists There exists a uniform constant depending on the manifold and the initial payload, such that for any time the reach, the scalar curvature of the normalized metric. So I normalize by t so that it's in the right, it's the It's in the right, it's the correct normalization. So the scalar curvature is uniformly bounded. And the diameter is also uniformly bounded. So this is the results. Both of them are uniform bounded. Of course, this part, this is already derived established before by. Established before by TNM myself a while ago, 10 years ago. So, this is the real deal to get the uniform control of the dynamic. So, I want to make some remarks. Well, in the general, in the case of MA is general type, general type. General type means that the flow is not collapsing. You have smooth convergence, non-collapsing convergence away from certain suburbs. In this case, the theorem is due to already known. For the scalar curvature bound, it's due to Zhou Zhang. And for the diameter down, it's due to Bing Wong. So, but even for the diameter bond, one has to use my early results of understanding the limiting structure. That's also the drawback of our theorem. We have to understand the metric control of the limiting metric space. In the case when the fibrillation, so in the collapsing case. So, in the collapsing case, if the fiber is torus, general fiber is torus. So this also is known. This is due to myself and Chan and Zheng Li Zhang a couple of years ago. So, here we use the so-called We use the so-called relative volume comparison of Tian divided by Tian and Zhang to get convergence. And also, we have to use certain distance estimates from Mahjan-Pair equations. But here, the drawback is that the relative modern comparison needs a uniform Ricci bound, at least locally. This only holds up when the fiber is a torus. Is a torus. In general, it's a little bit difficult to verify, but I still believe it's true. And we can show that up to dimension three, it is indeed true. The third remark is that if the complex dimension is less than or equal to three, in fact, the rich curvature Is uniformly bounded away from it's a local uniform estimates away from the singular fibers or the singular points. So away from the singular fibers, these bad parts, indeed, you can. So this is also due to myself and Jen, one Jen Jen. So we can also derive. So, we can also derive, in fact, we can do it a bit more. As long as the algebraic dimension is less than one, less than or equal to one, this is also true. So, this shows that the flow actually collapses with the uniformly scalar curvature bound. And locally, you have a uniform Ricci curvature bound away from the bad sets. But we believe that the Ricci curvature bound should probably hold globally in this case. Right, so let me talk about the proof just using five minutes. So, we should also remark that this result can, if you look at the estimate, it looks very similar to one should compare to. So, I don't have time to talk about the final K-Ricci flow, which means the final time extinction of the Ricci flow. So, if you look at Perman's work on the final flow, Work on the final KOV flow, he derived the similar things. But in that case, these are the kind of extreme cases. Here we have a long-term solution. In Permanent's work, you have look at the finite time extinction. And after route normalization, you have kind of similar estimates. The scalar curvature is uniformly bounded, the diameter is uniformly bounded. So these two are the kind of If you look at the spectrum of the solutions of the K-Lucci flow, you have on the two ends, you either have finite time extinction, which is corresponding, which corresponds to the final K-Ricci flow, or you have the long-time solutions. The long-time solution, in fact, you can get a uniform scalar curvature-diamond bound, just like Pyramid's scalar curvature and diameter estimates. So these two somehow kind of go related. And the more difficult part is something in between, which is the finite time singularity. Is the finite time singularity, which is not in the category of finite time extinction? So, those finite time singularity are really the tricky parts. And the singularities are much worse. So, let me just use a couple of minutes to talk about proof. So, there are three new main ingredients. Ingredients The first one is the uniform scale curvature down. So let me just. So here, instead of looking at the original unnormalized flow, I can look at the normalized flow. Let me call it star star. Let me call it star star. This corresponds to the normalized Richie flow corresponding to the long-time solution of the unnormalized flow. So instead of the original unnormalized flow, I can just look at the normalized flow. So here we have three main ingredients in our approach. First of all, I wanted to use a scale curvature bound. The uniform scalar curvature bound. This is due to myself and Tian a while ago. So once you have the scalar curvature, you can do a lot of things. For example, one could apply this the collapsing version of, just look at the Or just look at just permanence of carbon non-collapsing using scalar curvature power. Even though this is long-term solutions, if you want to look at the recent work of Richard, you see that the scalar curvature plays a role even when the flow is collapsing. Even for long-term solution, you still can play around with bounded scale curvature and get non-collapsing or non-inflation control a boss. The second part is that it's kind of a drawback of this approach: is that in a collapsing case, you have a holomorphic fibrillation. And of course, you have a bunch of calabia fibers. And the trouble comes from these singular fibers. The singular fibers are the real deal. The single fibers are the real deal. Everything closes nicely. So the metric closes nicely. I want to let's say locally C0 to a limiting metric sitting on the base. Or let's say Z naught. What is Z naught? It's the original base variety minus all the singular fibers. You subtract all the bad sets, all these bad singular sets. So, away from these bad singular fibers, the match actually converges relatively nice. One can show actually it converges like in C, I think, even probably in C1, possibly. But then one can show that if you look at the metric completion of this. The metric completion of this nice smooth metric, the twisted K-lines, the metric on the base. This is a compact metric space, even though it's collapsing. So, this is this kind of a distance estimate is due to myself and my former student, Shing Fu. And my former students, Xing Fu Bing Guo, and myself. So, this is kind of a used collapsing distance control for collapsing case. This also works for the Calabiao case. It's actually quite a flexible and general type of techniques. Now, the third part is kind of the key for us, is the so-called improved relative. Relative volume comparison. So, this is kind of application of the work of Richard. His work, I think, a little more than a year ago. A little more than a year ago. So, what we can show is because he can quantitize the volume control of balls by using this Nash entropy. And Richard was able to derive various estimates, for example, the breeding estimates for the Nash entropy. And therefore, you can actually use that to compare both. Actually, use that to compare both once you have kind of the scalar curvature bound derived by myself and TF. So, what this basically shows that for a fixed number, let's say a sufficiently large number A, and any two points on the manifold with distance for any time, doesn't matter what. For any time, doesn't matter what time. As long as at time t, the distance x1, x2 is bounded by a, then the values are comparable. Let's just say unable. It's enough for us, a simpler case. This is good enough for us. So you can compare universe. So you can compare unit balls at different locations as long as the distance are controlled, and then the two volumes of these two balls center at different locations are the volumes are kind of controlled. This is kind of a really scaled version of Permanent Copper non-collapsing at different locations. You compare volumes non-collapsing at different locations. So here the key is that using this gradient estimate of national entropy divided by Entropy divided by Richard. So, of course, the equivalence depends on the choice of A, of course, and the original manifold, the initial. Once you have that, you combine one, two, three, and play around with some technical things and one can derive the distance estimate. So for the reaching curvature estimates, slightly different approach. It's more analytic along the line with the Yao or Permanent gradient estimate. Permium's gradient estimate kind of improved over the tricky part. So I think my time is up, and thank you. I'll stop here. Thank you very much, Jen. Let's give a round of applause. Thanks online and in person. And let's see, are there any questions? Let's maybe see if If the remote participants have some questions? Well, maybe I have a question. When we talk about the resolving these singularities, if you flow through the singularities, you said that they're caused by great and shrinking solitons and then they're By gradient shrinking solitons, and then they're resolved by the expanding solitons. So, can you prove that there's always an expanding soliton? Somehow, do you construct the flow through singularities by explicitly gluing in an expanding soliton? Or is it somehow an a posteriori statement? That's right. That's a great question. So, the tricky part is that what can we do? I mean, without, of course, I mean, without, of course, the perfect situation is that the flow would pick up the resolution by itself. But at the moment, very few examples. I think at least with the UN symmetry, one can actually construct examples actually the flow result singularity because the complex structure is not really changing. For example, you look at the C2 block one point, the simplest case. You contract the minus one curve and you continue on C2. It's a little bit like. Continue on C2. It's a little bit like just like the FIK case. Of course, you have to do a little bit more work to show that. Actually, one can show that the reach curvature, the curvature is the solution is type 1 solutions. And then you flow out, you kind of, in this case, you have only one choice. And you can show that these two solitons expanding and shrinking, they have the same tangent at infinity. This is kind of the gruing. You guess what. You guess what you should be, and you construct these kinds of starter transcripts by gluing. But the perfect situation is that it should be completely determined because this resolution should be unique. And what happens is that you can using the singularity coming from algebraic geometry, and you know that the singularity type, supposedly one can construct certain cones, and these coneship gives you the unique. Conceives should give you the unique expanding solotron. In fact, it should gives you the corresponding variety on the right-hand side. But at the moment, from flow, how to pick it up, one doesn't know. But so far, one can only just find the algebraic model to show that that's the unique possibility. Okay, but in order to construct, sorry, in order to construct the Richie flow, do you explicitly construct the Do you explicitly construct the expanding soliton metric? Well, at the moment, almost nothing is known about it. So I think probably the first step is that using information from algebraic geometry, you can build up this kind of relation. Perfectly, one should be able to directly use the Vichy to derive these types of a Southern transition. But I don't know. I don't know. It's not very much known. Even very few examples. Okay, but so in, so you, but you say, so in what case is it known that you can flow through these singularities? No one actually really checked. First of all, you have this FIK, local solution is done, done by FIK. I think it's the same. Global solutions, I don't think anyone has done anything, I guess. So, what I did. Done anything, I guess. So, what I did, so we played around with Binguo, we played it around, and it seems that it's at least for dimension two, one can do that. And in fact, you can look at premise mu function. It has a gap there. When you go through the singularity, the monotonousity has a gap, it's not continuous. Once you go through the singularity, but high dimension, even for high dimension, there are lots of quite a few examples corresponding to Mumford's. Corresponding to Mumford's kind of complex cobaltism examples corresponds to the wall crossing this comparative geometry, same thing. But I don't think anyone has really constructed these solutions yet to show that one can get these solutions. But in your work with Chen, you do construct flows through certain singularities. That's right, but that's not for the blow-up. So you don't get substance. You have to do type one blow-up. You have to do type one blow-up to get the solid sounds. Oh, yeah. Before the blow-up, it's just using the PD, you can just go through. You can just okay, yeah, but you have to do the rescale with now to show that the singularity model is exactly there. Oh, okay, okay. So then I get okay. So that, yeah, yeah, right. I get it now. Yeah, thanks. Okay. Okay, so somehow that you can construct the flow just by looking at the scalar PDE, but you don't know if an expanding soliton is actually responsible. An expanding soliton is actually responsible for the resolution. That's right, that's right. Yeah, that's right. Okay, local models also after type 1, type 1 blow up. Yeah, okay. Thanks. Yeah, thank you. Thanks. Any other questions? Hi, Suje. So you can prove the limit space is L G. No, no, if it's collapsing, one doesn't know. For complex dimension three, you can show it's algebraic variety. Beyond dimension three, we are not able to do that. Only for special cases one can. But in general, beyond dimension three, we can't at the moment. So improve for three dimension, right? Dimension three, up to dimension three. Dimension three, up to dimension three, yes. Uh, the limit at the limiting space, uh, first of all limited is algebra. So, this you show based on the estimate of damped boundary, you needed to know the damped estimate. Diameter estimate already known. We have the diameter estimate, but the problem is that this is the limiting space could be slightly larger. Slightly larger than the algebraic variety because you have a Lipschitz map. It might have some blow-up, but of course, it shouldn't be. So you have diameter estimate, but the diameter estimate wouldn't give you convergence to an algebraic variety. And because you don't have partial C0 here, there's no partial C0 in this case. So you mean so. you mean uh so low the local limit i mean in in in potential case like i mean so this limit is seven to uh grammar host of limited no you can always get certain gromoff host of limit but the problem is that the limit is very weak it's just a metric space you in order to identify this metric space with the algebraic variety you usually need to use the partial c0 estimate Well, uh, a partial C0 estimate. The partial C0 estimate is missing because the collapsing case, in a non-collapsing case, yes, one can show that. But for collapsing case, because for example, cheater coding theory wouldn't work in the collapsing case, you can't say too much about the tangent cone and you cannot really use partial CZ problem because of collapsing. Non-collapsing, yes, for general type, one can show that, no problem. Not clear. Is that clear? Are you? Do you have any follow-up questions? Okay, are there any other questions, possibly from the audience in Banff? See someone's raising a hand. Hi, this is Maria Garcia speaking. Speaking, I wonder if you remove the assumption on the canonical bundle in your main theorem. Can you still derive this boundarily for the maximum time existing? Yes, that's a great question. I think in here, we cheated a little bit. So here, when we say, so here we use semi-ampleness, algebraic strong, weak positivity. It's slightly stronger. It's slightly stronger than nav. So, in general, if you assume a bonus conjecture, they're the same. So, here, if you don't assume a balance conjecture, we actually assume slightly stronger assumption than the nav. But up for dimension three, a bonus conjecture always holds. So, up to dimension three, you don't have to, you don't need this condition at all. As long as you have a long-term solution, you always have this solution up to dimension three. In general, Uh, we have uh we are a little bit weaker because we don't we have to use semi-emponous. If we can replace semi-emponymed by nav, that essentially it's one step almost close to solving the abundance conjecture. That's the same problem here. That's kind of the same trouble here with algebraic geometry. Thank you. Any more questions? Yeah, if that's not the case, let's thank the speaker again for today's series of talks. Thank you. Thank you.
