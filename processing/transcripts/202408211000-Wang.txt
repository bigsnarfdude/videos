Uh thank you for the introduction. Uh so first I would I would like to thank the uh the organizers and special team for uh giving me the opportunity to speak uh about my own research. So uh this talk is about a uh immersed problem in uh cosmology uh or more generally in general relativity. So all right uh let's see uh this is the the plan of my talk. Uh so first I will spend some time on the uh physical background of this problem because the second Background of this problem because the setup of the problem, this problem comes from an application. So, and the setup for the PDE is slightly different from the one that we usually see. So, I will spend some time on the physical background. And then I will show the two main results for this inverse problem. And in the third part, I will so and also I will talk about the techniques that we use to solve this problem. And then in the last part, I will talk about integral geometry problem. Talk about the integral geometry problem that we get from the proof. So that's the plan. Alright, so now the problem that I'm interested in is actually a universe problem in general activity. So roughly speaking, we want to learn the structure of the universe by making measurements. And the easiest one, I think, to measure data to get is the line signal. The light signal. So, therefore, the general question here is: what information of the universe can be inferred by making this observation of light signals? So, here is a picture. One example is this cosmic microwave background, the CMB. And so, you will see this picture like this. And so, this was discovered by Penzas Wilson in 1964. And these days, we have multiple satellites to make very precise measurements of the CMB. CMB. So now, so roughly speaking, the CMB are the thermal remnants after the Big Bang. And what we have here is basically the temperature for the universe. And if you look at this picture here, right, so this is data from the Wilkinson microanisotropic probe. What you see here is the color map for our universe. And so you can see the dark region here, the blue region means that temperatures are cold. The blue region means that temperature is lower, and the red or yellow region means that temperature is higher. You see a lot of variations, but actually, the temperature is about 2.7 Kelvin. And the variation is very small. So even though we saw these colors, but the variation is only about 0.0002 degree. So it's a very small variation. But now these things can be measured very precisely. Can be measured very precisely. So now the question is: you know, from this data, right, can we find interesting astrophysical objects? So that's the idea. So now what do we know about, you know, currently about this data? So now first, like I said, you know, the temperature is very, isotropy is almost the same. Now, if you ignore the small variations and then you look at the isotropy of the observed CMB, Isotropy of the observed CMB. Then there's a famous theorem called the EGS theorem in 1968. Tells us that this isotropy of the observed CMB implies the isotropic and spatial homogeneity of the universe. So if you ignore the variations, then the universe should be isotropic and spatial homogeneous. So however, as we saw in the picture, there are small variations. So now this small anisotropics The small anisotropies, because of the small anisotropies, it's more desirable to prove an almost EGS theorem. That means if your observed CMB is close to isotropy, not exactly, but close to isotropy, can you say that the universe is close to some background, isotropic, homogeneous background? So this is more like a stability question, right? So but how close, right? So I use quote mark here to because you know the we need to define the closeness. We need to define the closeness for this question. Now, and also, this is a more general answer, right? So, I mean, if you just care about the closeness, it's a quantitative result. But then you can ask more, right? From the anotopies, what can you recover? You know, what can you say about the astrophysical objects? So that's more like a inverse problem. You know, you want to actually recover something from the anatropy. So now for this problem. Probably. So now for this problem here, the cosmologists have studied this problem, especially Stoiger, Martens, and Ellis in 1995. They actually have a series of papers to study this problem, this almost EGS theorem. And more recently, Rinstrom has a book on the future stability of the universe. And there's one very interesting section about this type of theorem, because this theorem does not hold all the time. Hold all the time, and then you need certain conditions to make sure that you have this property. So now my goal is to prove a more qualitative version of this kind of theorem, to give a very precise statement for this closeness. But unfortunately, I haven't succeeded yet, because this is a nonlinear problem. I'll discuss in the end of the talk some challenges for the nonlinear problem. Challenges for the nonlinear problem. But what I can do now is to solve the linearized problem and not only prove this almost EGS theorem, but also solve the inverse problem. From the linearized version of the problem, we can recover some metric perturbations from the anotropics. So that's the result that I'm going to do. So it's a linearized version. Alright, so now let's look at the formula's mathematical problem. So first I will consider So, first I will consider this problem for a fixed background. So, this is the FRRW cosmology model, where you take the manifold m to be 0 to infinity times R3, and then you take the Lorentz metric, minus dt square plus A square T d dx square. Now here, basically this A is a smooth positive function, and in this model, you know, you can think, well, the universe starts from the big band and then start to inflate. So, this factor A here tells us. factor A here tells us how fast the universe is expanding. Now depending on the matter model you use, for example if the universe is dominated by radiation, the factor is about t to the half. But if you change the matter model, t could be t to the 2 or 3. So this factor, but in that case, we're assuming this is a smooth positive function. And by a simple, it's not hard to observe that this metric is actually conformal to the Minkowski space. To the Minkowski space. So our result actually works for a metric of this type, but for simplicity, I will take this A to B 1 so that we can look at the Minkowski metric. So the background is basically Minkowski. So now this is the background, isotropic homogeneous background. Now, what about the perturbation, right? Because so now for the actual So now for the actual universe, we're going to consider a metric perturbation, this mg of this mg0. So now here it's a very brief illustration of the evolution of the universe. So now according to the Big Bang theory, our universe starts from this singularity represented by the dotted line. And then there's a very short period of time, the early universe, where a lot of complicated high-energy physics is going on. And then what we are And though what we are interested is in the moment where the temperatures in the universe start to drop so that the photons are formed and they start to travel freely in the universe. So therefore this is the surface of last scattering. And then we look at the so after this moment then the photons start to travel in space-time and then we observe them here. This is the surface of observation where we make the observation of the CMB. So now if we ignore So now if we ignore, basically, you know, if we ignore the photon interactions and all the kinetic effects, then this is a geometric problem. Because you see for every point here, there's a photon that goes in space-time that we observe here. And then you can formulate this as a geometric problem. So, and I have considered a geometric problem, but because this is a PDE workshop, so here I want to show you the results by using the kinetic model so that we consider, we take into account. That we consider, we take into account the photon interaction, the scattering, and actually, if you want to go beyond the surface line scattering, and then you cannot ignore these effects. So you have to take into account all these effects. Alright, so, but that's roughly where we make the observation and where did it come from. Alright, now there are two things we need to do. Okay, so first, we need to Okay, so first we need to, because I said I'll work on the linear linearization of the problem. So first I will consider a linearization of the metric with respect to this background. So that's one linearization. And then I will describe the photon distribution by using the linear Bolshevik equation. So now for the metric, okay, now there's, you know, in the perturbation theory for CM isotropy, this is well developed. CMI isotropy, this is well developed in cosmology. And so, in this talk, I will consider the special type of perturbation where we consider G epsilon is a one-parameter family of a metric perturbation, and it's of a scalar type, so that the perturbation is represented by this phi as a scalar function, and this epsilon psi is another scalar function, and then there's some higher-order perturbation terms. Okay, so this will be ignored. But then on the linearization level, the perturbation. But then on the linearization level, the perturbation is fine sat. And now comes the important thing. So this is still an arbitrary Lorentzian metric. There is no structure, very little structure on that. But when we consider the evolution of the universe, so this g epsilon, this g should satisfy the Einstein equation with a certain matter model. So it's not an arbitrary Lorentz metric. And therefore, for this case, when we have the scatter field, When we have the scalar field, and then you do the linearization of the Einstein equation, you will get a very simple equation called the Bardini's equation for this phi and psi. So first you would derive that this phi is equal to psi under certain assumptions, physical assumptions. And then this phi will satisfy, or psi will satisfy this, it's like a wave equation. So basically it's a wave equation, but there's some dapping term and then term and then a zero-to-order term. So this is called Barden's equation. But this equation really comes from the fact that you consider this value of the metric which satisfies the Einstein equation with a proper matter model. So that is the perturbation metric perturbation that we're going to consider. Alright, so now we describe the photon distribution. So now to describe the photon distribution, we Describe the photon distribution, we set this f epsilon to be the photon distribution function, and we'll assume that this f epsilon satisfies the linear Boltzmann equation because we want to take into account the kinetic effects. So basically you can write this, this gamma epsilon is null-judici. Now along the null judicic, so this f epsilon is actually a function defined in x variable, the space, you know, this space variable, and also the phase variable here. Also, the phase variable here, which lives on the zero mass shell. So now, this function, so this is the basically, you know, you have the derivative along the judiciary, and then this part here, the Cf epsilon, denotes the interaction term. And so here I consider a linear Boltzmann equation because for the full Bolshevik, you have nonlinear terms. But here I ignore the nonlinear term, and this is only the linear Boltzmann equation. So now So now, but this epsilon, because we consider this equation for this family matrix. So there's an epsilon dependency. So all these equations, these Bolsonar equations are considered for that background. And now we do a linearization for this equation. So we select a linear Bosnian equation for this background. You do a linearization for the background. So it's a linear. This is really linear theory. And so then you write down this expansion, assume you have this f epsilon f0 plus epsilon f1, etc. And then this f0 is just the background photon distribution. And usually you can assume that this is a Planck distribution given by the following form, but you know, it's just the background. So now what we care about is this equation for F1. So because this is the describe the linear describe the the the linear uh theory for for this problem. Now this f now you have to uh come you know look at this equation and use the you know look at this equation together with this expression to find the linearization. Uh there's some calculation that we need to uh to do. But uh after the uh this this calculation we get the following uh Boltzmann equation. So basically uh u So basically u is f1 and then we have this equation dtu plus theta dot gradient u plus the sigma. Sigma denotes the absorption term. And then this is equal to k u this is the scattering term. And then you have f which is the source. So basically this is what you do after the linearization. You look at the order epsilon terms. Okay, so then you get this equation. Now the The important thing here is that this F term is actually related to the metric perturbation that we assume. So basically this F has a very explicit expression in terms of this phi, this function phi. I didn't show it here, but you can think, well, essentially this F is the metric perturbation. And now for our inverse problem, this ends up with the following, right? So you assume that the at t equal to zero, u is T to the zero, u is zero. And now you make the observation of this u and t to the capital T. This is where we do the measurements of the CMB, which is on a linearization level. So you make this observation, and then the inverse problem is by this observation, can we determine this F? Because F is related to the metric perturbation. So therefore, this is really a inverse source problem for this Olsman equation. Ozma equation. So from this measurement, we want to determine F, the source term. Alright, so now that's the setup for this problem. Okay, alright. So now what are the main results? So first let's look at some previous results for this type of problem. Now for the stage ring problem, if you ignore the dependency on t, okay, so now there's no t to no t variable. Now this is a state stream travel. Now this is a stitching problem, and then there's a large literature for this problem. Because this problem is related, you know, it has applications in optical imaging. And so there's some nice review papers by Glenbau and Plomen Stephanov. So for this problem, people have studied the determination of both the sigma, this absorption coefficient, scattering kernel, and also the source term. And you can also study this problem. So, and you can also study this problem under many manifolds. So, I will not say more about this problem, but this problem is well studied. Now, for the non-striction problem, there are several type of results. So, first, if you consider the boundary measurements, usually people study this problem from the boundary measurement. You consider a bounded set, and then you make measurements on the cylinder, and you make measurement on the cylinder. Make measurement on the cylinder. Now, if you have the boundary measurement, if you can control the source on the boundary and the make measurement on the boundary, it's like now this is called the albedo operator. Then this problem has been, it's like a hyperbolic DT map problem that I just discussed, I talked about yesterday. So, and then the determination of a sigma k, this is studied. Okay, so spinasoid, and you know, this is, there are a lot of work for that. But this uses a lot of. Of work for that. But this uses a lot of measurements. You have to control the source and also make the measurement. Now, in the last 10 years, not 10 years, last few years, there is actually a lot of interest for this nonlinear problem. Now, for this problem, you actually consider a nonlinear Bolsonar equation. There's an interaction term in the equation. And for example, Lai, Wu Man, and Yang, they study the construction of the collision kernel, and there's some further work by. And there's some further work by Lion Joe. And also, there's some work for, you know, in this work, they consider the source-to-solution map, and then they consider reconstruction of the background geometry. So, but for all this work, they use the non-linear interaction of the waves. And for that, you need to send in several waves for them to interact. So, now, but this, so, therefore, you know, for this category, all these results requires All these results require multiple measurements. Multiple measurements. Now, for the inverse source problem, this belongs to the category of a single measurement problem, because you have only one source, although you can make measurements on the boundary or at Cauchy's surface, but you only have one source. So you cannot perturb the source. So th therefore this problem is more difficult. Problem is more difficult. There are some uniqueness and stability results by using this Karman estimate method by Kribanov, Pamyatni, and Machida Yamamoto. So they're the two groups, and they work out this problem. And so for this method, usually you need certain conditions on the sigma and k, so the absorption coefficient and the scattering kernel. Usually you need that the sigma is independent of the time variable. So and also you need certain conditions on the source. So for example in this workman GDM model you need the source to be of the form fx theta and then times another function r t x theta where this r so that the dependent in t is only in this r part and this r is they assume this r is positive and it's null. So therefore the thing is that they need to they want The thing is that they want to determine this F, but they assume, but the actual source term is the product type, and the dependency in T is only in R, which we know. So you need certain conditions for this method to work. So now I will describe our result. So we actually have done two results on the stable determination of the source term. Okay, so alright. Okay, so alright. Now uh first I will introduce this notation. So uh let's consider this uh Minkowski space-time with this uh uh signature minus plus plus plus. Now what I need is to introduce this uh uh cutoff in the uh uh in the Fourier space. So this gamma sp is the space-like vectors, so this is the tau cos in R3, so that tau square is less than cosi norm square. So this is the uh uh the set of space-like vectors. The set of space-like vectors. And then I will use this phi to be the characteristic function of this gamma sp in R4. And then we define this phi D as a Fourier multiplier. So basically you just look at the Fourier transform of F in this space like Cole. So I will explain why we need this later. So and then you define this Fourier multiplier. So this thing would, you know, this phi D F will tell us the information of the Fourier transfer of F in this. The first transfer of F in this space-like vectors. So now the first result is this. Okay, so we assume that sigma, sorry, the absorption coefficient is a function of only the t variable. So here the sigma does not depend on x, but it depends on t. And then we assume that the scattering kernel k and f are subordinate in some complex set. And then the result is that there exists an open and dense set U such that. Such that the if you look at this scattering kernel in this open dense set, okay, and F is in H2, then this F can be uniquely determined by this UT. UT is the measurement at the, you know, capital T, T equal to capital T. So we have the unique determination, and also we have the stability estimate, so that is phi df, this H2 norm, is bounded by C times UT to certain norm. To certain norm. Okay, so we have both the uniqueness result and also the stability result. So of course the stability only holds for this, essentially we can determine, you know, we can recover this Fourier transfer of F in the space-like directions. All right, and also I should say that this is a so-called generic result. It does not work for all K, but it works for K in the open density set. So that's the first result. Okay, so now the second result is the following. So because remember, you know, when we derived the physical model, we assumed that this metric perturbation would satisfy a Bardin's equation, which is essentially a wave equation. So now for the second result, I will assume that the source F is actually a solution of the Cauchy problem for this wave equation. So I can consider a more general wave operator here. And then we look at this F, the source term that satisfies this Cauchy problem. This Cauchy problem. So now this is the actually, this is the correct problem for this CMB inverse problem. And now the second result is also a generic result. We assume that this F is the solution of the Cauchy problem. Now then there exists an open dense set for both the absorption coefficient and the scattering kernel. So that this initial data F1, F2, F, because you see this is a pushy problem. This is a cushy problem. So, if you determine F1, F2, determine F. So, either way, you can determine F or the initial data. So, here I said that the initial data is uniquely determined by the final measurement of the photon distribution. And then we also have a stability estimate. So, these are the two results. And here I emphasize on the stability result because, remember, one of my goals is to prove this almost EGS theorem, which is a quantity result. Theorem, which is a quantitative result like that. So, that if you if you make, you know, if your UT is small, then that means, you know, this F is small. That means if you observe the photon distribution close to the background, then the metric perturbation should be close to the background. So, that's the kind of results that that's why I emphasize a lot on the stability result. Of course, this is only for the linear problem. Eventually, the goal is to prove for the nonlinear problem. All right, so that's the Alright, so that's the result. And now the sketch for the proof. Okay, so now the key idea for the proof, you know, we follow this spirit in a paper by Stefan Woman for the inverse source problem for the stationary transport equation with no dependence on T. Now, the idea is the following. So you look at the Boltzmann equation and you decompose it into several parts. So the first part is just pure transport. Is just pure transport, you know, this transport part. And then this T1 is you include the absorption part. And then finally, you have the set T, which you add the scattering part. Now, both T0 and T1, for these two operators, we can solve it explicitly. So for example, you solve this T1u equal to F. For T1u equal to F, you can solve it explicitly in the following form. Now you have this integral. Have this integral. So you have this integral from 0 to t, and then times kappa, which is a function tx as theta, and then times f. So this f is the source term. Now you look at f and s and x plus s theta. I will explain what's the meaning for that, but this basically gives us an integration of this couple times f along certain lines. Very much like the Judiciary Rate, you know, the X-ray transformation. The Judiciary, no, the X-ray transform, but there's an important difference. Okay, I will explain in a minute. But here, this kappa is related to this sigma because we're solving this T1 U equal to F. So this absorption coefficient will come into this kappa, which I call weight. So there's a weight for this transform, and it comes in this way. So now, okay, so the idea is that we solve T1U equal to F explicitly, and then we treat this. F explicitly, and then we treat this k term as a perturbation. So then you look at the inverse problem: you have this equation xf equal to ut. Ut is the final measurement. And then you do this decomposition, which is our cup, and there's an error term. Now, so then the goal is to, for proving our results, we want to actually invert this operator x in a proper sense. So the way we do this is. sense. So the way we do this is first we apply the formal adjoint of this al kappa. Oh, I think I yeah this oh I've got to say that this this integral here I denote this integral by L kappa. Okay so this yeah this L kappa. Oh yeah is here. So basically you apply the adjoint of L kappa to this X and then you have two terms this L kappa star L kappa and then there's star L kappa and then there's another term L kappa star E. The main part of the proof is to show that this L kappa star L kappa, this part is invertible. And then you show that the other term is actually compact in the proper sense. So then you can use the analytic Franklin theory to get the invertibility first for sigma k in a dense set. Okay, so first you do this for a dense set, but then for this But then, for things in the set, you can actually prove a good stability. Because this is actually invertible. We have a good stability. And using that stability, we can extend the result to the open set. So therefore, the key for this argument to work is to show the invertibility of this operator here. Now, the compactness actually needs some work. And actually, that's why we need, let me see. Let me see. I can go back a little bit. Oh. So, actually, to show that I will need, okay, so here you see I need some regularity assumption on the open dense set, the same fitness C6. This is stronger than the original result instead of a woman's paper. It's because we need to use this high regularity to gain some compactness. So, this is used in the compactness part. Part. But yeah, that can be done. And therefore, the main part is to show the invertibility of this operator. And then I will explain how we show this invertibility and what's the challenge here. So the challenge is the following. So now if you look at the static transport equation without the dependency in the T-variable, then this L-kappa is actually a weighted GDC rate transform. Okay, and for some remaining manifold. And then, if you look at this operator L kappa star L kappa, then this is ellipsoid cassine dimension operator, and we have very good understanding for the invertibility of this operator up to error. We have a good understanding. So that's what Pluman, Stefanoff, and Guntherman did in their papers to use the fact that this is a elliptic suit of operator. Now, for the linear Bolson equation, now this al-Kappa is. Equation, now this alkal is actually a weighted Lyric transform. And the problem is that this operator is not elliptic. So, you know, there is a region where this, from the microlocal sense, the symbol vanishes in a very large set. Now, if it vanishes, then we can't get information stably from that part. So, therefore, the key idea for our approach to work is to restore this ellipticity by either using this special cutoff. This special cutoff, or using the parametrizes of the wave equation. So that's how, you know, that's why we can get this stability results. Because without this constraint, then this problem is ill-posed. And we do not expect to have this good stability. Okay, so now that's the now we get to this part about the integral geometry problem. Okay, so now let's look at this transform that I've been talking about. Now, this library trans, okay, so first Lyric transform, okay. So, first let's consider the Lybrid transform without the weight. Okay, now why this is the Lybrid transform? We consider this Minkowski space, n plus one-dimensional Minkowski space. Now, I want to look at the null jadistics or light-like jeodisics. And in this case, actually, there is a very simple parameterization for this null jealousy, because, for example, you can consider this is your Rn, and then this is the Your Rn, and then this is the T direction. Now, what are the non-judicious or light-line judiciary? So, now for every point X, I think I use X. Oh, I use Z. Okay. So, for every Z in Rn, now you look at all the knowledge from this point. That will be, so now first you take a unit vector. So, I think this is theta. This is a unit vector in this Rn. This Rn. And now the null vector will be this vector here, which is 1 and theta. I think I denote this by V. No, okay. So now this vector here will be 1 theta. It's a null vector for this Minkowski metric. And then the null judici will be the line from this point. So therefore, the parameterization for all this, and now if you change the theta, you can get another, you know, you can get all the non-linear. You can call all the knowledge of this based at this point, which is form this code, right? So that's all the knowledge at this point. But if you vary this point, then you get all the knowledge of this. So therefore, the set of all this knowledge or light rays are parametrized in the following way, which can be identified with the set Rn times Sn minus 1. So that's the parameterization. And now the Lightray transform defined the following way that you integrate, you take a function in Rn plus 1. In Rn plus 1. Now you integrate this function along this null judiciary so that we have this f of s. You integrate this f along, you know, the s and z plus s theta. So that's the integration along this null judiciary. So now for the transform that we are considering, there should be a weight, right? So there should be a kappa here. But so for the time being, let's consider this transform and now indicate what needs to be. Indicate what needs to be changed if we have a weight. So actually, this transform can be defined on Lorenzi manifold. And by the very definition, you see that this is very similar to the actual transform, Random transform. But the difference is that for this problem, we only integrate the function along this null judiciary, or light-like judicics. And if you do this for the actuary transform, then The for the actuary transform, then you would have to integrate along all the lines, not just the libraries. So, therefore, you know, in particular, if you look at the, if you compare the random transform in R2 and the library transform, so here, for a random transform, you have a function on the plane, and you integrate the function along all the possible lines. But for the library, you only integrate the function along these lines of these two directions. So, you lose a lot of information by. You lose a lot of information by considering this transform. And that's the main challenge here. So now, Guilleman actually, there has been some work for this transform because it naturally appeared in some geometric problems. So Guilleman studied this Larry transform on the compactification for R2 plus 1. And because he encounters a problem from the Lorenz version of the Zoe problem, because in this case, if you compactify R2 plus 1 in the correct way, then the knowledge of this is Way, then the knowledge thesis will be periodic with the same period. So, and then he Guilleman considers Lorentzian version of the ZOL problem, and then he studies the problem. And he already observed that there are some limitations on the ability for reconstructing f from the Ray transform. Because if you put this in a very naive way, because we only use light arrays to find the function if the function, you know, if the object travels faster than the speed of the light, then we are not supposed to see it. Supposed to see it. But this statement is more like a stability statement. It's not the injectivity statement because for this transform, in certain cases, we do have injectivity. For example, in the Minkowski case, we know that this transform is injective, a compact support is misfunction. And Stephanov has a result for this proof of the support theorem and also the injective day for this analytic Lorentzian manifold under certain conditions. Certain conditions. And then for Imar Verta, he proved this using Pestov identity method, but his result works for a pseudo-Romanian manifold with certain signatures. And so if his Mohammed Imar Verta Aksanand considered this injectivity problem for stationary and static space-time. Basically, you know, for all the known results, although we know some known injectivity results, but they are mostly restricted to the case where you have an Restricted to the case where you have analyticity, or you can reduce the problem to a Riemannian problem. So, but in general, for the Lorentzian problem, if you have a metric which depends on both t and x, then this problem is widely open. So, okay, now and also if you add a weight to the transform, you know, the uh many of this injectivity results will not uh will will not be true. So so currently this re injectivity results are very rigid for uh these settings. Very rigid for the settings. Okay, so now to see, but this is just injectivity. So to see what information can be actually recovered stably, let's look at this normal operator equal to L star L, because this is the operator that we're going to use in our proof. So now for this L without a weight, we can actually calculate what is Calculate what is operator n, and it's actually a Fourier multiplier given by this integral, whereas the symbol k, if you look at the symbol k, is of the following form, where the symbol is non-zero on the space-like vectors, but it's zero otherwise. So, this is why for the first results, we need to restrict to the space-like vector, because here, this is the homogeneous distribution. When it can see norm square. Homogene distribution. When C norm square minus tau square is less than zero, then this will be zero. So therefore, this k here is not an elliptic symbol. It's only elliptic on the space-like direction. So as a result of this, okay, actually we can say a bit more about the structure of this operator. Okay, so the symbol vanishes on the boundary of the Okay, let me see. Yeah, actually, the symbol would vanish on the set when c square is equal to tau square, which is exactly the null vectors. So, and because it has a normal type of singularity there, we can describe the micro-local structure of the symbol or this operator in this framework of this parallel distribution introduced by Guilleman Woman and Maurice Woman. So, I will now say to So, I will not say too much about it, but there's a way to describe the micro-local structure for this operator precisely. And from there, you can actually get the information for recovering certain singularities of f from this normal operator. So, in particular, by using this result, we know the following. So, if your f if your function f has only space-like singularities, then we can recover the singularity stably from, we can recover the singularity from the non-linear. We can recover the similarity from the norm operator. Now, if you have a time-like similarity, then they are gone. And also, this result can be extended to Lorentz manifolds, and I have some work for this problem. But for Li-Light vectors, it's trickier. And there's even some counterexamples for the Light-Light vector. But for us, let's just focus on the space-like and the time-like vectors. So now, to show you the instability, so the The long story short, right? So, if you look at the reconstruction, okay, so if you want to reconstruct your f from this nf, this result tells us that you can stably recover the singularity in the space-like vectors, and otherwise it's not. So, we actually carry out a numerical study for this problem. So, this is joint work with my colleagues Julian Chong. With my colleagues Julian Chong and Lou Konisk. So we consider this Labrador transform for scalar functions and then we develop, you know, we analyze the Labrador iteration for solving this LF equal to M in L2. So it takes this form. And then we use the microlocal structure of the normal operator to analyze what information F can be recovered and what are the possible artifact phenomena. And we also try some regularization methods such as FISTA. So now here is some numerical Now, here is some numerical example. Now, this is one example. For this true image here, all the singularities of this function is actually in the space-like direction. So, in this example, we expect to recover all the information of this f in a relatively stable way. As you can see for the Landomiber iteration Tikonov recognization method, this is almost the case. There are some numerical instabilities near the tip of the cone, but mostly all the singularities are resolved. You know, all the singularities are resolved. Now, FISTA works actually better because it promotes the sparsity. So, that works a little bit better. Now, if you have the example where you have the time-like vectors, for example, this one, for the cylinder, the top and bottom, if you look at the singularity, they are all in the time-like direction. Now, for all this factor, these directions, it's going to be very difficult to reconstruct. As you can see, for Landweber and Tikhonov, they cannot. For Landweber and Tikhonov, they cannot recover the top and bottom surfaces because this is where the instability manifests. And also, if you look carefully, there are some artifact phenomena from the top and bottom. And we actually can analyze why they are of this form, because of the structure of the operator. So now, but if you restrict yourself to the space-like vectors, then this operator can be stable. Operators can be simply inverted. That's how we get the first result. Okay, so now for the second result, right? So for the second result, we need to consider this transform acting on functions that satisfy a wave equation, Cauchy-Proton form for the wave equation. So now the re, okay, so now if you take into account the wave equation, then this result can be, the stability result can be greater improved. So for example, for this case, let's just consider a For this case, let's just consider a simple wave equation, so where you have this dt square plus c squared c is a constant sound speed. And then you consider f satisfy this Cauchy problem. Now for the Lyric transform, now we consider Lyric transfer acting on this F. And this is proved in a joint work with Andrew Swashi and myself in 2022. Basically, for C bigger than 0, less than negative 1, we can stably recover. Stably recovered, so this LF uniquely determines F and the initial data F1F2. And also, we have the good stability estimate for determining this F1F2. So remember, this is only for the reduced problem. Originally, we had to do this for this alpha kappa. Here there's no weight. But this result, after this, we have to generalize this result to the case with the weights and deal with the more general. With the weights and deal with the more general wave operator. So now the okay, so in the next few minutes, I want, okay, so let me briefly explain how why this is true. So now, intuitively, the idea is the following. Because if you look at the wave equation, if the sound speed, because here it's very important that the sound speed is less than or equal to 1. If the sound speed is less than or equal to 1, then Is less than or equal to 1, then basically the waves will propagate within the light cone. So that means all the information will be constrained in the light cone. And now within the light column, actually, we would expect to recover, because everything will travel slower than the speed of light, so therefore in this case, we actually expect to recover all the information. Now, mathematically, how do we prove this? We need to look at this composition. So, we have this L is the Library transform. Now, you apply this to the parametrics for the wave equation or fundamental solution of the Cauchy problem. And then you would expect that this composition would have better micro-local structure and stability structure. So, there are two ways to see this stability, you know, this good structure. You know, so first method is in this work with Andrew Shrashi, and then I give a new method in this work. Give a new method in this work. So now, for the, okay, so now the, because we consider this, okay, so because we consider this very simple wave equation, we can, sorry, I should say, no, if we consider the simple wave equation with a constant wave speed, you can solve it by using, you know, Fourier transform. So in this case, you can express the solution for the Cauchy problem in the following way, where this B plus, E minus, these are also the E plus, E minus, these are all certain integrals. And this H and H1, H2, these are reparametrized Cauchy data. So, but in a more general setting, if you have a wave operator with some perturbations, you can still do a similar construction, but you have to use this parametrics construction by Deuce and Malcolm Munder. But for all this problem, we can find an oscillating representation of the solution operator. Solution operator. So now, what we do is we use this expression here and then we compose this with the library transform to see what we get. Okay, so wait a second. Oh yeah. Yeah, so we look at this L E plus minus. Now then the idea is that we need to show that this operator can be inverted in a proper way. So now for the first method, the way we invert this operator The way we invert this operator is to do a sort of a back projection. So we integrate in this V. I used theta before. So basically, I integrate over this theta variable. And therefore, I introduce this operator I phi, which is, you know, you multiply your f by this phi, but then you integrate out this v variable. So what we get is actually a function, you know, on this Rn. And then there are some technicalities, but the idea is that if you apply But the idea is that if you apply this operator i phi to this l and this e plus minus, this operator is a k phi, then after some work and show that essentially this is an elliptic pseudo-j operator. So after you integrate out this v variable, which is essentially a by projection, and then you can show that this is an elliptic operator. Now, once you have this microlocal structure, then you go back to this equation L F and then you can And then you can make some adjustments on the weight to get an equation that you can solve for this H1, H2, up to some error terms, but these error terms are sufficiently good so that we can remove them because they are more regular. They're not smooth. In this case, they are smooth, but in general, there are some more regular operators than the leading term. And therefore, we can see. term and therefore we can solve these terms away to get this H1, H2 from this L F. So that's the idea. But the key idea here is to show that this operator are elliptic Susan Sch operators. So now that's the first way that we can see this. Now the second method is to, this is a common idea in integral geometry, is that you look at the normal operator. So here we have this operator. So here we have this operator LE, but then you apply the former adjoint to this LE, so E star L star. And so now there's some issue with this approach because if you just look at this operator, it's not well defined. And now you have to fine-tune this operator a little bit so that you can use some of the information in this operator to solve this problem. And the way that The way that we do here, roughly speaking, okay, yeah, alright, so I'll show the idea in the next slide. But one reason for doing this approach is actually inspired by another work by Menard, Paternan, and Nico. So they studied this non-parameterbation inference problem for this X-ray transform. Basically, you look at this X-ray transform, but then you Transform, but then you consider a case where your measurement is contaminated by errors or noises. And then you look at the inverse problem, what you can reconstruct under these noises. And for this problem, I want to develop a method that I can extend their results for to this problem. So their method actually relies heavily relies on the structure of this normal operator. So that's that's one motivation that why I consider this problem. That's why I consider this problem for considering this approach. Now, for this approach to work, the thing we can do here, it's a bit complicated, but roughly speaking, this novel operator, L star L, it's not an elliptic pseudo-operator. So if you look at the Schwarz kernel, there are two kinds of similarities. So one is a singularity, one type of singularity is on the diagonal. If you look at the Schwarz kernel, one singularity is on the diagonal, which corresponds to similar. On a diagonal, which corresponds to a suitable operator. But then there's another part which is a flow-out. Now, for this approach to work, we look at the part on the flow-out. We have to stay away from the singularity on the diagonal. So that's why here I introduced the two color functions, this chi and chat theoda, to apply to this left and right of this n, so that we can stay away from this singularity on the diagonal. And then we can use only the flow of part to compose with. To compose with this E and E star. If you look at the last line, you look at this, you apply E star on the left and the E on the right. Now, with this cutoff, and then you can show by using some FIO calculus to show that this is a well-defined elliptic system operator. So that's this approach. So now after this, you can do the same thing. You can set up the equation to solve for the Cauchy data. Okay, so. Okay, so this is the last thing. So there's some problem that I want to address in the near future. So, of course, this the nonlinear problem. So, this talk is only about the linear problem. So, for the nonlinear problem, okay, so it's not just you replace the equations by a nonlinear equation or undo this linearization process. Because if you do this nonlinear problem, you have to work with the, because here we derive the linearized problem from the Einstein quake. Derived the linearized problem from the Einstein equation. If you undo this linearization, you have to look at the Einstein equation. And for that, you cannot work with a nice setup like scalar function or compact supported scalar metric perturbation. So you have to work with a non-compact supported metric perturbation with tensor perturbations. So it's a much more complex problem. It's not just you replace the equation by a non-equation. You have to address the tensor-type perturbation first. You have to address the tensor type perturbation first and consider the non-compact supported perturbation first, and then you can resolve this. You can hope to study a non-linear problem. Of course, if you just add a non-linear term to the Bolshevik equation, that's fine. But otherwise, there's a lot of work to do. And then there's another problem that I hope to learn more is about this statistic model because this is a workshop for probabilistic and deterministic PDE. Can determine state PDE. And but you know, I know very little about this. But because you know, from the physics model, actually, the inertial data for the photon distribution is not a deterministic quality. It should be a Gaussian distribution. And therefore, what is the correct model for the, you know, if you take this into statistical behavior of the photon distribution into account, then what should be the correct inverse problem to study? And the last one is the partial data problem. Because here, for all the results, Problem because here, for all the results I showed, I assume that the Formula distribution is observed on the whole Cauchy surface. But in practice, we can only do this near the Earth, for example. And therefore, there's also a part of the problem that needs to be addressed. So I think I'll stop here. Thank you very much.
