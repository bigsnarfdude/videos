Are you with us? Yes. Okay, hello. Okay. So, Dr. Hu is the head of the Department of Sustainability at Rochester Institute of Technology. Her research focuses on operations research and data analytics with application in sustainable manufacturing, renewable energy systems, sustainable supply chain design, and sustainable agriculture. So, it's a pleasure to have you with us. The floor is yours. Thank you. So, I was talking to Anthony earlier that I wish I could be there in person. Looks like it's a very beautiful place. So, let me share my screen on the slides. I was told that I have 15 minutes in total. Can you hear me okay? Can you hear me okay? Yes, yes. Okay. All right. I thought I'll talk about. Yeah, I thought I'll talk about the type of work we are doing for about maybe 35 to 40 minutes and then we can leave some time for questions. All right. So the topic I want to share with the group is some hybrid models that we've worked on in the last few years to improve crop yield prediction. So prior to my Prediction. So, prior to my job here at Rochester Institute of Technology, I was a faculty at Iowa State, which is a land-grant institution. So, the crop yield prediction I was working on was mainly on corn and soybean. Okay, so let's get to it. Oh, I thought before I talk about my research, I'll introduce myself a little bit. That way, you know who you're talking to. All right. All right, so I'm originally from China. I did my undergraduate, let me get the pointer up that way. So my undergraduate was in China in sort of mechanical engineering and also had a due degree in management science. Then I came to the United States and did my master and PhD in industrial engineering. That's what I learned all. That's where I learned all about operations research, data science, and decision making in general. And after my PhD, I became a faculty, basically go through the ranks of tenure check as a faculty at Iowa State University. My primary appointment is at the Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering. But during that time, I became affiliated to Affiliated to what's called Plant Science Institute. That's where I learned and worked with people who are in the agricultural sector on crop yield prediction, genetics. And GPSA stands for Graduate Program for Sustainable Agriculture. BEI is Bioeconomy Institute. I'm not sure whether the attendants are familiar with the Middle West of the United States. So I was. States. So I was sort of in the middle of the corn belt. So Bioeconomy Institute is focusing on improving the profitability as well as environmental impact of agricultural and follow-up production system, like, for example, biofuel production. And BCB stands for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. This is well some of the genomic selection and genomic prediction piece. And genomic prediction piece, POS, and I'm not going to talk about that in today's talk. And last year, I took a leadership position at Rochester Institute of Technology. I'm the head of the Department of Sustainability, but I also affiliated with data science because of my interest in the operational research as well as data analytics. So just to put in perspective so that you know who I'm talking about. So, that you know who I'm talking about. I'm by no means an expert in agriculture, but I work with people who know it. Another slide is about my research. So, as introduced earlier, my core areas is really in the operations research mathematic modeling. But in that time, I've expanded to data analytics or big data analytics. I teach courses in this domain as well as doing research. This is a group. This is a group picture of my research group at Iowa State. Of course, this is before COVID, because I'm not well in Ask yet. And in terms of applications, there are all kinds of applications, including supply chain design, manufacturing and production. Those are actually went back to my PhD study. And after I joined Iowa State, I worked on renewable energy systems parameter lead. Systems primarily biofuel production and also some biopower as well. Sustainable agriculture: where we look at crop yield predictions, one of them. But in addition to that, we also look at management practice, irrigation scheduling, fertilizer application, those type of things. And then the bottom two are more of the informatics. I'm not going to go into too much detail. So, today I like to talk about two. So, today I'd like to talk about two things that we work on recently with the goal to first improve the crop yield production and also try to attack the transparency or interpretability of machine learning model. So, for this specific study, we are looking at coupling machine learning and crop yield modeling to include the yield prediction. MOSEN is one of Mohsen is one of my PhD students. He actually graduated earlier this year, and now he is working for ClimateCorps, which is a company focused on using machine learning method for agricultural applications in general. And Sotirius is a professor at Iowa State in the ergonomy department. All right. All right, so a couple introduction background information. I may be preaching to the choir. I don't know what's the background. I wish I was in the room at least so we can get to put face to name and then get to know people. But with COVID, everything I'm not able to travel. Now, quick introduction, there have been advancement in machine learning and as well as in the simulation domain. As well as in the simulation domain on crop modeling. So each provides unique capabilities as well as shortcomings. So far, you know, utilization of machine learning or crop modeling for yield production has been done mainly separately. So there is no talking and spacing just done separately. The point is that there are benefit of integrating them. Okay, so what we are talking about So, what we are trying to do here is design what's called a hybrid model, which I'm going to elaborate a little bit in a couple of slides. So, another slide to talk about the pros and cons of crop modeling as well as machine learning. So, for the simulation-based crop modeling is the simulation of a physiological process of how the crop is growing and the And the advantage of that is it's reasonably transparent. You know why we're getting the type of results and the prediction accuracy, it's reasonably well. Now, the downside for that is you have to have the domain expertise to really do the simulation. And also, the data calibration can be very, very extensive. Extensive and depending on what type of knowledge model you're running, the runtime or computational effort can be quite significant. On the flip side, on the machine learning side, we know that there are wide range of applications ranging from imaging processing all the way to all kinds of applications in various domains. So there are all kinds of methods that are developed in this process. Developed in this process. And another advantage is that machine learning models tend to be able to deal with all kinds of input-output relationships, linear, non-linear, and dealing with some non-normal data can be very effective as well. And the prediction accuracy, if you have reasonable amount of data that's of okay quality, the prediction performance tends to be quite positive. Are positive. Now, the biggest problem for a machine learning model is the transparency. That's what we are here to try to address because, depending upon the model you are using, it tends to be a black box or it's hard to really provide the domain insights. For example, if you're trying to explain to farmers about why you're getting this yield prediction, the question is why the rainfall in Rainfall in, let's say, week 20 is causing the biggest impact. So, those are some of the big problems that we're facing in the machine learning-based or data-driven approach. So, the type of model that we introduced in this specific paper, it's sort of this hybrid approach. Now, to the left, we have the traditional yield data, historic yield. Additional yield data, historic yield data, the weather data, soil and management, including the type of seeds as well as the population and also when it's being planted. So on the top, you'll see the data-driven approach of using machine learning directly go to yield prediction. And then the bottom approach is through crop modeling, and then you can also go to yield prediction. What we are doing in this What we are doing in this framework work or this hybrid approach is that what if we use crop modeling to generate some intermediate traits or phenotype that's not as complicated as yield. So the computational effort won't be too high. But what we are doing is by incorporating these types of features into the machine learning approach. Okay, so by doing that, Okay, so by doing that, you sort of incorporate the domain expertise into the data-driven approach. And the hypothesis is that by doing that, we'll be able to improve the prediction accuracy as well as shed some light on transparency and interpretability of the approach. So, the research questions we're trying to address with this study is that does this hybrid approach really result in better? approach really result in better. In this case, we're talking about corn yield protection. Is it really better or we may not get better results, just depends, right? And then now the second question is which combinations? Now, what kind of features, so that's related to the third one, what kind of features from file modeling are most important for the machine learning? So those are some of the questions we're trying to answer with this study. Was this study? Okay, so the crop modeling simulation approach is absent. It stands for agricultural production simulation modeling approach. The exact name may not be that's basically a simulation model. So the type of features we generated include three categories. The first one, Three categories. The first one is phenology-related. So we have flowering date, maturity date, and then the second one is crop-related, like the type of biomass, root depths, leaf appearance rate, and crop transpiration, nitrogen uptake, nitrogen uptake, and auto-jout stress, average excess stress, and also nitrogen stress. For the soy and weather-related, these are. And these are some of the nitrogen as well as runoff or water table type of features that we grab from APSIM, which is the simulation on crop simulation modeling framework. So now with that input, the data set we had was from USDA. So the training set is from 1984 to 2016. Okay, so it's about 30. It's about 32 years of data, and then the testing set is two more years after 2016. So the predictors include basically the X, the input features include the absent features, the plant population, the planting date, the weather information from Damon, and also the soil information from Sergo. The target is Is the corn yield? Okay, in this specific study, we did three corn belt states. We also had a follow-up study where we look at entire corn belt with 12 states. All right, so once we have the data, the first thing, as we know, for data science or machine learning, is you need to first look at what is the data trying to tell us. So we went through a data. So, we went through a data pre-processing and also model selection approach for the purpose of keeping some transparency as well. Okay, so there are three stages of data pre-processing as well as model selection. The first one is feature construction. So, after talking with the farmer as well as field practitioners, okay, are there questions? Okay, other questions? Okay, okay. All right, it's hard for me to tell. So we constructed two features. One is called yield trend because as time goes by, technology improve, genetics improve in the yield. So we create something called yield trend. And also at the county level, we've constructed a feature based on historic data called yield app. On historic data called yield average at the county level. Okay, and then the second phase is feature selection, and there are three steps over there. The first one is incorporate some expert knowledge. So for example, when we talk with our ergonomical collaborator, there were certain insights say during the vegetative stage, the water is more important, and then in the grain filling stage, then it's important to have certain types. It's important to have certain types of heat information. So, we incorporate that into the feature selection. And also, we did the data-driven type of feature selection with random forest with permutation, and of course, the correlation coefficient analysis to look at how correlated they are. In the model selection, we took a Bayesian search approach. Well, we had 20 iterations with 30. 20 iterations with 35-fold cross-validation. So that's the approach we took. This picture shows the feature yield trend we've created. And I'm not going to go into too much detail, but these are the different years and then why is the crop yield. And then we plot it and then generate features based on these types of information. And also, the year average is basically you're talking about each year and each state, and we actually did at the county level as well. So, let's take a look at the data as well as some of the preliminary result. Okay, so as I said earlier, the goal of this study is to investigate the approach of hybrid model. Approach of hybrid model versus the benchmark is purely data-driven approach. So the hybrid model with taking input from absent features and then feed them into the data-driven model. Well, for the benchmark, there's no absent feature incorporated. It's purely data-driven, but the other input are the same. Okay, so here is the results. The x-axis are different types of models. Of models. You may recognize some of these basic LASSO, XGBoost, Light GVM, Random Forest. And then to the right, these are some of the optimization-based model as well as ensemble model and stacked type of models. The point here is that what the y-axis is the test relative rule mean square error, so which is a nice indicator of the extrapolation. Of the extrapolation capability of the model. So the lower, the better. The blue line here is the benchmark without the absent feature. The orange line at the bottom is the one with the absent feature. So as you can see across multiple models, we've seen some of them quite significant improvement from the benchmark to the hybrid approach. To the hybrid approach. Okay. And then another sort of illustration of the results includes XY. So basically, the X-axis is the true yield. The Y-axis is the predicted yield. Okay, so the top four pictures are the benchmark. Okay, so they actually perform reasonably well. We've analyzed multiple metrics, including Analyze multiple metrics, including the altar root mean square error, the mean bias error over here. Some of them are, but they are primarily negative. Okay, so the bottom one is the one with the hybrid approach. So as you can see, the relative room need square error dropped as well as the knee bias improved as well when we incorporate the Incorporate the Apps features. Now, to further look into the sort of dig into the transparency, if you will, we pick one model. That's the optimization-based optimized weight ensemble model. Okay, that's the best performing model, you know, through the model comparison. And what we did is this partial dependence plot, PDBs for. Plot PDDs for the different types of features after talking with our collaborators and basically look at when we change the feature, how will that impact the final output we are interested in? So the key takeaway over here is that if you see a big increase or decrease, the basic big change when you change the feature, that typical means that features are important or. That features are important, or it's sensitive, the output is sensitive to this type of input. Okay, so this is one way we can sort of shed some light into the features that are inputting into the model. Now, to also look at similar things over there, we look at feature importance. Okay, so the different colour. Color is representing different groups of features. So, for example, the blue line over here at the bottom, which are the two most important line for two most important features, including yield average and yield trend. These are trend related, which is denoted by this. And then, if it's weather related, you'll see the green cloud rain-ish, and then And then, um, hold on, this is precipitation-related, and then if it's radiation, there's a different notation. So, the point here is that we are dive into the feature importance. And then the W21 means week 21 based on calendar day. So, by doing that, we'll be able to see why the certain features are more important than the other, and how much importance in terms of understanding the Terms of understanding the yield. Now, since we've incorporated APSIM variables, if you recall, there are three groups of APSIM-related variables, including phenology-related, crop-related, and soil-weather-related features. So what we are doing in this specific analysis is that, you know, the x-axis steer the different types of models, the y-axis steer the test relative rule mean square error. A relative rule mean square error. Now, the difference is that if I just include the phenology-related feature or just include the crop-related, or just include the soil-related. So the point here is that if I only have partial information of the absent variables, how will that impact the prediction error or the prediction accuracy if you're looking at the fourth side of the prediction? So, this is another way that we. So, this is another way that we can maybe dive in a little bit more into the model. Now, if you recall, but here, these are some of the features that are the top important, and not all of these are Absin related. Now, this is some of the features because Apps and features turns out that they are reasonably important, but they are not at the top of the list. Now, this is saying. List. Now, this is saying that if I'm only looking at absent, which is the simulation-based feature, how do we evaluate the importance of those features? So now here, just to illustrate the robustness of the approach, we actually looked at some representative yields. I'm not sure how much you know about the corn yield prediction or corn yield in the In the Corn Belt, 2012 is a very special year because it has some significant drought. And then in 2017 and 18, those are the two years that I mentioned earlier. So what we are doing here is by looking at the different types of testing year and then how the feature importance for each of the AppSim-related features. I'm not going to dive too much into the specific feature because this foreign supposed. Because this forum is supposed to be just looking at the transparency, but this is one way that you can improve some transparency. And we took a permutation approach by improving the robustness of the future importance evaluation. Now, just to conclude, the first topic real quick is that what we've done in this stat, we've demonstrated actually some quite significant improvement in crop yield prediction when we have this. Prediction when we have this additional features from the crop simulation-based approach that's not necessarily all the way to the yield, but is shedding enough lights by providing input into some of the intermediary traits that are important for yield production. These are some of the most important absent features, and then we also realize the additional soil water. Additional soil water-related variables could further improve the yield prediction. So, with that, oh, this is the paper that documented the findings in this study if you're interested in knowing more about that. Looks like I have the more minutes. Now, the second study I want to quickly talk about is deal with the same collaborator. What we are doing is by What we are doing is by taking an ensemble convolutional neural network and deep neural network approach, the perception there is that, you know, convolutional and deep neural network, it's not transparent enough. And we are trying to explore ways that maybe can help with the transparency as well as maintain the crop yield prediction accuracy. So, I'm not going to go into too much detail. Go into too much detail, but the point is that the deep learning models are their ensemble approach, and what we are doing here is by grouping the different features as different input into the specific neural network model. And by doing that, we'll keep certain features within certain neural networks. And then, by that, we may be able to keep certain types of transparency. So, some background here in terms of the architecture of the deep learning in agricultural and also ensemble learning. Ensemble learning basically is you're integrating different models together. And there are mainly two approach, homogeneous and heterogeneous. Ensemble meaning that the individual models, they are similar or same, or they're very different models when we go into the ensemble approach. Let's see. Let's see. The research questions we are trying to address include which base model before we go to the ensemble would result in better ensembles? And also which ensemble creation method that may make better ensemble? And how do we design this approach that can help with transparency as well as be comparable to the state-of-art neural network approach? So, very similar to So, very similar data, slightly different split because here we have a more advanced data set because this is a later study, a study, and then you may notice that we have now 12 states, while the previous paper we had three states. Okay, so the base architecture what we had was, as I mentioned earlier, to help with the transparency, the input has The input has a big group of weather information and a big group of soil information, and there is sort of other features that are either management-related or it doesn't belong to weather or soil. So, what we are doing here is that we are keeping this weather feature inside what's called a weather convolutional neural network approach. And then in this one, it's soil convolutional neural network approach so that we know that all of these inputs. That all of these inputs are generating weather-related impact to the final yield prediction. And then the other ones are basically evaluated through a fully connected neural network. And then after that, it's going through a fully connected neural network by the final yield prediction. So this is the base architecture. And I'm now going to, so this is what I already talked about. So, this is what I already talked about. So, the weather convolutional neural network captures the temporal effect as well, because for the weather information throughout this growing season, they are weekly based on precipitation, temperature, solar radiation, all of those. For the soil information, the assumptions that the soil won't change from time to time, won't change within a year. Time won't change within a year. So, long-term wise, it may change. Now, this is trying to capture the spatial effect of the soil data, like when you change from one location to the other. So, by doing that, the goal is here that we'll be able to help with transparency or interpretability of the model. All right. The approach we took, it's pretty similar to the VGG16 approach. VGG16 approach that performed quite well in the ImageNet challenge. And I'm not going to go into too much detail because we have the paper published, which I'm going to share a little bit later. But these are the components or the depths as well as the layers we have in each of the convolutional components. Now, for the other Fully connected neural network, if you recall, I said all the other features that are not weather-related or soil-related. Remember, the weather, we are trying to capture the temporal because throughout the growing season, there are changes. For the soil, it's more of a spatial. Now, for the other one, it's going through the fully connected approach, and we're trying to capture some linear, non-linear effects of the other input features, include. The other input features include management practice as well as the type of seedling information. And then finally, in the aggregation fully connected neural network, we are taking the extracted feature in each of the components into this neural network for final yield prediction. So then, after we have the base model, then we are trying to create an ensemble on top of it. So, homogeneous ensemble. It. So, homogeneous ensemble is basically very similar as bagging. You have a very similar model, you just have more of these, and then you are trying to figure out what's the best approach of integrating them. Now, heterogeneous ensemble is there may be different structure, different depths, or there are all kinds of things that you would tweak over there. So, we're doing some comparison over there. Homogeneous, so basically, you have Basically, you have exactly the same structure for each of these components. We divide the data into K sort of sub-component that will go into each of the ensemble, and then you'll just integrate it at the end. Now, for the heterogeneous ensemble, we basically have different type of networks, as you may notice. This may look a night-like, but the depths and then the structure are actually different from. Are actually different from one network to the other. Now, in terms of the ensemble creation, they are basic ensemble approach and they are generalized ensemble and also stack generalization. Basically, you're talking about another model on top of this. Well, the basic ensemble, they're basically just looking at averaging or weighted average. Now, just quickly look at the results. I'm not going. Results. I'm not going to go into too much detail because, in the interest of time, some of these are detailed in the paper that I'm going to share a little bit later. Now, the point is that when we have the homogeneous ensemble comparing with the benchmark in different types of monitoring approaches, it looks like the prediction accuracy increased, prediction accuracy increased the error drop. Increase the error dropped across the board. And then, in order to, this is another way that we are trying to address the transparency is that if you recall, I mentioned we are dealing with 12 states. So these are the 12 states across the Corn Belt. So we are doing, what we are doing here is that, what if we are using different models for each of these states and then compare with their accuracy or in this case? The accuracy, or in this case, it's relative room mean square error percentage-wise. And by doing that, we'll be able to see which states will be able to do better and worse and why. And you know, by talking to our ergonomical collaborators, we'll be able to dive in and really understand why the model is behaving the way it is behaving and what kind of insights we are able to generate from this type of analysis. From this type of analysis. And another thing we did was sort of a spatial analysis for the homogeneous. And in this case, we are using the shade of the color to represent the error. And in this case, it could be overestimating or underestimating. So in this case, if you have a very dark reddish color, then we are overestimating. We are overestimating, and then if it's bluish, then it's underestimating. Okay, all right. So, in terms of generalization, here we have the model across the board over there. The point here is that homogeneous and heterogeneous, it's sort of give and take. I wouldn't say there is a clear winner for this specific study that. Study that we had 20-20 data. You can even see different models. They may have flipped results, which one is better, which one is worse, but they are comparable. The point is that both of them are better than the benchmark. All right, just to conclude, we noticed that both ensemble models types outperform the benchmark, and the homogeneous ensemble provides. The homogeneous ensemble provides a more accurate prediction, at least in the one that we look at, which is sort of intrinsic diversity and also a generalized ensemble model makes most robust prediction. And this is the paper that summarized some of the findings that I've shared in this presentation. And these are some of the founders of the study. And with that, With that, I'll stop and answer any questions you may have. Stop sharing. Are there any questions? Hey, let's thank first of all for that presentation. So to the audience, you have some questions? Okay, I have a couple of questions actually. So the The span, let's say, the years that you are analyzing goes from the 80s to the 2020s, right? And this is a very long time in which many things happen, even from, let's say, climate change, social and political conditions. So, how do you see this? So, how do you see this, like working with a data set so large in time and applying this for prediction that might reflect also this kind of aspects? That's an excellent question. The fact that we pick 1980s to 2020 is in a way trying to address that because the data can go back to the 1950s. But you made a very good point. But you made a very good point in terms of the technology improvement as well as social changes during this 30, 40-year period. The way we address that is through the yield trend. The hypothesis or the general guidance from the agricultural community is that as time goes by, there's a general trend in terms of increase as time goes by. As time goes by. So we took that into consideration in our feature construction and we construct the feature. And it turns out that that yield trend is one of the most important features in terms of understanding the general increase in the yield. So that's a great question. Yes, we try to incorporate that into the model. And then another question that I have is like more like thinking to the state. More like thinking to the stakeholders of this kind of studies, right? Which are the variables that are more controllable, like in like so that we can act upon them, for instance, to optimize the crop yield or to actually, because for instance, the weather, of course, is something that we cannot control. But like of all those variables, there are some that are more actionable. You're asking all the good questions. Yeah, this is an excellent question. So, for data analytics, there are sort of three levels of analysis: descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive, right? So, descriptive, all you are trying to understand is historic data. What is that data trying to tell us? What we are doing here is the second level is we're trying to make prediction, extrapolation. And then the question you ask is sort of. Question you ask is sort of the third level, which is prescriptive. What if we can make any changes to it? And in order to go to that stage, you're right, we need to understand what are the sum of the factors that can change. In this analysis, the managing practice includes the type of seed, but to a very limited degree because we're using USDA data. But I did not share in this specific talk. Not share in this specific talk, but we're working with a few private companies to look at more genotype-specific analysis on yield prediction. And for that one, you can do some recommendation for different type of seeds for different locations. And in Iowa, for the corn belt, at least in Iowa, we don't do irrigation, but in California and Nebraska, there are irrigations. So that's another thing you could change or, you know, make. Or make some updates in order to mitigate. So, for example, if you know that certain vegetative stage and certain weeks of the year are important, if you don't have enough water, then maybe during those weeks you should incorporate some irrigation into it. In this specific study, we did not look at pesticide and herbicide and all of those, but if we have the data, I think those would be the management practice to look at. Would be the management practice to look into. Yeah, you're right. We cannot change the soil that much unless you know we are looking at different types of seed selection. Then we did not look at, I did not share in this talk because this is a public data set, but we are working with a private company to look at that. But that's a great question. Thank you. So if there are no other questions, we thank again. Other question, we thank again Dr. Hu. Thank you so much. Okay, all right, thank you, and enjoy the rest of the conference. Thank you. Okay, so the next speaker is
