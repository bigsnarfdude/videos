Okay, I guess we can start. So let me introduce Zhang Shi, and who will talk about the non-abelian Hodge correspondence on some non-carrier manifolds. Okay, thanks, Professor McCrowdy, to introduce. I also thank the organizers. I also thank the organizer to give me a chance to have a talk here. Okay. In my talk, I will first recall some basic knowledge and introduce the classical aberrant correspondence and talk about our motivation. Then I will talk about the proof. The proof as an idea of proof of our theory. The classical non-abridge approach correspondence was established by Gareth, Donas, Hinching, and Simpson. It states that on a compact term manifold, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the modular space of some simple flat compressed vector. Fred compressed back bundles and the modular space of polystyrene Higgs bundles with vanishing turn numbers. And in this talk, I will introduce our recent work on extending this corresponding to some non-carries. This work is joint with Pan Champ and Zhang Chanjing. So let's first recall some knowledge. Knowledge. Let E be a vector bundle of a manifold. E is a flat bundle means its transition function is constant in general linear group or equivalent to their existing a flat connection. Fret means the coefficient is vanished. We see a flat back bound is simple if it has no is simple if it has no proper d invariant and we see the red bundle is semi-simple if it is a direct sum of d invariant sub bundles and lima here but corresponds said the following two modular space is equivalent the first Is equivalent. The first is freight vector bundle, and the second is the representation of fundament group to the structure group. Usually, we consider the general linear case. For a connection, when we give a metric on the bundle, we have the following unit. we have the following unit composition and D can it compose unitary connection and Posa H is a self-patron part if D is right then we can express the curvature in the following way so We so considering the self-adjoint and anti-self as a part of the above identity, we can conclude d pi zero and this d square plus pi with li is also zero. So when give a homitometric And give a Homitian metric, we consider this energy function. And we see the critical point is harmonic. And the Euler-Lagrange equation is the following. D stars are adjoint operator of dh by the works of Crea and Doris. We know And the Dorren, we know there must exist a harmonic metric on any simple Frank bundle. So when the best manifold is carried, the harmonic metric can deduce a Higgs structure. So we first introduce Higgs bundle. Higgs bundle was first introduced by Hing Chi. Introduced by Hingching. A Higgs bound means a holomorphic backbone coupled with a Higgs field. This Higgs field is a holomorph section of the endomorphic vector and also satisfies phi which phi is zero. So Higgs bundle is set to omega stable. Omega means carry management. Omega means a care metric means if for every far invariant coherent probe subshift, its slope slope means the quotient D degree of rank is less the slope of E. And if less or equal, we see it is the semi-stable. When the best manifold is a compressed manifold, we can denote the one zero part of the unitary connection by partial H. Also the zero one part by the partial bar H and define the following operator the dh double prime is the partial bar is the partial bar price the one zero part of psi and d prime the partial price the part zero one part of psi and we consider the square of d dot prime and denote by gh and we the zero two part is just the square of hush bar and this and this one one part is the partial psi one zero and the two zero part is a psi h one zero part which itself if we can prove gh is zero then we can conclude that the three part is also zero so when the base manifold is carried And when the base manifold is carried, if H as a harmonic metric, we consider the Orange Font equation. And we know this equation is equivalent to the following equation. Where GH is defined in the above, and lambda means contraction with the carry metric. Carry four, yeah. And furthermore. And furthermore, we can also deduce that from the 2.9, we can deduce that the gh is zero. So we can conclude that three part is also zero. The first one means that the partial bar h is a holomorphic structure. And the second one means that one zero part of psi is a holomorphic. And the third one means it wedge itself is zero. So this, the partial H and the one zero partial psi H determine a Higgs structure on E. And furthermore, the harmonic metric is also satisfied following Commission-Yamius equation. And it's also a Hermitian Einstein metric on the Higgs band. When the base manifold is compact carrying, the hinging and simple probe the Higgs bundle is polystable if and only if it admits commission einstein. This is a Higgs version of Donaldson-Wherenberg-Yao theorem. Back Yao theorem. And on the other hand, by turn-wheel theory, we have following this ten numbers is equivalent to the following three part integral. And we consider the third part, third term. And if H satisfies the commission Einstein equation. The commission Einstein equation, the third part is zero. Third part is zero. So if we suppose the first and second term class is zero, then we know every Hermitian Einstein metric must satisfy this connection is the threat, means the curvature of D is zero. And now And now we know H is just a harmonic metric on the flight bundle. So from above two results, we know every we obtain the following correspondence between the modular space of the freight bundle, simple friend bundle, and the modular space of Modular space of stable Higgs bundle with vanishing chain numbers. So we give the following notation. M R E S means the irreducible representation of the fundamental group. And M tiered means with no irreducible assumption. And M freight means And M thread means the modulus with simple thread connections. MT is a general thread connection. MS Hicks means the modular space of stable Higgs bundle with vanishing numbers. And SS Hicks is the modular space of semi-stable Higgs bundle. So by play, don't hinge and simple sense they are. And the simple result, we have the following correspondence. The modular space of stable fixed bundle is one to one correspondence to the modular space of our simple flight bundle. And this is also called the non-aberial Hodge correspondence. And the second equivalence is just the Liemann here about. And furthermore, if the base manifold is algebraic, things prove the following correspondence between the semi-stable Higgs bundles and the modular space of freight bundles. So the key theorem for the semi-processing. CRO for the seventh stable case is the following result, which is approved by Simplicon on a project manifold. Simpson proves that a Higgs bundle is semi-stable, and suppose the following 10 numbers is zero, and then if and only if it has a fluctuation of It has a filtration of Higgs bundles. Filter means the following sequence of Higgs. And such is every Pauli Hermitian Freight Higgs bubble. So this means that every semi-stable Higgs bundle with vanished turn numbers must be an extension of stable. Extension of stable Higgs boundaries. Now, we want to extend the above non-aberian correspondence to the non-carry case. So, we need the following two key steps. The first, we consider the existence of special matching. In the no-care case, the harmonic The harmonic metric we introduced in the above is not a class, and so we replace harmonic metric by Poisson metric. And we can prove if a simple fresh bound must exist Poisson matrix. The second step is generalize above. generalize the above simplest key theorem to some non-carried case. We know simplest only to prove the above key theorem over algebra manifold. So we want to prove this theorem to carry some non-carry case in fact we expect establish the following isomorphism. The isomorphism uh yeah we suppose m omega is a compact non-caddy manifold and it is a gauducho yeah for the first one is the second one is a senior cadet and also satisfied this integral is always zero for any double class h zero one and a tail for Hotel found some nutrients satisfying the above condition. I will thank Professor Fuji Xiang and Zhang Xiang to point out these examples to me. And we generalize the above not a very holy correspondence to this no-carrier case. But for semi-stable case, we only can prove the rank two case. For high ranks, ranks, we don't believe it will be right. And for some special case, if the structure group is a special linear group, then we can lowering We can lowering the assumption of non-carry manifold. We only need to assume omega is a senior carry. Or when we assume the complex dimension is zero, this means the x is a complex surface. So on complex surface, x admits a single carry. admits a synochronic then we must must there must exist a harmonic metric and we can prove gh0 so we can deduce any simple sl freight bound must exist of commish freight higgs structure with the trace The trace psi is zero. So, for this special case, we can roll our assumption. And for the time reason, I only introduce the proof of this map from semi-stable His bundle to Fright Vac bundle. Right, back boundary. And the key is to extend above simple king theorem to carry all some non-carry keys. Simple proof essentially depends on material and nominal result of that restriction of a semi-stable vector bundle to general hyperplane sections of certain arbitrary high degrees. Also, semi-stable. Is also semi-stable since many and nominals. The result is valid only when m is a small project variable. So, simple argument cannot be generalized to general carry or no carry case directly. In fact, we prove this by use geometry and analytic method. We will use the Yamis His flow to prove that. To prove the above his theory, in fact, we obtain the following theory. Let X be a compact Hermitian manifold and satisfy Gauduch and Athena. Suppose E is a Higgs bundle and it's semi-stable with vanishing term numbers converging. Numbers conviction. Then, if and only if the E admit a filtration of the either Higgs bounders and such that every quotient are stable with vanishes and number. So, our approach can be divided into three steps. The first one steps. The first one, we will prove any semi-stable Higgs bundle must admit approximate commission-yamius metric. And the second one, we will prove a semi-stable Higgs bundle with vanishing 10 numbers condition must approximate Higgs so much frag structure and use this existence of a special match. Of a special metric, we can obtain a vanishing theorem and prove the singular set of younger hold filtration is empty. And I will express in detail. In the first step, we consider the four input to input equation. When epsilon is zero, this is just commission Yamius equation. equation and when his bundle is very simple and we prove we prove in fact we obtain the this following generalized Dallas Umbeg Yao theorem we prove there is a tensor of the the solution h if h it shows the solution of It shows that the solution of the above particular equation must converge to zero. This is just to prove the existence of proximate commission Einstein matrix structure. And furthermore, we can prove that every the trace of curvature must the fixed one requires a fixed one for every if so then Then we evolving the H eptone around the formation Yamius flow on the Higgs boundary. This is also called the Yamius-Higgs flow. And use the assumption of the 10 numbers, we can prove that this trace free part of the QH integral L2 norm is zero. Yeah, is zero okay. I have three more minutes as extra converge to zero. Then by Chengwell theorem, in fact, we prove this by Cheng Weir theorem because we asset the chunk number is zero and we can probe the monotoricity around the Yami success flow. I mean successful, so we use the existence of approximate function Einstein metric structure to prove this L2 normal converge to zero. And furthermore, using the epsilon regulatory theorem of the Ami-Shift flow, we can prove the infinite part that the coefficient and the greater of phi is uniform. Phi is unit form bonded on the Yamius Higgs form. And then we have the following Bochana type inequality. Using this Bochana type inequality and using the parabolic mean inequality, we can prove that L infinite norm of this curvature must converge to zero. And we call this We call this the approximate Higgs commission freight structure. Then we can prove use the exist across Higgs commission freight, we can prove the singular set of yada code filtration of semi-stable Higgs bundle is empty. This means the yada code filtration is by Higgs sub-bundle. Okay, we first obtained the vanish theorem. Vanish theory means the theta is a non-trivial invariant form of section of Higgs bundle E. Then we can prove theta has no theorem. Use the above managing theorem. We consider the following exact sequence of his shift. The S is a subshift and Q is a post. sub shift and the q is a portion shift then we construct the new higher bundle yeah this is a new higher bundle and you we can also prove the new higher bundle is also admitted uh approximately higher commuter structure and then use a ball vanishing theorem we can prove this not tree tree will map the determined line boundary to determined line bound to the P times wedge of E and must no zero every one. So this map is just injected. This means the shift S is a bundle, is a sub bundle. This means the single rate set is empty. So set the E1 is S and then we can establish the third rate of filtration by induction of the neck. Okay. On the leg. Okay, I shall stop here. Thank you for your attention. Okay, thank you. Are there any questions? Yes, I have a question. Okay. I have a question. So you use your music flow. Yeah. So can you say what's happening? So, can you say what's happening when the Higgs bundle is unstable? Semi-stable. Yes, but when it is unstable, can you just sing on the floor? What's happening with the flow? You mean unstable case? Yes, unstable case. In fact, unstable case, we can prove the Yami's limiting of the Yami's case flow must. flow must equivalent the harder narrative society filtration of the initial Higgs structure. This means that we can determine the analytic limiting along the Yamis X flow by the filtration from the algebraic geometry. Geometry. Okay, okay, but this is true also in the non-Keller setting. No career we cannot prove. We can only prove the Kerry case. But no career case, we can prove the semi-stable case. So this is an open question in the non-KLR case. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is a good question for not KL. There's some difficulty in the tech. There's some difficulty in the technique, but I believe we have been right for some case. Yeah. Thank you, Bian. Okay. Thank you. Okay, more questions? Okay, if not, we resume in three minutes with Robin. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Yeah, yeah.
