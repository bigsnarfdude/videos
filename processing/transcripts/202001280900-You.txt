From a plaque melting transition, where we can potentially have some kind of fractal behavior. And this work is mainly done by two pioneers, Jen B from MIT and Mike Pratko, who is here. So yesterday we already have six amazing talks on frack towns. So right now I don't need to emphasize what it is and why it is important. But actually, one of the outstanding issues for me is apart from some For me, is apart from some theoretical curiosities where we want to build some field theory approach or mathematical physics classifications to characterize or differentiate different fractal phase of matter. How do we get from there? How can we find fractal physics in a conventional condensed matter settings? Or say how can we bring this topic of fractals to the conventional condensed matter community who may or may not be familiar about quantum field theories or mathematical physics. Mathematical physics. So, this is a part from Mike Practos' talk yesterday. He raised three important questions. First, how can we construct a simpler quantum spin liquid for fractal, which can be connected to real materials? Or are there any new platforms to host such kind of fractal physics? What are experiment signatures to prop or measure them? So, I'm not a fancy person, so I don't want to start with such kind of complicated questions, so I will start with some simple question. Instead of searching for quantum spin lips, Instead of searching for quantum spin liquid models, where I'm not an expert on quantum spin liquid, I want to start with some paramagnetic models, which are more simpler, which is much more simpler for myself. And apart from looking for new platforms, actually what I'm looking for is we want to find some old platforms which already exist in some condensed matter systems and whether we can search for fractal physics in these conventional condensed matter systems like paramagnet crystals. And apart from some experiment signatures, I'm looking From some experiment signatures, I'm looking for some numerical signatures where one can probe in numerical simulations. So the starting point is pretty simple. I'm looking for paramagnetic crystals on square lattice, or in general, on a bipartite lattice in 2D or 3 spatial dimensions. And let's start from paramagnetic crystals on square lattice, where there are odd, or say, one spin degree of freedom per site. Apart from some magnetic phases, such kind of square lattice. Faces. Such kind of square lattice with an odd number of spin per side can host two types of paramagnets and crystals, which do not break any spin rotation symmetries, but they break the lattice symmetry of the square lattice. One is known as the valence-bound solid, where the two spins pair as a singlet between the bounds. This valence-bound solid maintains the spin rotation symmetries, but it breaks the translation symmetry along one direction, and also breaks the side-center C4 rotation. The side-centered C4 rotation. Another common paramagnetic crystal, which is found in both numerical simulations and some experiments, some material like this, is known as the valence plaque crystals, where the four spins entangled on a plaque. And such kind of valence bond crystals does not break some spin rotation symmetry, but it breaks translation symmetry in both directions. So the unit cell is enlarged in both Tx and Ty directions, and also break the side centers. And also break the side centers for rotations. And now let's think about a quantum melting or fluctuating procedure for such kind of paramagnetic crystals. And once we fluctuate a VBS solid or plaque solid, we can potentially restore the translation rotation symmetry if breaks. But there was a famous theorem called a Hasting-Oshikawa theorem in the higher dimension, saying that melting such kind of paramagnetic crystal will never give rise to a feature in the scale phase, which Rise to a feature-scaled phase, which does not break any spatial symmetries or spinning rotation symmetries. And the reason is the defect of the VBS and VPS will carry some non-trivial Foaming number, known as the spin-off number. First, let's look at a simpler case, which is pretty well known. For the Venus bound solid, it breaks the C4 rotation symmetries, and there are four distinct ground states, because we have four bounds near precise, so there are four types of dimer configurations. So there are four types of dimer configurations like this. And thus, we can write down such kind of VBS order parameter as a Z4 boson. In the VBS phase, the Z4 boson condensates, so we always have a preferred patterns. And if we want to damage such kind of valence bond order, what we need to do is we need to condense the defect of the Z4 boson, which is a vortex, into spatial dimension like this, where the four distinct patterns meet at a singular point, and the singular point carries a free. Clopo carries a free spin one-half degree of freedom, which is not paired with any of the nearby particles. And if we proliferate and condense such kind of vortex, we are condensing the VBS defect together with such kind of spin-on. The VBS defect condensation will restore the C4 rotation symmetries and hence we go into a symmetric phase. However, the spin-on condensate will always break magnetic, will always break spin rotation symmetry. Break spin rotation symmetry, so we finally end up with a magnetic order. Such kind of phase transition is known as the deconfined quantum critical point, where a valence bond solid and a new order or other magnetic order can be connected by a continued phase transition with only one relevant coupling constant. And the reason here is because the defect of one order parameter carries another non-trivial quantum number. And now let's look at the Plaquette order of phase. The Plaquette order of phase Phase. The plaque order phase seems to be pretty similar because we can have four distinct plaque patterns. The unicell is enlarged, and the plaque can sit here, here, here, or here. So we can still regard the plaque as a Z4 boson. And for the plaque order to face the Z4 boson condensate, if we want to destroy such kind of plaque order, we still need to proliferate the defect of the Z4 boson, which is a vortex here. And same at a vortex code. And think at a vortex code, there is a free spin one-half degree of freedom, which is not paired with any of the nearby partners. So, ideally, we assume such kind of defect condensate is always accompanied by the spin-off condensate, so we eventually end up with some magnetic order phase. But here, there's a subtlety here. When we say something can condensate, no matter whether it's a single boson or a composite object, we actually have two prerequisites for condensing. First, if a particle can condensate, First, if a particle can condensate, they have to be an energetically deconfined quasi-particle. And this defect, vortex defect, is confined in the VBS phase, but once you approach the quantum critical point, actually the energy cost is softened, so that's almost a deconfined excitation here in the quantum critical region. The second is, if I say something could condensate, it should be free to fluctuate and move in space-time. So it should have some kinetic energy. And that's the subtle. Energy. And that's the subtlety here. So let's make a comparison. If we have a spin-on living on the background of a valence bond solid, the spin-on can fluctuate in space. The fluctuation is actually pretty simple. What we need to do is, if I want to move the spin-on from here to here, I just need to exchange the configuration between the spin-off and this dimer like this. Or if I want to move it in the off-diagonal direction, I again have to exchange this spin-knot with the dimer. So this is how the This is the diver. So, this is how the spin-long move in the background of the valence-bound solid. But for the valence placay solid, there is a subtlety here. If I want to move the spin-long outside to this side, potentially you may assume, okay, we just exchange their locations with the plaque. And then we end up with an obstruction because, in the final configurations, near each side, there are two places configurations adjacent to each site. But for the valence plaque solid, But for the valence fluque solid, we assume there's only one odd number of spin per side. So near per side, one spin can only entangle with one of the fluque nearby. So such kind of configuration will never appear in your low-NG herbal space. And hence, such kind of motion is never allowed. And the same, actually, this obstruction always appears. If I want to move it down, then again I will end up with the obstruction configurations where there are two plugin near per side. This is the configuration which will never appear here. Configuration which will never appear in our herbal space. So it gives me the impression that a spin-on inside a defect of this VPS vortex is somehow stuck like a fracton. It cannot move even we assume it becomes energetically deconfined. So although the spin-on itself is stuck as a fracton, that doesn't mean such kind of ploquet melting would finally end up into a glassy state, because even a single spin-on cannot hope. We can look for Single spin-on cannot hope. We can look for some collective motions. We can try to create two spin-ons together and see whether we can move two spin-ons at the same time. So this is another excitation where there are two spin-ons spatially separate along the bond. And this is what I called a dipole degree of freedom. This is a dipole oriented in the x directions. And if I want to move this dipole along this direction perpendicular to the dipole-orientation, Perpendicular to the dipole's orientation, what I need to do is I first need to annihilate this dipole, and then along the path it will move. I have to reorder the plaque configuration like this. Previously, we live on the even side, and now the plaque live on the odd side. And again, I create such kind of dipole. So such kind of procedure effectively moves the dipole from here to here. And this procedure is always involved with the fluctuation of the plaque patterns. Fluctuation of the plaque patterns along the paths. So, from these two kinds of pictures, we reach a rough conclusion that a single spin-on cannot fluctuate and hold in a plaque background. So, the spin-on here is something like a flat once. But instead, a pair of spin-ons as a dipo is something like a 1D sub-dimensional particle which can move on the transverse stripe, which is perpendicular to the dipole's orientations. And in the meantime, whenever. And in the meantime, whenever we fluctuate such kind of dipole on the 1D structure, we always have to flip the plug A configurations along the path. So this is just a pictorial way to show the spinner as a fractal. But here we have lots of field theory experts and mathematical physics. So you are probably not happy with such kind of pictorial arguments. So let's do some simple mathematical counting. So before I go into the plaque side, let's have a warm-up exercise because it's too Have a warm-up exercise because it's still 9 a.m. and I assume some of you hadn't waked up yet. So, first, let's look at the valence bond phase. We know a valence bond crystal or say a quantum dimer model on a bipartite lattice can be mapped into a compact U1 gauge theory. On any bipartite lattice, if the link contains a dimer configuration, we can map this valence bond or say dimer coverage into an electric field. Electric field. So if there is a dimer here, then the electric field is either 1 or minus 1, depending on its sub-lattice structures. If there is no dimer here, then the electrical field is just 0. And because we're dealing with a finite hurba space where there's only one spin per side, so the herbal space has a constraint such that near per site, if there's one dimer nearby, then there is no free spin-off. The charge is zero. If there are no dimers nearby, then we have one spin-on charge. Then we have one spin-off charge. And if we want to translate such kind of configuration constraint into a filter language, then we just write down the Gauss law, which is just a 2 plus 1D Gauss law. Differential over electric operator is related with the local spin-off density. And this Gauss law is nothing but telling you the constraint of such kind of Hurbus space. And because we have Gauss law, we should have charge conservation, and this is a global charge conservation. This is a global charge conservation, which means that the spin-on charge is conserved globally. So whenever we create a spin-on excitations by breaking a dimer, they have to appear in pair, although they might be spatially separate apart. And the same, because the electric field corresponds to the dimer configurations or dimer occupancy, the conjugate variable of the electric field, which we call the gauge connection, is actually the operator which creates or annihilates. Which creates or annihilates dimer configurations of each bond. And hence, the magnetic flux operator plays a role as fluctuating the dimer configurations. If I add the magnetic flux operators on this plug K, it flips the horizontal dimers into vertical dimers and vice versa. So magnetic flux operator plays the role as the dimer configuration fluctuation. And as I have shown, if I want to Shown: if I want to move this spin-off along this path, what I need to do is I need to annihilate the spin-on here, create them here, and along the path I have to flip the dimer configurations. And in this field theory language, that corresponds to spin-on creation operator here, annihilation operator here, and the gauge connection operator acting along the path. So that means the spin-on current should minimal couple with the gauge field, and the role of the gauge field is it have to flip. Gauge field is it has to flip the diamond configuration along the paths it moves. And now let's go back to the plot K patterns. On a 2D square lattice, there's only one type of ploque. So I can define an electric operator I call EXY here, which lives on the center of the plug K. And this electric field actually corresponds to the plug A coverage. If there is one plug A here, then its value, electric field value. its value, electric field value, is 1 minus 1, depending on the sub-lattice structure factor, because it is always a bipartite lattice. And otherwise, if there is no pluck A here, then the spe is merely 0. And again, because we are dealing with a finite Hiribus space and there is only one or odd number of spins per site, so we actually have a Hirabel space constraint that if there are no plug A adjacent to the site, then there is one spin on charge. There is one spin-on charge here. Otherwise, as long as there is one plug A, then there's no spin-on charge on the side. And now we have to translate such kind of Herbert space constraint into a Gauss law. And this is actually a special Gauss law where dxdy acting on this EXY operator give rise to the local charge conservation. If the spin is up, does it have charge one? And if the spin is down, is it charge one? No, this is the magnetic charge, SZ charge, but I'm talking about. Charge, SZ charge, but I'm talking about a spin-on charge. So all spin-ons have charge one? Yes. Okay. Yeah, the spin-on has charge one. That's something like a gauge charge, and it also has SZ charge, or the Magnum charge, one is one, and the other is minus one. And if you create if you if you write on the finger boson, then they must appear together, and that becomes the Magnum charge. The spin-on charge is actually the gauge charge. The gauge charge. What is like electric charge plus one and minus one? How are they defined? It is defined, so we have a dual lattice which is also a square lattice, and then one sub-lattice one and the other is minus one. Oh, it's sub lattice, yeah. So that is why it can only be done on a bipartisan lattice in 2D or 3D. And this special Gauss law is just a simple translation of this herebus space constraint. And because this special Gauss law contained two Gauss' law contains two differential operators in front of the electric operator, so the charge degree of freedom here, spin-on charge, is not just conserved globally. Instead, if we integrate out both sides of the equation along dx or dy directions, you will find a charge along each x row, like this, or each y column, like this, should be conserved. And hence, when we create charge excitations, we have to break a ploque, and hence, such kind of spin-on excitation must be... Such kind of spin-off excitation must appear in a quartet form, and two of them have to live on the same row, two of them have to live on the same column, and this is the only excitation which can potentially conserve the subsystem charge conservation where the spin-on charge is conserved on all rows and all columns. And again, because the electric operator corresponds to the plaque coverage configuration, we can define a conjugate variable for the electric operator. Variable for the electric operator, which is I call the gauge connection here. It has a gauge transformation which is generated by the Gauss law. And the gauge connection operator actually creates or annihilates the valence plaque configuration here. So if we act E to the IAXY operator along a path like this, then it will flip the placay configuration. Previously, all of the places live on the even dual side. K live on the even dual side, and after that, they all live on the odd dual side. And again, if I want to move a pair of spin-on as a dipole in a direction perpendicular to its orientation, what I need to do is I have to annihilate a spin-on pair here, create them here, and along this path I have to reorder the plate configurations. And in this field theory language, that actually corresponds to a dipole curve. Correspond to a dipole current operator which is minimal coupled with this high rank gauge field. And the role of the high rank gauge field is they have to reorder the plaque patterns in order to assist such kind of dimer to move in a direction perpendicular to their orientations. So now we reach the conclusion that when the plaque is trying to melt, a single spin-on which live inside a plaque crystals cannot. Plaque crystals cannot move. It is a fracton which does not have any mobilities. Instead, a pair of spin-nons spatially separate along one bound as a dipole is something like a 1D sub-dimensional particle which can move on the perpendicular stripe and such kind of motion is always accompanied by the reordering of the plaque configurations along the paths. Now we want to think about the melting procedure or what is the corresponding phase. Corresponding phase after the valence placid crystal melt. So, we have to write down some kinetic energy or minimal theory for such kind of spin-on defect. And because we know a single spin-on cannot move, what we can do is we can only have an x-dipole move in the y-direction, a y-dipole moving in the x-direction. On the square lattice, this actually corresponds to some ring exchange term, where we have a spin-on pair. This is oriented in x direction, they are moving along y. They are moving along y, or we can regard it as a y-dipole. They are moving along x. Hence, we can write down a kinetic energy like this, which does not have any dx or dy-theta term. It implies that a single spin-on does not have any kinetic energy. Instead, the leading order kinetic energy came from this dx dy theta term, which implies x-dipole can move along y or y-dipole can move along x. And because we only have And because we only have this term as the leading order term for the kinetic energy, so once this spin-on becomes energetically deconfined, we figure out that such kind of spin-on actually has a quadratic dispersion. And this dispersion actually does not have any 2D U1 rotation symmetry. It only has a C4 rotation symmetries. And actually, there are a bunch of zero energy lines along Kx and Ky directions. So there are two nodal lines. So there are two nodal lines, and all of these nodal lines correspond to the zero energy state. So such kind of boson or spin-on kinetics is pretty different from the usual weak interacting bosons or the usual deconfined QCP we are familiar with. Here actually at each Kx and Ky axis we have some zero energy mode and around each fixed K actually the boson here disperse like a 1D relativistic particle. 1D relativistic particle. Okay, so once now we have a theory for the spin-ons kinetic energy, then we can think about what is the potential phase near the plaque melting transitions. And once the spin-on or dipole becomes energetically confined, we can think about their condensing. However, a single spin-on cannot fluctuate and doesn't have any kinetic energy, so obviously, spin-on cannot condense here. Obviously, spin-on cannot condense here, even they are energetically deconfined. Instead, we can only condense such kind of dipole because they at least have some mobility around the 1D strike. Remember, in 1D quantum spin models or 1D bosons, there is a mermian width of... In 1D, the quantum fluctuation is pretty strong. So in 1D chain, actually, if a boson condensate, you won't get any long-range order or spontaneous symmetry breaking for continuous internal symmetry group. Instead, you will only get a quad. Instead, you will only get a quasi-large order where there is a power law decay of the correlation function. And that is also the case here because the dipole only have mobility on a 1D strike, its point fluctuation is pretty strong. So once the dipole proliferate and condensate, we just get a quasi-long range order phase between the dipoles. And this phase is what we call an algae break monoliquid phase, which is gapless, but there is no spontaneous symmetry breaking. Spontaneous symmetry breaking. There is no subsystem symmetry breaking or whatever because it is in 1D and a quantum fluctuation is pretty strong to Q and in long-range order. Yeah, I mean you're not writing down maximal terms for the gauge theory. Okay, good. So actually I also like discuss, you know, the statements you're making would be true if there was, if it wasn't a gauge theory, for this was just a ring exchange bosonic, purely bosonic model with global symmetries. Good question. So actually I. Good question. So actually I skipped some step here. So first for the Maxwell theorem, we do have E-squared fluctuations, which would but we do not have a magnetic flux operator here. There's no local magnetic flux operator. There's only a global magnetic flux operator. So first thing is we don't need to consider any instanton event because there is no local 2π instanton creation. And second, here because we have a spin-on, so there are two boson components. Two boson components, theta1 and theta2, and we can make a linear combination of them. One of them carries gauge charge, the other of them doesn't carry gauge charge. And the one which carries gauge charge, it's condensate water. You will get a fully gap spectrum because of Higgs mechanism. And the other one, which is charge neutral, would give rise to such kind of algebraic quantum liquid phase. So the other guy doesn't have gauge? Yes. And this gauge, after condensate, becomes fixed. So that's the one you were talking about. Becomes fixed. So, and that's the one you were talking about. I mean, also in this theory, I mean, I don't know if it's allowed by the microscopics. You can add nonlinearities, so for example, that are relevant in 2 plus 1 dimensions. So, for example, derivative of theta squared to the fourth power, for example. Yes, cross terms that are true. So, for the fourth. True, so for the fourth power, you mean this dx dy theta parenthesis to the fourth power. This is just the can you add terms like dx theta to the fourth power? Dx theta to the fourth power. No, that breaks the C4 rotation symmetry. That is not allowed by subsystem symmetries. But you are right, I will then mention there are some other perturbations you can add, which is allowed or not allowed by symmetries, and there could be some instability here. So this is again. So, this is a gapless phase, but there is no symmetry breaking. Instead, if we measure the dipole-dipole correlator, which is spatially separate along the things drive, say along the x direction, what we will observe is this dipole-dipole correlator decays in a power-low wave, which is pretty similar to the 1D critical bosons or 1D quantum spin chains. And finally, let's talk about the instability problem. There are two types of instability. The first type of instability is allowed by symmetry. Instability is allowed by symmetry because zeta is actually a compact boson. But once I write down this form instead of a cosine term, I actually ignore the compactification of this zeta. But compactification actually matters. So for a large k, actually, the compactification doesn't matter, so I can do a Gauss expansion because the instant time event of the C dot tunneling is irrelevant. But actually, this k, which can be analogy as a Latin parameter in 1D. As a Latin parameter in 1D, would be, once it becomes small, then the instanton proliferations become relevant, and such kind of instanton proliferations will finally gap out phase, which leads to the plaque order phase, or the stripe order phase, usually depend on microscopic interactions. And the second, there is another symmetry which is not allowed by, there is another perturbation which is not allowed by symmetry, like if I add a dx C dot or dy C dot, this is not allowed by symmetry because This is not allowed by symmetry because we know a spin-off itself cannot hold. But if I still add this such kind of term at a quantum critical point, when such kind of weak subsystem symmetry breaking term is small, and this is related with partial fitting, then such kind of operator is still not relevant when you are at small k region. So there is actually a finite region for k where both the instanton event and the weak subsystem symmetry breaking becomes irrelevant. Breaking becomes irrelevant. So, this algebraic quantum liquid phase is really a stable phase which can survive in a finite region at zero temperature. How do you show that last statement that there's some intermediate regime? Actually, because what you need to do is find out a critical k for this instant on proliferation event. And we can add a subsystem symmetry breaking perturbation and find another k. And that depends on the feeling. If it is integer filling, then actually at least one of them should be relevant. At least one of them should be relevant, but at fractional feelings, there is a region where both of them are irrelevant. Is the phase transition here some like KT kind of thing? Yeah, I feel it's a KT transition, but actually I don't know whether there is a good way to tackle such kind of phase transition, so we cannot make any strong argument about a quantum critical point. So the other area I was thinking about that that does preserve C for great enough theta to the fourth power. So The fourth power. So, like, does your microscopist allow? Does your symmetry allow? I mean, so it's the path. So the gradient, two-dimensional gradient of theta to the fourth power. So it's something like a Q square of theta or Q cubic theta? Q cubic theta? No, to the fourth power. Okay, fourth power. So that's marginally relevant pervasion. It's another kind of It's in other contexts. Oh, actually, that will have full U1 rotation symmetries, but actually, such kind of theory cannot have U1 rotation symmetry because once you have subsystem symmetry, it's impossible to have a full U1 rotation symmetry. Because if you have full U1 rotation symmetry, if charge is conserved on each X row, then it should be conserved on each X plus delta row, and then actually you have charge conservation on any directions. Directions. And actually, the theory is pretty important. It must be developed on a lattice, defined on the C4 lattice. If you put on another lattice, like honeycomb lattice, would you have fractal behavior? But microscopic theory would be pretty different. Okay, we can discuss after, yeah, I think. Here I have a simple question. So, in the VVS phase, we know that spinors are confined, right? Basically, there's a linear confining. Yeah, here it's also linear confining. So, what about your dipole object? Those are also. About the dipole object, those are also confined? True, so actually, for dipole objects in the Plaque order phase, if they are spatially separate along this direction, then there is a linear confinement proportion. Linear confinement potential two, right? Yes, and if you further want to separate them, these, this will give you additional confinement, which is proportion for their spatial lens. So how the combining potential enters in these in these In this in this way, that it that doesn't make any difference for your you know, you you have some kind of positive therapy, with uh with uh yes, so this linear confinement only appears when you have uh when you have an ordering of the plaque crystals. Once the crystal becomes disordered, then such kind of linear confinement disappears. Yeah, but I thought that you are in the in the VBS phase. No, I I'm considering about melting the VBS phase and already condensed the dipole, so now you'd Already condensed the dipole, so now you do not have any valence plus K ordering. But you can condense it even though there is a linear confining potential? No, at a phase there is a linear confining potential, but once you approach the quantum critical point, this energy costing is softened. And that is why you can proliferate them. If you do not reach that region, then you cannot even proliferate a dipole. Then you have a decompilement transition at the same time. True. When you are condensing the dipole. True, this is something which would happen. True, this is something which would happen like a KT transition of the dipole condensate. True. But if that's the case, then at the critical point, for example, you should be restoring the U1 symmetry, are you? Oh, you mean like which U1 symmetry chart? It's no longer C4, isn't it? Uh no. Actually, for that problem, for that for that spin-on problem on a VBS problem on a A VBS problem on the square lattice, the reason why it is U1 invariant, a spatial U1 instead of SQL is for that problem. We know that four instant time is irrelevant, so actually SQL doesn't make any difference. But for this problem, actually, I'm not sure. Only when the four-instant time event becomes irrelevant, or say PALICOM, that is when the three-instant time becomes irrelevant, can we explicitly say that we have a full UI rotation symmetry instead of the C4 rotation symmetry? Symmetry instead of a simple rotation symmetry, but this is not always true. That's related to this question whether you actually allow pre-compilement transition out of this fucking rotor state, I suppose. Actually, even the C4, like for the VBS case, even if you don't have C4 rotation symmetry, you only have reflection symmetry, then that's the two-instantile event that is actually relevant. Then, once this appears, you still have that phase transition, but first, because you have another relevant operator, so this can potentially be a first-order. Operator, so this can potentially be a first-order transition. And second, at a quantum critical point, you do not have full UI rotation symmetry because two instances still tend to be relevant. So let's go on. So actually, a take-home message we can talk about here is for the valence bond solid melting or valence fluccine melting, both of the D-bag carries a spin-on, but for VB, a spin-on can fluctuate, so the spin-on can condense directly to get a Spin-on can condense directly to get a magnetic order phase, but actually for the BPS order phase, the spin-on cannot fluctuate. And what we can condense is a spin-on here as a dipole. And that is why we eventually end up with an LGBT quantum liquid phase. And if we obtain such kind of quantum liquid phase, then potentially we want to do some experiment on numerical measurement for them. So one measurement we can do is for the structure factor, because in the LGBT quantum liquid phase, the boson Quantum liquid phase, the boson has a branch line along kx and ky directions where there are excessive number of zero energy modes. So we can measure the static structure factors and observe such kind of branch line. And this branch line actually implies this is something like the boson version of the Fermi surface. Usually for 2D Fermi surface, the zero energy point forms a closed line. And here it's actually a boson Fermi surface where they form a closed line along the Kx and Ky directions. And because we have this excessive And because we have this excessive number of zero-energy modes, if we calculate the specific heat at low temperature, its behavior is very different from the usual weak interacting boson in 2D. The usual weak interacting boson, same photon gas, is proportioned to cubic T, but here it is proportioned to T low and T, which is pretty similar to the marginal non-Fermulique systems. And this behavior is totally due to such kind of gapless branch along Kx and Ky directions. Along kx and ky directions. And also, numerically, one thing we can probe is we can probe the entanglement entropy. And actually, such system, the entanglement entropy scales as L low on L, which is pretty similar to the entanglement entropy of a 2D Fermi circle. And the reason is pretty simple, because for each fixed momentum k, the boson disperse like a 1D relativistic boson, and for 1D relativistic boson, we have entanglement entropy. Entanglement entropy low and L. And if we made a spatial cut approximately, we have L number of 1D relativistic bows, and that's why we have such kind of scaling, which is similar to the 2D Fermi surface behavior. So since I'm run out of time, let me just end up my talk with some future directions. So today I'll talk about a plaque melting transition, which can give rise to such kind of fractal degree of freedom. And can we have fractal physics in Fractal physics in other systems, especially in a quantum critical point where the fractal or subsystem symmetry becomes really emergent. And the answer is yes. And interestingly, actually, such kind of emergent fractal can appear at a phase transition between an interacting higher-order Ti21. It's trivial phase. So I don't want to talk about what's higher order Ti because Taylor Hughes will talk about this tomorrow. So higher order Ti is just some gapped charge insulator where it's totally gapped and Where it's totally gapped in the bulk. On the smooth boundary, it's also gapped, but at this corner, there is a charge-zero mode. So, this do look like a membrane operator of the fractal excitation where we have charge degree of freedom living at a corner. So, at a quantum critical point, there is a percolation picture where the domain wall between a higher-order Ti phase, the pink region, and the trivial phase, the white region, would proliferate. And such kind of domain wall are trying to condense at a point critical region. Dense at a point critical region. And for the smooth boundary of this domain wall, that's just a higher order Ti smooth edge, which has nothing there. But at each rough boundary, which is the corner, it carries a charge mode. And hence, at a corner critical region where such kind of domain wall is strongly fluctuating, their corner is also strongly fluctuating, and the charge carried at a corner is fluctuating. And if we look at such kind of fluctuation configuration of the domain wall, Of the domain wall, what we will find is actually we have such kind of domain wall will transport a pair of charge in a perpendicular direction, or it will annihilate the charge here and create the other three at the other three corner. And this exactly corresponds to the ring exchange term, which preserves the subsystem symmetry. And this actually tells us that a quantum critical point between a special interacting higher order TI and trivial phase has emergent subsystem symmetry because there is no single charge fluctuation. because there is no single charge fluctuation. Charge must have fluctuated in pair. And such kind of quantum critical point will be pretty exotic because the quantum critical point has an entanglement entropy which scale as L law and L. And this is the first example I know where the quantum critical point in two spatial dimensions has a violation of such kind of area law. Okay, I'm running out of time, so thanks for attention. I think we have lots of questions. We have two minutes for any short questions. So the mapping to the scalar charge theory seems very natural for the Plaquette order. So this is a mathematical mapping. Can we understand other VBS pattern in terms of scalar charge theory? VBS pattern, you mean? Like corner state, loose state. Actually, for the BBS, we usually in bipartise. For the BBS, usually in bipartal gliders, that can be mapped into the usual U1 gauge theories. There are some special cases like Mike and U study, where if it's an RK point, you can also write it in terms of a tensor gauge theory because we only have high-order fluctuations. True, because here I only have off-diagonal component, but you have diagonal comp component. My steer is the vector charge still. So I wonder if any, like, why we get different Why did we get different? Here it's scalar. Well, your theory you can calculate. Well, this is very special for particular patterns. Like, if I look at the Plancket order, I naturally think of the space theory because of the rectum pattern. But so why I cannot use other theory to describe this face? Like it's a language to describe the face, right? It's part of the face, right? So yeah, I just wonder why it's it seems special, but it should not be that special. Actually, it is only special if I assume that the plaque pattern is only a pattern which is allowed in a low-energy Hilbert space. It may be true or may not be true depending on the microscopic Hamiltonian. If at a quantum critical point that a plaque breaking into two dimers does not cause energy or cause a very small energy, then the dimer configuration can appear. And again, you go back to that. And again, you go back to that VBS to nil order transition. So, this could happen if your low-energy Hilbert space can appear some dimer by breaking the plugin into two horizontal or vertical dimers. So, if you start with the SU4 spin, this is not allowed because there is no SU4 dimer. Or if I start with some ring exchange harmonic, this is also not allowed because dimer actually breaks the system E1 symmetry. I see. Okay, maybe this is a good time to start because I have a lot of time. Let's back to speaker again.
