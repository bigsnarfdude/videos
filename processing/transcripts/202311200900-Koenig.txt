Invited me here to speak. And secondly, I would dedicate my lecture to the memory of Nicole Tontra Kjägelmann, co-author and friend for many years, to the memory of Jura Gordon, both of them who passed away, unfortunately, in June of last year. Now, Nicole played a certain role in establishing birth. The point is that The point is that she was actually the first to organize a conference here in Bann on Banner spaces and the geometry of convex poles. In 1988, I have here poster. This time we organized this together with Marcia Kusu, Archlaf Sisla, and Jim. And Jim Timuria, I think he was the chairman in Edmond at the time, had context to that. This was a very well-attended conference that gave some impetus to organize something like this Birth Center. Of course, this Birth Center was not the work of Nicole, but it was the work of Nassif Gusoup without his work. Without his energy and his dedication and hard work, this institution would never have come into being. But I think it was very successful in the end. Now, closer to what I want to talk about, in this conference in 1988, Keith Paul gave a lecture on his studies. Studies into the Bruscam deep inequality and his applications to cube slicing. This topic, slicing of convex bodies, is what I'm talking about. So we start with a symmetric convex body and we introduce the parallel section function. So this is here. You take a direction vector, norm 1. Direction vector, norm one, some distance to the origin. So we have the volume of all points in your convex body of distance t to the origin. Now, at the time, Guzman-Betty problem and the hyperplane conjecture motivated the study of these. Of these of this quantity. So, what we want is basically we want to find Xtrema of this parallel section function of Xt as L minus 1. So, we want to find the direction of maximal sections and minimal sections. And minimal sections when the distance t is fixed. Now, of course, if t is zero, you have central sections, and this is what the first well-known results were all about. Now, for central sections, I want to give some short remarks about the results. And throughout my lecture, I will use this notation. Lecture: I will use this notation. Ak would be the standard vector of k1s and otherwise zeros in n dimensions normalized so that they are in S n 1. So, these are sort of the standard directions. And mainly when considering maxima and minima, this will be important for k is equal to 1, k is equal to 2. k is equal to 2 and k is equal to n, which would be the main diagonal diversion. So the result for the cube, normalized cube, A1, so 1, 0, 0 would be the minimal direction and this direction 1, 1 or square root of 2 would be the maximum direction, square root of 2. Now the lower estimate is Hartmiger intensive, and this is a famous And this is a famous result of Keith Ball about the mid-80s. And for Lp, for P between 0 and 2, we have that the minimal direction would be the main diagonal direction and the maximal direction is the direction of A1. Now this is basically Maya Ajour. Basically, Majer Pejor for P between 0 and 2, but also Koldowski has a different proof, and he may pajor some art set only for L1. Now, this leaves open the case P bigger than 2. The minimal situation was already in the paper of Maya Panther, and for P bigger than 2. And for P bigger than 2, the maximum vection, there's a problem by some example of Oliszkimich. It turns out that the answer has to depend on P and N. It's not completely solved yet, but there's a beautiful paper of Eskinasis by Jar Kroch very recently, but this is not my topic here. So now we consider non-central sections. Consider non-central sections. There are not so many results for non-central sections, and mainly the results are for very large distances from the origin. So very close to having almost empty intersection. So here we have the following situation. If in the cube, if you have very large distance, yeah, I mean Large distance, yeah, I mean, square root of n is over 2 would be the maximal direction, and if you take the main diagonal direction, this would be the maximal case in this case. And the same holds in the slightly smaller range if n is bigger than 5. Now in the L1 ball, if t is between 1 over root 2 and 1, well, this direction is the maximal direction. Note that in these cases, Note that in these cases the minimal reduction is not very interesting because it could be zero. You are far outside of so A is a result of Woody, Stone, Chach and Svarvich. And this extension here to slightly smaller distances due to Cornin. And this here is a result of Yu and Koch. Now, what is Now, what is common here is that d is the distance, little d is the distance of the midpoint of edges to zero, big d here, this was here the situation, the distance of a center of a square phase to zero. Now what is common here is that in both cases the maximal vectors connect zero with the vertices. Connection to the vertex. To the vertex, also connection to the vertex. So somehow it is sort of orthogonal in this direction to the vertex. So my first main result is the following. I want to extend this result to slightly bigger distances. Result of U and Koch. So now we take n bigger than So now we take n bigger than four, we take the L1 ball, and we take a distance between not one over root two and one, but one over root three and one. Then the same vector is maximal in the sense that the maximal section is sort of a coordinate axis section. It is orthogonal. The vector connecting zero with the vertex. Of course, this is easy to get. Now, in dimension 3, this is not true up to 1 over root 3, but it is only true up to 0.6384, which is this funny number. For n is equal to 2, the statement is true only up to three quarters. It's already in the paper of mu and margin. U and margin. So the maximal volume hyperplanes are orthogonal to the coronal directions. E is the distance of the center of the boundary triangle to zero. And for n is equal to three and you have a slightly smaller distance, then A two will be the maximum section and not A one. Then direction which keeps all across. Direction which keeps all of us. Now, the point is to prove extreme results, you need concrete formulas. There's a concrete formula. So you take some distance between 0 and 1, take a direction vector, and now you assume that you have positive coordinates, that they are ordered. And that they are ordered. That they are all different. x plus would be the maximum x at zero. And then you have a funny formula of this type. Now it's a complicated formula involving at both end terms. Now, let me say there's a claim in Meillé and Parjour on the volume of steps, it has one. If you differentiate this formula, Reject this formula, get this here. Now, there's no proof in Meyer and Bajor, and Patrick Buzzinski, in his dissertation, provided a detailed proof using the Fourier transform of L1, Fourier transform of the parallel section function, and then back Fourier transform, and whether you calculus, you have poles of order n in the integral, the inverse Fourier transform. But the inverse Fourier transform. Maybe I should say the following: that if you have this function and you take the Fourier transform in one variable, this is essentially up to a constant depending on the normalization of the Fourier transform. The indicator function function Fourier transform SA. So this is the connection between the Fourier transform of the convex body and the Fourier transform of the parallel section function. Once you know this, know this and then you transform this back. Now there's a funny situation here that you have kind of singular. That you have some kind of singularity here. I mean, if you take, for instance, if you take a situation A1, bigger than A2, bigger than T, bigger than A3, and so on, then you have two terms. And this looks like 1 over A1 minus A2 squared. And then you have here a 1 with the n minus 2, a 1 minus t2. A1 minus t to the n minus 1. And we have a product here from 3 to the n 1 squared minus aj squared minus the same with a2. So this would be sit the situation if you have two terms. The problem here you see is that you have kind of a singularity, right? But it's not really a removable singularity because here these terms would also coincide. Having a removable singularity in your formula doesn't make it easier to calculate extrema. So this is the main problem here to extend this result from This result from 1 over square root of 2 down to lower values. Anyhow, if you ask yourself why you get these singularities, maybe I will make just one small comment. If you calculate the Fourier transform of the one ball in two dimensions, you are somehow left with something like this. This would be sort of the Fourier transform you have to calculate. If you calculate this, you come up with something like this. like this. This is the main point why you have a singularity, formula singularity. The main point of the problem is very short. Oh, as I said, for t bigger than 1 or 2, we have only one term and then We have only one term, and then it was used by you and Koch. Actually, in this case, you have a nice geometric group. Here, it is possible that you have two non-zero terms, formally with this alternating behavior and singularity. Now, Patrick Buzhensky used this thing, this horrible thing, to determine the extreme dimension 3. It is not completely easy. Not completely easy. Many critical points which you have to consider. Now, it starts out if you start from 1 going down, you have for A1. Then in a certain range, you have A2. Then below 1 over square root of 3, you have A3. And then you have a funny other direction. Now, if t is 0, this thing is just 1, 0, 0. This thing is just 1, 0, 0. So it interpolates between this and A3 somehow. Minimum is easier. There are only two situations. Now there's a funny situation. There are some gaps left here. 1 over root 3 is something like 0.48. And so there's a small gap here. And then there's a continuous rotation of the maximal vector for. Of the maximal vector from here to here. And 1 over root 3 is 0.5774. So there's a difference of just 1 over 200 or something. In this case, there's a continuous rotation from A3 to A2. Here there's a discontinuity. So this is a funny geometric situation. You have your L1 ball. Now if you take vector A2, the vector connecting to the midpoint of the line here, and so at the intersection. would be something like a small hexagon, right? So A2 in this case would give a small hexagon. Now A3 of course is the main diagonal direction. It's going up here and if you had one overall square root of three of course then you would get this Get this base. However, if you are beyond 1 over root 3, taking this would give 0. Now what happens is that this is sort of moving, this vector is moving in this direction continuously, but it does not give, in the end, you take the limit, it does not give the It does not give the fall on face, but it only gives something like this piece of the face. This is about the areas, this is one-third of this, the area is about five-ninths of the whole area. So even though you have a continuous rotation, it is somehow discontinuous at 1 over root 3. Yeah, it's a tedious calculation, as you can imagine, because you have three terms in this formula, and so this is quite complicated. Now, what I want to show is that you get a formula for the standard directions for all t in terms of derivatives. It's not really surprising because somehow Because somehow what happens is that you have these differences here. So if you take a limit, you get derivatives. For two terms, you have the first derivative. For higher terms, you have sort of higher differences. And so it is some kind of derivative. General formula, at least for k is equal to two and three and so on, so you can actually find this out. Actually, find this out. I don't want to go into the proof now. I want to say a few things about the steps in the proof. So, if t is between 1 over root 3 and 1 over root 2, u case, there are two possibilities. Either a1 is bigger than t and all other aj are smaller, or we have this more difficult case that a1 and a2. That A1 and A2 are bigger than T and the others are small. In the first case, A is again something like this. Only the first term shows up. There's no singularity. Now in this formula, of course, here in this situation, now by continuity, the formula would also hold it. Some of the H's are equal to R0. So here you don't have to assume anymore. Now, what you do here is you fix A1 and you consider this as a function of all the other Aj's with this constraint. Then you look for critical points of this function and show that they are all equal or they are zero. Now, if s coordinates are non-zero, then you get such a formula. Then you have to consider two cases, a1 less than 1 over root 2. root 2 or a 1 bigger than 1 over root 2. Both things are possible. Now in this situation you need at least s is equal to 2, otherwise s is equal to 1 is possible. Now if you investigate this thing, it turns out that this is decreasing in s, so the maximum occurs in this case plus is 2 or in this case 1. That's one, and then the extremo shows up to be one. So, in a more complicated case, you have this kind of formula which I put down here. Now, what do you do? You fix a1, a2, and t. Now, you consider this as a function of a3 up to a n with this constraint. And again, And again, possible equal or zero coordinates aj beyond 3. Now, if you write down the Lagrange equations for this, critical points of this function, I mean these aj's for j bigger than 3, are shown to contain at most two different non-zero coordinates. Because these will satisfy a certain quadratic equation, which comes out from the Lagrange equations. Now assume that you have two non-zero coordinates, A3 and AN, and they have some multiplicity, R and some S. Then some here would be R times A3. would be r times a3 squared plus a times a n squared. And so you can express a n as a function of a3. And then you show that the maximum of this funny function is obtained. Either one of them is zero. This means that we have not two possibly different coordinates, critical point, but only one in the maximum case. So then So then, A is up to a factor equal to this kind of thing, where I is this multiplicity. Now you have to investigate this thing here, with this thing, and then you show that the maximum of this thing occurs for i is equal to 1. Then a3 squared is this number, so you are out and left with this. Now we have Now we have only a function of a1 and a2, but still it's a complicated function. And now you fix a1. Then you show that this funny function is increasing in a2. You increase a2, this reduces a3 down to 0 possibly. So the maximum occurs either if a1, a2 is 0. if a1, a2 is equal to a1, the limit, the case that a1 is less than 1 over square root of 2, then this is allowed. a1 is bigger than this, then a2 at most would be 1 minus a1. The first case you have a limit, then you use L'Hopital's rule to find a formula which is increasing in F1. formula which is increasing in A1, and so the maximum is that 1 is A2 is equal to 12. And then you are left in this standard direction A2. However, for n bigger than 2, this is not the maximum situation. It's a critical point, but it's not the maximum. Second case, this one here. Also A is less than A one, but A may be bigger than A two. A may be bigger than A2. So in this situation that 1 over root t, 1 over root 3 less than t less than 1 and n bigger than 4, the maximum occurs only in the case when you have in the formula only one term. So from the beginning you don't know. Now some conjecture. Now, some conjectures. If you look at these standard directions, you can paint pictures, graphs of this, and you get the following conjecture. At least I got the following conjecture. For n bigger than 7, the direction A1 at 1 over root n, this is where you have the singularity. Would be bigger than the main diagonal direction. So for n bigger than 7, you will not no longer have a singularity at one remote. Because you have some nice continuity. So A n does different from dimensions 2 and 3, this does not yield the maximum. So now the conjecture for n bigger than 7. Conjecture for n bigger than 7 that there are numbers gamma n, beta, n, alpha n, such that a is maximal if you start off at 1 with a1, then a2, and then a n. So it sort of jumps from a1 to a2 to a n, main direction. And the numbers alpha n and beta n are the larger two solutions for t of these equations. Of these equations. This is parallel section function here is equal and he is equal. If you check the formulas for a1, a2 and a n, these things are of order 1 over n. Basically, you get an exponential equations and the solution is something like 3.4 over n plus 2. plus 2. For n bigger than 7, this number alpha n is less than 1 over root n. Now this means, if the conjecture is true, that for a very long distance between 1 and something like 1 over n, 3 over n, a1 would be the maximum. Like yeah, for t is equal to 0. 40 is equal to zero, but not below. Minimum, I have another conjecture, but maybe I want to say a few words about the complex situation. Much more complicated, but in dimension two you can consider this. Now in dimension two L12 and L infinity 2, of course, are isometric. Now for L infinity, you have well-known results. Basically, it depends on this formula. If t is less than a1 minus a2, this formula, if t is in this range, would be this formula. Want to mention the complex analog. So we consider the two-dimensional complex poly disc by define volume and there's a formula in terms of Bessel functions, which actually was used by Verczynski and Oneszkevich in their proofs. Now Now this can be evaluated more exactly in the situation. There's a t missing here, t between 0 and square root of 2. Then this is the analog of this formula here. This here looks easy. Looks more complicated. Here you have pi over a1 squared. This is still similar. Here you don't have relatively easy expression. Relatively easy expression, but here you have this arcsine monster, which is difficult to analyze, but it's possible. And give for certain directions and write it down. And what you find is that A2 is a critical point here. You can calculate this derivative. Derivative. This function here has two zeros, 0.3 and 0.107. So A2 would be at least a local maximum for T less than 0.30 or T bigger than 1.07. Now I only can show that this is the local maximum, but it's probably the absolute maximum if you look at the graph. Graphs. You can also see what the minimum is, but I'm not going into details. A2 yields the maximum central hyperplane, or T is equal to zero due to this result of Ollish, Kivich, and Bershin scheme. But here, if you look at the normalized poly disk and you look at the main diagonal direction and the limit, you can calculate this. And this is bigger than the young. This is bigger than the value for the normalized polydisc for A2. Tift T is something like this. So A2 will not hear the maximal hyperplane in the normalized poly disk if n is bigger than 1. Real situation is slightly different. Now I want to quickly state a few results. Quickly state a few results about the simplex, regular simplex, and I will use this representation. I take positive coordinates with sum up to one, and this would be sort of my representation of the regular syntax. Here it would be two syntaxes are three. In R3. Now the side length would be square root of 2, the height would be this, the volume would be this. And the centroid, of course, is this vector. And now I take direction vector with a situation that is sum the coordinates sum up to 0. This has the advantage that the advantage that the centroid is in this dominant hyperplane. So part of the centroid is now 1.0. Similar as in the symmetric case, the parallel section would be this function and if this condition is satisfied t is just the distance here. distance of the hyperplanes through centroid and the hyperplane. Now there's a result of a web of the order maximal central section, which I'm not doing. So now what we need is sort of standard directions. The vertices are The vertices are these here. And the distance of the vertices to the centroid is this number. Distance of the midpoint of edges to the centroid is this number. And this number would be the distance of the centroid to the centroid of a k-dimensional boundary syndrome. Now the unit vectors in the direction from the centroid to the centroid of a boundary simplex. The centroid of a boundary simplex or to the vertex by given by these numbers. So these are sort of the standard directions which I considered before. A1 points from the centroid to a vertex, a two to the midpoint of an edge, and A3 point of a boundary triangle. So a hyperplane orthogonal to the main sort of main diagonal, A1, is parallel to a boundary. A1 is parallel to a boundary n minus 1 phase. Now there's a situation here that if you look at n minus k plus 1, it's essentially minus ak up to permutation of coordinates. Now here the situation is the following n bigger than five Regular n simplex and t is the distance, and now I assume this situation. So, this is again a situation like 1 over root 3 less than t less than 1. Similar result is for the L1 wall. Again, A1 would be the maximal hyperplane distance centroid in this range of T. range of t. All these maximal sections at distance t are parallel to a boundary n minus one phase. And the orthogonal vector is a permutation of this standard direction. Now for n is 4, this is not completely true, it is only true up to 0.3877. This number here is 2 over 15. It defines the maximum. This way it's the maximum that's given by this direction. Now there's again a formula which we have to use to prove this. This was shown by Jerksen. He extended a result of web for central hyperplanes and actually in the And actually in his paper the formula looks a little bit different because he does not have this condition, he has a different normalization. But anyhow, if you assume this, you have a formula which reminds very much of the formula for the L1 case, except that you don't have squares here and you have no factor here, so it's slightly simpler. Now here Now here there's one advantage compared to the L1 case that because you can go from A and T to minus A and minus T, then you changes and then here turns out that you don't have to take n plus one times, rather only n plus one half to be the cost here. Maybe you can do with slightly less terms. Do with slightly less trouble. Proof of this theorem is very similar to theorem B, but there are the following differences. There's non-symmetry and we have an additional constraint. The second more complicated case here, there are now three possibly different values, not two, because you have an additional constraint. So this. So, this gives some difficulties. And you have to study this. I'm not going into details here. Anyhow, for the standard direction, you have an explicit formula which looks complicated, but which is quite explicit somehow. Now, these results can be used to Used to determine the maximum in two dimensions and in three dimensions of the sections, and I've done it here. And it's a little bit tedious to calculate, but again you have something going from A1 to A2 to some intermediate term dimension, and then this AT somehow something like this, which means that in this situation This situation. What is the result of MAP, which I mentioned? The result of MEP is the following. Take a midpoint and you connect this. Then this sort of thing is moved boundary phase. This is how this turns. I think I should stop here. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you very much. Questions? I was curious about the central sections of the circle, but for the minimum. Yeah, this is still this was a case of Hiddenberg, right? The central section parallel to the phase. Parallel to a case would be minimal. But I don't understand his proof. There's only a claim in his paper. Unfortunately, Philip Shorty died after he wrote this paper. He wrote, he can show it. And there's no proof. I I don't understand his arguments to be honest. Funny thing is that Webb does not mention this problem of Oh. Kind of strange. I I'm I'm sure that this is uh the minimum sketch. I have no proof. I think it's known only for smaller machines. Okay. Other questions? Bottlest thing to speed up. And the next talk is
