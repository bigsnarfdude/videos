And it's very beautiful every time. So yeah, thank you, and thank you all for coming. I'll be talking about Junction Principle, Frequency and Convexity, which is a joint work with Torresanti, Fentini, and Solani. It's not yet posted. At the time of submitting abstract, somehow it felt to me like of all my projects, this one is the closest to the end. It's not a high bar, but it's still now I don't also feel like it's all that close. I don't also feel like it's all that close. Actually, I'm feeling a bit nervous, giving this talk, not just because it's not close to the end, but because it's also a bit new topic for me. So it is what it is. Anyway, so let me remind you a classical definition first of a classical principal frequency. So suppose you have a convex domain. In principle, by the way, you don't need to consider it to be convex. It to be convex. So, usually it means open and bounded. Also, for this talk, I specifically have not mentioned bounded because we will not be considering bounded domains. So, it doesn't have to be convex, it has to have the usually one car inequality. But let's just say convex for simplicity. So, principal frequency of this domain, principal frequency. Of k. It's called lambda of k. There is two equivalent definitions. So it's defined to be the infimum of the integral of the gradient of u squared dx on k divided by the integral on k of u squared dx. Where the infium will mistake in our old functions which take value of 0 on the boundary. So u is in w. So u is in W12, okay, so the appropriate space for which these things make sense. Let me not solve the space. And U on the boundary is zero. So this is called principal frequency. So for any, it can be considered for any domain provided that it's finite, so provided that, so the fact that this quantity is finite. Quantity is violent is called the Jewish level for inequality, or solely inequality, some people, if you appropriately call it. Equivalently, this lambda of k actually is the smallest number, so it's the smallest positive number. such that L such that there exists a function u in W12 k such that L u is minus lambda of k times u and u on the boundary is zero. This is this hold on k. So This function is called the first Dirichlet eigenfunction. So it's a first eigenfunction of the last operator with Dirichlet zero boundary condition. The equivalence can be shown in a variety of ways. You can perhaps, for example, return. You can say that if a k-mom is at the bay end here, then if we take u plus epsilon v, take derivative, derivative should be zero, we can conclude this. We can conclude this. You also save some records, but I mean, there are better ways. Anyway, so this is the classical principle frequency. Are there any questions about this definition? So a number of things are known about this. It's a very well-studied object. One famous thing... Questions? No? Dima? Let me just take. So it's okay, okay, yes. Uh so it's okay okay yes it's non non okay non-zero non-zero so it's a n yeah non-zero What? Sorry what subsid run is fine yeah you're right there should subside on zero it's important yes okay Julian here is actually okay Julian you'll be my role you know this thing's better than something else Julian good Yes, exactly. Yes, yes, yes. Okay. Now is everything okay? Okay, good. So, a famous fact about principal frequencies, for example, Fiber-Cran inequality. Very nice Fiber-Cran inequality. As usual, I don't remember the year, but it's a long, long time ago, before Mark was born. Probably. No, no, then this is not true. Anyway, survival friend inequality. Anyway, so Weber-Krand inequality tells us that if you prescribe the volume of K to be the same as the volume of some bulb, then the principal frequency of K will be a small, let me double-check myself smaller than that of a ball. So it's an isopermatic type inequality. In fact, it follows from the isopermatic inequality. From the periodic inequality. So, those of you who know Porte-Sorko principle, which in itself is nothing but the periodic inequality, essentially. If you apply Porte-Soko principle to this quotient, you see that you see this straight away. Okay, so another important, interesting thing about this is that if I dilate my domain k by t, it scales with a factor of t to the power minus two. factor of t to the power minus 2 as can be checked from definition directly and the following very nice result of brascom-pleb is perhaps the most important historical reference for this talk so brascom pleb showed with the 70s presumably that if we have a pair of convex domains so if k0 and k1 are convex compact convex convex bodies let's say Let's say in a run, then if I take any t between 0 and 1, the following the Mintlovsky type inequality holds. If I take average of my two bodies and raise it to the power minus one half, it's smaller than or equal to T lambda of k. No. T lambda of k0 minus one half plus one minus t lambda of k1 minus one half. So it turns out that this nice functional Dirichne principal frequency follows sort of Bruminkovsky type inequality. There is no need, of course, to remind you the actual Bruminkowski inequality, also is not directly related to the story, but also. The story, but all of you know that when we take the Kovsky sum of convex sets or convex, when a functional has some concavity property, it reminds us of Umikovsky. So this is a result of Brass-Company Leap. And key result, key other results that it was based on. So they proved this and they also proved the result that it was based on that actually this first eigenfunction, the first HD eigenfunction. First eigenfunction, the first user eigenfunction is log concave. So if u, so if this is, let's say, star, yes, so if u satisfies star, then u is log con k. So this is my domain k, dot function u on it, something like this. 0 on the boundary, it's log gun k. So Brass Cap and Lib proved a token k and they used it in a way that I will hopefully And they used it in a way that I will hopefully show you how to deduce this nice inequality. Any questions about this? So this is, yeah, this is a nice background. So by the way, notice here that because this functional is minus two homogeneous, the fact that this Brimikowski inequality holds to the power of minus one-half is automatic from any kind of concave. Is automatic from any kind of concavity. So whenever we show any sort of concavity for this functional, we automatically can deduce this, we can improve it to this minus one-half concavity by a standard method. Notice a nice fact that this implies, by the way, it implies the following nice fact, that if the width of a convex body k is fixed, the mean widths. So if w of k, which is integral on the sphere of a Integral when the sphere of HK of Zeta, let's say, is fixed to be, I don't know, A, then this lambda is minimized, so lambda of K is bigger than or equal to lambda of the wall for which we have the same width. Okay, R. Okay, so R times the sphere the same. The atmosphere thing. So, if we prescribe the mean widths, then the principal frequency will be minimized on the ball. This is because Minkowski averages do not change between, right? Because support functions z, support functions add, therefore integrals also add. So, if we take a pair of different if we take a so what we do is we take a quantity quantity k maybe We take the quantum 4 decay, maybe take some reflection, take an average, take another reflection, take an average, and so on. We continue the procedure to converge to a ball. Mid-base will be the same, yes? I don't believe there is a way to relate it to fiber crow. But it's a good question. Is it stronger as a fiber crut? Because actually, I remember I asked myself this and concluded that no. So there is an inequality that. So there is an inequality that says that if you prescribe Zamin bits, modeling will be maximized on a ball or something. So, okay, I'm not quick enough to think about it right now, but I thought about it and I thought that actually it doesn't apply further crowd. And it doesn't follow either somehow. But maybe I was wrong and it does. I don't know. But okay, I'll think after that again. I think my previous conclusion was held. Anyway, so yeah, okay, so this is history. Maybe a few more few. Yeah, okay, so this is history, maybe a few more few more names. Uh there are many proofs of all these facts. Caffarelli-Friedman I can mention there's a paper of Caffarelli and Friedman there was a paper of Borel Christian Burrell and there was a paper by Goria Barr and Lewis and Andrea Colisanti characterized the quality cases in here. Characterize the quality cases in here. So there is no non-trivial equality cases except for the K and L being K0 and K1 being dialect of each other. Cool, so this is a background. Mark, Gimma, what? What? No, Mark, say, yes, it's possible that I missed it up. Everything is just very last minute. Yes. So what about the equality cases? Equality cases. But I sent to you verified that the equality cases in this inequality, even on if K0 and K1 are. Even on if K0 and K1 are dialects of functions or Mark? No, no. Good. Did I say something else? It's not minimized, but maximized? Okay, got it, because everything is a bit last minute, honestly. Okay, so let me now talk a little bit about the actual subject of this talk, which is the Gaussian principle frequency. So in general, if you have a low-concave measure, so suppose measure, so suppose dÎ¼ is a long concave measure. d mu of x is e to the power minus v of x dx, where v is a convex function. This measure will also associate its own Laplace functional L u, which is Laplace U minus grad U grad V, which, like the usual Laplace Which, like the usual Laplace function, will also satisfies the integration by part with respect to this measure. And one could also define the principal frequency with respect to this measure. So one could define lambda mu of k, again k is subdomain, to be the infimum over all u which are in reasonable subject space of whatever reasonable functions. Our visible functions. That is zero on the boundary of integral of grad u squared d mu divided by integral of u squared d mu. So equivalently, once again, it's equivalently L U so lambda v of k is the smallest, smallest positive. Positive number such that there exists u00 in the appropriate space such that lu is minus lambda u of k. So L is this operator associated with the measurement. The function u is near the boundary. For this talk, I shall For this talk I shall focus specifically on the Gaussian measure, because quite surprisingly the results that I will state we have currently four different proofs of, but they all kind of only specialize to the Gaussian measure, and for completely different reasons, neither of them seems to extend beyond. Which is quite annoying. It might be different to actually at the time of the paper, so don't take it for granted, but at the time it seems like this. Anyway, so yes, so if Anyway, so yes, so if we will focus on the case of d gamma e to the power minus x squared over 2 plus some constant the Gaussian measure and the operator is the Eunstein Muhlenberg operator one might ask all the same things about this expression. Let me mention one result before I go One result, before I go to our result, let me actually mention a nice result of Carlin and Kerze, who showed that similarly to how the principal frequency, the back principal frequency is maximized on a ball, when the volume is fixed, the Gaussian principal frequency is maximized on a half space when the Gaussian measure is fixed. So if H is a half space and gamma of H equals to gamma of K and K is a gamma. Gamma of k and k is a convex set, then lambda gamma of k is smaller than lambda gamma of h. So this is an again follows from the Gaussian and the primary inequality via something called Erfard principle using the same kind of arrangement techniques. And now of course we move on to the questions of this talk is whether or not we can have some concavity property for Have some concavity property for this Gaussian principal frequency. So the question is: okay, do we have some kind of concavity property for lambda gamma? And so the two theorems that I can state, I erase, did I erase the names? I erase the names. Okay, so I'll write them again. Actually, there is one term. So it's Polisanti Alfred Kini then me and then Paolo Salvani. Um first of all it turns out that indeed the first Tibet The first Tibet eigenfunction is log concave was a Gaussian measure as well. So should be declared U? Yes, yes. U is missing. U is missing. Yes, thank you very much. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Definitely, yes. Okay, so yes, so yes, so the gamma is Gaussian. K is a convex set, doesn't have to be bounded anymore because Have to be bounded anymore because for the Gaussian measure, we have one inequality and you have one inequality also for unbounded sets. Then we consider lambda to be the smallest such that there exists a u non-zero with lu minus lambda u and zero on the boundary. Then this function u is log conc. Is log kat k. So the first Eigree Steigen function with respect to the Orchid-Lemberg operator is also logged at k. Perhaps surprisingly it was not known, it's not in the literature, it's not, but it's yet true. And also this lambda gamma functional has a nice congavity property, but because we don't have any continuity, we establish kind of the most basic one in the power 1, the lambda gamma. In the power 1, so lambda gamma of tk0 plus 1 minus t k will be smaller than or equal to check this. Yeah, smaller than or equal to 1 minus t lambda gamma of k plus t lambda gamma of k1. So both of these facts indeed appear to be true. Appear to be true. Any questions about this so far? Actually, don't have that much time, yes? Correct. Okay, so let me. Yeah, okay, let me do any questions? So, as I said, I'll explain to you hopefully in the remaining time how this implies this, how the fact that the first eigenfunction is logon-cave implies that this principle frequency possesses the cavity property, which is a nice argument. For the first result, we currently have, like I said, four different proofs, and all of them seem to be very special for the Gaussian method. Seem to be very special for the Gaussian method, which is quite unusual. We really think that it's probably not true for general lockpick gate measures, this is just simply probably not true. I haven't got examples yet, but anyway, like I said, it's maybe a little bit too much complex. Any questions about the theorem? This is a very here, optimal exponent. So, this is a very good question, actually. So, unfortunately, Actually, so unfortunately, we do not have homogeneity here. Nothing is homogeneous with respect to the Gaussian matter. So we can no longer say we prove whatever gravity and bump it up. I don't know if the right question is what is the optimal exponent. The right question may be what is the optimal function that I put here that f composed with lambda gamma is concave. This is a very good question. For example, we know this Gaussian measure, such optimal function is fiber. Such an optimal function is phi inverse. One can conclude optimality of that function in a variety of ways. Indeed, phi inverse is honestly a very, very optimal function, which is the inverse of the Gaussian CDI. Our initial, in fact, when we started working on it, we were like, maybe there is phi inverse concavity. We don't know how to prove it at all. In fact, I forgot to mention something important here that I will mention in one second. But yeah, so yeah, the answer is we don't know. We don't know. It's a good question. A good question. But note that the theorem actually already implies that if we prescribe the mean bits of a convex set, convex void, let's say, to be fixed, then this lambda functional will be minimized on a ball. So if mean, let me write it in words. If mean width of k is prescribed, That lambda gamma of k is minimized on a ball. So you see, this is totally different from Gaussian is a periodic inequality and the Carl and Gertzebo-Fiber-Karin inequality, where things are extremal for half-spaces. When we talk about Gaussian measure, we generally expect things to be extremal for half-spaces, not for both. Although there are, for example, there is a version of the Gaussian pain, Weimberger inequality. Of the Gaussian-Pay involved inequality, which has both as optimizers. Sometimes balls are optimizers, there are some trivial results for ball optimizers that somehow use rotational invariants. In fact, this suggests that perhaps for rotational invariant measures, maybe this is also true. And in fact, one of our methods actually does have a little bit of a chance for that, in fact. But somehow, in spirit, this is very different from Gaussian superprimatic inequality and from Kelsey's result about Fibrocran analog. Fiber-cran analog because it's not about half spaces. So maybe it's also not about five inverse functions because five inverse functions are half spaces. So, yeah, we don't know. We haven't understood it. Any more questions? Reverse behavior of a water cat will work affected. This is it? No, no, it should not be. It should not be reverse. It should be the same. I thought it minimized, I thought. Minimized, I thought. I don't know what it is. It's maximized for five gram. So if you prescribe volume, it is maximized. What? No? Okay, maybe I'm correct. So let's analyze it. Because inequality is the same as for the back. We had an inequality in the other direction, but with negative power. So it should be exactly the same. Is it minimized or maximized? Minimize. Minimized if you prescribe minimates. If you prescribe or wait, so isolatron? I hope that you wrote it correctly in the far cal and reversed in the medium. Okay. Okay. So this is wrong. Now this is the same as so fabric so you're saying that fabric run, if you prescribe I thought I looked it up when I was very good. I thought I looked it up and I was very good. You're confusing me right now because I looked it up and I'm very embarrassed right now, but I looked it up and I thought it was okay, it's possible. So, okay, if you prescribe mean, okay, so let's see. So if you prescribe minutes, you take a convex body K, you start symmetrizing it, the lambda will decrease. It will decrease every time you do the symmetrization. So so uh it's minimized if you prescribe nucleates. If you're prescribing it, it's yeah. Uh yeah, I can judge myself again, but mean width and volume they both the same to the same inequality or is it reversed? So uh it's reversed. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, sorry for this, like I said, but it's I think I'm right, I think. Okay, so uh let me Okay, so let me explain some idea of the proof, just very quickly. So how do we possibly prove such a concavity statement? So the point is the following, that if we define this kt to be this t k naught plus 1 minus t k1, we construct, the goal is to construct a function construct a function Ut on KT such that LUT is minus T lambda naught plus 1 minus T lambda 1, so where lambda naught and lambda 1 correspond to K0 and K1 times UT and 0 on the boundary of Kt. If we construct such a function, then what? Then what? Then we can write that integral of ut LUT on one hand it equals, so let's do minus, right, on one hand it equals to t lambda naught plus or minus t lambda one integral of u t squared. I'm missing Gaussian measure everywhere, of course, but Gaussian measure is assumed. On the other hand, it On the other hand, it equals to integral of gradient ut squared d gamma. And if I divide one side by the other, I get that integral of gradi squared d gamma over ut squared d gamma equals to t lambda 1 plus 1 minus t lambda lambda 0 lambda 1 here. But on the other hand, you know that infimum of this quantity of all possible functions is our guy. So this is bigger than a record. So, this is bigger than or equal to lambda gamma of kt. And so, this is it. This gives us inequality. So, the goal is, or I guess I have one minute constant later, is to construct a function which satisfies this. And so, how do we construct this function? Where we directly, so this function ut is given by e. function ut is given by e to the power, so let me explain, w t by w t is t w note star plus 1 minus t w 1 star star where w i is e to the power minus w minus u no the other way around u i is e to the power minus w i. So we take our solution We take our solutions on our domains, take logarithms, we know that they're concave. We take the average of the Legenders and take Legendre. From the properties of Legendre transform and the equation that this function satisfies, we can basically do some manipulations, say that, okay, this equation implies something about the W. The key step in the proof, however, to obtain the inequality is the trade. To tensor inequalities, the concavity of the trace inverse on the space of positive definite matrices, here which we apply to Hessians of these functions. And we can use the properties of the juncture. So anyway, it's a bit too long, so I'll stop here. Thank you. If you don't take PLSD, how do we call this? PHD boundary condition, but why not boundary condition? I believe nothing else is first eigenvalue is zero, but maybe the first one to eigenvalue is possible. So to the best of my knowledge, there is absolutely no such thing for the Neumann eigenvalue. It's very much a difficult question. I don't believe you can... Of course you cannot say any kind of local gravity because it's going to actually be, you know, all like this, right? It's going to be odd, for instance, for given measures, right? Measures, right? And it's a very, very different picture to the best of my knowledge. You can say, I think it's known. However, it is known. So a version of 5 picron is known in the reverse. So it's minimized. So 5-1 is minimized on a ball. Maximized Neumann is minimized on a poll. Unless I'm not doing everything that's completely opposite order. So and that is, I forgot, due to. I forgot due to the same thing. Is this the same WT that Corinthians used for the pillar plus? Same W. So I, for the pillar plus, yes, in his paper, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. This is the same idea. Yes. Interpolation. Same idea. And yeah, yeah. I maybe also pressed up. Yeah? Is there any hope for rotation in the variant button? Well yeah, so like I said, that's a bit like I said, it's a bit of a preliminary report. For a while we were like, okay, everything's completely Gaussian, we absolutely cannot extend this without being a Gaussian, even though in spirit it's very non-Gaussian. But right now there's four different approaches and one of the approaches might actually lead to it. Maybe maybe there's some hope, not hope. We have a twenty-five minutes.
