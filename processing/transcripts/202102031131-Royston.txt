Pulling off this whole thing under these crazy circumstances. I'm really honored to be giving this talk. I'm also quite daunted. When I was first asked about it, I thought to myself, okay, how many years will I need to prepare? But here we are. And of course, I utterly failed to. And of course, I utterly failed to prepare anything that is nearly as inspiring as the title of this talk sounds, but do the best we can. And if you make it to the end, if we make it to the end, I promise a video of a singular monopole bubbling into nothing and then bubbling back and then bubbling into nothing again and bubbling back, etc. Okay, so let's go ahead and get started. So I really enjoyed. So, I really enjoyed Derek Carlin's talk, and in particular at the beginning, when he was assessing what has changed and what hasn't changed since 1974. But as a quantum field theorist, I will go back a little bit earlier for the founding of the magnetic monopole. In fact, this year, the magnetic monopole turns 90. If you've never read the paper by Dirac, I highly recommend it. Here's a few prescient sentences from the introduction. From the introduction. The steady progress of physics requires for its theoretical formulation a mathematics that gets continually more advanced. Non-Euclidean geometry and non-commutative algebra, which were at one time considered to be purely fictions of the mind and pastimes for logical thinkers, have now been found to be very necessary for the description of general facts of the physical world. It seems likely that this process of increasing abstraction will continue in the future and that advance in physics is to be associated with the physical physics. And that advance in physics is to be associated with a continual modification and generalization of the axioms at the base of mathematics rather than with the logical development of any one mathematical scheme on a fixed foundation. So Dirac's quantization of magnetic charge, how did it work? Well, he started with the observation that in quantum mechanics, wave functions can carry a non-intequable phase. Non-inequable phase, beta, with the derivatives of that phase given in terms of the electromagnetic potential. We'll just consider a time-independent case here on R3. So we're just looking at the vector potential for electromagnetism. Curl of that is the magnetic field. So this observation goes back before Dirac, but his new contribution was to note that the change in this phase around a closed loop need not be the same. loop need not be the same actually for all wave functions, but can differ for two different wave functions by an integer multiple of 2π. So that's going to happen if one of those wave functions has sign through the loop. So that's a line along which the wave function vanishes. So these would be later known as the Dirac strings. And he then showed that the nodal lines have to end on singularities in the magnetic field. Singularities in the magnetic field. And essentially, with a Stokes-type argument, the sum of the phase differences around all nodal lines that end on singularities within any given closed surface has to be an invariant given by the magnetic flux through that surface. So in equations, you got this, and that led directly to the quantization of charge. Here, M is the magnetic flux, E is the electric charge, H bar and C. H bar and C are constants of nature, and N is just minus the sum of my N i's there. So the product of electric and magnetic charge is equal to an integer times a fixed constant of nature. And in so many words, I mean, what Dirac showed is that it is consistent with all physical requirements of quantum mechanics to regard the wave function as a section of a U1 line bundle determined by the magnetic charge. In the conclusions, he wrote, Conclusions, he wrote, This new development requires no change whatever in the formalism when expressed in terms of abstract symbols denoting states and observables, but is merely a generalization of the possibilities of representation of these abstract symbols by wave functions and matrices. Under these circumstances, one would be surprised if nature had not made use of it. Can I ask a question, Andrew? Yeah, sure. Yeah, so I've So I've wondered before in this argument to try and put monopole charges to restore the symmetry to Maxwell's equations. You try to put the symmetry at the level of the fields, of the strengths, of the electric and magnetic fields, but not at the level of the potentials. What if you try to restore the symmetry already at the level of potentials? Already at the level of potential, saying that there is also a vector potential for electric, for electricity, and the phi, a field for magnetic. Do you know what happens if one does that and why doesn't one do that? It sounds like things that have been done. Things that have been done before. There are these formalisms that are sort of electromagnetic duality invariant formalisms for the abelian gauge theory in Cyberg-Witten theory. But I'm not sure that, yeah, I mean, you can do something like that. Something like that. But it was just more than, you know, what was being sought at the time. Okay. Yeah, I don't, I'm not sure I have anything better to say right now. That's exactly how Gibbons and Manton compute there. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Exactly what? Sorry, can you say that again? Gibbons and Mac computers. Yeah, that's how. So Gibbons and Man. That's how so Gibbons and Manton used exactly that kind of a formalism also when they did their computation of the asymptotic metric on one moduli space by thinking of them as a matrix. Okay, I see. So that kind of approach is definitely out there, but it certainly wasn't at Indirax time. Okay, thank you. So after that initial breakthrough in 1931, over those next 50 years, so mathematicians were steadily building and exploring those more abstract foundations, including importantly the theory of fiber bundles. During that time, physicists were preoccupied with another concern, though, the development of quantum field theory. Now, quantum field theory and the ideas that evolved from it are absolutely fundamental. Evolved from it are absolutely fundamental to the modern results that I want to get to in the talk. So, and especially sort of the approach to QFT due to Feynman and Wilson. So, I want to spend a few slides on Feynman and Wilson's QFT tutorial. And so, actually, what I'm going to start with is Feynman's path integral formulation for quantum mechanics. So, given a Hamiltonian operator in quantum mechanics, Given a Hamiltonian operator in quantum mechanics and a corresponding time evolution operator u, then the transition amplitude to go from some initial state psi i to some final state psi f can be represented by this Feynman path integral. So here this is a shorthand notation for the instruction to perform a whole bunch of integrals. Over the values of the phase-space coordinates at discretized points on the time interval. There's actually an extra coordinate integration to do. And then after you get that result, you're supposed to take the limit where epsilon is the length of each sub-interval going to zero. into zero here big t is t final minus t initial should be t over n let's see t over n thank you that would be better um so this approach to quantum mechanics is as good as any other formalism pretty much any solvable model you can think of can be handled with the quantum mechanics path Handled with the quantum mechanics path integral. In fact, there is even a handbook of Feynman path integrals. In some ways, it's better because the analytic continuation of this path integral to Euclidean time turns the WKB approximation for tunneling into a semi-classical saddle point analysis around a classical solution to the Euclideanized equations of motion. And so for kind of To motion. And so, for kind of a nice introduction to that approach, I'd recommend Sidney Coleman's The Uses of Instantons. Well, that's quantum mechanics. Oh, and one other comment. If H happens to be quadratic in the momenta, as it often is, then when we integrate out that, we recover the usual Lagrangian form of the phase e to the i action. So, naively, if we want to construct a path integral for If we want to construct a path integral for quantum field theory, well, we just generalize to an infinite number of degrees of freedom. So let's consider for the moment a scalar field phi, which is going to be a map from our Minkowski space-time into the reals. And we'll suppose we have some Hamiltonian for that scalar field. And all we're doing with the previous formula is letting our degree of freedom Q be an infinite set, which are the values of phi at different spatial points. Of phi at different spatial points x. And similarly, p goes to pi. And so now this object here is supposed to be some product over a spectral parameter, let's not give it a range, or a normal mode parameter of a whole bunch of those quantum mechanics path integrals. So actually, these are still capped. So actually, these are still capital D's here where the phik are eigenvalues or normal modes of a linear operator. Let's call it delta. That determines the quadratic part of the Hamiltonian. So we'll call that quadratic part H0. H0 plus order phi cubed, say. And then these wave functionals up here are pretty general. They allow you to set up some initial state and some final state of the field. And normally we consider this sort of thing in the limit where our initial time and our final time are going to. And our final time are going to minus infinity and plus infinity. And then these states make these wave functionals will make contact with the asymptotic states in the Hilbert space of the CFT. But there are all sorts of problems with this. So student says, hey, I did the Klein-Gordon path integral. Klein-Gordon is integral, Klein Gordon, his free theory, H equals H naught, for the vacuum to vacuum amplitude. And I got something undefined. Professor Feynman says, well, of course you did. This computes e to the minus it sum over all of my frequencies. So these are just the eigenvalues. And that should have been a k and there are infinitely many normal modes. In fact, there's probably Many normal modes. In fact, there's probably a continuous, non-countable infinitely many normal modes. In fact, we should probably divide out by this amplitude so as to define this as the zero of energy. And you shouldn't complain about it because only changes in the potential energy matter in physics. Now, that last comment might come back to haunt us if we're trying to construct a quantum theory of gravity, but let's leave that aside for now and press forward. Now and press forward. So, student, I tried to compute the first perturbative correction in G to the scalar propagator in phi to the four theory. So, what's phi to the four theory? That would be Hamiltonian gradient term plus or maybe minus, depending on what you want to do, mass term, but now a nonlinear interaction. But now a non-linear interaction. So I computed the first perturbative correction in G and I got infinity. Professor Wilson says, you're right. What you tried to compute is not defined. But you were thinking about QFT the wrong way. The parameters in the Hamiltonian M and G aren't really constants. Rather, they change with the energy scale. So let's truncate the number of modes in your The number of modes in your computation by throwing away those modes with energy eigenvalues above some cutoff μ. And while we're at it, we should probably put the theory in a box of sides L2 so that the spectrum is discrete. We can send L to infinity later. Now, you give me values G0 and M0 in a scale mu naught, and I'll determine running couplings g of mu, m of mu, order by order in perturbation theory, such that Perturbation theory, such that the value of the couplings at the scale you gave me is the value of the running coupling at the scale you gave me is the couplings you wanted. And the limit of your computation as mu over mu naught goes to infinity exists, provided that we replace the bare g and m you had with my running g of mu and m of u. Furthermore, provided the theory is renormalizable, this procedure will cure the divergences in any computed observer. The divergence is in any computed observable, and thus we have not lost predictive power. So, this Wilsonian renormalization scheme, and here I'm just setting it up order by order in perturbation theory, lets you define a notion of an effective Hamiltonian or an effective action, which is going to be really crucial. So these are So these depend on those parameters, mu naught and all of the g naughts that you have. And they're defined by path integrating out all modes with energies mu above mu naught. So you can think of it as being defined by this relation here, where the little subscript mu on the path integral here means we only integrate up to energies, modes of energies mu naught. So, often we have more than one kind of field. Some of the fields are massive and they have a mass gap in their spectrum, and some are massless. So, by choosing this scale mu naught to be at the mass gap, we completely integrate out the massive fields from the action. But in an interacting theory, the heavy and the light modes will couple. So, when we integrate out these high energy modes, doing that will Will doing that will result in new couplings in the effective action for the light modes. Indeed, an infinite set of terms that can be organized into a double expansion. So we're going to have an expansion in the coupling G naught since we are doing this kind of order by order and perturbation theory, but now we're also going to have an expansion in this energy scale, μ naught. And that expansion typically takes the form of a derivative expansion. And so concludes our little tutorial on QFT. So, any questions before I move on to the return of the monopole? Andy. Yes. On the previous slides, you had this idea of sort of only looking at all the truncating by looking at by throwing away. By looking at by throwing away those with energy above a certain cutoff scale. So, just from an intuition perspective, I guess I'm thinking things with a lot of energies are the things you don't want to throw away. So, obviously, my intuition is wrong, probably because I don't do physics enough. But is it because those with a lot of energies are they don't, they're very small and they don't affect anything? Throwing away, so I don't mean that we're. Away, so I don't mean that we're going to throw them away in the end. This is just like a regularization device. So, by throwing away, I mean let's regularize that integral that we want to do by putting an upper limit on it. And then what's going on here is that trying to take that, what we want to do is we want to include all those modes, right? So, we want to let that go to infinity, but if we But if we pretend, or if we keep these constants in our classical Hamiltonian as fixed constants and think them that way, that limit just doesn't exist. So we're only doing this step here in order to be able to determine what these running couplings are. So there's a specific procedure to do that, and they'll depend on that cutoff. That cutoff. And then once we've got that, then we go ahead and let that limit go. And then we are including all of those degrees of freedom. What's the difference between mu and mu zero? Yeah, so mu zero is a fixed scale. You can think of it as some convenient scale where you could go, you know, and if this is some theory of the physical world, actually measure those couplings. World actually measure those couplings. So it's the renormalization scale. So it's fixed and it's finite. μ is sort of our artificial upper cutoff that we're going to eventually send to infinity. But you have to introduce this scale in order to carry out this renormalization procedure. And once you introduce that scale, that's the scale then that appears in the effective action. The effect of action. So here we are by going from here to here, we are now integrating out, we are taking care of all of those higher energy degrees of freedom, and we are taking into account their effects through the new terms that they generate in this effective action. Also, another thing I don't know that confuses me is Me is how do we choose at the fixed energy scale that we fix the value of the couplings there? One thing depends. That's what defines the theory, if you like. So you choose them as you wish. Like, and it's kind of so in the classical theory, you get to choose the G and the M that I wrote down in that Hamiltonian. So there's something left of that choice, which is now you're choosing those. Which is now you're choosing the value of those couplings at a renormalization scale. Okay, okay. Yeah. And these equations, these are called renormalization conditions. So you need them in order to start cranking this machine. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. So, how broad is this class of renormalizable field theories? Well, Well, it includes Yang-Mills-Higgs in four or less dimensions, which not incidentally is relevant to our current best description of nature. And this is about where the monopole re-enters our story. So in 1974, Toften Polyakov discovered that Yang-Mills-Higgs contains finite energy magnetic monopoles. And shortly thereafter, in the next few years, a formalism for defining solid. For defining soliton states in quantum field theory was developed and it fits nicely into this Feynman-Wilson framework. So, here's the basic idea of a soliton state in QFT. So, we're going to take our original phase space variables, pi and phi, and we're going to do a change of variables on phase space. So, the new position or coordinates, if you will, are a collection of Are a collection of a finite number of degrees of freedom, q. These are the collective coordinates of the soliton, which are being promoted to dynamical variables, and a field fluctuation, chi. And this fluctuation is constrained to lie orthogonal to the tangent space, to the moduli space of the soliton. So it's accounting for all of the remaining field-theoretic degrees of freedom. And the transformation on the coordinates. Transformation on the coordinates looks like this. So, this is schematic. Now, I'm using phi to sort of denote the collection of all the fields. So, for monopole, it would be the Higgs field and the components of the gauge field. And this notation here is meant to indicate that some of the collective coordinates are the actual position of the monopole, but of course, a monopole will also have additional collective coordinates. But the basic kind of form of this. Basic kind of form of this is that you're taking the monopole solution, you're letting the moduli become functions of time, and then you're accounting for all of the field theoretic fluctuations around that. Now I'm not writing out the formula for pi. It's determined by the condition that this transformation preserve the Liouville measure, that it be a canonical transformation. Once you've done this, now you can define a soliton state. So this would be defined by, for example, giving that. Defined by, for example, giving that wave functional. So the wave functional is going to be an ordinary quantum mechanics wave function on the collective coordinates tensored with the ground state wave functional, the ground state of all the oscillators inside of this field theory chi. At least, so this is the picture, the general picture. And so the state of affairs in physics. Affairs and physics after the first 50 years was nicely summarized by Coleman in the magnetic monopole 50 years later. So for more than 40 years, the magnetic monopole was an optional accessory. Dirac had shown how to build theories with monopoles, but you didn't have to use them if you didn't want to. Seven years ago, things changed. Tuft and Polyakov showed that magnetic monopoles inevitably occur in certain Inevitably occur in certain gauge theories. In particular, all grand unified theories necessarily contain monopoles. Many of us believe that grand unified theories describe nature at least down to the Planck length. So where are the monopoles? So I'm not going to really say anything more about grand unified monopoles, but there are a lot of interesting physics phenomena associated with them. And I think Daniel Brennan is going to talk about one of those and some of the cool math behind it. Cool math behind it in the next talk. Okay, but was QFT really ready to be useful for mathematics and the mathematical results associated with monopoles? Well, some pros for that are the class of renormalizable field theories is pretty general, including Yang-Mills, Yang-Mills, Higgs. And we don't really have to be in Minkowski signature. We can analytically continue to Euclidean time as we did in Quarterback. To Euclidean time, as we did in quantum mechanics and study vacuum-to-vacuum matrix elements on Riemannian manifolds. However, there's still too many cons. It's messy, there seems to be tricky limits involved, and do we really know that that renormalization is well defined non-perturbatively? So, also, you know, QFT computes observables. So, the observables should be something of interest mathematically, and we would probably Mathematically, and we would probably want something better than an asymptotic series and a small parameter for them. And also, what if we want to study Yang-Mills-Higgs in greater than four dimensions? So while mathematicians forged ahead with many remarkable results, physicists still needed two more tools before QFD could be brought to bear on the problem. So that brings us to the last 40 years, and the two tools are supersymmetry and strings. And strings. So, supersymmetry is an odd extension of the Ponker A algebra, a pun intended. In a supersymmetric theory, the Hilbert space of states forms a representation of this algebra. Now, at the level of actions, one adds fermions or Grassmann-valued sections of appropriate spinner bundles with certain special couplings such that the action is invariant under field transformations. Under field transformations, mixing these fermions with the original bosons. Turns out that with enough supersymmetry, some of the cons of the previous slide are bypassed because the path integrals can either be computed exactly via localization or inferred by indirect arguments utilizing symmetry. String theory. So since I'm supposed to be talking about quantum field theory in monopoles, I'm going to look at string theory. I'm going to look at string theory perhaps slightly perversely as a quantum field theory in 10 or 11 dimensions, depending on the formulation, which just happens to have an infinite number of fields. It also has a class of solitonic objects of varying codimension capable of hosting localized modes and interacting and joining with each other to form networks. So these are the DP brains and the NS5 brains of the type 2 string theories and the M2 and M5 brains of M theory. In the M2 and M5 brains of M theory. So there are many different low-energy effective descriptions in string theory depending on which fields are integrated out and which aren't. These descriptions include supergravity, supersymmetric Yang-Mills-Higgs in various dimensions, including d greater than 4, and strongly coupled superconformal theories without Lagrangian descriptions. Just to give you an idea. So often providing Often providing multiple descriptions of the same underlying state in the string theory Hilbert space. So that can give us a lot of insight. So for the remainder of the talk, I want to kind of focus on three examples. BPS states in 4DN equals 2 Yang-Mills-Higgs on R13. Vacuum structure in 3DN equals 4 Yang-Mills-Higgs on R12. On R12 and vacuum structure in 40 and equals 2 Yang-Mills Higgs on R12 cross S1. So the thing that's in common with all three of these is that all of these theories I'm describing by giving the dimensions and supersymmetry, they all have eight supercharges. N here is the number of minimal spinners that we're filling out with supercharges. So in 40, So in 4D, the minimal spinner has four real degrees of freedom. So in n equals 2 theory, we'll have eight supercharges. In 3D, in n equals 4 theory, it has eight supercharges. And kind of the underlying reason for focusing on theories with eight supercharges is because that's the minimal number, which allows you to put a gauge field or a connection and a Higgs field in the same supersymmetry multiplet. Before we get started on this, Um, before we get started on this, any questions? I will also comment on other uh Andy, yeah. So these are examples of what of quantum, yeah. So quantum field theories. Uh, these are all examples of quantum field theories, and um they all have realizations. As low energy effective descriptions in string theory, you could take string theory, integrate out some of those massive degrees of freedom in string theory, and realize these as low energy effective theories within string theory. But separately, taking string theory out of it and just talking about renormalizable quantum field theories, these are all examples of that. Examples of that. And so we can also just look at them, let them stand on their own, and try to see what we can understand about, for example, low energy effective actions in them. So in the second example there, when you're talking about the monopole modulized space, you're talking on R12? I mean, this is. No, so this is going to end up being the Coulomb branch of Vacua. Of vacua. So the so the vacua. So these theories all have the property that there's not a unique vacuum in the quantum theory. There's a family of them. And that family actually carries a natural metric. And so from the point of view of just saying, I want to study the vacuum structure of some 3D field theory. 3D field theory, there's no reason why you'd expect that to have anything to do with monopoles because the monopoles aren't, and actually they are, but that's a story I'll get to in a minute, right? But they don't naively have anything to do with the theory itself. But you end up getting them. The underlying reason for that has to do with supersymmetry. And string theory, as I'll point out, gives you an intuitive understanding. Point out gives you an intuitive understanding, gives you a really neat picture for why that happens. And that has to do with looking at this theory from different points of view within string theory. The moduli space that we're taking here is monopoles on which space? On R3. R3, not R1, 2. No. We will do that now. We will do that down here. But that space will arise kind of from a similar set of ideas that I just kind of summarized. But I'm going to go through and explain that. Sorry. And the original SEN conjecture was an n equals 4 thing, is that right? That's right. That's right. So n equals 4 is a special case of n equals 2. When you add a To when you add a certain matter representation to when you include more fields beyond the minimal multiplet. And so once you study that extended system, you can view n equals 4 as a special case. And then the Sen conjecture would be a special case of this more generalized conjecture that I'll talk about. Thanks. Okay. Yeah, this is good. Yeah, just ask me if you have questions because I've got everything kind of minimized so that I can see my screen. So, okay, so let's start with BPS states in 4D and equals to super Yang mill. So the quantum field theory we're talking about here is on four-dimensional Minkowski space, R1, 3. So let's talk about the classical theory first. So we've got a connection, we've got A connection, we've got a complex Higgs field, and we've got a pair of bile fermions. So these things are all adjoint-valued. So the complex Higgs field would be GC valued, for example. And then the fermions are sections of the Maierana spinner, or the Weyl spinner bundles, but we won't really need to do anything with that. anything with that. Those are the fields that we have. We'll do this with a simple compact gauge group G, and we've got some couplings in this theory, G naught, theta naught. Now, the potential energy contains the norm squared of the commutator of the complex Hicks field with its conjugate. And so classically, that means we're going to have a family of vacua parametrized by the eigenvalues of phi and some in say the fundamental. in some in say the fundamental representation or some or or adjoint representation so this theory in this theory there exists half bps finite energy solutions representing monopoles and dions so what does this mean remember i said that when we had supersymmetry we had these transformations that map the fields into each other so a half bps So, a half BPS configuration is one that is kept invariant under some of those transformations, half of them in this case. So, these are the equations that are left invariant. The first one we all recognize, but notice that the Higgs field here I'm calling capital X. And now I've got in the next equation a second Higgs field called capital Y, which is essentially satisfying some sort of. Essentially satisfying some sort of it's like harmonic in the background of the monopole, and then that second Higgs field determines the electric field. So, this these two real Higgs fields, Y and X, are related to the complex Higgs field in the theory through a phase. I could give you an explicit expression for that phase, but we won't need it. Just know that it depends on the magnetic charge of the monopole solution, the asymptotic values of these two Higgs fields. Values of these two Higgs fields and the electric charge, which we can read off from the asymptotics of the electric field. So that's classically the field configurations, which are finite energy, which when we study the quantum field theory, we want to understand as these soliton states. So semi-classically, and in the Manton or adiabatic regime, where we Our adiabatic regime where we treat the collective coordinate velocities as small. What we want to do is we want to make that field transfer or that change of variables on phase space that we talked about, and then integrate out the field theory fluctuations, you know, perturbatively by saddle point approximation to reduce the quantum field theory to a quantum mechanical theory of the collective coordinates. And so this. Coordinates. And so this action here is the action for the collective coordinates, and it comes from this Hamiltonian that I've written here. So in this theory, in addition to the sort of kinetic energy from moduli space motion, so G is the metric on monopole moduli space from this equation here, there is a potential energy. This potential energy is given by the norm squared of a triholomorphic. Of a tri-holomorphic killing field on the monopole moduli space. So upright G here is a map from a Cartan subalgebra of our gauge group algebra into triholomorphic killing vectors. And where that map comes from is the action of asymptotically non-trivial gauge transformations on the solution. So we're considering just the maximal symmetry breaking case here. Just the maximal symmetry breaking case here. So you can think of this potential energy as the effect of this secondary Higgs field on the collective coordinate dynamics in the Manton regime. And then there's also fermions because the fermions have zero frequency excitations around the monopole. So this whole Hamiltonian is in fact a supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Supersymmetric quantum mechanics. And in a supersymmetric quantum mechanics, the BPS states are then states that are annihilated by a supercharge, which squares to the Hamiltonian. Now, the fermions. Where does the gamma E come from? I'm sorry. I'm going to explain that. So, classically, it's just the electric charge that you can read off from the solution. But what happens when you quantum? But what happens when you quantize this or when you do the quantum theory here is that gamma E becomes an operator on in the quantum mechanics. And then when I write gamma E here, it's the eigenvalue of that operator. But I'm going to explain that just now. So we have a supercharge which gets represented by a Dirac type operator in this quantum mechanics. In this quantum mechanics, this is because when we quantize the supersymmetric quantum mechanics, we represent states, we represent the fermions through Clifford algebra, and states are represented then as sections of a Dirac spinner bundle over the monopole modulized space. And BPS states lie in the kernel of a certain Dirac operator on monopole modulized space. On monopole moduli space. So let me explain everything in this formula. So here, M0, sorry about the notational clash with the talks earlier today. M0 is the strongly centered moduli space, which was previously being called x in the earlier talks. It depends on the magnetic charge, and I'm using a curly x now in place of where I had x infinity before. This d slash y operator on m0 is a twist. M naught is a twist of the ordinary Dirac operator. The twist is given by Clifford contraction with the one form, which is the metric dual to that triholomorphic killing field we had before. This curly X and this curly Y, at leading order in the sort of perturbative expansion in G naught, they are the asymptotic values of the two Higgs fields, but those The two Higgs fields, but those relationships can get quantum corrected. So, gamma E up here refers to the electric charge subspace. So, we have an electric charge operator, which I'm not writing out for you in this quantum mechanics. And the way that it acts on these wave functions is through a Lie derivative. So that operator commutes with this. Operator commutes with this Dirac operator. So I can simultaneously diagonalize them. And therefore, the kernel I can grade by the different eigenvalues of the electric charge operator. And so here I'm restricting the kernel to a given electric charge eigenspace. And that subspace of the kernel is semi-classically identified with the space of BPS states with a given magnetic charge. States with a given magnetic charge and a given electric charge. Now, I want to note that this kernel can only be non-trivial in the class of theories I'm considering if we're talking about gauge groups with rank bigger than one. So the reason is that you, as many of you know, probably the SU2 moduli spaces, the centered ones, they don't have triholomorphic killing vectors. The only triholomorphic killing vector is the one. Killing vector is the one that generates the overall circle for SU2. And so when we restrict this g of y to the centered moduli space, we would get something trivial. In the SU2 case, then we would just have an ordinary Dirac operator and by some Lichnerowitz-Witzenbach argument, that won't have L2 zero amounts. But once we have this, once we are in with gauge groups with rank bigger than one, Gauge groups with rank bigger than one, then we do get triallomorphic isometries on the centered moduli space, and we can twist by them and we will get, we can get a non-trivial kernel here. So the punchline of this is that semi-classical analysis yields a family of Dirac operators on monopole moduli space. This family of Dirac operators is parametrized by two elements of the Cartan subalgebra. The Cartan subalgebra. So that's looking at this theory semi-classically around the soliton. We can also look at this theory from the Wilsonian low energy effective point of view. So in order to do that, we want to identify what are our light modes, what are our heavy modes, and we want to integrate out the heavy ones. So for a given vacuum that we're in, I forgot. Vacuum that we're in, I forgot to mention back here when we talked about the classical vacuum. These actually continue to be vacua in the quantum theory. All we need to do is put expectation values around these eigenvalues, and those define the family of vacua, which is the Coulomb branch and sometimes called B in the quantum theory. So for a given So, for a given point on the Coulomb branch, we're going to have a decomposition, a generic point anyway, we're going to have a decomposition of our Lie algebra into Cartan and roots, and we can decompose our fields with respect to that. These guys along the root directions have masses. These guys are the massless U1 gauge fields and scalars. So, we can So, we can integrate out those massive modes to define an effective action, like we were talking about before. And then, what remains, what are the degrees of freedom in this effective action? It's all of the components of the fields along the Cartan directions. Now, on general grounds, this effective action is going to have an expansion in both these parameters. And if I just talk about the expansion in mu naught, then there's a two derivative. Then there's a two-derivative action plus higher derivative terms. Sorry, Andy. Mathematically, when you say integrate out here, you mean not integrate over. I mean integrate over. Integrate over these guys. And these are exactly the guys which don't appear in the measure on the right-hand side of the integral. Correct, because I've done the integral. So I'm writing this measure as an integral over these guys. A as an integral over these guys and an integral over these guys. Exactly. So, so mathematically, what we are saying is that we don't integrate over them, but instead we plug in that modified effective action. But you've already integrated over them. So the result. Implicitly, right? We didn't perform this mathematical operation. Yes. So we never integrated over them. But you see the effects of having that. That's right. So when physicists say integrate over. So, when physicists say integrate over, what they mean is do not integrate over these modes. Well, I don't know. That's not really true because you can see the effects. I mean, there are ways to expand out where you can see the effects of the higher energy terms coming in, but you're sort of obscuring them. For example, like if we do the one-loop computation, you explicitly see the result of those terms in here. That's right. You can do it perturbatively. My only comment is about the process. The process, yeah. The algorithm of actions. And in this algorithm, you do. Of actions and in this algorithm, you do not integrate over the modes when you say integrated. I would actually to find that first one-loop correction and then try to come to you. I think you're jumping ahead a little bit because where I'm going to go is, yes, we're going to write down the form of this thing based on something else. But it is supposed to arise from actually doing that. So that's exactly where I was going to go next, though. So the SUSY supersymmetry actually fixes the form of this at the two-derivative level in terms of a single function, which is called the pre-potential. So this prepotential is a function of these scalar fields, AI, up here, and also this constant lambda, which encodes all of the renormalization. Renormalization can the couplings that we had in the renormalization scale in a specific way. I'll talk more about that in a second. So, perturbative computations, which is what we were just talking about, that will tell you what this is. Discrete symmetries and supersymmetry dictate that this prepotential has the following form. There's a classical piece, a one-lip piece, which you can compute by doing that integral, and a bunch of instantones. And a bunch of instanton corrections. And you can actually also compute the first few of those by hand. The fields AI take asymptotic values AI of u, depending on the vacuum u. And lambda here is the strong coupling scale. So when you consider the u's, right, you have this family of vacua. If you want to look A vacuum. If you want to look in that family at u values, which are comparable to lambda, the reason it's called the strong coupling scale is that that running coupling I mentioned before blows up at lambda. And that means that the perturbative reasoning we use to identify what were the like degrees of freedom isn't necessarily valid anymore. And so then what ends up happening is you need a different description. But I won't go into the details of that. That so we just based on symmetries, we know a lot about this two-derivative low-energy effective action, but we don't know this pre-potential. That's what Cyberg and Witten deduced by using an amazing combination of supersymmetry, consistency, and known limits in conjunction with the action of a certain SL2RZ electromagnetic duality symmetry. So, R, here's the rank of the gauge group. Here's the rank of the gauge group. So the solution is in terms of an elliptic curve, capital Sigma U of lambda and a differential lambda. A and a new thing called A dual are the period integrals of that curve, and then the way the pre-potential is defined is through this relationship between A and A dual. Later, Nekrasov obtained F directly from a Euclidean path integral computation. Euclidean path integral computation through localization. All right, we want to get to those BPS states. What are they in this low energy effective picture? So we want to talk about a BPS state of electromagnetic charge gamma m and gamma e. Well, if it's in the spectrum, we know its exact mass. Its mass is given by the absolute value of this central charge function here. But interestingly, these BPS. These BPS states can decay. They can leave the spectrum of one-particle states as we move along the space of vacua, as we move along the Coulomb branch. So there are these real co-dimension one walls in the Coulomb branch where if you cross it, the BPS state leaves the spectrum. And the question then is, which states leave the spectrum and which or enter the spectrum when we Or enter the spectrum when we cross one of these walls. So that's the subject of wall crossing formulas. And after a lot of work by many people, the full complete answer was eventually found to be the Kensevich Soyblin wall crossing formula, originally obtained in a different context. So, what I want to do now is compare these two descriptions of BPS states on an over BPS states on an overlapping regime where both descriptions should be valid. By doing that, we get a relationship for the two cartan-valued guys that defined our Dirac operators in terms of this data on the Coulomb branch, this data in the Cyber-Witten solution. And this is the relationship: x is the imaginary part of zeta inverse a, y is the imaginary part of zeta inverse a dual. Zeta is the phase of the central charge function. Phase of the central charge function. So, what this means then is that we can take the walls on the Coulomb branch and pull them back to XY space using this map. And since BPS states are identified with the L2 kernel of that twisted Dirac operator, it must be that that kernel jumps when we cross these walls. So that's where it must be that it fails to be frightened. This is what the physics. This is what the physics is saying. So, in work with Greg Moore and Daniel Brennan a couple years ago, we verified this by in a special case where the wall crossing formula reduces to its simplest case called the primitive wall crossing formula. And when I say we verified this, what we did is we constructed a model Dirac operator on monopole moduli space. On monopole moduli space using the asymptotic metric, the Gibbons-Manton asymptotic metric. And then we showed that assuming some sort of smooth extension into the interior, we were able to obtain that the kernel of that model Dirac operator jumps in precisely where it should. We certainly didn't prove that our model Dirac operator was a Fred Home definition. Dirac operator was a Fredholm deformation of the exact one. But at least when the charge is primitive, the physics is indicating that it should be. When the charge is non-primitive and the wall crossing is much more intricate, then it must be that the intricacies of that jump in the kernel of the Dirac operator are related to the intricacies of monopole moduli space that Assum taught it. Monopole moduli space asymptotics that were discussed this morning. At least that's kind of the intuition. So there's like a really neat problem to explore there that connects to that model, the moduli space asymptotics. Sorry, Andy, this is for moduli spaces, but for higher rank gauge groups. That's correct. Yeah, yeah. We've got quite a lot more work to do there. Well, yeah. So there are a couple ways to bring the SU2. Ways to bring the SU2 gauge group back into the game. One is by adding matter. So then things can get interesting, and that's how we eventually connect to the send conjecture. And the other thing you can do is there's a whole version of this story with singular monopoles, which I didn't talk about at all. And then you can have interesting things for SU2, but now you're dealing with singular monopoles. So if you extend this program to couple Program to couple to matter, then there's another physics result, which is the fact that BPS states only occur in certain, they don't occur in what are called exotic representations of an internal symmetry, which I haven't talked about. So I don't think I'll go into the details of that, but that suitably generalized is what gives the Sen conjecture in this language. In this language. And so that was discussed by Daniel Brennan and Craig Moore. So I think, in the light of time, I guess I've got about four more minutes. I want to talk about these other two things quickly. I don't, these will be a lot shorter. So I want to talk about the class of, oh, so this is a generalization of what I, okay, you know, how, what's the class of, what's the How what's the class of what's the space of 4dn equals two theories out there? Well, the ones for which the cyber-Witten curve is known is vast, and it includes theories like the ones we just discussed, but including matter representations. It includes more general quiver gauge theories, even coupled to strongly interacting SCFTs. And almost all the examples we know of are of what are called class S, meaning they descend, right? So now we're thinking of this quantum field theory as a low energy. As a low-energy description of string theory. Almost all these examples we know about descend from M5 brains wrapping a Riemann surface. And so this goes back to Witten's picture and 9D6 and extensions of it. And so here we've got a two-way picture with NS5 brains, ND4 brains. Don't worry about the details at all. All. When we describe this picture in M-theory language, it ends up looking like an M5 brain wrapping a cylinder with additional M5 brains coming in and joining onto it at these points here. So just wanted to give you that general picture because it's going to show up in just another minute. So for that second example, we've got three. For that second example, we've got 3dn equals 4 Yang-Mills-Higgs. We're going to think about it just as a quantum field theory in its own right for the moment. So now we've got a similar set of fields, except we've got a triplet of Higgs fields, and now we're in three dimensions. So this is a gauge field on R1, 2. We can also talk about hypermultiplets and Higgs branches. Let me not do that. Let me just focus on the vector multiplet. Like in the 40 theory, we have a In the 40 theory, we have a Coulomb branch of vacua. Classically, that space looks like this. So, if we're doing SUK, then what's going on is we've got K mutually commuting Higgs fields, and so that's going to give us a factor of R3 to the K. But we've also got a three-dimensional gauge field, a bunch of abelian ones, along the cartan. And in three dimensions, you can dualize those to periodic scalars. Those to periodic scalars. And so that's what gives rise to this factor of S1 to the K as well. And I should really subtract out the diagonals here before I mod out by while. But that's classically what's going on. What happens when we go to the low energy effective theory and when we, in principle, integrate out the massive fields? Well, we're going to get some low energy effective theory for this set of scalar fields, these triples of x. Fields, these triples of x and these thetas. Now, based just on supersymmetry, 3D n equals 4 supersymmetry, a 3D sigma model from Minkowski three-dimensional space into some target M, based on supersymmetry, we know that that target must be hyperkalar. So now we can ask, okay, what is integrating out the massive fields do to the hyperkalar metric on that target? On that target. So at one loop, it corrects it from the flat metric here to the Gibbons-Manton metric on monopole moduli space. And when we, the claim is, and some explicit computations have been done, when we include instanton corrections from integrating out those massive fields, they complete that Gibbons-Manton metric to give us the smooth monitor. Smooth monopole moduli space metric. And actually, since we're in 3D, the instantons that we're summing over when we do this are themselves monopoles. But why did this happen? Why did we get monopole moduli space for the space of the vacuo this theory? Well, a string theory brain setup actually makes that obvious. And so this is detailed in Uh, detailed in Hanani and Win. So here the D3 brains are the place where that 3D n equals 4 theory lives. And so if we look at the string theory picture from the perspective of the D3 brains, then we get the story on the last slide. However, the end of a D3 brain in an NS5 brain is a magnetic monopole from the point of view of the brain. From the point of view of the NS5 brain theory. And so, when we look at this string theory setup in terms of the fields on the NS5 brain, and we look at their low energy collective coordinate dynamics, we get monopole moduli space. So that explains that connection. And you could go in lots of directions with this. And since I'm pretty much out of time, I will rush through. I will rush through this last example, which is kind of connecting these two previous examples by putting the four-dimensional theory on a three-dimensional Minkowski space across a circle. But we're keeping all the degrees of freedom, and then we want to do the integration out again, see what the low-energy effective action says. So now we've got our scalars AI from the CyberGwitt install. From the Cyber Gwitten story. Now we've got, because we're on R1, 2 cross S1, we get two new degrees of freedom. We get the periodic scalars from the last story by dualizing the photons, but now we also have the holonomy of these photons around this circle, which gives a second periodic scale or second set of periodic scalars. So the space of vacuum in this theory is Of vacuum in this theory is an elliptic vibration over the Coulomb branch. And the low energy effective action is still an n equals 4 theory. So the target space must be hyperkalar. And so we're looking at some sort of hyperkalar manifold with which is an elliptic vibration over the Coulomb branch. We get a natural semi-flat metric just directly by changing variables from the Cyber-Witten description. From the Cyberg-Witten description. So, this is what's called the semi-flat metric when we do this, but it has singularities. So, the question is: are there new contributions to the Euclidean path integral because we're on this space now that we didn't include and we need to include to smooth out those singularities? And the answer is yes. All of those BPS states that we had in the 4D theory, now you can take them and view them as instantons. View them as instantons by simply taking those field configurations and translating them around the circle. So now you got all these new instantons. And if you know the spectrum of BPS states in the first case, then in principle, you know how these instantons contribute. And so you could write down a formula for the instant uncorrected metric. Actually, demanding that that resulting metric was indeed. That resulting metric was indeed smooth is how Gaudo Mora and Naitzke inferred the Kensevich-Sloiblin wall crossing formula for the BPS spectrum originally. But now that machinery is being used to extract explicit corrections to the semi-flat metric. So do these ALG spaces have other descriptions? As you know, they most certainly do. They have other descriptions as moduli spaces of solutions. Moduli spaces of solutions to Hitchin's equation. And it's a big program right now to recover the metric asymptotics predicted from the Hitchin perspective. There's also a 2A perspective, and that involves t-dualizing that Hanani Witten setup, and that's where periodic monopoles come in. And I think I'm about out of time, so. Out of time, so I'll just go to the final slide. So, what happens if we compactify another circle? What does string theory have to say? I'm not sure, but I think Sergei knows this is a diagram of string dualities from his paper. I didn't say anything about singular monopoles. They're really interesting. Higher D monopoles, I didn't say anything, but there's lots of realizations in string theory and in holography, in fact. And then string theory compactifications on special holonomy manifolds also connect to a lot of these topics. Also, connect to a lot of these topics, and I think Laura will probably say something along those lines. So, in conclusion, the monopole is alive and well, it's facilitated a new era of connectedness between math and physics. And I will stop my share for a second so I can show you the promised video. And let me share my desktop. There we go. So these are motions of smooth monopoles in the presence of singular monopoles. And so this one here is the monopole bubbling, I promised. So this blob here is the smooth monopole, and these are tiny. And these are time evolutions. We're actually solving the equations of motion. We're not doing geodesics, though, because we're in that theory with the potential energy that I mentioned. But the moduli spaces themselves on which we have that are multi-centered top-nut, and that goes back to work of Capustin and Cherkis. Okay, I'm done. Thank you so much. Questions, the speaker? I have a question. And I offer this question mostly because you're doing the survey talk, and so I make sure we survey things correctly. And in part, maybe we push aside things that should not be surveyed or perhaps needs to be surveyed. There's a certain amount of literature in condensed matter about spin and ice monopoles. Do we care? Do we care? Does this community care about this, or is this just a use of the word monopole in a different field? I haven't studied it myself, so I don't feel that I'm qualified to answer that question. I think it certainly deserves to be investigated. And I think it's an analogy by analogy. So I'm I'm sorry, and I don't have a better answer to that. I don't know if anyone else would like to chime in. I think these other uses of the name monopole are emergent phenomena. They are like quasi-particles. They just look like monopoles if you zoom out too much. That's the impression I got from reading a few things. Other questions? Angie, could you comment on these pictures? Anything we learn from seeing this volleyball with... Yeah, so the difference between the two on the left, so those are both motion of a single monopole and the presence of three singularities. The one on the bottom, though, is when the single monopole has electric charge, and the one on the top is when it doesn't. Top is when it doesn't. And so basically, what's going on on the top one is that the entire motion is actually staying in the XZ plane because I set up my initial condition so that it would. With the same initial conditions on the bottom one, the monopole goes all over the place because it's got an electric charge, and so it's feeling the Lorentz force of a moving charge in a magnetic field, which causes it to veer off. So that's kind of the So that's kind of the difference between having electric charge and not having electric charge. And then the other thing I'll say is that the first three are bound motion, and that is possible because of that potential in the energy. Yeah. Thank you. But going back to these monopoles that arrive in Mergent Florona, perhaps it's true that it would be interesting to. It's true that it would be interesting to see if there are some mathematical problems that in these areas of condensed matter physics could be somehow answered. Yeah, I absolutely agree. Using techniques that we know, I don't know. I think it could be interesting. I don't know about the spin ice case, but there are some other things with topological superconductors that perhaps could perhaps. Perhaps techniques that we know and things that we know about the monopole modular space could be helpful. I don't know. Oh, and I forgot to mention, I wanted to mention that all of these simulations are based on work done with a couple of undergraduate students here, Keaton Wright and Gannon Lenhart. All right, so Rulu. Can I ask, is this little time? Is this all time? Sure, one more question. Just so a naive picture some of us have about electric charges and things.
