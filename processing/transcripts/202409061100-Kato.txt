Thank you very much for the introduction. So, first of all, I would like to thank organizers to give me a chance to say something about this I'm studying for more than a decade. Anyway, so unfortunately, the talks are not so directly connected to either known of geometry or physics or contemporary algebra, but as we will see, some portion of We will see some portion of that had some similar flavor to all of these things. Maybe we can see something like this. So let me start with some very some classical situation. So let lambda be the space of symmetric functions with coefficients in rational numbers. And for this, we have a basis offered by Shur functions where P is a set of all partitions. Set of all partitions, and this special symmetric function has also other distinguished basis, like the complete symmetric function denoted by h and the monomial symmetric function denoted by f. So far, we have, because these are basis, we have a relation between them, and this is your function is somehow somehow related to the monomial symmetric function by some explicit coefficient, and because And because of the self-duality of shear function with respect to some inner product, and that also exhibits the orthogonality property between m and h, we have a duality between the expansion coefficient of s in terms of m and h in terms of s as follows. So far, this k of lambda mu was supposed to be the Kostoka number and somehow known to appear in many respects. Appear in many respects of representation theory. Most easy way and things is the tensor product of finite dimensional representations of GN and also much other things. And this is the Kostoka things which I would like to talk. And the actual object I want to consider is something called the Kostoka polynomial, the T-analog of the Kostoka numbers. In order to make sense of them, we introduce the scalar expansion or the Introduce the scalar expansion or the spatial symmetric function from the field of rational number to the field functions or by rational numbers. And here we have two other distinct species called whole-ritted functions that is denoted usually by p and q. And these two are related as false. There is some deformed inner product that That by t on lambda t that reduces to the previous inner product that makes a shear function into orthonormal sees by t equals zero and such that the inner product between the whole q function and p function are supposed to be orthogonal and this q and p just differ by some scalar for each individual. Scala for each individual partitions. And this particularly means that if we have if we expand S lambda in terms of p, then we have some conjugate things by some expanding qu by S lambda of dual, where S lambda dual is the dual of this pseudo function with respect to this deformed linear product that is unfortunately not the same as. Unfortunately, not the same as the original shear function by itself. But nevertheless, we have these expansions. And for this expansion, we call this k expansion coefficient k lambda mu to be the cost of the polynomials. And because if we specialize t equals one case, this whole ritual p function reduces the monomial functions, and it means that the cost of cost of component. Kostoko polynomial, Kostoko polynomial k lambda mu reduces to the previous Kostoka number by putting t equal to one. And also, because of the character formula exhibited by some shear functions, we have some sort of triangular relation of cost of polynomials. That means that cost of polynomials are indexed by two elements from partitions, but nevertheless, it is supposed to be. It is supposed to be zero if you have some if you lambda mu biologist some order that usually causes the dominance order and exhibits one if lambda equals mu. For t equal one, this one says that we are taking the monomial corresponding to the highest weight. And anyway, so this kind of some expansion coefficient and this osogonality condition coming from here basically From here, basically, characterize these Kostoko polynomials uniquely. And this is a setting we are going to generalize. So, in order to generalize, we need to introduce something else. So, let's see of X to be a polynomial ring of n variable, and here, symmetric group Sn acts on this. Symmetric group SN acts on this lingo's polynomial of n variables by permutation of indices. This leads to a smash product algebra A defined by this group algebra times the polynomial such that the grading of this A is said to be degree of W element from the symmetric group to be zero and degree of X1 I to be one for all I. So in So, in order to make some slight connection with geometry, let me note that somehow this G of X is an instance of the G L equivalent cohomology of flag variety of G L N. And in this space, we have enough Springer action that permits a variable in this situation. Anyway, so this is some abstraction from the situation coming from Springer correspondence, but never, and we are going. But never, and we are going to say something about that. So, for this algebra, we can consider some graded module and also irreducible graded module. And these irreducible graded modules are leveled by partition lambda of n because the representation of Sn is supposed to be leveled by partition of n, such by the general Peter Weiss theorem for finite group theory. Theorem for finite group theory. So it means that we have for each lambda, we have an ident E lambda in the group ring of SN such that L of lambda is realized by the projection of this group ring with respect to this one projector. And in this situation, we are looking only at the degree zero part of this algebra A, but we can Algebra A, but we can simply prolong into the somehow all the degrees because the graded Jakovsome radical of A is spanned by the positive degree part of X. So it means that the projective cover of L lambda viewed as a modulus by letting all of Xi acting by Zero is just given by taking projector to the full algebra A instead of the group algebra. Instead of the group algebra, C of S A. And this is the setting we are trying to consider. So in this situation, we can form two modules of N. So the first module is called K lambda with tilde that we define as a P lambda, that is clearly a module. A module and quotiented out by some modules generated by LO mu, and that is some grading shift of simple graded A module with the level smaller than lambda. And also, we can take its quotient, k of lambda, to be the largest sub module generated by L lambda of positive degree. And somehow here, we consider some submodule. We consider some sub-module means that it is the submodule as graded SN module and span by the action of the polynomial ring. And if we do this construction, we have the following theorem by the continued procession Tanisaki. And if we dualize this one, then it is usually something called the Gaussian processing module. And that means that k lambda of star is a unique graded quotient or the polynomial ring of Cx, but Of CX, but this time this one is identified with the projected cover of trivial module, trivial module of as graded A module, that is something like the P of N, such that L lambda occurs exactly once as Sn some modules. So here we have S lambda is or star is isomorphic to S lambda because S n Because Sn is a real reflection group, and all of its representation is defined over R. Anyway, so the reason we are interested in this Gaussian processing module is as follows. The first reason is that if we consider this K lambda or K lambda dual because of this, as just as a SN module, this is the induced module from Pluvian module with respect to the subgroup S lambda inside SN, where S lambda where S lambda is supposed to be the product of symmetric of lambda i letters inside Sn. And also this dual thing, the Gaussian processing module itself is realized as a cohomology of something called the springer fiber with this coefficient C. And yet another reason we are interested in this thing is that this K lambda star is also a specialization or Is also a specialization or quotient of something called the Gaussian-Hyman module that appears in the McDonald polynomial business. Anyway, we have these Gaussian processing modules. And that is unique. So in order to m uh so here we can mix the orthogonality property of cost of polynomials and the uh the module theoretic property of Gaussia processing module as follows. Of Gaussia processing module as follows. For graded A module, graded means the D graded, so we can decompose M as a graded vector space for which the action of Xi raised the gradient of y1. And then we put the graded character of M as this sum, where we count the occurrence of L lambda in degree M as S n modules and put the grading Tm. Of grading Tm, good record of grading by Tm, and makes the formal sum like here. This naturally sits in the space like this. And if we do this, we get the following theorem that is an interpretation of the Kostoka polynomial in the language of homological algebra. And but unfortunately, in this type A case, this is is essentially known to the Hyman's work of McNeill polynomials in Of McDonald Polynomials in early 2000. Anyway, so what happens is that if we take the graded character of k of lambda, then the coefficient just lacks the cost of colynomial. And we have an extension banishing between these two. One is coming from K of lambda tilde and the other is a dual of K of mu. And if we take this extension group as A module, then we have this vanishing. Then we have this vanishing. And actually, this latter extension vanishing is an incarnation of this orthogonality property of Holorettal polynomial P lambda and Q lambda. And P lambda roughly corresponds to greatest character of K lambda Tuda. And Q mu roughly corresponds to greatest character of K mu. This transference from X to H. Transference from extra to here is just taking the graded Euler characteristic. And note that here the ratio between p rambda and the q rambda is something like something like one minus t, one over one minus t or something or something like that. It means that if we consider it as an element here, it is just really a series in general. Anyway, this is Anyway, this is our interpretation of the orthogonality property of whole ritual polynomial that records the Kostoka polynomial of type A. So we say that the Kostoka polynomial for G L1N, that is some kind, that is a complex reflection group. So we need to say what is the Kostoco polynomial for general case in our setting. In our setting. Unfortunately, there are several Kostoka polynomials for general cases, and the literature just splits up. And one interpretation of Kostoka polynomial is coming from a formula of characters or finite group of lead types. And it means that each pair of reductive group and its some special lead subgroup use some cost of polynomials and corresponding to some while group. Into some while group. The second thing is to use the formula using root data, particularly something called the constant partition. And we can extend formally to all root systems. And resulting cost component is slightly different from the context one and context two. Here, the first one naturally uses the representation of Y group or reflection group, while the second group, yeah, While the second group, second construction, naturally representation of the group G instead of the Y groups. So today we will consider only the things related to the first one, the things corresponding to reflection groups. And let me remark that we have some notion of some Reese McNaught polynomial or some generalization of McNaughton polynomial for complex reflection group when this funk this kind of things use Kostoka polynomials in our setup. Costoko polynomials in our setup. If you could, in this G over L G, area, I need to say something. So here at some point we will put L to be L one N. And this is supposed to be something like the S of N of this one. And I'm saying this part. Saying this part. So, or this one. Anyway, so, and actually, complex reflection group of we can also replace this one with V2 with more general gamma, but we do not talk this case today. And in this case, somehow, in any case, in this case, the corresponding Rieszmakner polynomial uses a basis of tensor product of L-Fox spaces. Tensor product of L-fox spaces equipped with an action of quantum torrential GNL. This is some vague connection between what I am talking about and the topic of this conference. So far, we need some definition of Kostoka polynomials or general case. Anyway, for general real finite real reflection group, the corresponding Kostoka polynomials arises in Costa Copolynomials arise in family. Family means that there is a parameter, and if we fix a parameter, we have some corresponding family of cost of polynomials indexed by irreducible representation of W and so on. But anyway, once we fix some data, the cost of polynomials are characterized by following things. The K is supposed to be recorded cost of polynomials. That is a square matrix of size equal to the size of the size of the s Square matrix of size equal to the number of irreducible representation of w and lambda, this is also the same size square matrices that is blockwise diagonal matrices. So this blockwise means that unfortunately for general cost polynomials, we allow so sorry, so in this type A cost of polynomial, cost of polynomials obeys some triangularity property. Obeys some triangularity property with respect to some order, but this order can include some equivalence relation in general. So in this case, we do not have diagonal matrices, but instead, we have some blockwise diagonal matrices. Anyway, this one. So we need some one more ingredient called omega. This is somehow the same size matrices, usually called some fake degree given by explicit. Given by explicit formula. This fake degree leads an instance that somehow these cost of polynomials are coming from some module of module, something called the principal module of finite groups of lead types. And so it comes in the family, varying characteristic, and so on. And this characteristic is recorded by the variable T or Q or whatsoever. Anyway, Server. Anyway, if we set up these three, assume that K is an upper triangle matrices with diagonal entry one, that is the property described in type A in terms of the dominance order. And then we have the following equality on K and lambda, means that K and lambda simultaneously are null, but this is usually near to diagonal, and this is supposed to be near to triangular. Supposed to be near to triangular, and this is supposed to be the omega to triangular to omega. And actually, this has a unique solution that is a consequence of gas decomposition, and entries of k are called the Kostoka polynomial attached to W. So we can see that this tree we have a choice on how to arrange entries with respect to the irreducible representation of W. So actually, there are So, actually, there are many different ordering on irreducible representation of W that use essentially different but still meaningful cost components in W in representation theory. But unfortunately, for W equals Sn, we usually have only two orders: the dominance order and its transpose, and so on. So, this is the osmogrelation across the components. And let me pause. And let me pose, so let me generalize the complex reflection groups. So we should replace W with a finite complex reflection group because this W is no longer a Y group or linear reflection group if L is greater than or equal to 3. But in that case, we need to tweak a little bit more because of the following. So if we have a representation of complexity reflection group, then and consider Lambda. Then, and consider L lambda, that is the realization of this representation, then L lambda, L chi, and L chi dual are not isomorphic in general. So, in particular, we have a notion of complex conjugate or the dual taking dual, and that is basically the same because we are thinking trace of some elements of finite order. So, taking conjugate, taking. Taking conjugate and taking inverse is basically the same. Anyway, so it induces a bijection which is not identity and entity on the set of irreducible representation of W. And unfortunately, we use two matrices recording the cost of polynomials. That is something like the K plus minus or K chi and chi chi. And lambda is basically the same. We can just think of it as a broad diagonal matrices. Eat as a diagonal matrices, and we also have a recipe I didn't explain, but nevertheless, it's not so much important at the moment. So, we have explicit matrices given by some formula of X degree with respect to complex variable. And now we assume the same thing, the K is upper tringular matrices with diagonal entry one, regardless plus or minus. Sorry, this is the typo. And then we have the following equality: K plus, minus, and lambda. k plus minus and lambda that has a unique solution. And here the change is that k minus is the same, k plus is basically the same, but the entries are somehow conjugated. So it corresponds to the taking dual of representation. And then the same Gauss decomposition technique says that it has a unique solution. These entries are supported called cost of polynomials of W. This is a very artificial Of w. This is a very artificial definition, but actually, there were several work on this. Let me explain something. And so, as I noted in the abstract, I will say something about the formulas conjectured by Shoji, but let me say a little bit of background about that. So, there is a philosophy that says. There is a philosophy that says there should be a framework in which some family of nice order and irreducible representation w arising from that use some constant polynomial such that its entries are supposed to be a polynomial with no negative coefficient. And this is a property shared by many authentic Kostok polynomials for real reflection group. And the reason of this positivity in this real reflection group is that a big This VR reflection group is that basically this Costco polynomial is encoded by some intersectional cohomology complex, and its stock is pure. So this automatically means something like this. And anyway, in this framework, the matrix lambda is something, yeah, so in the setting of authentic cost components for real reflection groups, the matrix lambda encodes the number of. Lambda encodes the number of rational points on near-potential orbits, and k determines the characters of finite groups of lead types in the sense that it defines some particular part of the character table of the corresponding finite groups of read types. And from that, we have a procedure to construct general characters of that group and so on. This generalization from real and the previous generalization from real reflection. previous generalization from real reflection group to complex reflection group was a response of Shawji to the project of such something called the spaces proposed by Bro, Marl and Michel that exactly asks whether there is a hypothetical object corresponding to complex reflection group that acts as if it is somehow finite groups or Li-types or not. Anyway, so as there are no So, as there are no way to approach this kind of problem further, somehow Shouji have singled out one special case, something called the case of limit symbol, for the case W to be the least product of SN to G over L Z. This is basically the same. and asks whether k plus minus satisfies the positivity as in this here and whether k minus in this case this has a presentation by a generalization of gaussi processing module as a uniquely characterized quotient of cx and this gauchi as explained before this gaussian processing module is basically defined intrinsically in terms of its properties so it is unique um actually Actually, this uniqueness also holds even if for l equals 2 or something like that, and this actually uses a cost of a polynomial that is different from the context offered by different things. And so, yes, actually, we have something called the A function, and we are supposed to put the order that is compatible with the A function, some kind of dimension, something. Some kind of dimension, something like that. And so, anyway, limit symbol defines functions, and we are supposed to choose an ordering coming from this number with respect to the number, and then we get a k minus, and it is supposed to let go of the character of a particular module defined by characterization. So far, this is something called the Shozi's conjectures, and the situation is. Lectures, and the situation is as follows. Actually, there is a combination of work by Finke Bergoyon from Chiang Fu and Shorgis himself, says that Shorgis conjecture about the positivity of K minus, meaning that the enteries of K minus is a polynomial with non-negative integer coefficient. But unfortunately, the method does not use some module theoretic property. Module theoretic property described before and the positivity of the opposite one, K plus. As I explained earlier, because this kind of the monologue property conjectured by Choji for K minus is a unique thing. And so this one is a reasonably canonical object attached to this complex reflection group W. So far, I put the title about the Costa Colynomia, so G L. So, G L 1 N in this talk. Anyway, so the problem here today I want to consider is that Kanban realized this K plus minus as an indecompatible module of A, where we need to extend a little bit about the definition of A from the symmetric group case, where we were here Sn some time ago, and CX is unchanged from the before. x is unchanged from the before, but never here s n acts by x1 to xn the same as before, but here we have extraction of g over z powered by l. And that acts on some xi that agrees with the index coming from here by some else root of unity. And this gives a natural generalization of algebra A discussed before, and we write for the same data for. We write for the same letter for bravity. So far, we would like to consider some candidate of this k plus minus and try to set up into the world of A. So before doing some characterization, we need to lift the problem a little bit kinda in a categorical way because we are supposed to characterize a module. Supposed to characterize a module in some way. So, as in the same as in the case of SN, we can construct a module K tilde of plus minus and K of plus minus with respect to this ordering. And this is a typo here. We put the bar for minus case, that's also plus case, and originally put here for the same thing in order to have. The same thing in order to have different thing for plus minus. But nevertheless, we have two choices of this because the complex conjugate is a different order on the set of irreducible representation of W. So far, we have four different things, modulus of A, but anyway, so we can control it simultaneously, so we can reduce it to only two. Two, uh, only the pair, only the relation between two. And just what I have proved more than 10 years is that if we have this x to vanishing between this k minus guy and k plus guy, the right, then the cost of polynomials arising from this setting is just given by the following formula: counting the graded character uses the cost of polynomials. Use the Costa Colynomias. So note that if so, these two are just an explicit module constructed by quotient hit out by some explicit defining relations and so on. So it means that each of these numbers must non-negative and consequently if we can prove this also von IT properties, then the corresponding k plus minus or k chi prime and chi k chi prime and chi this belong to the this somehow polynomial with non-negative coefficient. And let me remark that this framework contains something called the all of generalized finger correspondence and it uses a module in the in this setting. And additionally they are connected to each other for wide group of type V and I think this is a little bit more interesting feature but we cannot Interesting feature, but we cannot say something about this because today I will explain only one family of post-polynomial polynomial for complex reflection group W. So anyway, this is a categorical version of the orthogonality relation that characterizes Kostaka polynomial for complexity reflection groups. But nevertheless, we need to show that we have some module that has the same properties like this. That has the same properties like this. In order to construct something, we will introduce some Li algebra called P. So far, we put gamma to be z over L Z, that is this particular part of complex reflection group. And consider the chi, yeah, sorry, this is different from the previous chi, and this chi is a degree one character of gamma, one dimensional character. Character of gamma, one dimensional character known to be a character of gamma. And then we set large v to be the somehow the collection of direct sum of modules for which the multiplicity of each chi i, that is a set of all, sorry, this is L. So this is L. So anyway, so this is a complete correction of representation of gamma, and we have multiplied by Have multiplied by Cn. Then we have an action of gamma on GLB because GLB is just B tensor B star and gamma acts on here, so it acts on here. And also, we can have an action of gamma on the inflation of this GLV, large general linear algebra, with the polynomial ring, such that gamma. such that gamma acts on G by the degree one characters. Then we set P to be the fixed part of this finite group action. If we do this kind of construction, this P itself is not isomorphic to some nice sub-algebra of Gerbi hat, but actually P is isomorphic to a paraphoric subalgebra that A parapolic sub-algebra, the affine G algebra of GRB, but it's grading twisted by the appearance of this non-trivial group action. But it is a little bit technical, so we will simply regard P as a so sorry. So maybe I Oh, maybe I can I have a sorry sorry. Anyway, so this is rather technical. So we simply regard P as particular parapholic sub-algebra for simplicity. And this is our algebra P that is supposed to be paraholic sub-algebra of affine E algebra. And then And then we consider something from non-symmetric McNarrow polynomials. So our general linear group is GLM of L. So it's integral weighted parameterized by M L copy of Z. For each choice of lambda, we have something called the non-symmetric McDonald polynomial, somehow denoted by EO lambda of Qt. Lambda v Qt. And also let I to be the Eurofoule sub-algebra. That is the particular case of one para subalgebra of the affine gi algebra V. And so what we have shown some time ago is that there are these two modules called E of lambda 0 and E of lambda infinity, such that they are orthogonal with respect to some category. Some category which I do not explain so much because it's not so much important in this situation. Somehow, this character is coming from that of non-symmetric McDonald's polynomials like here. Actually, the existence of module E roman zero is suggested by Cherednik more than 20 years ago, and at that time, something I think Yasimin Sandasan has shown that some particular demographic. Some particular demographic module arising from the level one integrable highest weight module of this one affords characters of McNaughton polynomials specialized to t equals zero. But this infinity one was a little bit more recent. Anyway, so here we have some slight deviation from the first time and second term, and we need to explain something. Something. So we have an orthogonality relation of non-symmetric McNarrow polynomials like this. And if we try to put t equals zero, then what happens is that because the chalidenic inner product takes a constant term with respect to f and g bar or something like that, it means that if we try to take some specialization to t equals zero, what naturally appears is that t equals t. appear since the t equal to 0 1 and t equal to infinity 1 are orthogonal to each other, not the 0 and 0. This is slightly different for the case of symmetric McNale polynomial, but it is so. Anyway, this shows that we have some orthogonal family that is different to each other, and both of them are not simple. And here, recently, somehow Fagin and Koroshkin and Makadensky say a little bit more. And if lambda and mu are sorry, the concatenation of L partitions of length n from the tail, that means lambda 1, lambda 2. So usually, if we try to consider partition as a weight, we arrange it from the first, lambda 1, lambda 2, lambda 3, and it is supposed to be. Lambda 2, Lambda 3, and it is supposed to be decreasing, but we are supposed to put it the opposite way. So Lambda 1 is smaller than Lambda 2 and go to Lambda N. And L partition concatenation means that, so this is for the first partition, and the second partition is arranged by the same fashion, and third partition is supposed to be arranged in the same fashion, and so on. For such kind of special weights, E lambda of 0 can be regarded as a zero can be regarded as a p-module by naturally. But unfortunately, the corresponding thing for the opposite one is not so. So we put some extension of this one of modulus coming from E of infinity such that we also have some also on the relation between them. So this E lambda 0 is the same as the previous one and this one is a sub is this one is A sub is this one is supposed to be a sum of this one with several different indices and so on. And in this situation, E of lambda 0 has a cyclic vector of weight lambda and E of sharp of mu of infinity has cyclic weight coming from minus of U0 mu, where U0 is supposed to be the longest element of Sn of L, meaning that we take the longest element of Sn diagonally any time. So, this is a little bit technical, but the extension of the orthogonality relation to something more familiar since P. And one lemma that is actually almost by definition, if we know the correct definition, and every simple module of Erafoli sub-algebra is supposed to be one-dimensional, and E lambda zero, this one, always have a U.S. This one always has a unique simple quotient and also a unique simple submodule. So, this is the property we will use in the next. So, in order to say some adjust with representation with some complex reflection with G L 1 N, we need to recall a little bit about representation is the representation selling. So far, our setting is like this. Our setting is like this with L is, sorry, this is L is larger than or equal to 2. So recall that irreducible representation of n is in bijection with the partition of n, and this bijection may be realized by lambda to lambda of s n. And in this situation, this irreducible representation of w is in bijection with a set L n of L partition of N. That means that it is a L sequence of partition. It is a L sequence of partition lambda one, lambda two, and lambda L, such that somehow its size sums up to n. And if we have this kind of correction of partition, L partition, then the corresponding irreducible representation of W is just an induction from the sorry, so these are type A thing. I'm really sorry for the type O, but anyway, so it is given by that induction from some smaller thing. Induction from some smaller thing and each error of lambda i tensor chi of i minus one is irreducible module when considered as a symmetric group of size of lambda i letters and enhanced by the action of the this gamma times the size of lambda i by some diagonally acting by chi times i minus one, it means that each of the coordinates are means that each of the coordinates acts by this. Then we can consider irreducible representation of this Sn as an irreducible representation of the corresponding W with some small of size equal to the size of lambda i or something like that. And then we have the corresponding subgroup of W and so we can induce. If we do this, we get a irreducible modulus. Get irreducible modules. And in this parameterization, we have: if we dualize the module coming from this parameterization, it dual is naturally like this. Here, lambda 1, trivial part, is the same, but L lambda to L2 are supposed to be swapped. This is because chi1 is dual to chi l minus 1, and so on. Anyway, this is an instance of. Anyway, this is an instance of the complex conjugate we have explained before. So we have a parameterization of representation of the least product of Sn and G over L Z. And in order to proceed a little bit more, we need to remember something called the Burst-Bluegez duality. And recall that V, sorry, V is supposed to be a C of N, external tensor product. External tensor product of CO gamma, as this is a direct sum of irreducible representation for one for each time, because gamma is the aberrant group. And what happens is that if n is less than equal, let's see, m is supposed to be, okay. So if n is less than or equal to m, we have an isomorphism. equal to m we have an isomorphism of this b tens of n into the into b of lambda back to l of lambda back as a gl n all times of l times this product group we are interested in so somehow here so b of lambda back is supposed to be an irreducible gay l module and actually this condition says that for each partition For each partition that is smaller than n, automatically use an irreducible G L N module B of gamma. So for each L partition of N, we have an irreducible module of G L plus N module, and also just L of lambda back explained earlier. And anyway, we have the following, this generalization of show validity, and we would like to send us it to construct a module of. To construct a module of our algebra A. But unfortunately, the natural duality of Lie algebra P and the natural duality of complex reflection group does not agree. So, but nevertheless, P of lambda is regarded as a simple P module by the quotient taking like G equals zero. And also, we have a pair of E lambda zero and of E lambda 0 and E lambda shaft of infinity, that also know. And if you understand the L partition of N by this one, this is what I have explained before. Sorry, that the explanation is computing, but nevertheless, for each partition, L partition lambda, we can somehow order we can make up a weight in this way. In this way, and then what happens is that Jordan-Helder series of this former module, E lambda 0, belongs to this one. The things we are interested in. And fortunately, we have a Lie algebra automorphism, eta, that is coming from the composition of the opposition and some diagonal automorphism that exists for particular choice of P, such. Particular choice of P, such that this eta twist star of the naive dual use somehow the property that we expect from the duality of the real duality coming from the complexity reflection group. And then what happens is that the Jordan-Helder series of some modification of the E-sharp module actually belongs to the simple modules we are interested in. The simple modules we are interested in. After this rather cosmetic change of the grade ideology, we can say the following. So let's put the script V to some loofian of V, meaning the B tensor C of Z, and also takes it n times. Then what happens is that if N is smaller than M, the P module V The P module V constructed here is projective, actually, not projective in the full category of P module, in a suitable category C of P module. And that is enough to contain our module of interest, E lambda back of lambda, E lambda back of du, or something like that, for each L partition of N. And this, so if we So, if we form this suitable category C, we have an equivalence of categories sending C to A mod by taking just home, where A is something we have explained, the smart product of the complexity friction group W with the polynomial ring of n variables. And this equivalence sends the duality check to be the honest duality of m. Duality of A module. Sorry. Yes, honest duality of A modules. And the reason that we consider, so actually, this theorem can be considered for arbitrary subdivision of large number into L pieces for each piece supposed to be greater than n to have similar equivalence. But unfortunately, we do not know how to define check that. Know how to define check that is the duality here in a nice way outside of our choice of v. And also, let me say that the ERICO1 case is well known. And actually, in this current setting, we have a paper by Fergin, Koroski, Makedonsky, and Frika that use this kind of things. So, this is a generalization from El 1 case to L equals one case to L equal higher case in our situation. Sorry. So what happens is that, so because we have an equivalence of category, we can obtain a collection of module K plus that is coming from something we have called E infinity and K minus that is coming from E0 in the category of P modules that we call C. That we call C inside the AG mode, that is a graded M module or finitely generated graded M module that satisfies the XTOS property as we have discussed before. And actually, somehow this says that because of our characterization of Costa Colynomials, and this one particularly defines some version of Costa Coinnial. find some version of cost of polynomials attached to some particular order and somehow and in this one is particularly nice because the k minus that is coming from e zero uh has simple head unique simple quotient and simple simple so called the unique simple sub module and its grading degree is supposed to be somehow very strictly determined as to be meaningful Strictly determined as to be minimal things. So it is in a so it specifies a module like Gaussia processing module. So it says that somehow our k minus of chi leads the unique graded quotient of the polynomial ring that contains this particular module with multiplicity one as W module. And also this graded character of k plus minus gives rise to some Gives rise to some cost of polynomials of W. And this is what we can obtain immediately after we have established this equivalence. And what happens here is supposed to be to compare with the cultural polynomials attached to the limit symbol, as Shoji has described. So far, we have defined no symmetry McNormal polynomials. McNeill polynomials by using the affine use system, and the natural order defining this non-symmetric McNeill polynomials with respect to this is something called the pterodonic order. And this pterodonic order is not unfortunately not compatible with the natural order coming from limit symbols. So far, we need to compare it by exhibiting that somehow we do not have Have how to say we do not have a multiplicity of our module k plus minus of chi whenever chi and chi prime bioraise the particular total order that defines the order coming from the limit symbols. And if it if we could prove this lemma we can say that our k plus chi chi prime t Chi prime t are cost of polynomials with respect to the cherry order induced by cherry order, but it is a cost of polynomials also for the things coming from limit symbols and so on. So far, here, what I said is that there are at least two partial orders on the same set of irreducible representation W that result in the same cost of polynomials attached to the limit symbols. Attached to the limit symbols, and the one coming from the teletrinic order seems to control the situation somehow better. So, this is virtually the end of my talk, but let me try to say a little bit example of what happens for the very, very small case. So, in this, so for n equals three, but m equal n equal to one case. n equal to one case, we have a very small partition like this. So the three partition of one is just like this. And in this situation, we have some D is supposed to be the demoduling module, and this is just a sub-representation or three-dimensional vector representation of GL3. So far, we do not have a grading on this kind of thing instead of characters, but as I see, we have a gamma twist. C, we have a gamma twist on the total structure of P that introduces some extra grading q and q square on here. And with this grading shift, this one or its sub module becomes the correct cost of polynomials. And on the other hand, so we have the following things. So if we consider infinity instead of zero, we Instead of zero, we have the following pattern, which I do not explain so much. But nevertheless, if we compare this one and this one, we see that there is no way to match because the number of terms are different. So, this is the future appears in the general caustical polynomials for Erica so so for complexity reflection group, and our construction safely somehow exhibits some particular patterns of that. It's some particular patterns of that. Anyway, so maybe the last slide. So far, we have exhibited cost of polynomials attached to complex reflection group L G L 1 N and such that it exhibits the property that K minus is characterized as a universal object attached to these complex reflection groups. Complexity reflection groups. And I put it somehow, and comparing the argument coming from the Shoji's construction, says that the positivity of K minus needs some extra grading introduced by the paper of Inkev Iono. And he asked that whether there is the meaning of extra mean grading with respect to the representation theory of Y group and so on. And our answer is that. And our answer is that it is coming from the action of the center of GLN of L. And in particular, by our category equivalence, our K plus minus also acquires some extra grading. Also, it says that A, which is a smashed product algebra of complexity reflection group and a polynomial ring, and so it means that somehow polynomial ring seems to be just a unique grading because the action of gamma. Grading because the action of gamma is uniform with respect to xi. But if we see it more precisely, it also admits a grading such that it exhibits a nice multiple-graded algebra structure in very non-trivial way. So, this is basically the end of the story, and let me just say some advertisement and some additional. Advertisement and some additional personal reason I am interested in this conjecture you show you is that for the L equal to case, that is the case of Y group of type B C, there is something related to something called some exotic during Langlands correspondence, which I have proposed 15 years ago, meaning that it gives the characters of modules of upper head algebra, so type B C or all parameters. So it means that this kind of cost. So this kind of cost of polynomial, even for L equal to 2, is somehow eligible to exhibit representation theory or reductive group or finite group of D type by itself. So this is something, one reason I'm interested in this. And this is the end of my talk. Thank you very much.
