Thank you, and thank to all the organizers for this opportunity. And it's a pleasure to be here in this very nice virtual conference and to talk about some results about stationary states for aggregation diffusion models. This is a topic that has attracted some interest in the last years and will probably be addressed also further in the next. Also, further in the next days in the conference. So, let me open the discussion about this topic by introducing the dynamics that I'm considering, which I call it aggregation diffusion model. So, it is an evolution model with two terms that I'm considering for a distribution of mass rho. There is a diffusion term with the which is Fusion term with which is non-linear with the power non-linearity m greater than one. And then the aggregation is governed by a non-local drift term, non-local because it features the reads potential of row. So Ks will be the Ritz convolution kernel of order S for S between zero and N half. So it's a singular kernel. And you may notice that if you take dimension two and take M Two and take M and S both equal to one, you get the classical Keller-Segel model where so-called parabolic elliptic Keller-Segel model. And because in that case, of course, for n equal to 2, sorry, for S equal to 1, the RISC kernel is the Newtonian kernel, which dimension 2 is understood as the logarithmic kernel. So in that case, you have linear diffusion and logarithmic input. And logarithmic interaction. And so you see that that is the, let's say, a borderline case for this range of parameters. And there is a natural free energy associated to these dynamics, which is the integral of rho to the m minus the total interaction energy associated to the Rift's convolution kernel. And so this energy formally generates the evolution as its gradient flow with respect to the vastest. Gradient flow with respect to the vastest time matrix. By the way, today I will be mostly interested on the characterization, in particular, existence, properties, and uniqueness of radial steady states for these dynamics. So before introducing the equation that governs steady states, let me introduce the usual subdivision of the range of parameters. The range of parameters according to the fact that diffusion is dominating with respect to attraction or vice versa. So, this can be done, for instance, looking at the energy. So, take a distribution of mass rho and you just take the dilation of your parameter lambda. Both terms in the energy factor out a power of lambda, and you just compare the two powers, the two exponents. They are equal if m is equal to this, let I call. m is equal to this that I call the critical exponent mc, which is 2 minus 2s over n. And it is always a number between 1 and 2. So in this case, I say I am in the fair competition regime. Otherwise, I have the diffusion-dominated regime and attraction-dominated. And of course, being in one on the other regime has influence on what we should expect from the dynamics. And so in this talk, I will not be concerned with the dynamics. Talk, I will not be concerned with the dynamics, but let me say that, for instance, in the Newtonian, in the Newtonian case, so the Ritz kernel is in the case S equals one is the Newtonian kernel. So it is known that you have existence of global in-time solutions if M is greater than MC, so in the diffusion-dominated regime. And if you are in the fair competition regime, that's the regime in which you have a critical mass such that if the mass of the initial If the mass of the initial datum is below this critical mass, you have global in-time solutions. And so, this is the well-known feature of the two-dimensional Kelder-Segel model, which is a fair competition model. And so, the existence of a critical mass has also been proved for higher-dimensional fair competition models by Blanchekarilo and Lorenzo. And now, concerning my topic, so the analysis of stationary state. Topic: so the analysis of stationary states there are several papers on the topic. So, for instance, there is papers by Calve, Carrillo, and Hoffman, which extensively study the fair competition regime. And so, the diffusion-dominated regime, there are many results, especially covering the case of the Newtonian potential. There are less results about the attraction-dominated regime. In the case of the Regime. In the case of the Newtonian potential, the paper by Bian L Yu covers also the attraction-dominated regime. So, this is just a short literature review, which is not meant to be exhaustive, but I will also address other references through the talk. So, I have these three regimes, and there is a picture here for visualizing the different regimes in terms of the two parameters, S and L. The two parameters s and m. So m greater than one, and s for me is between zero and n half. So I will be in the upper left quadrant of this picture, where you may see that you can be both diffusion-dominated and attraction-dominated. The red line is the fair competition regime, which separates the two. If you are in the most singular range of the RIDS kernel, so for S between zero and one-half, there is also the appearance of another. There is also the appearance of another coefficient here in the picture, which is this M star. It's related to some regularity issues for stationary states, which again appear exactly when you are with S less than one half. So in the most singular range. And let me just write down now the equation that governs steady states so that I can start my analysis. So here is the equation for radial steady states. For radial steady states, it is so this coefficient m over a minus one times rho to the m minus one minus the rich potential of rho should be constant in the positivity set of the density, which in the radial decreasing case is of course a bull. So, the so a heuristic argument for deducing this form of the equilibrium equation is this: if you start from the evolution equation and you write The evolution equation, and you write it as a continuity equation with the velocity vector field v. This velocity vector field is a gradient, and if I require that it is zero on the positivity set of rho, I find that this quantity rho to the m minus one minus the risk potential of rho should be constant in the positivity set of rho. So, precisely, you should have possibly different constants in each connected component of the positivity. Constants in each connected component of the positivity set, but of course, if I look only to radially decreasing to radially decreasing stationary states, I have a single connected component, which is a ball and a single constant. In this talk, I'm not addressing a topic which is, however, very interesting. So, if it is possible to prove or not that every stationary solution is, in fact, radially decreasing. And one of the most important results. And one of the most important results in the theory is the one by Carrillo, Itmeyer, Bolsoni, and Yao, who proved that for the Newtonian interaction, this is the case. Every stationary solution is necessarily radically decreasing. And this result has been extended in this contribution with Carrillo, Hoffman, and Wolzone to some extent to the diffusion-dominated regime, so M greater than Mc. There is, however, this restriction, M should is however this restriction m should be less than m star which was this exponent here in the picture which doesn't appear if s is greater than or equal to one half in that case just say plus infinity so there is no restriction and if s is small however there is this restriction and now i would like to uh so in the talk i will present so studying this uh radial decrease in stationary states i would like to present two results Stationary states, I would like to present two results essentially. So, the first one is an analysis of the properties of stationary states in the diffusion-dominated regime. And the second part, most importantly, I will discuss uniqueness of radio steady states. And for this result, I will cover also the other regimes, so also the aggregation-dominated in particular. So, let me start with the So, let me start with the result about the diffusion-dominated regime. So, here is a general theorem which gives properties of steady states in the diffusion-dominated regime. So, every property but uniqueness. So, uniqueness is not here and will be covered later. So, the point is that in the diffusion-dominated regime, so stationary states are characterized as minimizers of the free energy. The free energy is written here, as before. Energy is written here as before, so rho to the m minus the total interaction energy with Ks. So then it is natural to fix mass densities with total mass capital M. So capital M here is the total mass with prescribed center of mass, positive of course, and recalling the formally the evolution preserves positivity, mass, and center of mass. And so it is natural to look for minimum. So, it is natural to look for minimizers of this free energy in this space Ym. And this is the theorem. So, if you look for minimizers, so there exist for any given capital M, so for any given mass, there exists a minimizer. And the properties of minimizer, so if you have a minimizer, it is radically decreasing, it is bounded and compactly supported, and it satisfies the equilibrium equation, which is exactly the equation of stationary. The equation of stationary states. So, rho to the n minus one should be given by part of the constant k, so the risk potential of rho. And the difference of the two should be constant in the positivity set of rho. So, here the equation is just rewritten with the positivity constraint, say, here by including the positive part in the right-hand side. And so, moreover, And so, moreover, we also have the regularity results for minimizers. And in particular, it is in the regularity that M star, these strange coefficients appear. Because when you try to do bootstrap by bootstrap some older regularity for solutions to this equation, so you find that if M is greater than M star, which only happens if S is small. only happens if s is small, smaller than one half, then rho to the m minus one is older with some older exponent which is does not reach one. So rho to the m minus one is not lipschitz. Otherwise, if m is less than m star, rho to the m minus one turns out to be lipsch. And I mentioned that the lips property of this quantity rho to the m minus one is used for instance for proving For proving that every stationary state is radial in the results that I previously mentioned. So it is an important property. And so for instance, and then when you have m less than m star, so rho to the m minus one is Lipschitz. So for instance, now I will show a picture. So suppose that S, for instance, is equal to one half, so that we are in the first, so in the case in which M is less than M star, which is a plus. m is less than m star which is plus infinity then rho to the m minus one is lipschitz and then rho will be c0 alpha with a suitable alpha so for instance if m is greater than two it will be the the older coefficient will be one over m minus one otherwise if m is smaller you go to c1 and you can even go c1 alpha for suitable alpha so for instance in this particular case s equal to one alpha the and the And if m is greater than 2, the older exponent is 1 over m minus 1. And here is a picture of radial profiles of the steady states. And so two-dimensional numerical simulation give rise to this picture. So you see that S is one half, M is greater than two, meaning that the older exponent, which here is called P, is one over M minus one. So you see that when, let's say, M is larger, When say m is large, you have a low old response older response, so you have this, for instance, this red curve which is very steep when it touches the origin. And otherwise, these bar and blood-like profiles are more or more old and irregular when they touch the zero level. And when you reach p equal one, which means same equal two, you get Lipschitz, that's at the bottom of these curves. Okay, so now I would like to. So now I would like to. If we go back to this theorem, the next part I will discuss uniqueness, because in a sense here I'm looking to properties of minimizers, but if I look only to the equilibrium equation, and now I would like to close the circle and say, okay, if you have a solution, then it is a minimizer of the free energy. And this will be a consequence of a uniqueness result for radial solutions to this equation. And so this is the And so, this is the last part of my talk. I will discuss uniqueness. So, what about uniqueness of steady states? The Newtonian case is covered and uniqueness is proved by Kimenyao and then Carrillo, Castorini and Volzone for dimension greater than or equal to three or two, respectively. So, the first results in the risk case are given by Calveka, Rilo, and Hoffman in the first. Calve Carrillo and Hoffmann in the fair competition regime, and again in this contribution with Carrillo, Hoffman, and Bolsona in the diffusion-dominated regime in the one-dimensional case only. In higher dimension, there are three recent papers which all together more or less cover all the cases. So, the one by Calveca Relu and Hoffman for N greater than or equal to Mc There is a paper by Degadino, Yan, and Yao for M greater than or equal to two. M greater than or equal to 2, but it is more general because also covers not only RIT scales, but also our more general potentials. And then in this contribution with Chan, Gonzalez, Schwang, and Bolzone, we cover the case M less or equal than 2. Okay, limited to rich potentials of order between 0 and 1, or 0 and 1 half is if the dimension is one. And so, in the last part of my talk, I would like to discuss these results. Part of my talk, I would like to discuss this result that I mentioned for last end. So, how do we prove uniqueness? So, the first step is to rewrite the equilibrium equation in this form. So, the equilibrium equation is here in the second line in terms of rho. Then I call u the risk potential of rho. Okay, so k star rho is just u. And I rewrite the equation in the unknown u. And so I find that this, let's say, semi-linear fractional equation. semi-linear fractional equation fractional Laplace S of u is equal to a constant a which is just this number in terms of m and then i have this non-linearity u minus c positive part to the power p c is a let's say a non-negative constant p again is the notation for one over n minus one this is called the the plasma problem because this particular non-linearity so x minus constant positive part Positive part was used in the study of two-dimensional models for plasma physics in some papers by Roget Mamme in the 80s. And so the uniqueness result that I will present covers this range of parameters. The case S equal to one, so the local case is solved with ODE techniques by Flucker and Wei. And notice that. And notice that, however, that we have. So, if you look at the equation in this form with the power non-linearity, there is a critical exponent for this equation, which is a new threshold that appears in the problem. So, in the local case, it is m plus 2 over n minus 2. In the general case, it will be n plus 2s over n minus 2s. Here is a picture for comparing the parameters and the range of parameters. And the range of parameters in terms of p or m. So p is 1 over m minus 1. So you see that I'm considering on the vertical line m between 1 and 2. And this in terms of p means that I'm taking p greater than 1. mc is the critical exponent between m1 and 2. But now there is this new critical value in terms of p, n plus 2s over n minus 2s, which in terms of m falls in the Terms of M falls in the attraction-dominated regime. So it will be split into two sub-regimes. And here is the result. So subcritical case, P, now I take P greater than or equal to one and subcritical for this exponent. So take, let's say, constant taking C given, there exists a unique solution to this problem, unique radiocreasing solution to this problem. And so So, just a brief discussion about this result. So, existence can be more or less reduced to known techniques, for instance, by searching to critical points of this energy. So, the fractional Dirichlet energy minus the integral of the antiderivative of the non-linearity on the right-hand side. And so, I'm mostly interested in uniqueness. Let me mention before discussing uniqueness that. Uniqueness that since we have also the other results on stationary states that I mentioned by Delgadino, Yan and Yao, and Calve, Carrillo, and Hoffman, we can use that results for showing that this theorem is in fact true even if P is between 0 and 1. So in the end, this theorem, if we go back here, will be true even if M becomes larger than 2. So covering all the diffusion-dominated regime. Okay, so what is the uniqueness? So, what is the uniqueness? How do you prove uniqueness? Here we use the so the proof of uniqueness is based on the monotonicity formula for the fractional Laplacian by Cabré and Cigre. So, very briefly, suppose that you have two solutions, U1 and U2, we fix the C, okay. And then you take, so V1 and V2 are just U1 and U2 minus this C. So, in terms of V, the equation will be this one. You may assume that the V1. You may assume that the V1 and V2 have the same value as zero. This a posteriori is true by scaling properties of the equation. And then what is the equation solved by V1 minus V2? So what is the fractional applaution of V1 minus V2? Of course, it is, looking to this equation, it is V1 plus to the P minus V2 plus to the P. And so I can write, so if W is the difference, its fractional Laplacian can be written as W. Fractional Laplacian can be written as W times this capital V, and this capital V can be written as this ratio, where G is just the nonlinearity in the right-hand side, so positive power to the power P. And the point is that with the monotonicity formula, so there are the results by Frank Landzmann and Silvester that prove the uniqueness of radically decreasing and vanishing solutions to this kind of fractional equation in some cases, for instance, the linear case. So, in that case, if So, in that case, if capital V is a given function, then they have a uniqueness result provided that capital V is decreasing in the error variable. So, of course, here you do not have that V is a given function, but the point is that even if it depends on V1 and V2, but since V1 and V2 are radically decreasing and G is a convex non-linearity, it is still true that this quantity. That this quantity here, capital V, is decreasing. So, this is the key point. And the convexity of the non-linearity allows to prove that this is anyway a decreasing function. And you see where the assumption p greater than one enters into the game. If p is less than one, this nonlinearity here is not convex anymore, and you cannot say that this capital V is monotone. So, this is why this method works only for P greater than. Works only for p greater than one. And then we have an analogous result, and this is the last result that I present in the supercritical regime. So in the supercritical regime, so now P is greater than or equal than this m plus 2s over n minus 2s, we have a very similar result. There exists a unique radially decreasing vanishing solution. And what are the differences? So here the non-linearity on the right-hand side. non-linearity on the right hand side so it is a u minus constant positive part to the p, but the constant is zero. So in this case the nonlinearity is just u to the p. And moreover for having uniqueness you have to prescribe in this case the say for instance the value at zero. So there is a unique solution among those that have the prescribed value at zero. And so the fact that the constant c should be necessarily zero. So this is true because if you try to find a solution with that constant If you try to find a solution with that constant C in the right-hand side, which is positive, you do not find it. This can be proved by using the positive identity. And so the proof of this theorem again uses the monotonicity formula. Let me just mention that there are results by Chen, Li, and Wu, which interestingly tell you that in the supercritical regime, there exist also no radial solutions, and that in the critical regime, there is an That in the critical regime, there is an explicit formula for the solution, which is this one. So you have this power decay with this explicit representation. Okay, so this is the last slide. So in the last slide, I would like to. So I have a uniqueness result in all the regimes. And so this summarizes the consequences in terms of the original problem of the steady states. Problem of the steady states, so the solution to this equation here. And so the summary is the following: if M is greater than Mc, so in the diffusion-dominated regime, so for any mass, you have a unique radial steady state with that mass. And there is a one-to-one relation between the mass and the constant C. In the sense that if you fix C in this equation, so if you for a given positive C, this equation has a unique solution and it will be a minimizer of the functional. Will be a minimizer of the functional over density with mass m for some m which is uniquely determined by c if you go to the fair competition regime again for any c you have a unique radially decreasing solution. However, in this case all the solutions have the same mass. So C varies but the mass is always the same and it is the critical mass. Recall that in the fair competition regime there is a critical mass. And this is a consequence of the results by Calvica Rilo North. Of the results by Calvika, Rilo, and Hoffman. If you go down with M, so you enter the aggregation-dominated regime, but still above this exponent, which corresponds to the critical Sobolev exponent for the fractional plasma equation. Then again, for any given mass, you have a unique radio steady state. So it's as in the diffusion-dominated regime. The only difference is that you do not have anymore the property of being a minimizer of the free energy. Of the free energy. And then you go down up to one with M, so you enter the supercritical regimes. So, in this case, what happens is that if you fix the central density rho at zero, then you find a unique radiocreasing vanishing solution. In this case, however, a consequence of the theorem of the previous slide, you have to take C equals zero. And in particular, if you are supercritical, what happens is that this happens is that these steady states are let's say slow are smooth and slowly decaying at infinity and they are no more of finite mass. So in this case in the supercritical regime you find steady states with not finite mass. And then again even in this case there is a one parameter family of steady states you can parametrize with the central density. And let me mention that in And let me mention that in the local case, there are results by BNLU, and all these results agree with that results in the sense that if you put s equal to one in our analysis, formally, you get exactly the same picture that you have in the Newtonian case, so in the local case. And I think that with this, I can end my presentation, and I thank
