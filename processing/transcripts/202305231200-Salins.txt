It is ten fifty nine, so we are going to start the introduction immediately so the speaker can start just on time. We are very happy to have Mickey Salins with us talking about stochastic partial differential equations with sublinear forcing. Thank you. Thank you very much.    Okay. All right. So we're thinking of a stochastic reaction diffusion equation. So you can think of this A as being the Laplace operator. So it's the heat equation, or it could be a more general second-order linear operator. And under appropriate conditions on A and this noise w dot, then the solutions are function valued. And if f and sigma are both. F and sigma are both this deterministic forcing and this multiplicative noise forcing. If they're both globally Lipschitz continuous, then there's lots of theory that tells us that solutions exist, are unique, and don't ever explode. So the question I want to ask is: what happens when you're talking about the market The question I want to ask is: What happens when F and sigma both grow faster than linearly? So you lose this global Lipschitz continuity. And what happens to the solutions? They explode or not? So the global Lipschitz continuity isn't the only known result. It's also known that, for example, if sigma is globally or is locally Lipschitz with linear growth, and F is locally Lipschitz and features some dissipative behavior, so it pushes everything toward the middle and maybe grows slower than polynomials. And maybe grows slower than polynomially, then it's well known that global solutions exist. And this has been done by many, many people in many different cases of bounded domains, unbounded domains. And here's a very partial list of citations. So just the terminology that I want to use, because it's a 30-minute talk, so I'm going to present five results. So the first, if F grows super linearly and pushes outwards, so if you take F and you divide. And pushes outwards. So if you take F and you divide it by U and you take the limit and you get positive infinity, I'm going to call this superlinearly accretive. So these forces push things out towards infinity and they could cause explosion even if you don't have any noise. If it pushes the other way, if F divided by U, if you take U to infinity, if you get negative infinity, then this is a force that's strongly pushing in. So this is superlinear, but it should help prevent explosion. And I'll call that superlinearly dissipative. I don't think these are very. I don't think these are very standard notations, but for these blow-up problems, I really don't care about what happens anywhere except for the tails. I only really care about what's happening near infinity. So these kinds of forces might counteract some expansion. And I want to give you just a couple examples of basically four different cases. So what happens if you have superlinearly dissipative F, so strongly pushing in, then how fast can your sigma grow and not have explosion? And we look at that on a basic. Have explosion, and we look at that on a bounded domain. I'll also look at the case where f is pushing out faster than linearly, and sigma is also pushing out. So, everything is sort of potentially causing explosion, but still doesn't. I'll give examples of these on a bounded domain. And then I want to look at the same two questions on unbounded spatial domains, where it's a lot more complicated. All right, so let's go. So, if you have one of these heated So, if you have one of these heat equations or reaction diffusion equations defined on a bounded spatial domain, and your f and your sigma are both locally Lipschitz continuous, then there's a localization procedure that's available. And what that looks like is you take these locally Lipschitz functions and just cut them off at some point n. So you let it match this Fn matches F in the middle. And if U is higher than N or lower than minus N. Than n or lower than minus n, you just set it equal to f of n or f of minus n. So now these f n are globally Lipschitz continuous, and I do the same thing with the sigma n. So if you, for each n, then I'm going to have a unique global solution that doesn't explode where I've replaced the forces by these globally Lipschitz cutoffs. Forces by these globally Lipschitz cutoffs. And the point is that you don't even have to take limits as n goes to infinity because these solutions are all consistent. They all completely match each other up until the point that you exceed a certain level. Because of the uniqueness, these f and these sigma all match up to n. So if you look at the first time that your L infinity norm reaches n, then these solutions are all consistent. So that means you don't even take a limit, you just define a local solution as being u n up to this time, tau n. This time tau n. And then that solution is called a global solution if this tau infinity, that's the supremum of these tau n is infinity with probability one. So when we're on the bounded domain case, we can do this localization procedure. We just have to look at these stopping times to understand whether stuff explodes or not. Localization can also work in some unbounded domain cases. I'll come back to this. But if you have an unbounded domain and your f of zero is zero. f of zero is zero and sigma of zero equals zero, and you start with certain initial data profiles that are bounded and decaying as you go to infinity, then you'll stay in this space and you can still localize stuff. But if your sigma is bounded away from zero, then you have a real problem because your solutions are unbounded with probability one. Your heat kernel has infinite range. So there's no way of localizing this. There's no way of localizing this and stopping it before your L infinity norm reaches a certain level. So you just need a different procedure in that case. So before I present my results, let me tell you about some 30-year-old results by Carl Mueller and collaborators. So they were looking at this heat equation in one spatial dimension with no forcing term F and the sigma is a polynomial. So you have U to the gamma times space-time white noise in one spatial dimension. And what they were able And what they were able to show is that the solutions to this never explode if gamma is less than three halves, and the solutions explode with positive probability if gamma is greater than three halves. So we're far, pretty far from the globally Lipschitz setting here. And the one sentence intuition for this very complicated result is that, so it's a heat kernel on a bounded domain. So it's not exactly this, but the heat kernel on the bounded domain with the right periodic conditions. Bounded domain with the right periodic conditions, it still has this t to the minus one half in the heat kernel. And that decay and many, many other tricks are able to get you this extra half power of sigma. Yeah. Do we know what happens? No. And I don't think anyone's worked on it since 2000. And then there's this dissertation by Bazdec that takes us to higher spatial dimensions. Takes us to higher spatial dimensions and other kinds of noise. And then one more thing before I get to SPDs: let's look quickly at this SDE example, which I think gives you a lot of intuition for how dissipative forcing could allow superlinear multiplicative noise. So this is just a SDE on Rd. Here the W is a finite dimensional Brownian motion or whatever. And I have a polynomial dissipation force. So I've got this, you know, basically minus x to the b with. know basically minus x to the b with the right sign and then uh x to the gamma uh stochastic multiplicative noise so it's clear that if gamma is less than one then you're not going to have explosion because you can do kind of runwall arguments but you're also not going to have explosion if you have this inequality so if gamma is less than b plus one divided by two then solutions can't explode so the bigger b is the bigger gamma could be right if if b is 100 Right, if b is 100, then gamma can be quite big, and you can prove this in basically one step just looking at the second moments in Ito formula. And what you get on the right-hand side is an expression that if this condition is satisfied, this expression is just bounded from above by a number, by a non-random constant. So the second moments can grow linearly and you're not going to explode. You can also find this in the SPD literature. You can also find this in the SPDE literature for monotone SPDEs, where you have a regular enough noise that an Ito formula exists. And it's basically the same argument, do the same Ito formula, and they have this complicated condition on Hilbert Schmidt norms or whatever. But I wanted to see what happened if you have space-time white noise or other situations where you don't have a Ito formula. And here's the result for the bounded domain case with the superlinear dissipative F. So we've got the We've got this stochastic reaction diffusion equation, and assume that the F decays really quickly. It decays so fast that it's bounded in this way by a polynomial with power beta. And assume that the sigma grows polynomially to the power gamma and assume this relationship here. So I didn't explain what this number eta is, but one minus. eta is, but one minus eta over two is the notation that I use for the temporal holder continuity of the stochastic equation. So if I have a heat equation with spacetime white noise, that one minus eta over two is a fourth or a little bit less than a fourth. So if you have these conditions, the mild solutions never explode. So this result is nice because it matches the Ital formula arguments. So if you set eta equal to zero, that gets you this half holder. That gets you this half-holder continuity in time, right? This is the Ito formula case, and the condition matches the condition that you get from the Ito formula. But if you have other kinds of noise, then it also allows for this super linearly growing multiplicative noise. So as long as beta is bigger than one, gamma can grow super linearly. If you look at the space-time white noise case, which is probably the most interesting. Which is probably the most interesting. This temporal holder continuity is less than a fourth. So gamma can be any number that satisfies this. If you have the cubic case, then you actually get the same gamma as Mueller showed you have without the cubic dissipation, which is interesting. So for beta less than three, the Mueller results actually dominate. But then if beta is bigger than three, then the dissipation caused by this strong, strong attraction to the middle. Strong attraction to the middle lets you have sigmas that grow much faster. Yeah. So let me give you an idea of why this works. This is a one-slide idea of why it works, but it's nice. So if you look at the deterministic ODE with this polynomial decay, it has a really nice property. You can solve it explicitly. It's a sophomore exercise. sophomore exercise and these have the property that you get these bounds that are independent of initial data so there's this this uh c t to the minus one over beta minus one is this profile it's singular at zero but bounds all the solutions with any initial data you don't have this in the linear case right because in the linear case you have exponential decay which is proportional to your initial data but if you have any beta greater than one then you have this kind of property uh Property. And you can also see why the beta equals three case matches the Mueller result, because that's giving you a t to the minus one half, which is the same t to the minus one half from the heat kernel itself. But if beta is bigger than three, then this one will dominate. So if you take a mild solution, here S is denoting the semi-group generated by the linear part of the equation. If you take one of these mild solutions, this has a space. These mild solutions. This has a space component, all this stuff, but you can compare it to this ODE. And in particular, if this noisy term is particularly small compared to the value of the solution, then this will also decay in the same way that's uniform with respect to initial data. So as long as the noise isn't too big, this will fall and it will fall at a speed of t to the minus one over beta minus one. And you can use that in your estimates. You have to use stopping times. You have to use stopping times to make sure that the noise isn't getting too big. So, then if you take this superlinear composition, this is growing like gamma. You can take a linear power of u out and then take this singularity. You can get these sort of uniform estimates on sigma that don't depend. At least they don't depend super linearly on the initial data anymore. And this helps with your calculations. I'm not going to go through the whole proof, but this gets balanced. Proof, but this gets balanced out by a singularity that's introduced from the convolution of the noise and the heat kernel. And you just have to balance these two singularities as like a beta function, and you're able to control this stuff. All right, so this kind of uniform decay is what makes this result work. All right, now I'm going to move on to the accretive case. So this is very, very similar to the talk we had yesterday. Now let's look at the effect of Fs that are unhealthy. Now let's look at the effect of Fs that are unhelpful, right? Fs that push out and may cause explosion, but they're faster than linear. So the question is: does this cause explosion in finite time or not? We went over this yesterday, but I'll go through it again. So if you have these one-dimensional ODEs, you have what's called the Osgoode condition, which is a characterization of explosion. So if F is positive here and C is positive, then the solution of this will be possible. Then the solution of this will explode in finite time if and only if this integral is less than infinity. And that number is the time to explosion. If that number is infinite, then these solutions will grow but not explode like you're used to in the linear case. So for example, the ODE won't explode if you have the linear case. You know that it grows like e to the t. But it also won't explode if you have like u times log u. That one will not explode. It will grow like e to the e to the t. Will not explode, it will grow like E to the E to the T. And you can do this as many times as you want. So you could also have U times log U times log log U times log log log U. This one grows like E to the E to the E to the E to the T, which is fast but not explosive. All right. So for deterministic PDEs, this isn't quite the case anymore. So there's a result by Fujita that looked at this PDE where the power of P is quite. Where the power of P is quite large, and there exists non-zero, non-explosive solutions. So, but if you add some stochastic noise to it, then once again, the Osgoode condition is basically characterizing explosions. So, there's this result by Bunder and Grossman, where they showed that if you add an additive stochastic noise, then this Osgoode condition being less than infinity. Osgood condition being less than infinity causes the SPDE to explode. And this is just done by comparison principle. Fundun and Neular proved that the Osgoode condition is actually a characterization when sigma is constant. So you explode in finite time if this integral is less than infinity, and you don't explode in finite time if the integral is infinity. The interesting thing is that sigma can be superlinear too. Superlinear two. So there's a result by DeLong, Koshneverson, and Zhang on the bounded domain case. And they didn't quite get exactly to the Osgoode condition again. What they showed was that F grows slower than U times log U, and sigma grows slower than U times log U to the fourth. If you have those conditions, then you also can't explode. And their proof uses moment estimates and that kind of stuff. And that kind of stuff, and I'm fairly confident that the proof just doesn't work if you try to go to u, log, u, log, log, u. So you can't quite use their method to get all the way to the Osgoode condition, but you're getting super linear stuff. You can also see this is very, very close to Osgood, right? If you took log to any power bigger than one, then you'd be in the explosive case. So I found this result that is basically the Osgoode condition again. It's the Osgood condition. Osgood condition again. It's the Osgoode condition on f and an osgood type condition on sigma. So I'm assuming that there's a positive increasing function h, that when you integrate one over h, you get infinity. And I'm assuming that this dominates my deterministic forcing f. The other thing that I'm assuming is that there's some number gamma that's less than the, remember this one minus eta over two is what I call the temporal holder continuity of these paths. So for some Of these paths. So, for some power less than the holder continuity of the paths, your sigma can also be superlinear. So, maybe this is a little hard to parse, but if u, if h is u log u log log u, then sigma can be u times log u log log u to any number less than a fourth. Right, so the superlinearity should be kind of on the same order as the holder continuity of the paths. Anyway, if you have these conditions, then solutions don't explode. So, both are pushing out faster than linearly. Pushing out faster than linearly, but not exploding. I don't think you have moments, by the way. These things get really big, really fast, but they don't explode. So here's the argument. I'm just going to define these stopping times. I'm going to use this localization argument. I'm going to define these stopping times that are just looking at the time when the L infinity norm of my solution reaches the level 3 to the n. I'm using 3 because the mild solution has three terms. And this exponential spacing is just really, really convenient. Exponential spacing is just really, really convenient for the proof. And then I'm defining this number a n. This is a deterministic number to be 3 to the n divided by h of 3 to the n plus 1. Remember, h is a superlinear thing, but if you integrate it 1 over h, you get infinity. So this sequence Z n is a deterministic sequence of numbers that converges to zero, but sums to infinity. And this gives us a lot of intuition, I think, for why the Osgoode condition is the right condition. Is the right condition because what I can do is I can start my process at one of these stopping times. So I'll start this the first time it reaches the level three to the n. And this has three terms. And I can very easily control the first two. So this is maybe a little hard to read, but if I look at any time that's smaller than this deterministic number a n, and before my process reaches the level three to the n plus one, then I can get. Plus one, then I can get this bound. So it's an integral. The time interval is less than a n, so I can multiply by an, right? The integrand, I'm stopping this before it reaches 3 to the n plus 1. f is dominated by h, so the integrand is bounded by h to the 3n plus 1. And if I multiply those together, by definition, that gives me 3 to the n. So this term is less than 3 to the n if I take a t that's before a n and before the tripling time. The first term also. The first term also is less than three to the n because the semi-group is a contraction. Right, so this is less than three to the n, this is less than three of the n. If I want this thing to triple before time a n, then I need this term to be bigger than three to the n, because three to the n plus three to the n plus three to the n is three to the n plus one. So this event can only happen if this stochastic integral is bigger than three to the n on the short time interval that's less than eight at the end. And I have the stopping time. The end. And I have the stopping times here because the integrands are always going to be smaller than 3 to the n plus 1 before I reach that. And this turns out to be a very rare event. You can understand here I multiplied by an because I had this integral. Here I end up multiplying by an to the temporal holder continuity. So that's why my superlinearity that cancels out can also be to the time holder continuity of the paths. Anyway, the proof involves proving that this is very rare, rare enough that the Borel. Rare, rare enough that the Borel-Cantelli lemma is applicable. And then you can just show that this tripling times are eventually bigger than this deterministic sequence an. So summing up the tripling times has to be infinity, and this thing can't explode. I think it gives some intuition for why the OSGID condition is existing in the first place. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so I'm using moments on this term, but it has all these stopping times in it. So I'm looking at this, the moments of this before a n and before it triples. But if you looked at a deterministic t, I don't think there's any moments. Because remember, these things grow like e to the e to the e to the t. So if you take e to the e to the e to the Brownian motion, you're not going to get any kind of moment at a deterministic t. But I've got stopping time. At a deterministic T, but I've got stopping times all over the place, and it works out fine. So, yeah, let me talk about some of the results on an unbounded spatial domain. So, here I'm going to assume that I have a noise that's spatially homogeneous and white in time that satisfies this strong Dalang condition. And I basically just wrote this to. And I basically just wrote this to explain why I was calling 1 minus eta over 2 the time holder continuity. So if you use this strong Dalong condition, then this 1 minus eta over 2 is the Dalong condition. And here's the mild solution on an unbounded spatial domain where we're using the heat kernel here. So in general, solutions are unbounded in space because, in general, these stochastic terms are unbounded in space. But there is this special case. But there is this special case where your solutions are bounded in space, where if sigma zero equals zero and f of zero equals zero, and you start with initial data that's bounded and decays as you go to infinity, then you'll stay in that space for all time. So Chan and Wang showed that if the same assumptions as Dalong and Kaushnevison, that if f grows like u log u and sigma grows like u log u to this. Like you log to this timeholder continuity, then you can't explode. And then we have a paper that's almost done that extends this all the way to the Osgoode condition. And this is basically the same assumptions I had on the bounded domain case. And the proof is basically the same as the bounded domain case, except that you have to keep track of this LP norm as well. So the only difference really is that you can use these localization methods, but You can use these localization methods, but you have to have a stopping time that keeps track of the LP norm and the L infinity norm. So there's just like extra stuff to keep track of. On the bounded domain case, this makes no sense because the LP norm is dominated by the L infinity norm, but here you have to keep track of both. Yeah. Yeah, sigma zero, zero, F is zero zero. And that lets you stay in this LP L infinity for all time. So you can localize it. Let me talk a little bit about other things you can do on the unbounded domain case. So, for example, if you have additive noise, then your solutions aren't going to be bounded anymore. So, there's no localization method and the stopping time stuff doesn't really make a lot of sense because your solution is going to explore the entire domain of these superlinear force at any time. So, if you assume that H is increasing positive convex. Increasing, positive, convex, satisfies this Osgoode condition. And you assume a very technical assumption about the solution of the ODE with initial data X doesn't have too much growth in X. Other than that, it's the same. So if you assume that F is bounded by this Osgood type function and sigma is a constant, and you assume that the initial data grows slower than square root of log, then your solutions can't explode. Then your solutions can't explode. So it's also basically the Osgoode condition with one technical assumption that I actually don't think can be removed, but I'm not totally sure. So the way you deal with this without localization is you do some kind of like dynamical weighting. So there's a paper by Shang and Zhang that looked at F is U times log U and sigma has linear growth. And they proved that there's no explosion by taking their prove that there's no explosion by taking their unbounded solutions and dividing them by this. So they take this kind of exponential weight in x, but the exponential weight is growing in time. So they use a stronger and stronger weight as time goes on. And then this seems to basically work, but again, it's hard to get past the u log u using their method. It's hard to get all the way to the Osgoode condition. So I considered faster growing F, but additive. F but additive sigma. These papers were put on archive like two days apart or something. So if you look at the, I looked at the additive noise case just for simplicity. So the spatial growth rate of this stochastic convolution is square root of log x because it's a stationary Gaussian process in X. And the square root of log is, you can understand sort of intuitively as being the inverse of the Gaussian density. It's the inverse. inverse of the Gaussian density. It's the inverse of e to the minus x squared. So these things will sort of get bigger and bigger and bigger and they'll sort of grow like square root of log x. They'll spend most of their time near zero, but you'll get these little peaks and they fall in this envelope. So what happens is you can define a dynamical weight and you can write this explicitly using Brownian motion and stuff. You can write down a row that's a super solution to this. Solution to this PDE, deterministic PDE, that starts with square root of x, square root log of x is the initial data, and then grows by the heat equation and the superlinear force. And what happens is that if you take the stochastic solution and you divide it by this weight, then you can prove that because the, I assume the initial data grew like square root of log, and I assume that the noise grew like square root of log, you can show. Log, you can show that this quotient can't explode. There's basically no probability arguments in this paper, it's just comparing stuff to ODEs once you know the growth rate of the stochastic convolution. You can prove it for any deterministic path that grows like square root of log, and then you can just plug the stochastic term into there. So, very different than the localization arguments. All right. And then I feel like I have a little bit of more time, right? So two more minutes. So the last thing I'll talk about is kind of the beginning of thinking about the dissipative case in unbounded domains. So here, a condition that works really well and actually gets rid of the local Lipschitz assumption is this half Lipschitz assumption. This half-Lipschitz assumption. So, if you assume f is half-lipschitz, so there's no absolute value on the left-hand side. This is saying the maximal slope of f is bounded by kappa, but it can decrease as fast as it wants, and it can even jump down. It doesn't need to be continuous. So f is, for example, a decreasing function plus a line. That's the same condition. And one thing you can do to deal with these cases is you can look at this kind of functional mapping M that maps. That maps a function of time and space to the solution of this integral equation. If this is a stochastic integral, then this gets me a mild solution of an SPDE. And one thing I was able to prove in this decipitive case is that this mapping M is actually Lipschitz continuous if you look at the right space. So assuming that F is only satisfying this half Lipschitz assumption, you can show that, for example, if you take two, let's say, bounded. Example, if you take two, let's say, bounded and continuous Z's, then you can prove that there exists fixed points M that solve this equation. Then if you subtract them, they satisfy this kind of equation. And this K only depends on the time horizon and the kappa. It's not very specific to F at all. And once you've done this, you have this kind of global approximation now using this mapping M. Using this mapping M. And what that lets you do, yeah. So then once you prove this for bounded and continuous functions, you can kind of extend it to all these polynomially growing functions in this space. And the fact that this is Lipschitz continuous, it allows you to work with this kind of operator instead of with F directly. And you can build solutions to these decipitive SPDs just using Picard iteration, using the Lipschitz continuity of this operator. This operator. So now we're completely avoiding localization. We're doing everything as just like Lipschitz continuous maps of unbounded fields. And that's enough to get started here. All right. Well, thank you so much for your attention. And thanks for inviting us to Mexico.
