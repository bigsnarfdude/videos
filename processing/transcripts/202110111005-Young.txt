Okay, so let's get started. Welcome, everyone. The first speaker is Amanda Young from the TU in Munich, and she's going to tell us about bulk gap in the presence of edge states for the Halden pseudo-potential, so namely for quantum Hall effect, I suppose. Amanda, please. Amanda, please. All right. So, thank you very much for the invitation to speak with you guys today. The work that I'm going to be talking about appeared on the archive just in August and is joint with Simona Bartel, who's also at Tune and NCQST. So the talk is going to be broken up into three different parts. So in the first part, I'll give a little bit of the background on Haldin pseudopotentials, and in particular, some of the main properties and conjectures we expect to see in these models. And even though this is actually a model for a two-dimensional physical system, the mathematical model we're going to consider is a one-dimensional lattice model. So I'll spend a little time writing that down. And for the particular pseudo-potential we're going to be considering today, it's the one-half model and it's going to be a truncated version of the one-half model. So in the second part of the talk, I'll define what this truncated version of the model is and state the main result, which is a bulk gap. The proof strategy that we use. The proof strategy that we use is based off of our ability to identify an abundance of invariant subspaces of the Hamiltonian using tiling descriptions of the lattice. And these invariant subspaces, in particular, are going to support the ground states. And so the ground states also have a tiling description. So I'll spend some time talking about what this description is. And in the remainder of the talk, I'll spend some time talking about what the proof outline for the What is the proof outline for the bulk gap, and also some other results we have related to edge states and excited states if we have time? All right, so let's get started. So Halding and pseudopotentials were first introduced in the 1980s as Hamiltonian models for the fractional quantum Hall effect. So the physical system that you should keep in mind is that you have some sort of two-dimensional manifold where charged degrees of freedom are interacting and there is a perpendicular magnetic field. And there is a perpendicular magnetic field acting on the manifold. Now, theoretical models for the fractional quantum Hall effect originally date back to Laughlin with his enzats for the mini-body ground state wave function. And shortly after Laughlin's work is when Haldane introduces pseudopotentials. And in particular, the Hamiltonian models were catered in such a way that each pseudopotential has a maximally filled lambda Laughlin wave function in its ground state. In its ground state space. Now, pseudopotentials themselves have kind of become an area of study also. And later on, it was also realized that rapidly rotating posites also behave like fractional quantum Paul systems. And in particular, this would correspond to P even for the Heldering pseudopotentials. And the model that we're going to be considering today, which corresponds to P equal to zero, is actually a model for one of these wrap. Is actually a model for one of these rapidly rotating composite gases. However, in a previous work with Bruno as well, we also considered that p equals one for Meonic model, which is for the fractional quantum Hall effect. And in particular, everything I talk about today has an analog for that model, and the results can also be extended to the system as well. Now, one thing we expect for the pseudo-potentials is that the properties of these models should be robust under the choice of two-dimensional manifold that we choose. Of two-dimensional manifold that we choose to define our system, and for our particular model, we chose to work in the cylinder geometry. So, that's going to be the manifold that we work on, and that you should keep in the back of your mind as we go through this talk. All right, so what are the main properties and conjectures we expect to see in these Halding pseudopotentials? So, first off, the pseudo-potentials themselves are non-negative models and they have Models and they have zero energy eigenstates. And what you expect, and what we know actually does hold true, is that the ground states, the zero energy eigenstates of this model, have a maximal filling, and the filling is related to the particular pseudopotential that you choose. So for p equals zero, the model that we consider today, the maximal filling is going to be one half. And here the filling is given by the number of particles that are in the wave function divided by the volume of the system. And for And for example, the Laughlin wave function is an example of a zero energy eigenstate that has maximal filling. Now, for fillings that are higher than this maximal filling for the ground state space, we expect that there be some form of spectral rigidity, which means that if we fix the filling of the system, we expect that the minimal energy and the Of the minimal energy in the n-particle subspace associated with that filling is going to be proportional to some increasing function of the filling. And this is related to the URAS line, and we'll actually be able to see this property in the truncated model later on in the talk. The main property that we're going to be considering is going to be the spectral gap conjecture. And in this particular situation, what you are looking at is the gap of. Are you looking at is the gap of the Hamiltonian above these zero eigenstates? And what we want to be able to show is that there is a positive constant that's independent of the system size, the physical system size, that bounds the spectral gap from below. And in particular, the spectral gap is responsible for the incompressibility of the fractional quantum Hall fluid. And one way you can think of this is by alternating. Is by uh alternate um is via the filling. So, one way to change the filling factor here is to compress the volume size. And so, if you start off in a state with a filling of the number of particles in that is below this minimum quantity to be in a ground state, and then you think about compressing the volume to increase the filling factor, what the gap will guarantee is that there's a maximal amount of amount that you can actually compress. Of amount that you can actually compress the volume before you have to actually increase the energy of the system with that fixed particle number. And lastly, of course, we're thinking about a fractional quantum Hall system. Also for these Haldane pseudopotentials, what you expect is that above the zero energy eigenstates be fractional excitations. All right, so we're going to be considering a truncated version of the Hamiltonian. And if this model physically represents the Model physically represents the true model. Well, we should be able to reconstruct all of these properties in our system. And what we were able to prove is that these three first three properties do indeed hold. And we also were able to make a little bit of progress on the anionic excitations. All right. So again, we're going to be considering the one-half field model in the cylinder regime. And if we write this model in a second quantization form, the pseudo-potentials become one. form the pseudopotentials become one-dimensional lattice models where the sites they'll model correspond to the possible orbitals in the one-particle Hilbert space and so it's it's this particular setting that we're actually going to study the model and improve these gap results in so let me be concrete now and write down what this this Hamiltonian is in this lattice model setting so the one the single particle Hilbert space for the cylinder is spanned For the cylinder is spanned by the lowest landau level, and these orbitals can be indexed by an integer z and this or k and this integer represents where spatially located each orbital is in space along the cylinder. So for the orbital psi k, it's going to be centered around the value approximately k alpha, where alpha here is the ratio of the magnetic length to the radius. To the radius of the cylinder. So, given this single particle Hilbert space, we're talking about a bosonic model. So, then the Hilbert space is given by the Fox space, the symmetric Fox space generated by this Hilbert space. And the Haldian pseudopotential is the projection of the delta potential in the single particle Hilbert space. And when you write it down in terms of creation and annihilation operators, this operator takes the following form. It's a sum of non-negative. form it's a sum of non-negative operators that are indexed by half integers where each of these operators vs can be written as a sum of of terms each of which is a product of two annihilation operators and the distance between the annihilation operators corresponds to the coefficient in front that we have here and since this coefficient is decaying rapidly in the distance between the two annihilation operators it's Violation operators, it's not unreasonable to expect that if you take a finite range truncation of this model, that we would end up with a model that still represents well the physics of the system. And so the truncation that we take is for all values of k less than or equal to one. And this produces two different types of interaction terms. So for half integers, we're going to get a nearest neighbor interaction term that corresponds to an electron. That corresponds to an electrostatic interaction. And for integers, this is going to give us a sum of two terms that's going to correspond to a dipole topping term. All right. So, Amanda, what is K physically here? Is this an angular momentum? Yes, I think that's how you interpret it. Okay, so we're going to be considering a finite volume model here, which is. Finite volume model here, which is going to correspond to essentially taking one particle Hilbert space span by a finite number of these orbitals. So for any interval in the integer lattice, we're going to consider the Hamiltonian with both open boundary conditions and periodic boundary conditions. All right, so we're going to also kind of generalize the model a little bit. So rather than having these coefficients determined by the parameter alpha, we're going to have instead kappa and lambda. Said kappa and lambda, and kappa is just going to be restricted to be positive, and lambda is a complex value. These Hamiltonians are going to are self-adjoint and have dense domain in the Fox space that is spanned by the occupation basis here, where you should think of the value of mu k as being the number of particles occupying the kth orbital in the single particle Hilbert space. So, this operator q is. this this operator q is is a dipole popping term and what it you should think of it as is it's going to act on an interval of length three and it's going to take the a particle occupying either site on the boundary and hop them to be occupying the same site. Okay, so this operator Q star Q is going to hop pairs of particles back and forth from the center site. Now in this model has two symmetries. It's particle number Has two symmetries. It's particle number preserving number one, and it also satisfies a center of mass symmetry. And if we look back in the physical parameter regime, the value of kappa and lambda take the following form, where again, let's recall that alpha is the magnetic length to the ratio. And where we're going to see the edge shapes appearing is in the tau-fowlis limit, where we take the radius of the cylinder to zero. And the parameter to really pay attention to here is the value of length. To here is the value of lambda, which will also go to zero in that regime. And so the two gap results we're going to be considering are for the open and periodic boundary conditions. And it's easy to actually find zero energy eigenstates for this Hamiltonian. And since this Hamiltonian is non-negative, it's guaranteed that these are the ground states. And so the gap of these Hamiltonians is just going to be the gap in the spectrum above zero. zero and in the simple case that when we set lambda equal to zero and actually are in this talgalis limit limit it's easy to see that the gap of the hamiltonian in case of either boundary conditions is the minimum between one and two kappa however if you start to turn on this this parameter lambda now and think of lambda small it's easy to see that for open boundary conditions the lowest energy level is going to be of order lambda squared and if for example And for example, you can take a span of these two occupation states here. This is an invariant subspace of the Hamiltonian, and its lowest energy value actually attains this order of lambda squared that we have here. However, if you look at the Hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions, you're not going to see these edge modes. And that's what we mean by the bulk gap, because the periodic gap should be more representative of what we actually see in the thermodynamic limit. And so the question here, though, is. And so the question here, though, is how can we actually get a good estimate on the gap for the system with periodic boundary conditions when you have these edge states when you have open boundary conditions? Because the majority of the gap methods out there that actually can be used to estimate the periodic gap usually rely on the results that you have for the open boundary condition gap. And so if the open boundary condition gap has these low-lying excitation, Condition gap causes low-lying excitations, it oftentimes will hamper your ability to estimate the gap for periodic boundary conditions. So, this was the difficulty that we were able to overcome in this model. And our main result is the following. We're able to show that for both open boundary conditions and for periodic boundary conditions, we can get a lower bound on the gap that's uniform in the system size. Both of these gap results will depend on some function f. some function f that we we've we've given the the plot here it's we can write it down explicitly but it's it's more uh reasonable to get the picture and for values of the parameter lambda sufficiently small you can actually show that the this value is robustly positive and the difference though in this minimum comes from this value gamma OBC or prayer and the thing to pay attention to is that the the lower bound for the open boundary conditions galaxy bound for the open boundary conditions gap is something of order lambda squared which reflects this edge state um behavior but for the the value for gamma pair it only depends on kappa so it's robust it's order one in this thin cylinder limit so the the main takeaway here is that the bulk gap uh stays open despite there being edge states and in particular our strategy Particular, our strategy here also works for the truncated model that we considered previously. And so this new result actually strengthens the result from that paper where we didn't actually get this robust bulk gap. So what is the strategy that we actually implied or use to get this result? It's the following. So what we essentially do for either case of boundary conditions is that we're able to block diagonal. Is that we're able to block diagonalize our Hamiltonian in terms of an invariant subspace, a close invariant subspace that contains the ground states of that Hamiltonian, that particular boundary conditions. And then what we do is we take the Hilbert space and we decompose it in terms of this invariant subspace and its orthogonal complement, which is also an invariant subspace. And then the gap of the Hamiltonian can be realized as the minimum of two particular spectral values. Number one, Number one, the gap of the Hamiltonian in this invariant subspace that contains the ground state space. And number two, the minimal energy value of the subspace that does not contain the ground state space. So in this case, because we don't have the ground states here, the minimal energy value is actually an excited state overall. Now, how we prove the gap in the space that has the ground states is. The space that has the ground states is where we actually apply the techniques that were previously developed for quantum spin models for estimating gaps. So that's going to be the place where you have the edge states possibly coming into play. But the main thing here is that the edge states for the open boundary condition system is actually contained in this orthogonal complement space. So the fact that we're able to separate out the ground states and the excitement edge states is what allows us to. Is what allows us to actually apply these techniques in a way that circumvents the edge states in the model. So, what we would like to be able to do is identify invariant subspaces that contain ground states. So, let's first restrict to the situation that we have open boundary conditions and first discuss how we can identify just uninvariant subspace. So, the first observation to make is that this first part of the Is that this first part of the Hamiltonian, which is an electrostatic part, is actually already diagonalized in the orthonormal basis of configuration states. So what that means is that to actually identify, if we have a subspace here that is spanned by occupation states, that to actually identify it as a subspace of the Hamiltonian, it's sufficient to just check that it's invariant under all of the dipole popping terms. The dipole hopping terms. And these dipole hopping terms have a very simple way of acting. They just take pairs of particles that are on the outer two sites and hops them back and forth with this intersite. And so in this way, we're going to be able to identify, starting from a given configuration, we're going to be able to identify a subset of configurations that will generate an invariant subspace of the Hamiltonian. So let's see an example of how. So let's see an example of how this works for this particular case, and then add on top of that the idea that we want to construct invariant subspaces that support ground states. So this model, as I said before, is non-negative. All the interaction terms are non-negative, and it definitely has zero energy eigenstates. And so what that means is the model is frustration-free. And so the ground states are actually given by all of the vectors that are simultaneous ground states. Vectors that are simultaneous ground states of all of the interaction terms. And so, for a configuration state to be a ground state of the electrostatic terms, all you need to check is that there are no nearest neighbor occupied sites. So then, if we just restrict ourselves to considering those configurations, we then just have to look at how these dipole hopping terms act on these spaces. act on these spaces and it's easy to check that if you take for example a configuration that starts with a 101 and act on it by the operator qx that there's a particular linear combination with the configuration that hops those two edge states to the center site that produces zero and a simple furthermore a simple calculation shows that if you actually take the full interaction that um the behavior of these these two Of these two, the action of this interaction term on these two configurations is again a linear combination of the two states. So this satisfies that property that I said before for identifying invariant subspaces. And so we're going to be able to then generate an invariant subspace from the ket of alternating ones and zeros by taking the configurations 1, 0, 1 and replacing them with 0, 2, 0. them with zero to zero. And this has a nice picture that can be described in terms of lattice tilings of the interval. And so what we do is for this starting configuration, which I'm going to call a root tiling, I'm going to tile it with a pattern of monomers where the monomer tile is just length two and has a single particle on the first site. And then what the replacement rule says is that I should be able to take pairs of neighboring monomers and replace them with a dimer. And replace them with a dimer that is of length four and has two particles on the second site. And then, by taking all possible tilings that I get using this replacement rule from the original root tiling, the collection of configuration states that I create when I take their span will produce an invariant subspace of my Hamiltonian. And moreover, this equation here will guarantee that we actually have a ground state in the subspace that's the sum of. The subspace that's the sum over all configuration states given by one of these tilings, and you rate it with a coefficient here that's one over lambda square root two raised to the number of dimers in the tiling. Now, this is only one example of a tiling space that we can create that supports a ground state. And by just adding a few more tiles to the set that we can use to create the root tiling. Can use to create the root tiling, we can actually create an abundance of subspaces, all of which support a unique ground state. So, what are these extra tiles though I needed? What are the root tilings and the tiling spaces? All right, so for the root tilings, we're going to have this finite set of, or it's not actually finite, but we're going to have this set of tiles. So, number one, we have a void tiles. This is going to add zeros between tiles. We have the monomer tile that we saw on the previous slide. Bottom or tile that we saw on the previous slide, and then we have two sets of boundary tiles. So on the left, I can have on the boundary any number of particles that I want, as long as it's followed by two zeros. And on the right, I can have a similar tile. And then I can also have a truncated version of the monomer tile. So a root tiling of my lattice then is going to be any tiling of the interval that you The interval that uses these tiles to cover every site. Now, of course, the left and right boundary tiles must be on their respective boundary, but you don't have to use these if you don't want to. You can, of course, put either of these two tiles at the boundary if you'd like. And then the corresponding invariant subspace is once again obtained via replacement rules where neighboring monomers can be replaced by a dimer. And we consider this truncated one to also be a monomer. And so it has a truncated dimer that can be used in its. A truncated dimer that can be used in its replacement role. And then once we have these invariant subspaces, the ground state is again defined similarly to before. It's just the sum over all configurations that are used to span the invariant subspace weighted by one over squared of lambda to the number of dimers replacements that we use to create that tiling. So, what we can show then for the open boundary condition case is the following. So, number one, for Is the following. So, number one, for any root tiling, there's a finite number of replacements you can use. So, each of these subspaces that we've created is finite-dimensional. As I said before, it's going to support a unique ground state. And moreover, for any two distinct root tilings, the corresponding tiling spaces are orthogonal to each other. And so in particular, what that means is that the direct sum of these tiling spaces is going to be well defined, and it's going to construct this invariant subspace that I was looking for in my original. Was looking for in my original strategy. And as you can expect from what I have said so far, is that these ground states that are supported by the root tilings actually generate an orthogonal basis then for the ground state space. And since I can have an arbitrary number of particles at either boundary, you can actually see that even though lambda is finite, the ground state space is going to be infinite dimensional. All right, so a similar technique will also work for creating a Technique will also work for creating a tiling space and the ground state space for the periodic boundary conditions, and it's actually even simpler in that situation because you no longer have to consider these boundary tiles. So in the case that we have periodic boundary conditions, we're thinking of the interval as actually being a ring. And for the root tilings, we're tiling with either a zero or a monomer. And then we have the same kind of replacement rules where neighboring monomers can be replaced by dimers. And in this case, And in this case, the number of tiling states is finite-dimensional, and therefore, so is the ground state space, but it actually grows exponentially in the system size. And also, you can see here that the first property of the Hallian pseudo potentials is going to be satisfied that for periodic boundary conditions, the maximal filling of any ground state is going to be at most one-half because any root tiling is at most going to be filled with all monomers. Be filled with all monomers. And for the gap results, kind of the two main properties you have to look at is how the periodic tiling states work with the open boundary condition tiling states. And so in particular, when you take a periodic tiling and you truncate it to create an interval, what you're going to get is a tiling that at most Going to get is a tiling that at most has two particles at either boundary. And so, if you replace this back to the root tiling that you get for open boundary conditions, you're going to see that the corresponding root tiling is not going to be arbitrary from the set that we said before, but rather it's going to belong to the set of what I call both tilings that's generated via these root tilings using these tiles. So, in particular, I can only have at most two particles at either boundary site. Particles at either boundary site. And the collection of root tilings, of open boundary condition tilings using these guys is going to be finite dimensional. And that's one of the key things here that's going to allow us to actually use the gap strategies from quantum spin models in this setting. The second main thing that allows us to apply thing that allows us to apply or adapt these quantum spin techniques into the setting is the relationship between the tilings for open boundary conditions and the tilings, these bulk tilings. And it comes through an isospectral reduction. So for open boundary conditions, the tiling space is infinite dimensional. And of course, if you're thinking about applying a quantum spin technique, you're thinking of a finite dimensional Hilbert space. However, in the situation where you use these Where you use these kind of artificial boundary tiles, where you can have as many particles as you want on the boundary, something kind of nice happens, which is that when you look at the action of the Hamiltonian on the tiling space corresponding to one of these artificial tilings, the action is actually equivalent to the action of a Hamiltonian on this interior region on the corresponding bulk tile that's created from removal. Tiling that's created from removing the artificial tilings. And so, then, as sets, the spectrum of the Hamiltonian restricted to this artificial tiling space is equal to the restriction of this Hamiltonian on a slightly smaller volume to this bulk tiling space. Now, the multiplicities will be different, but in particular, what this means is the gap is the same. The same. And so, to actually get the gap of the tiling system of the Hamiltonian restricted to the tiling space for open boundary conditions, it's sufficient to actually figure out the gap restricted to this bulk space. And we can use that to lower bound the gap on C lambda. So, really, in the end, to do either for either case of open. Case of open or periodic boundary conditions, what the question is going to reduce to is figuring out the gap in these bulk tiling spaces. And so that's what we do. So let's just recall that what we've done so far is we've broken the Hilbert space up into a direct sum of two invariant subspaces, the first of which are these tiling spaces. And then therefore the gap of the Hamiltonian is the gap in the tiling space and the minimal energy in the non-tiling space. Minimal energy in the non-tiling space. And so for the tiling space, the two techniques that we're going to use are the following. So for open boundary conditions, we use what's called the martingale method to produce a lower bound on the gap in the bulk tiling space. And then once we have the gap in the bulk tiling space, we can use a finite size criteria due to Kanabi to then estimate the gap in the periodic system. The gap in the periodic system. Now, in these tiling spaces, there are no edge states. I haven't proved this, but we can actually show that all of the edge states are supported in this orthogonal complement space. And so in neither of these two estimates, will we see a behavior of order lambda squared? And where you'll see this behavior of order lambda squared is going to correspond to when you estimate the ground state energy in the complement space. Energy in the complement space. And in this situation, what we do is we use electrostatic estimates to get a lower bound on this energy. But the key thing here is that the results that we get for this lower bound for open boundary conditions are completely independent of our results for periodic boundary conditions. So we don't have to rely on the open boundary condition results in the periodic case, which is why we're able to circumvent again the edge states and no longer see this order of lambda squared behavior. Now, for time, I'm going to maybe skip the slide, but this was just maybe an outline of what these two gap methods are for the Martingale method and finite size criteria. I'd be happy to talk about this more in the discussion session if you are interested. This kind of outlines what these gap methods are for our quantum spin models. And let's maybe instead turn to the to focus on this orthogonal complement space now. So we've spent some time talking about. Now, since we've spent some time talking about the tiling spaces, okay, so the motivation behind how we get the lower bound for the energy and the non-tiling space comes from this question actually of spectral rigidity. So remember here, what we want to know is if we fix an in-particle sector, which corresponds to fixing the filling of our system, what we want to know is how does the minimal energy in this system depend on This system depends on the filling. Now, for fillings that are sufficiently high, what we're able to do is do kind of like a quick and dirty estimate where we take a Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to lower bound the Diefold-Hopping term in terms of electrostatic operators again, which then creates a lower bound on the Hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions that is purely electrostatic and we can solve use. Can solve using, for example, a Lagrange multiplier technique. So, this is a very easy estimate that you can do. And what you can show is that for fillings that are sufficiently large, the minimum energy in this n-particle sector does indeed grow or does indeed increase as a function of the filling. Now, this requires, this result requires that your filling is at least one. And in particular, there's going to be configuration. There's going to be configurations in this non-tiling space that have lower filling. So, this quick estimate is not going to be sufficient for estimating this minimal energy in the non-tiling space. However, what we're able to do is a similar type of estimate where we treat individual occupation states that are supported in this Hilbert space individually and treat them kind of individually for the Kuchi-Schwarz inequality. Inequality. So, here is kind of the outline of how we do this. So, what we're going to do is we're going to consider the set of configurations that are not tiles, and we're going to break them up into two sets. So, the first set is going to be those configurations that have a positive electrostatic energy, and the second set is those that have a zero electrostatic energy. And then, for either case of boundary conditions, if I take a vector sine. Conditions: If I take a vector psi that's contained in this non-tiling space and I look at its expected energy, I can write it as a sum of two terms. The first is going to be the contributions from those configurations that do have electrostatic energy. And then I give the terms that correspond to the dipole hopping. Now, in the end, what we would like to be able to do is to take this, this affected energy, and lower bound it from below by some positive constant times. Positive constant times by the norm of the vector. So, this first term here for the electrostatics has the correct form. It's now then going to be the, we have to now consider though, however, those configurations that don't have electrostatic energy. And how we're going to be able to produce this estimate is by applying Cauchy-Schwartz inequalities appropriately to these terms from the Diefeld-Hopping interaction terms. And what we'll do is for each possible configuration without electrostatic energy, we'll choose a pair of k here to produce an estimate of the fall that depends on the coefficient of that configuration. So just to give you an example of the difference between the open and periodic boundary conditions, let's consider one of those configurations that came from the edge-shaped example that I gave at the beginning of the talk. Of the talk. So here is the configuration U that supported an edge state. And notice that it does not have electrostatic energy. And so what I'm going to want to do, though, is relate this to a term that does have electrostatic energy. And for this particular configuration, if I have open boundary conditions, there's only one possible dipold Hopping term that I can choose that will actually relate this configuration to one with electrostatic. To one with electrostatic energy, namely, it's the one that chooses the value of k to be the site A plus one, as that will hop two particles to the middle site. Now, when you actually then choose your value, your configuration u kind of correctly, the term that you get from the electrostatic energy or from the dipold hopping term is the following form, where the key thing to notice here is that the coefficient associated with mu Associated with is multiplied by a parameter lambda here. And then I'll apply a Cauchy-Schwarz inequality similar to the operator equality I did before to produce the following lower bound, where here the thing to notice is going to be that the term that has the electrostatic energy comes with a slight with a negative. And the idea is going to be that if I pick delta correctly, I can eat a little bit of the electrostatic energy that I Electrostatic energy that I got from the previous term, but not all of it. So then, if I take this term here from the dipole hopping plus the electrostatic energy from the configuration nu that I have chosen here, I can lower bound it from below by something that's robustly positive. However, the coefficient in front of the term psi of mu squared here does depend on lambda squared, which reflects that edge. Squared, which reflects that edge behavior that we had at the beginning of the talk. And so, our general strategy here is to choose these, make these choices K and mu for each type of different configuration that doesn't have electrostatic energy in such a way that we don't actually eat up all of the electrostatic energy of any given configuration. Now, to just contrast, for the periodic case, what's different is that I now have a different choice that I can make for this. Now, I have a different choice that I can make for this parameter k. I can now choose k to be the edge state a, which will allow me to hop particles one to b and one to a plus one. And then when I look at what I get from the electrostatic energy term, the coefficient that does not have electrostatic energy is no longer multiplied by a factor related to lambda. And this is what allows me to do a similar procedure and get a coefficient here that is order of one. Order of one instead of order of lambda squared. All right, so this is just an example of how these two, this electrostatic estimates can differ between the open and periodic boundary condition case. But one might be worried that I haven't actually treated all, how do I actually know where the edge states actually live? Well, we can actually, once again, Well, we can actually once again construct the invariant substances of the Hamiltonian that support these edge states, and we can recognize them again in terms of tilings. But rather than the tilings that I had before, I have to introduce some new tilings. And for the root tilings here, I have two tiles, a left and a right tile. And the main thing here, though, is that when you do something similar to create the invariant subspaces, when you truncate When you truncate the last site corresponding to these edge boundary tiles, the resulting tilings that you get on the interior are once again these boundary void monomer dimer tilings that supported ground states. So this is how you can actually represent the invariant subspaces that support these low-lying excitations and recognize them as actual edge states. They will all be contained or supported on invariant subspaces of this form. On invariant subspaces of this form, or when you cut off the boundary sites, the remaining part supports a ground state. And then finally, in the last couple of minutes, let me just quickly say a little bit about the bulk excitations. So what we conjecture, what we believe is that these bulk excitations, so if you actually look at the Hamiltonian with, say, periodic boundary conditions, that the lowest energy excitations are going to come from subspace. Are going to come from subspaces that support a quasi-whole particle pair. And so we have some sort of way of trying to describe this in terms, once again, of tilings. And the idea is that we take a monomer, we slice it into two pieces, and then we kind of flip where the two pieces live. So we switch their orientation. This is going to be our quasi-volume quasi-particle pair. We use this to create a root tiling. Use this to create a root tiling, which will generate again a few additional tiles when you do the replacement rules and you actually see what creates an invariant subspace. But what we conjecture is that the lowest energy states belong to these invariant subspaces. And we can actually show that the minimal energy in these subspaces is something that, for at least in the case of the one-third model, we consider does agree for small values of lambda with the lowest energy state. Values of lambda with the lowest energy state. One other thing we can also do is with these tiling states is we can also identify mid and high energy states using the concept of mini body scars. And the idea here is that on the interior, you create some sort of tiling state that is definitely an excitation. And if you put enough voids to the left and to the right of this state that separates the excitation from the rest of the system. From the rest of the system, then you can put a ground state on either side and create an exact energy state then for the larger system as well. All right, so let me just conclude then. So just to summarize, we've proved the conjectured low-lying energy properties for a truncated version of the one-half Halding pseudopotential in the cylinder geometry, and we did this facilitating. We did this facilitated by invariant subspaces that we described using Domino Tylene's lattice. The bulk gap strategy we were able to use should also apply to other models where edge states and ground states can be separated into different invariant subspaces. And in particular, we can tell that it applies to the one-third truncated model that we studied previously as well. And some future directions and questions. First, what we And questions. First, what we'd be interested to know if anyone here has an idea, I'd be happy to hear it. We're able to identify all these invariant subspaces with only two known symmetries. And typically, when we think about invariant subspaces, they're usually linked to some symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Over here, we can very easily find an abundance of invariant subspaces with only a few symmetries. So we're curious to know if there's possibly some other algebraic structure. Note, there's possibly some other algebraic structure at play here that could be behind how we're able to find these invariant subspaces. We'd also like to be able to get better control of the low-lying excitations. And some other directions would be to possibly consider longer range truncations or stability of the gap, with the ultimate goal, of course, being able to prove the gap conjecture for the untruncated model. So I will stop there and thank you for your attention. We'll stop there and thank you for your attention. Thank you, Amanda. Let's make some noise virtually, maybe.
