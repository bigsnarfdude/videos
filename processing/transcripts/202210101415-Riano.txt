Okay, thank you very much. Thank you very much to the organizers for the invitation, Lucrezia, Claudio, and Miguel. Thank you for the opportunity. And okay, I'm going to talk to you about the well-positions of dynamics for a certain class of KDB type equations. And this is a joint work with Esmedlanda Rudenko here at Florida International University, Kai Jang, and two. Kai Jiang and two undergrad students, Isaac Friedman and Diana Son. We did this project during the summer, previous year, and it's partially really nice. We worked with some undergrad students, so it's going to show you some results here. Anyway, can you hear me? It's just a second, Oscar. I don't know if you are touching some bottom. So I don't know if you see also that there are. Your screen, there is some emoji or here. It does not appear the talk from here, so I don't know. Okay. Yeah, but I have also difficulty to hear you guys. It's not easy to can you maybe stop sharing and share it again? Okay, sure. Okay, sure. I think that it's no no, it's from UCLA. It's from the zone. But it's not very good. There's also a box on the wall, sorry, the control panel in the room 202 that you are in. You can adjust the volume as well of what will come through the speaker. I will be there in just one minute to show you. I will be there in just one minute to show you how it's done. So, yes, if you want to hear more in the room in the audio adjustment right here, you can raise the volume of everything a little bit. I cannot hear you well. I don't know what's happening, but yeah, it's not that good. Sorry. That would be answer. You want me to share the screen or something? Um yeah, you shouldn't touch need to um if you go from the scrap here, just go this one here. That's where you have control of it. But the problem is, yeah, if you read them out on the side here, that's when you're going to have to pop up. And technically, it should disappear within a few seconds. For some reason, it doesn't really try to show something. But yeah, at least the reactions are gone, but for tending to see it. Should work like fine. Can you try now? I'll start to material screen again. Okay, I'll try it again. I don't want to turn the big light off that kind of side, but it's really. But it's really up to you guys. It's just some kind of bright one. You cannot really see the big layer on the screen, but of course, you can also have this one. Okay, is it working? Yes, yes. Shall I start? Yes. Yes. Okay. So Okay, so as I said before, I don't know if you can hear it, but I will mention just some results about the KDB equation. Work with it with Professors Belana Rudenko, K Jang, and with Isaac Friedman and Diana Sun. These two last here, they're two undergrad students, and it was part of a research program we carry on here in Florida International University. And okay, just going to show you the results and some of the open questions that we have here. The main goal of this talk, I don't want to be too technical about it. I just want to introduce you to the problem, the equation, some results we got, and hopefully, things that we expect to work on on questions that remain open. That's pretty much what we want to say. So I focus like my talk in two parts. The first part is going to be the part about local world positions, where we're going to give some analytical results. And then I will talk about the numerical investigations, where we open more questions, I think, to explore here, like in the study of this type of questions. In the study of these types of equations, so I hope this motivates you to work on these things. Anyway, so before that, let me introduce the models we are working on and going to discuss today. There's these two models here. One is going to be the GKDB and the capital letter GKDB here, the one you can see here. And there's a difference. You can see the dispersive part of the equation is the standard KDB equation in both of them. And the main difference is the non-linearity term. The non-linear term here is one. The non-inner term here is one that does not include the absolute value, and here we include the absolute value. So, in order, since in this total we'll focus more on the lower, like non-inneridic case, when alpha is less than one, I will restrict the ports of alpha in this case to m over k written as a fraction when m over k are all the numbers in such a way that this function is well defined. Okay, for negative initial data, negative solutions use of sign-changing solutions. So, that's pretty. Solutions. So that's pretty much the two models we want to study: like the capital GKDB and the small GKDB. And I want to show you some difference between these two equations and what is nice about the, let's say, the large time behavior of the equations, like a way of some problems to compare those equations. Anyway, so this is pretty much the goal of the talk. I just said it. For the local behavior, the equations are going to be behaved pretty much the same, like the techniques we use to get local existence. We use to get local existence. They are pretty much the same technique and they work the same for both equations. We're going to see some difference when we study the global behavior, for which we're going to use numerical methods. Are the tool we're going to use to kind of like understand what's going on with these two equations or main difference between them? So both equations are, in a way, as you can see, like generalization of the key generalized KDB equation, which is the one when typically you put this non-linearity and the power include or the power study there is K when K. The power study there is k when k is an integer power, it's an integer number, and this equation has been widely studied. Like the well-posedness and everything about this equation is well studied, but we don't have time to talk about it here. I just want to mention that this equation here, the GKDB with capital V, which is the one with absolute value, this equation has also been studied. It's an equation that appears in some physical applications in the study of electrons. When alpha is between zero and one, actually, you can push the alpha to negative power as well. The alpha to negative power as well. So that equation will also appear. I will give you a reference at the end of the talk. There's also a particular case of the equation, which has been like, is the more popular one, I will say in that way. It's the so-called Chamel's equation, which is the one where you fix the nullinarity to be one half alpha equal to one half power. And this is the Chamel's equation, which was again proposed to study the electrons. And here's like some remark of the physics. Remark of the physical application of the equation. Right? I mean, this is an extra remark of the Wald Posnis. And very recently, the case alpha between 0 and 1 of the Moller KV equation of when you put alpha here, that equation was like the Wald Posner was studied by Felipe Linaris, Eminjasake and Gusol Ponci, 2019. They used like some technique, some approach based on Cassina's idea for the showing equation and using that technique. The Schoenger equation. And using that technique, they kind of like obtain some well-posnessed results. And that's one of the focus of this talk because we make some improvement of that technique that I will discuss later about. Okay, so talking a little bit more about the equation, they have like these conserved quantities. They have like with sometimes called the mass, which is the L2 conservation law for both equations. And we have here the L1 conservation law, which is this type of L1 norm. And there's other. Of L1 norm. And there's also like the Hamiltonian structure of the equations, which is the ones you're seeing right now. It's this equation. This is the Hamiltonian equation, the structure for this equation, this concert quantity. And the one below is for the absolute value. And here, right away, you can see a difference because one of them has absolute value and the other doesn't have. So sometimes we'll see that this will give some difference between ZNF, especially when you put it in negative initial conditions. One is going to be bigger than the other. Be bigger than the other because of this magnitude here, and this we will see that like when we study the numerical part, anyway. So, let's say like just a few cases of the family of KDB equations we know that are known to be like completely integrable. The case of equal to one, which is the standard KDB equation, and the modified KDB equation. For other models, including the ones I'm mentioning here, I don't know anything about integrability. As far as I know, the integrability is an open question. The integravid is an open question for those things, or if it is not integral, especially for the case of less than one. What else I want to mention? There's the scaling invariant of this equation, which is also nice and also gets used to see the critical index, which is useful to classify the equation when you have the supercritical equation, the critical equation, supercritical equation, especially for the large time behavior of solutions. This is critical, it is really important. The stability or those types of. The stability or those types of questions. So, this is the scaling variant of the equation. And anyway, another important thing that is useful for this type of equation is the existence of traveling wave solutions. The traveling wave solution we consider are solutions of this form, given by a specific solution of this form, and it vanishes at infinity. So, a solution that decays. It's easy when you look like all of these equations where you see this translation, the speed of the propagation of the weight, they can all Propagation of the weight. They can all be rescaled to the propagation C equal to one. And then you will find that for the first equation, for the GKDB, this is the ground state equations. And for the other equation without absolute value, this is the other ground state equation. Although for us, for the mathematical point of view, these two equations are completely different. As we can see, you have here the magnitude there, and here there's not magnitude, right? But what is nice is like when we talk about the ground state, When we talk about the ground state, when you check at the positive solution, both equations have the same positive solution, and that solution we have explicit solution in those cases, which is given by the formula you're seeing right now. And here we plot some profiles of that cube when we change different parameters of of. We consider different of, and here's some profiles of that queue. Like we shape, like taking the shape of those, those equations for. The shape of those equations were different enough. Anyway, so that was pretty much like the small introduction of the equation. And now I'm going to talk more about the local well-posness part, like the existing result or solution of the equation. And all of you might notice as one that one of the greatest difficulty, like working with this type of equation, is the fact that these two non-linearities, they're not as right in the typical case of the KDB equation, let's say when alpha is equal to one. Say when alpha is equal to one, this equation is a polynomial nonlinearity, and therefore you can apply like bilinear estimates and try to do those arguments, right? But in this case, say that we would set alpha between zero and one, a major difficulty to the well-posness result is exactly that this function, this map here, is not necessarily class C1. Exactly. So you might think, how can I justify the energy space, right? Which is H1 energy space, base energy space. So that's one of the main difficulties because if we try to apply one derivative to this formula, we might run out into some difficulties there. And of course, by local well-poseness, I would mean like the strong sense of local well-posedness. Like we want to have like uniqueness, existence of solution, and continuous dependence. So in that sense, it's hard to find solutions of these equations, right, with the standard methods. So because of that, like those are recent idea in 2016 from Cassiana and Dopkin. Cassiana and Dopkin. They introduced like one idea to get well-posed for those types of non-linearities that are not regular enough to apply like classical techniques. And what they did is like they started like a weighted space. And the idea is very simple. The idea that they say is like, okay, let's say that I want to work with a smooth non-linearity. The non-linearity that I'm showing you today, it's smooth outside the origin. So can I correct or make a correction of that lack of smoothness of the origin? Lack of smoothness at the origin by considering initial condition that never vanishes. Of course, if we are working on L2, we cannot take a function that never vanishes, right? So in order to compensate that, we put a wave. So when you put a wave, you assume this type of initial conditions, right? And when you have that type of initial condition, then you expect to construct a solution that, at least for a local time, a small time, the solution remains with this property, meaning that your non-linearity is smooth enough to apply. Is not enough to apply at least existing of some result on that direction. Anyway, so this is partial over theory. I should point out as well that this idea was also applied, like was first applied by Felipe Linares, example and say, Andijazaki in 2016. And what we did, we just extended to fractional weights because they did it for the case when M is an integer number, and we need it for applications to see what happened when M was. Applications to see what happened with them was fraction, especially to increase the range of admissible decay allowed by the equation. Anyway, so this is pretty much the main theorem we proved in 2022. And of course, just the condition is not enough to have a solution, right? We need extra regularity conditions and decay conditions as well. So all of these things, they pop up like when you just work on the spaces, right? This is extra decay conditions of the derivative. Some L infinity. Derivative, some L infinity decay conditions and the resolution, and some like mixed set conditions, right? Between decay in L infinity and L to partial decay of these things here. There we were. So this is still the statement of the result. So here we get like a local existence of solutions. Sorry if this is a lot of text here to read, but I will summarize it for you. Like what it says is like given an initial condition with all those conditions I show you, which the one that we care more is this one. The one that we care more is this one, the infimum condition. Given that we can always find a local solution, there exists a time and there exists a unique solution such that that solution lives in this class, right? And the solution is pretty much closer for local time. It's really close to initial condition up to some number. This fact actually means that if your solution never vanishes up to some polynomial multiplication, the same is going to happen for your solution for some local time. And of course, this is the statement of the continuous dependence. Statement of the continuous dependence. Anyway, so this is a technical result of local well-positions, which pretty much works for both of the equations. So we can get the same like well-poseness for the equation regardless of the non-linearity, even when alpha is greater than z. Okay. And anyway, so here is again the remark that the Keynes case m greater than one integer was deduced by Linares, Mijasaki, and Ponce in 2019, very recent result. And what we did is essentially we stayed. And what we did is essentially we strengthen the admissible range of weights to M to be a real number as wherever we want. So that's what we did during this job. And actually, because of our arguments, we also study any power elf. So although we get well posness for powers that a better technique applies there, what is nice is like you can take alpha wherever and the same proof will work. So that's also nice, even though you will have like better techniques for alpha even, for example, for the model. For example, for the modified KDB equation. Anyway, so I'm just going to mention two key arguments here, which I believe that are really important for the deduction of the fractional thing. One is the way the linear equation behaves with polynomial weights. Like how the area equation of the solution of the linear KDB equation, they behave with the polynomial weights. And this is one of the key lemmas we did use. Like here, I'm going to denote the group of solution of. Here I'm going to denote the group of solutions of the Schoening of the K-Dib equation. And we are seeing how to get one estimate between the solution of the linear equation and fractional weights. And we have this really clean and nice estimate when each time you work with a weight, you need two times the regularity, and this is the relation we get. As I'm saying, what we did is that we extended, we proved this lemma when m is a positive real number. Okay, that's pretty much one of the key features we use. And here I'm explaining. And here I'm explaining the notation. And well, here's like some basic idea how to do this that important estimate. And it's very simple. What you do is just write this power n into integer of fractional power, and then you use the Fourier transform. We are in an L2 basis space. So you know that you can always transfer decay to regularity in the L2 spaces. That's very easy. So everything turns out to be just find the local derivatives of this guy and the fractional derivative as well. And the fractional derivative as well. So, for the local one, nice, we can use this type of identities for the exponential weight, which are not difficult or hard to deal or find. And for the non-local part, which is the hardest part, of course, it's not simple to use or to operate or calculate the fractional derivative using the standard definition of multiplication, but this way it's not that easy to handle to compute things. So, we use instead one of the Stein's fractional derivatives. One of the Stein's fractional derivatives, which is the one here, which is, of course, due to time, I won't be able to explain all the details. But this is what we did. We split the weight into the derivative of integer and fractional part. For the fractional part, we use a stein derivative, which is, by the way, equivalent in the L2 norm. This is the square norm. This is one of the stein's derivative. Anyway, so that's one of the key ingredients. And another one that is really useful in this KDB type of equations is this result by Kenny Poncipe, that it's the so-called Katis-Moody effect. It's the so-called Catus-Moon effect, the charm Catus-Mooten effect, in which we are seeing the following estimate, the one that I pointed out here in the middle. It's one when you observe that the solution of the Lin equation actually absorbs one variety. It's one derivative smoother than your initial condition F. So you can absorb one variety. And this is kind of like nice when you work with the null inheritance of the form u to something time dxu, because that dxu is increasing the varieties in the system, right? So this is like one of the key ingredients. So, this is like one of the key ingredients we use. The only price we have to pay is like it's not the standard, L2 in space, L infinity in time. It's just the L2 time, L infinity in space. So here you switch the order. But this is a nice estimate that will help us to control that extra derivative coming from the non-linear term. Anyway, so the idea essentially again is to develop positions is use of contraction mapping principle when we define like the contraction space, like the complete space. Space, like the complete space here, which is the one I'm introducing here, is the space that has the hypothesis in the theorem, which is kind of like technical. But okay, like, for example, here you can see the norm I just mentioned, right? The L2 norm in time and the L infinity norm is the space that came from the Katus Moody method. Anyway, and again, we use the integral equation and we apply the estimate. I just want to show you some example of one of those estimates. But I think that the example is not that, I mean, it's illustrative because it will follow some restriction on the weight. And it's kind of nice because you will also see some difficulties here. So I just compute, like, remember, I have to show that the integral equation, how it behaves, like in that space I introduced, right? One part of this space is the HS. One part of this space is the HS norm. So I have to compute the HS norm of this integral equation here. When I apply it, which is exactly what I'm getting here, I also, when I combine that with the Katos-Mudin effect, I will end up with the S derivative of the non-linear equation. Again, we are running here into troubles, right? Because you will see right away that if S is too large and alpha is really small, we're going to get negative powers, right? So this is a not nice thing. Anyway, so when you distribute the derivative, you will get exactly what I'm saying. You will get exactly what I'm saying. Some high-order derivatives are landing here, and that's going to give us some trolls. But one way to handle, which is just this particular example I'm showing you, is that what you can do is like each time you have a negative derivative, remember that you have this condition, u, like x a times u greater than lambda. Because of this condition, you can change negative, like negative powers of u by power of the polynomial. By power of the polynomial way. That's like the exchange. Like when you have a negative power of u to the negative something, you can exchange that by a way, but a polynomial way, because your solution never vanishes. And actually the case as a polynomial. And here I'm showing you like some example where we see how to distribute like the weight in a smart way to optimize like the estimate. And here we have an extra derivative. So we need to use the Katos moving effect norm. And then we end up with some requirements. And then we end up with some requirements on the weight to be integrable in L2. And this gives like a lower bound of the requirements for the weight, which actually appears here, one or two of. Sorry, you have a question? I sorry I heard something. No, no, I okay. Just go on. Oh, thank you. Okay, like. Okay, like just to mention, like other estimates will fall. Like the thing here is a careful analysis between negative powers and weights. When you have a negative power, you can change the negative power but a weight. That's pretty much the key argument here. And this is a typical example of an initial condition that satisfies the class I just introduced. They have to be like polynomial way. And this function here decays faster, like a Gaussian of a function in the Schwarz plus one. In the Schwarz-Plasophone. What is nice about the well-posness is that we extend it to fractional weights. So actually, we can cover a lot of weights, weights, as long as the weight is greater than this number here, regardless that it's fractional or not, which is useful when you compare with the numerical methods we use because we have some limitations. So the theoretical part can work with better weights. And here's the huge question that probably some of you might ask: is that there's not the ground state, which There's not the ground state which decays exponentially because it's a sesh function, decays exponentially. The ground state is not part of the initial condition that satisfies a local well-posness result. Therefore, I mean, we need to study or introduce probably a different technique or different approach to include some well-positions result that includes the ground state. So, this still remains like a nice question because we want the ground state to be an example. Because we want the ground state to be an example. When you have a ground state in some class product, you can think of the stability or instability, those questions there. Anyway, so because of that, like kind of like the numerical approach, it's needed because it will complement our investigations in the way that we can now study what happens when you put exponential data. Like what should be the point of the exponential data. So, in a way, the numerical and analytical results complement each other, right? And again, I hear a posing equation. An interesting problem is to investigate the solution of this equation, both of them, in some class, I don't know the class that you should define, such that the Q of the ground state is part of that class. I mean, you can include exponential decay. It sounds easy to ask, but I mean that there's a lot of things to investigate there. Anyway, just now I'm going to change, like, now that we've studied somehow the local behavior and I let. Somehow, the local behavior, and I left some questions for you. Now, I want to study the numerical investigations we did so far. And what we did is a study pretty much like verify the so-called solitone resolution conjecture, which essentially says that given a for like a formally, it says that a solution eventually evolves into a number of solitones plus radiation. So it's going to be like a sum of solitons plus radiation. Of course, there's going to be some scaling parameters here that they're going to. Parameters here that they're going to depend on some cheap operator here. But this is pretty much the soliton resolution. I mean, for several equations, this is open, especially for equations that are not completely integrable and you cannot use inverse scattering transform. Like, for example, our case when alpha is less than one or greater than zero, this conjecture is open, but we're going to use numeric to check that it, if it holds, right? We expect this to hold, like to happen, right? That's good to have an intuition what's going on there, and so that is what. And so that is what we're going to do. We're going to confirm, check that this resolution actually holds for single peak initial data, just one peak initial data. Like we did it with super Gaussian, Gaussian, polynomial decay. And I'm just going to show you like some small things we did. So the first equation we studied is this so-called Chamel's equation, which is u to the one-half power dxu. So we studied this equation and So, we started this equation, and the only thing that I want to say is: like, this behaves typically as a KDB equation. Like, there's not a big problem. Like, we start with some initial data. You can see a positive initial data, kind of like the positive Gaussian initial data, which is localized, and it starts to travel to the right. And when it travels, it starts to form a solid. And when it goes to the right, it starts to turn things into the radiation here. And then you can see the radiation here. Right? This is like the first line of the picture that I'm showing you. The second one is. Of the picture that I'm showing you. The second one is when you take negative initial data, right? When you take the negative initial data, the same happens. Like it starts to form a negative soliton, which is the one you're seeing here. And then the right-hand side, the left-hand side starts to turn into radiation. So this is typically the behavior of KDB type equations. And this is what is happening. I should mention that we are doing this thing for the equation U, which is the one with absolute value, which is the Chamberlain's equation. Well, that's pretty much. Well, that's pretty much what I want to say here. Now we're going to consider the ground state as an initial data, see how it evolves, right? And change the amplitude and change the translation of this thing, right? And we're going to try to compare these two guys again with and without absolute bad. That's pretty much the capital GKDB and this and the u to the alpha dx ukdb. Okay, here, of course, if I'm putting the ground state. If I'm putting the ground state, there's nothing to see, right? This is just nice to check that the numerical techniques are working, right? Because it's a ground state, so it has to be constant. So we see that in both cases, when A is greater than zero, both cases, and like with blue is the K-Dev equation without absolute value, and the dashed red line is the one with absolute value. So as you can see, like the evolution is nothing, it's what we expect. We're just checking numerical techniques are working. Checking the medical techniques are working and everything looks so far, nothing interesting. And here is we will start seeing a difference. And here's where we see that the ball equations are different. And it's the following. With A is less than zero, right? We start with a negative ground state. The dashed one is the one that you obtain for the non-interactive with absolute value. In that case, as you can see in all the pictures here, it travels like with. Pictures here, it travels like without changing shape. The shape is the same, it's just traveling, right? The traveling weight solution, no problem. Shape remains the same, it's okay. But when you put it into the equation that doesn't have absolute value, it does, it changes immediately. It turns into radiation almost immediately. As you can see, time equal to zero, same initial data, time equal to 10, you're still seeing the radiation field. And then it time equal to 50, you get a lot of radiation there. And here's the same in this extra example. You see that. Example, like you see, that the blue line remember is the one with adaptive value, right? So, for that, like the negative soliton is not stable. I mean, it's not, I mean, probably is stable, but it means that it turns into radiation. I should say, I should be careful with my words. Sorry. So what is happening is like with the negative initial ground state, the solution without absolute value immediately starts to form radiation. It never reached, like, tried to reach the. Try to reach the negative ground state because the ground state is not negative. And here is where we start seeing like a difference between both of the equations. We actually consider like more things, like this initial data, like the initial data of the Gaussian. Here I have some numerics about it. Like, first, we consider the case when A is positive. As I'm saying, both of the equations are going to behave pretty much the same way when the initial data is positive. So, we are seeing that there's. Initial data is positive. So we are seeing that they start here, the same initial data here, and then they start forming the soliton to the right, their salt people into the soliton, and generated this radiation here. Right? And as you can see, I just want to point out that the height of the equation, the height here, of the KDB equation without absolute value is higher than the height of the equation with the absolute value. So that's something to mention here. And then we start seeing. To mention here, and then we start seeing like it starts to form something like a train of solitons here to the left. That is the image you are seeing, and then we did like a profile, like a matching profile with the ground state solution, some pre-scale ground state, which is the last figure here. So, we're seeing that it's happening, right? Like we are seeing the solitone projection resolution here, like the initial data starting to evolve into the ground state and radiation. In both cases, nice, no problem at all. I just want to mention that. I just want to mention that this is something that the thing that you just saw is something called the parade of solitons. And it's that eventually we started with this initial condition and then we follow like a train of solitons, which is nice in both equations. It appears nice. And what is really nice with respect to the numerical techniques is that when alpha is small, we don't need a large domain to check the formation of the train of solitons, because that's one of the greatest difficulties. Because that's one of the greatest difficulties when you deal with KDB or higher power KDB null equations. Because in those cases, you need a domain really large to show like the train of solitons. But that's not the case when you reduce your, when you increase the power of the null linearity, you will see the train forming faster of solitons there. And that is actually one of the nicest things to work with this type of equations. Anyway, here's the X-ray mark that the solution of the GKDB without the absolute value are slightly Without the absolute value, are slightly higher and thus faster than those generated with the same initial data with the capital G K dB. We can expect that. I'm going to be really informal with you, but I think that this happens because of the energy, because the energy of this equation might be higher than the energy of this equation. Because this one, the absolute body is like subtracting something from the energy, which, in a sense, is the kinetic energy, like how the equation moves. But again, this is. But again, this is just my intuition. And anyway, now we take the negative initial data. And as we know, like when the negative initial data, and you take the absolute value, it behaves like pretty much the same. It's a symmetric equation with respect to positive or negative initial data. So the dashed one forms a negative soliton, and then it works really pretty much as we expect. And the one without the absolute value, it started to form radiation right away. Like without. Like without the absolute value, it does not like the negative solvent. It starts to form radiation, which is exactly what you're seeing here. And here are our examples again, Gaussians here. We consider really low powers of non-linearity. And again, negative initial data. Like with the absolute value, it doesn't matter. But without the absolute value, it turns into radiation. It doesn't form the solitone or the negative solitone. Anyway. Anyway, the solution of GKDB as the circuit starts radiating to the left. It's always radiation to the left. Whereas the solution of the GKDB evolves into the negative lump, into the negative soliton. We also observe something really nice, that is that the larger the pole alpha is, the faster the separation of the solitons from the radiation, because the radiation will eventually create its solitons, but the separation is going to be. Separation is going to be like it's going to be faster the separation when alpha when the power alpha is larger. So it means that if alpha is small, you will see like more closer and closer and closer to the solutions, like the solutions that are created from the radiation. Anyway, and then this is a simple conclusion, like in the case of the GKDB, which is the one with absolute value, there's no influence of the sign of the initial data. They can be positive or negative. You have like forming a positive. Negative, you have like forming a positive solute, a positive soliton or a negative solute. Okay, and here I just want to track what happened in the case of UU is without the absolute value, like what happened with the negative initial data. So here we took a negative initial data, negative c e to the x squared, and we tracked, remember that that negative initial data turns into radiation right away, like almost like a standing wall. It turns into radiation. It doesn't form. Turns into radiation, it doesn't form the solid. So, when it turns into the radiation, which is the one you're seeing here, the negative part of the initial data started to turn into positive part, and then it eventually will form a solid, which is exactly what we're showing here. Like the negative part will eventually disappear and turn into a positive profile that eventually will turn into a solid as well. But as you can see, see the scale, right? The scale is really small. So, that we are tracking the. Really small. So that we are tracking the radiation, right? The radiation part. Anyway, but this is something like what happened. If you put a negative initial data, it will start to turn into positive and form a soliton data. Anyway, and here I just summarizing that. One can observe that the first negative bomb in the radiation decreases in its magnitude, becomes smaller, smaller, and then eventually disappears. And the next positive, then it turns into a positive part, and that positive part. Part and that positive part will turn into a soliton because it's a KDB model. Anyway, so that's pretty much what we observe in the pictures. There's also two things that we study that I think I won't have time to mention it here. And is we study what happens when alpha goes to zero, when the dispersion is really small, the non-linearity, sorry, u to the alpha. It goes approaches zero. We find that the smaller the power alpha is, the longer the time. The power alpha is the longer the time the solution evolves into a rescaled soliton. So if it evolves into a soliton, but the smaller alpha is, it will take more time, more and more and more time, which is consistent. Because when alpha is equal to zero, like you expect to have a solid, right? Because there's not, it's a linear equation, right? U to the alpha gives you alpha equal to zero, like linear equation. So we are just checking numerically what's happening. And this is actually a conjecture. And this is actually a conjecture. We conjecture that when alpha approaches zero, the time that the main lump forms the soliton goes to infinity as well. So the time will form in infinity. This is a conjecture. Remember, the solution turning into that solid. Anyway, and also that we mentioned here, that I don't have time, I just want to mention, but I won't have time to show it to you, is that we also studied what happened with the interaction of two bonds, like two solitons interacting. Like two solitons interacting, what happened with the collision, what it forms, what we expect after certain times. And I won't have time to it, so I just advertise in a workshop in case you want to read it. And anyway, so this is like the bibliography, like things we did. Just want to mention like Casanalis and Labkin idea, the one they used to get the global local existence using weights for the Schöninger equation with weird non-linearities, like not smooth non-linearities, which all of them are. Linearities, which all of them are, but some particular cases. Our result, which is to appear in, it was just accepted. Everything I mentioned today is based on this paper. So you can read it and there's going to be there all the information, even better explanations. And there's also like the result of Kenny Possibly Vega for the Katos-Mutin effect, the Shark-Katos-Mooting effect. And the previous result of the decay when M The decay of the weld bosness for the fractional for the GKDB, the previous result when the weight was integered is in this paper by Felipe Mijasaki and Gustavo in 2019. This is a word of Belinovsky, and this is work called the big type equations in applications. This is a nice word when they
