Well, I I should I would like to thank the organizers, but I'm one of the organizers. But you know very well that I haven't done anything. Really, Mitch has done everything. So I want to thank for his leadership and all the energy that went into organizing this meeting. It's my first time, yes. It's my first time at Ben. It's wonderfully beautiful, and it's kind of interesting to be at a place that's colder than Beth. To be at a place that's colder than Yupe. As if I don't get enough cold button. Alright, so I want to talk about fractionally filled more. So these are STM data on twisted viler graphene and transition metal dichoca night. These are data without twisting. And what you notice is that with the twisted bilayer graphene, when you change the filling, these kind of Change the feeling, these kinds of pictures don't really change much. And what you are left with is the idea that, well, perhaps what you have is something that looks like a triangular lattice. But with TMD, when you change filling, you can clearly see that sort of periodicity is changing. There is a charge order for me. Now, Now, everything that I'm going to talk about today has to do with further range interaction. But we're going to make use of the fact that we're going to have to observe that somehow, if further range interaction exists in 2C5 graphene, it's going to be of different form because when you change filling, nothing's happening here on the plain side, and something is happening here. I'm going to first talk about 2C bilateral graphene and fractional correlation. And fractional correlated insulator states, including phylographen. The work that I'm going to talk about is in collaboration with my student Kevin Zhang and postdoc Dan Mao, who's a beta kid fellow. And we also had a pleasure of collaborating with Liang and his former postdoc Yang. Now, these group of people have been involved in theoretical work since. Dan's wonderful March meeting talk in the middle of COVID. The group of Mark and Jeannie Lau took interest in our predictions and they pursued experimental verifications. And there are some evidence that some of the aspects of what we predicted actually was worn out in the experiment. So it's very exciting. All right, so fractional filling invite you to think about fractionalization. About fractionalization. Fractionalization in 1D in the Sussri-Vertheger model for polyacetylene takes the form of solid funds, which are domain-wall balance states between two degenerate configurations of the dimerization. And these solitons can move. You can see that this soliton has just moved over here. And physical manifestation of these solitons are Manifestation of these solitons are fully acceptable. On the other hand, there are another form of rationalization which comes from, which can be accessed through sort of long wavelength effective field theory of Left Enterlined physics. And there is spin charge separation. And then a two-bit integer phenomenon. Edge states are examples of fractionalization that you can observe in 20. So both of these phenomena. These phenomena of rationalization are something that occurs without needing magnetic field. Earlier today, we heard about the excitement, especially Ellen mentioned how this is really exciting time to see fractional anomalous call effect. That's because fractionalization in 2D have required large magnetic fields. We know about fractional quantum holiday effect, and one way we think about this is to realize. Is to realize that, well, you know, you have flat band and you partially fill it, effective interaction gets magnified, and you get fractional component effect. And roll-up magnetic field there is supposed to give us flat band. And fractional charging later was something that we've thought about theoretically for a while, and only we started to see some evidence is only very recent. But those are both examples of fractionalization, whether Whether with field or with spontaneous effect, time reversal breaking fractionalization. There are other forms of fractionalization which does not break time reversal symmetry. So in the world of frustrated SPIT systems, people have long thought about how geometric frustration can lead to personalization. One can also consider constrained solvable models such as Dimer model giving frustration. Dimer model giving frustration fractionalization without any ideal. So the question is: can we get this sort of fractionalization in BOI systems? Now, in order to see fractionalization, one way or another, you need to amplify the effect of interaction. The fractional quantum Hall effect paradigm is to kill kinetic energy, get a black band, and then magnify the effect of interaction. But another Interaction. But another way would be to start with a strong effect of interaction, a strong complaint limit, giving you a crystal, and perhaps one can access a different form of rationalization, sort of kind of like the diagramization. So that's what we want to ask. Why would we even think about that? So I mentioned at the beginning, I'm going to talk about effects of further range interaction and how that could be different for TBG. Different for TBG and TMD. So, for TBGs, although this picture, this is data, it invites us to think about, you know, there is triangular lattice of with localized binary orbitals. It's been shown extensively that you cannot localize binary orbitals exponentially to one site. Instead, what you should really think about is there being a center organizing three lobes of. Organizing three lobes of extended by Neil Robille. So it was seeing these kinds of images that invited us in my collaboration to think about what would be the effect of geometric effect of this object. So when you have this extended object, bani-orbital, your effect of repulsion, that is, on-site-like repulsion, will not be Like repulsion will not be limited to on-site of the two centers sitting on top of each other. Even when lobes are overlapping partially, part of the lobes are overlapping, there will be the effect of repulsion. So this kind of repulsion can be actually captured as a cluster charging term. So it's written in the cluster charging format. It is a multi-body propulsion. But geometrically, you can think of these. Of these effects of these extended binary orbitals as giving you SOROBA Ferderweight interaction. Now, when people first observed that the binaryization results in this kind of object, that invited a lot of challenges. It meant challenges in describing the system at integer link, which was the focus of a large part of the community. What we realized staring at these pictures. Staring at these pictures was that, well, to think about the effect of this geometric aspect of the binary orbitals at fractional building could be actually rather simple. So that's what we decided to do. So how do we think about the strong coupling limit of this bunny orbitals? You borrow a toy from your kid, and you realize that they have this shape of digit spinners. And at one third filling, one-third counted as one electron occupying three sides of view that the triangular way. At one-third filling, what you can do is to lay down these fidget spinners flat. None of them, none of the lobes are overlapping. Oh, this is running by itself. I have no idea why this is running by itself. None of the lobes are overlapping. None of the lobes are overlapping, and this will be a happy configuration. But then, once you start laying down these fidget spinners, you realize there is more than one way to lay down these fidget spinners. It's a pilot model. So, first of all, the fact that you can lay them down flat like this says you would naturally have an incompressible state at integer plus minus one-third. But the fact that there are multiple The fact that there are multiple ways to lay them down tells us that there is extended generis. And it was Kevin who realized that there are many configurations. Leon and I were talking about this and we each came up with different configurations when we first thought about it. And I asked Kevin to try to think about what are different types of configurations that's possible. And after one night of thinking, I And after one night of thinking, I don't know why this is keep going, Kevin said, you know, there seems to be many, many, many. This is not something that we can count. And then we realized there is extensive ground state degeneracy associated with these configurations that you can actually evaluate using data analytics, which was first done by these people in the step-end contest. So then we started to think about what would be the consequence of this geometric frustration effect associated with orbitals. The community is used to thinking about geometric frustration associated with spins, but this is sort of a new aspect that is new from to Cylraphy. Now, what you realize is that you can explore these different geometrically different ground states. Ground states in the strong coupling limit by flipping these binary orbitals, but you cannot flip them just one at a time, they will have to be flipped in an extended way. And either you go along the whole line, or you can have this kind of tri-junction, and that allows us to see that there is going to be some breathing mode, which would account for extended degeneracy. Now, this extended degeneracy is Degeneracy is as a function of temperature. We are looking at a strong coupling limit where you can do Monte Carlo simulations. Although, having this kind of large degeneracy makes Monte Carlo simulations challenging because you need to be able to access all the configuration that can be only accessed through global updates. Once you add a little bit of degeneracy breaking curve, multi-parallel simulation becomes possible. possible. And what you find is that even when you there's a little bit of degeneracy breaking curve, the entropy remains large over a large range of temperatures until that degeneracy breaking really starts to kick in. So this degeneracy is a consequence of thinking about a particular limit of the strong gas interaction only, which is this avoiding the touching, no touching condition, or the cluster charging constraint. The cluster charging constraint only. Now, once you start to include interaction effects that are next order, this degeneracy is lifted. And now the system can pick a ground state. And we find in the limit of positive before some particular way of parameterizing higher-order terms, one will get so-called root 3 by root 3 state. If you remember that the orbital has an extended shape, we will draw. Orbital has an extended shape, we will draw these triangles. This is how we go between different rotations. Or if I just focus on the center of the orbital, these are the locations of the surface. And that kind of looks like the three by U3 state that we're used to. The limit of negative U4, which is possible when the exchange interaction is stationing from challenges, one will get this kind of breakwall state. It turns out this brick wall state, although this multi-by-rule. Ripple state, although this W3 by Wu3 state has only six-fold ground state degeneracy, the Ripple state has some extensive degeneracy that is linear in the system size. Now, if we take quantum effect into account, there is going to be new phases that's promoted by the quantum fluctuation effect. So, we generically expect this kind of phase diagram. So, the question So, the question we started to ask is that, okay, so we now know without having done a whole lot of work, just staring at some pictures and borrowing tools from kids, which I love to do, we got pretty far. And then we started to ask, so what would it be like to go away from this exact one we're dealing? Can we think about deviating in charge? And that's when Dan joined Cornell. Cornell, and she was busy telling her about look, there is this thing that I'm really excited about. She stared at it for a while, and a couple days later, she comes back to me and says, Una, there's really interesting fractional excitations here. And really emphasizing then, she spoke to the dog doctor. So I would say that, you know, she's really got everything one needs to be successful as a woman theorist, and really excited to have. And really excited to have been able to work with them. So it was then who observed that these states, when you dope it, you would have fractionalization. So I talked about two different states with UVI with V and BigWall. I'm going to focus on BigWall because there is more interesting sort of situation with Brickwall. When you said that the interaction suppresses interface only at a very low temperature, does it mean that you slightly reason? Does it mean that you slightly raise the temperature, the problem becomes extremely cost mode? Oh, so okay. So, first of all, everything I'm doing right now is classical. I'm looking at strong coupling limit, so I am considering I don't have any hopping effect. But the degeneracy that I went through really quickly came from only taking the leading interaction type into account. Interaction term into account. The leading interaction term was: please do not overlap any lobes of my fidget spinners. And that's where the degeneracy came from. But there are other interaction terms that are weaker than that leading term. And once you add those additional interactions, degeneracy that was extensive gets lifted to some degree. But does it mean that the slightly higher temperature dominates the temperature? Yes, right, right, exactly. Yes, yes, exactly. Right, exactly, yes, yes, exactly, yeah, yeah. So although this was observation of classical grounds day, when we did the simulation, we realized this would be actually observable, you know, at finite temperature, even when the degeneracy lifting effects are present. So we started from thinking about just the leading interaction term, which gives us this extensive degeneracy. And then we noticed that, of course, there are other Notice that, of course, there are other terms which is going to break degeneracy. Nature does not like degeneracy. However, that sub-dominant interactive term is small, and when you look at the temperature scale below which that sub-dominant term breaking that degeneracy will be visible, it was obvious the scale associated with the interaction. Okay, but entropy of the small. The entropy of the small will be if you're in the intermediate scale, it will be very large. Yes, exactly, yes. Large entropy, yes, exactly, yeah, yeah. And we were asking questions about entropy because around the time we were working on this, which was sort of in the middle of COVID, there was a lot of discussion about entropy. But this is one way to observe this kind of phenomenon. So this brick wall stay, unlike the root 3-5. State, unlike the root 3 by root 3 state, has some extensive degeneracy. This is Google's because each of these fricts have two ways of slanting. That's one way, it's another way. So there's sub-extensive degeneracy. And now we can think about fractionalization of charge. So here we introduced one full electron. Full electron lifted, taken out, that's a hole. And that one hole is actually, you can think of this one full hole as consisting of three pieces. And this fractionalization is really to introduce charge third domain wall between two ways of slanting, just like in the SSH model. So here is a So here is a sort of animation of how you're taking one hole into charge two-thirds and charge one-third object that can move apart from each other. And this moving is coming by, it's a result of changing the domain wall configuration. Now when you have this kind of fractionalization, you have to ask whether these fractional objects are confined or not. What is the energy cost that depends on the separation between the two? What was really exciting was to find out that these charges are actually not confined. There is finite energy cost, but it doesn't grow with the separation. Another thing that we observed, so this was the moment that Den got really excited and ran into my office. She said, you know, our fractional charge have restricted mobility. So it's not just any old fractional charge, it's a fractional charge with. Charge. It's a fractional charge with restricted mobility. Here you can see how this fractionalization involves the two-thirds and one-third charge moving away from each other, but only along the line, because each line sort of gives us two-street vertebrae kind of situation. And this kind of restricted mobility is something that's been interesting in the context of fractons. So fractons is a notion that Is a notion that various people have thought hard about as a way of thinking about a new type of fractionalization. And it's been considered in detail in exactly solvable models in 3D. There's been also some observations about how we can understand the rectum physics in connections with elasticity theory. But all these kind of models that's been These kind of models that's been thought about are out of reach of experimental setting. And in the elasticity theory context, although these kind of lattice defects are obviously occurring in solid state systems, we don't know exactly how to control them. So the fact that there is a possibility of observing line on light having 1D restricted mobility rationally charged the excitation. Charged the excitation got us really excited. Then we have also started asking the question of what is the effect of quantum fluctuation. So up until now, everything that I've talked about was restricted to strong coupling limit, classical physics. But now we can ask what would be the effect of quantum fluctuation. And then there is a whole richness of the history and literature on thinking about quantum effects in geometrically frustrated spin systems. Frustrated spin systems. So we sort of draw lessons from some of those ideas, but everything becomes new and different because we have a very new object, this digits in a binary orbitals. In order to think about the quantum phases, we have to think about what are the so-called flippable configurations that are satisfying the load that you've constrained. And Dan has figured out how to think about these operators. And it's a big object. A big object, and a multi-size big object, but this is the smallest unit that we can flip and introduce through dynamics. And that would be one way to approach this effect of hopping. And we're right now trying to see whether this kind of operator can be really meaningfully envisioned by borrowing the By borrowing the tools that's been developed for rust-based fin systems. But this is at the moment sort of more the realm of theorists, imagination, and fun. But what's getting us really excited is that this is a sort of a summary of different fractionalization possibilities. Consider root 3 by root 3 has one-third charge. One third charge excitation that is not mobile. And brick wall has linon, a linear only moving in sub-dimensional one k. And then quantum laminous case solid is what we, one of the possibilities of effects of quantum fluctuation. You can find more details in this PRL that was just accepted. But what got us really excited is that this state that we started imagining. We started imagining in the middle of COVID seems to be potentially really occurring in experiment. So, first, this is a part of data that was presented in this paper, which was really, the paper itself was focusing on fractional trend insulator, which would amount to these red lines having a slope. But when we were looking at that paper, we realized: hey, what about this straight line? Straight line means Straight line means this is not breaking cannabis in symmetry. Now, this was at magic angle. Magic angle, as we've heard, has a lot of richness, yes? So could you go back to the defective model? Uh-huh. So the interacting, that's an interacting model, right? Yes, right, right, right, right. So can that be understood as some sort of interacting base reserve McDonald model, but for one-third fitting for One-third fitting, projected to the incompressible sector. You satisfy this. Yes, yes. Yes. And for that thing, it turns out to be a good model to find the hyperactive. Right, yeah. So the way BM model enters is that we use BM model to BM model gives us the Banny orbitals, right? So Bannier orbitals that we're using, the fidget spinners are consistent with. Using the visual spinners that are consistent with model. And what we do is we take that binary orbitals and think about the partial filling in the strong coupling limit. And that gives us the incompressible state. And then we ask, now if I'm starting from that strong coupling limit and try to add a little bit of hot ink, I will want to stay within that space. But if I can have... But if I can have hopping effect that allows me to connect between different states that are within that constrained Hilbert space, those hopping effects will be amplified. That's the so-called resonance. So this operator, this lemnis gate operator, this operator is the smallest operator that we could build out of a consecutive hopping that That leaves us in a state that is within the constraints of response. And the ground state is definitely not some hard resonance. No. And how good is this approximation? Because in practice, I guess you all have a little bit of compassibility. Right, right. So how good is this approximation? It's an experimental question, right? From my perspective, it's an experimental question. Because I can make whatever approximation, and I can Approximation, and I can have wonderful imagination, but ultimately, as a physicist, my validity comes from experiment. So, can I move on to I have a classical fine question. What is about experiment? So, where does the value and spin degree of freedom go? Are you doing a spinless and validist model? So, the model up to now was spinless and validous. But experiment has been invalid. So, you have to take that inflection. So you have to take that influence. Okay. So on the left-hand side is the experiment that actually, it was published after our paper, but they didn't know about our paper. However, we discovered, excavated in their paper, that they had this straight line. They do talk about it as harsh as weight. But this is the experiment that occurred after. Occurred after our prediction, or rather, when Dan gave her March meeting talk, Gennie happened to have watched Dan's March meeting talk and then called us up saying, hey, we think we have what you're talking about. So why did Jeannie think what she has what we've been talking about? So this is data, and this is away from magic angle. And what we've observed is that, in collaboration with Ginny and Mark, is that at Mark is that at magic angle there's a lot going on, and this could be happening, but there are a lot of other things. This definitely does occur, but there being so much going on makes it hard to focus on just the one-third feeling. But when you go away from magic angle, this is 1.3 degree, we've also seen it at 1.5 degree, the only thing that is really visible are this one-third filling. Are this one-third filling? So minus 8/3rd, minus 4 third, 4 thirds, 8 thirds. And this got us really excited. But it also means, as Lev mentioned, now we have to think about spin and valley. Yes, yes. All those states are very cold. So these are this conductivity, right? As a function of temperature, I think this is conductivity. So, I have a question on the previous slide. So, I mean, at 3 plus 1/3, like you can't think of a charge density wave in momentum space where you just fold the bands and fold the bands. What is the difference? Right. So, um when you fold a band and get charged in a C wave starting from momentum space, it is very hard to make it commensurate with the lattice. Make it commensurate with the lattice. You have to really engineer it. Well, but in this system, there is. So hold around M. That would be. You still have to engineer it. Because in momentum space, you know nothing about lattice. There is nothing special about convention building in momentum space. Well, M point is special. M and K points are special. So two and three, like half and third, are special. So this is from my discussions with Patrick, who With Patrick, who did talk about charge sensitivity wave origin in the paper with Omir Yakovi. And he admitted that it requires fine-tuning and engineering. And it's actually discussed in the paper. Now, just from the measurement, we cannot, just observing one-third filling does not obviously prove that this cannot be from momentum space picture. But when you see commensurate filling, Well, when you see commensurate filling, it is more natural to think from position space. And here we have a very simple way to start from thinking, thinking from position space, which is what we thought. Yes? It's hard for me to tell, but is there an insulator at minus 2 at this angle? It's very weak. Minus 2 is weak. So here, this shows better. So at 2, the plus 2, maybe. Maybe minus two is kind of hard to tell. I see. So minus eight-thirds is much stronger than minus two. Yeah. So this third feeling is just the strongest thing here at this angle. One-third, 1.3-degree and 1.5 degree at this away from magic angle. This third states are most robust. Okay, so actually, we have. So actually, I can I have more, you know, we have, so we did think about Spin and Valley. There are, there's this eight thirds and four thirds respond to inflame field differently. And in thinking through how eight thirds and four thirds are responding to inflame field, we were able to sort of make sense out of those phenomena by taking speed and value degree of freedom into account and also how the banner. Vaneurization sort of changed the extent at 13. What was kind of nice is that this fidget spinner vaneurization picture is not restricted to magic angle. Of course, projecting to this flattish band is as you make the angle go away from magic angle, it is less robust. However, we are really using We are really using very simple qualitative observations, and it allows us to study angles away from magic angle. So, that's been the fun of this project, and that's what we've found to be sort of a novel effect of twisted hydrographing, allowing us to think about geometric effects associated with orbitals. Now, I want to stitch gears and talk about twisted transfer metal that you're. Twisted transient metal detrogenides, where physics becomes quite different, at least from the model perspective, because now we are going to talk about extended interaction, not from sort of orbital perspective, because TMDs allow exponentially localized linearization, but rather from just the straight str um screen Coulomb interaction with weak effects of screening due to low density. Due to low density. So at integer filling, at half filling, that is one electron per site, this is what we've studied and found that effective further range interaction for a little while actually further strengthen this intermediate hyerosphin liquid phase. But now we wanted to extend. Now we wanted to extend this kind of study to a fractional building, one-third building. And this is in collaboration with. A header bilayer. Yes, header by layer. Yeah. This is in collaboration with my student Xing Zhao and Lana Cheng. So the half-filling study is in this paper, and this one-third filling study is in preparation. It's been in preparation for a while because each In preparation for a while because each really wanted to make sure the magnetism results are correct. And this is all DMRG, DMRG for a large system, which allows for the charge order is actually quite challenging. So this is hiter TMD, and this is more due to lattice missiles without twisting. And we ask because of the low-range interaction, there is a charge order possibility. Contraction, there is a charge order possibility. There's obviously magnetism possibilities, and there is frustration. There's also the fact that kinetic mechanism, as Phi talked about, is ferromagnetic, and exchange mechanism is anti-ferromagnetic. So there are all these things. And we wanted to ask what kind of states, symmetry-broken or non-broken states, are possible as a result of interaction. So this is the Hamiltonian. So, this is the Hamiltonian, there is the hopping, and now we can really talk about particle hopping on a triangular lattice. There's on-site interaction, but there's also further range interaction, and this further range interaction is modeled from the geometry of this double-gated geometry. Now, the kinetic energy would want to give you fermiliquid on a side interaction plus kinetic energy only would promote anti-ferromagnetic interaction due to Due to exchange, and the further range interaction will promote charge order. So, how is it going to all play out? Like in the previous part, if you just think about the classical limit, you can do multiparallel simulation. And we found in this paper that different types of commensurate order states are possible, and in between there can be sort of intermediate bases. Intermediate basis. And especially at one-third filling, we expect the W3 value 3 state from strong coupling limit. But we wanted to know what happens if we look at the product fluctuation effect, which we studied with DMRG. So this, in the half-filling, this was the phase diagram. There is a pyrrol spin-liquid phase. And in one-third filling, it becomes pipe-lippling. So, before we started working on this, there were other studies. First of all, there is this experiment showing in the flatband limit, very flatband limit, root 3 by root 3 charge order. And there were part 3 fault calculations, exact diagonalization calculations, unfield theoretic treatment, and there have been different answers. So, to the option, To the upshot, we found direct transition between Fermi fluid and charge-order state. It seems to be first-order transition, and this charge-order state seems to have long-range magnetic order. So, how do we know we have what happens to different observations? Well, first of all, we can observe that Fermi surface is sort of disappearing into the Disappearing into the insulating state, which is assessed by measuring this residue. And also look at the density, one particle density operator, and that's how we assess the residue change. The charge order can be observed by just looking at the charge order parameter, the structure factor, and there are peaks. And this is a result of this commensurate filling. And you can see just that this is an abrupt development of the ordering, which makes it really look like a first order transition. The charge order develops at the same point where the Fermi surface disappears. We do not have the measurement of the gap because. The measurement of the gap because that it was very hard to get the gap calculation to converge. But these observations are pretty compelling that we have a first-order base transition from Fermi-liquid to charge order. Magnetism. This took us a long time to sort out correctly. It's a hard calculation. But at the end of the day, what we are finding is that there is a power law decay in speed correlation, as you can see from this model plot. As you can see from this long plot. And spin structure vector here in the strongly interacting limit shows peaks that are consistent with root 3 by root 3 configuration. So the summary is that for one-third field TMD gray system, a hetero-timping gray system, we are predicting a direct We are predicting a direct transition between Fermi fluid and charge order state with 120 degree anti-ferromagnetic order. So that's sort of the contrast between half filling and one-third filling. And that's the end of my talk. Yeah, I wanted to go back about this one third. So there was TBG? Yes. So at McRaker had some DMRG.
