So first talk will be an online talk by Xuan Xiao about non-invertible symmetries and sensor networks. So you can hear us and we can hear you. Yeah, I can hear you. Can you guys hear me well? Yes, you can hear you very well. Okay, great. So please go ahead. All right, thank you so much. First, I would like to thank the organizers for giving me the opportunity to talk here. I'm sorry, I couldn't go to BAMF to join you guys. To join you guys, it's always tricky to give a Zoom talk. It's hard to read the room if you are not really in the room. So, please feel free to interrupt me anytime with questions that will make the talk more fun, more lively. All right. And I understand this is more of a QI meeting and conference. So, the topic I'm going to talk about probably will be rather foreign to most of the people in the audience. The people in the audience. So, I'll try to cover some of the simplest examples and to introduce some of the new developments that have been happening in quantum surgery and condensed matter system in recent years. All right, let's go. So the talk will be mostly based on these three papers I listed here with my wonderful collaborator. The first half of the talk will be based on these two. talk will be based on these two written with nati zeiberg and sahan safanashri from ias and the third one which is more about tensor network was written with pranay gorentila and nat from caltech as the title suggests the talk today is about a new kind of global symmetry known as non-invertible symmetry the name sounds very weird indeed conventional global symmetries as we know them are described As we know them, are described by group theory. This is established by Wigner's theorem in quantum mechanics, which says that every symmetry operator in quantum mechanics is generated by either a unitary operator or an anti-unitary operator. A very basic property of unitary operator u is that take the dagger of that operator u, you get its inverse. So every unitary operator or n unitary operator. Operator or operator by definition have an inverse, and together they form a group. And indeed, every group element has an inverse. In recent years, there has been a lot of development in a new kind of symmetry, which goes under the name of non-invertible symmetry. The applications in quantum field theory, in particle physics, such as axiom physics, in many body quantum systems. In many body quantum systems, in quantum gravity and string theory, and also in mathematical physics. As the name suggests, they are implemented by conserved operators that do not have inverses. Concretely, you can think about having a Hamiltonian lattice model, and there are some operators that commute with the Hamiltonian. That's why I meant that the operator is conserved. It's conserved under time evolution. However, it's an operator that doesn't have an inverse. That doesn't have an inverse, it has zero eigenvalues, and it also cannot be written in terms of conserved operators that do have inverses. Even though this sounds weird, these symmetries lead to new conservation laws, new selection rules in scattering amplitudes, new constraints on renormalization group flows that teach us something new about confinement and work applications. Now, at this point, you might think this symmetry is so weird, and maybe it only Maybe only of interest to string theories who work with a lot of supersymmetries in 11th space-time dimensions. But actually, you don't have to look very far for the simplest possible example of such symmetry. Already in the one plus one D-ponton Ising lattice, there is one such non-invertible symmetry, which I'm going to present to you. And I'm sure almost all of you have some form. Some form of this non-invertible symmetry in the past, perhaps not presented in this precise way. So, at the first part of my talk, I'm going to set up the stage by introducing this non-invertible symmetry in the Ising model, raising some of the well-known phenomena in this new language, and then we will go from there to get a new result. So, the setup, as shown on the screen, is a periodic. Is a periodic spin chain with L side. On every side, we have a qubit labeled by J running from one to L. And I identify J with J plus L. Now on every side, I have a two-dimensional qubit Hilbert space, so the total Hilbert space is two to the L dimensional. For most of the thing I'm going to say, it's going to hold true for finite L. So if you get so bored with the talk, you are welcome to take up your Mathematica. To take up your Mathematica and code everything, every operator into the Mathematica, and they're just going to be some 2 to the L by 2 to the L matrices. The Hamiltonian is the familiar transverse federalizing Hamiltonian. You have a sum over x and sum over z's. Sun over z, z's, by mistake. And there's a parameter in the Hamiltonian G. Now here, let me just remind you: poly x, this is the poly x, this is the polything. This is the polling thing. Now, the reason we consider this simple Hamiltonian, as everyone knows, is that at the generic value of g, there are two symmetries we talk about. The first one is the spin-flip symmetry that flip the spin of the qubit on every side. So, here I take it to be the product of the poly x. You flip the sign of the polyz, but keep the poly x invariant. So, you flip all the spin from up to down. Flip all the spin from up to down. And because of these symmetries, we allow linear turning x, but the turns involving z have to be quadratic. And also, we impose lattice translation, which is shift every operator by one site. And imposing these two symmetries, which I promise you are going to be invertible throughout the talk, this is the leading simplest homotomy you can write down. The phase diagram, of course, is well known. The phase diagram, of course, is well known as a function of g. When g is very small, you look at the second term dominate and you diagonalize the spins in the z basis, you get two vacua, and each one of them spontaneously break the z2 spin flip symmetry. If you are a field theorist, it's natural to think about it as a double well scalar potential with two vacuum. This is a symmetry breaking phase, also known as the older phase in condensed matter physics. Face in connection. Alternatively, if you go to very large and positive g, then the first term dominates. Then you diagnolize the state in the x basis with positive eigenvalues. If you now write that state, the O plus state in terms of the Z basis is going to be a sum of all possible spin configurations. In this phase, the symmetry is preserved and it's a disorder phase. And at And at g equals one, that Hamiltonian flows to the Ising conformal field theory, which is a gapless quantum field theory. And this, as everyone knows, is the simplest possible second-order phase transition between the symmetry preserving phase and the symmetry breaking phase. Okay, so so far, everything I said can be found on Wikipedia. I haven't told you anything new. But at this point, But at this point, any question will part. Okay, great. So, the question I would like to ask here is that let's say we sit at the critical point g equals one. This is the Hamiltonian. Is there an additional symmetry of the Hamilton? Now, if you ask someone on the street this question, the answer you're going to find is You're going to find is that, yeah, of course, there's a Cuhrmer's one-year transformation that leaves the Hamiltonian invariant only when the coupling constant g is set to be one. The Querm's one-year transformation takes the poly x to poly z times poly z and zj zj plus 1 to xj plus 1. This transformation, as you can check, preserves the operator algebra. For instance, x squares to 1 on the left. For instance, x squares to one on the left-hand side, and zz also squares to one on the right-hand side. Okay, so that seems to be the answer. But if you ask, but if you question yourself, is it really a symmetry though? Well, you have a Hamiltonian that is invariant under Simpen transformation. What else do you want? What else do you want it to be a symmetry for? And indeed, if you go back and look at the 1941. Can look at the 1941 paper by Kremers and Wanier. In the abstract, they did call it a symmetry property of the IC bottom. Kremers and Wanier were smart people, so we should probably follow their terminology and calling this a symmetry. But suppose the person you asked on the street about this question were Wigner. Then Wigner would ask, is this transformation implemented by Transformation implemented by a unitary operator, as my theory in quantum mechanics would dictate. But the answer is going to be no. There's not going to be a unitary operator that implements the query's one-year transformation in this setup. And this can be shown in a two-line proof. So bear with me. I'm going to walk you through the details. So suppose we're going to So, suppose we're going to prove it by contradiction. So, suppose there were such a unitary operator u that implement this transformation. That makes ux u inverse give you the right-hand side of the transformation. So, going from here, we are going to reach a contradiction. So, the way to reach a contradiction is to consider this transformation on the spin-flip Z2 operator V. Z2 operator V. Let me remind you: V is a product of X. This is a defined Z2 symmetry of the Ising model. This is a non-trivial operator acting on the Hilbert space. V is a product of X, and then you can move the UU inverse action to the individual X, which turns each XJ into a product of these. But since we are on the periodic chain, every Periodic chain, every z appears exactly twice. This z2 cancels with that z2, so on and so on. So at the end of the day, you get one. Now I can multiply this equation on the left by u inverse, on the right by u, and that tells you the z2 spin flip operator v, which defines the Ising model, is a trivial operator. But that, of course, is a contradiction. So we have proven that the Quermier-Weynier transformation cannot possibly be a problem. The Quirmer's one year transformation cannot possibly be implemented by a unitary operator. And this is the simplest possible example of a symmetry transformation of a Hamiltonian that goes beyond the paradigm set by Wigner theorem. Any question at this point? So, if there's any lesson to be learned from this very short proof, is that in physics, we should never write arrows. We should never write arrows. When you write arrows, you don't know what you are talking about. We should really try to provide the equality behind all these arrows. So, the next question we would like to ask, what do we actually mean by these arrows when we write down the query merch-wigner transformation? And this was the question we approached in this paper from 2023. So, I'm going to present you the answer. The answer. I'm not going to give you the details of the derivation. There are several different ways to get to the answer. So, the answer is going to look like this. I'm going to define an operator D that take this rather complicated form. I'm going to walk you through the details. Well, walk you through the important aspect of this operator. The details don't really matter. And I'm going to tell you what this operator does. First of all, there's a First of all, there's a gray fact, which you don't have to pay too much attention to. That's just a normalization that will make some of the formulas below easier. There's a root 2 that has something to do with the Marana zero mode in the Kitaev chain, but I won't be able to explain that connection here today. There's a phase factor with an interesting factor of eight, which actually has something to do with the critical space-time dimension of superstring theory. Dimension of superstring theory. But for now, let's just take it as a normalization. So, modulo this gray factor that I ask you to ignore. This operator comes with two pieces. The blue piece is a product of local unitary operator that you can easily check. Every single local factor here is a unitary. And the product of unitary is going to be a unitary as well. And then there's a red. This V, let me remind you. This V, let me remind you, is a product of X. That's a spin-flip symmetry. So, if you take the combination of one plus that operator, this is going to be a projection operator. So, the blue piece is a unitary operator that denotes by u sub kw. It's actually a sequential quantum circuit, as you can see. In the first step, you multiply the x from here, and then zz. Here, and then ZZ, and so on and so on. It's not the finite depth circuit, it scales linear in the system size, but it's not a generic linear depth circuit. Sequential in the sense that at every step, you only have a box that involves two sites. And this sequential linear circuit was recently discussed in this paper by Zhe Chen and collaborators in connection with gap phases. With gap phases on the spin chain, in many body on the system. The second piece is a projection. And as we all know, projection has a big zero, has a big kernel. Every state that has minus one eigenvalue under the spin-flip symmetry will evaluate to zero under the projection. So this operator, even though it looks complicated, at the end of the day, it boils down to some 2 to the L by 2 to the L. To some 2 to the L by 2 to the L matrix. And this matrix has a huge kernel. It has a lot of zero eigenvalues, and in that sense, it's a non-invertible matrix. So why do we care about this operator or this matrix to be less fancy? This operator is the equalities behind the arrows that we were puzzled by. It satisfies the following equations for every site j on this closed periodic chain. j on this closed periodic chain. If you try to push the xj through the operator d, on the other side it becomes z times z. And similarly, if you push the zz through the operator d, you get x on the other side. This equation looks very similar to the one we had on the previous slide. This one, ux u inverse equals zz. The only difference is that I didn't dare to move the d to the other side because To the other side, because D doesn't have any inverse. And because of this equality, this operator D commutes with the Hamiltonian precisely at the critical point. And in that sense, this is a conservative operator. And because of that, I'm going to call it a symmetry. One can ask, what's wrong with the unitary operator UKW? I mean, it's a legitimate operator. There's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with that. But you are welcome to check that it actually does not commute with the Hamiltonian. It is invertible for whatever is worth because it's a unitary operator. On the other hand, this non-invertible operator D, it is non-invertible, but it does commute with the Hamiltonian. And in this simple Ising-Lattice model, it seems that you just cannot have it both ways. For it to be a symmetry, the price you pay is non-invertible. Is non-invertible. But I would like to argue that it's really a feature of the problem rather than a bug. Okay, so at this point, I want to emphasize that throughout the entire discussion, I focus myself on a single Hilbert space of L qubit on a closed periodic chain. And this D is really an operator acting on the same Hilbert space. And that's the reason later on we can discuss meaningfully its operator algebra. There has been a lot of There has been a lot of earlier related discussions on formulating the Quermer's wannier transformation, not as an operator acting on the single Hilbert space, but as a map from one Hilbert space to the other. And this is the common perspective taken in the literature, that the Grammar's linear transformation maps the sites to the links, maps the lattice to the dual lattice. If you formulate it that way, then the related map, And the related map rather than operator has appeared many times in the literature, including this beautiful paper by Assen, Fen Li, and Mong from 2016, also this paper by Nath and collaborator, and also this paper by Masaki and collaborators. But here we take a slightly different perspective by restricting to a single Hilbert space. Okay, so now let's summarize what Let's summarize what symmetries we have in the Ising model. We have a lattice translation, we have a spin-flip Z2 symmetry, and we have this rather complicated non-invertible symmetry that implements the Kuhmer's Bohnier transformation. Now, the moment you have all the symmetries at your disposal, the next thing you should do is to start multiplying them. For the spin-flip symmetry, obviously, if you square it, Square it. If you square it, you get back to the identity operator. So, this forms a Z2 group. This is an ordinary symmetry. What happens if we try to square this operator D? It turns out that you get something rather bizarre. You don't get a single object on the right-hand side. Rather, you get a sum of two objects. You get a translation times the product between the spin-flip symmetry and the translation. In group theory, whenever you multiply two groups, In group theory, whenever you multiply two group elements, G1 and G2, you only get a single group element, G3, on the right-hand side. But for non-invertible symmetry, when you square it, you generally get a sum of different operators on the right-hand side. And this highlights the fact that the symmetry is not described by group theory. This algebra has appeared, well, this algebra, as far as I know, first appeared in this paper I wrote with Nati in 2023. Roost Nati in 2023, but part of it has already appeared in the literature. So, for instance, if you erase the translation part, the T operator here, that's the algebra that shows up in the context of non-abelian anions in the Ising topological order. And that's also the algebra that appears in the continuum field theory. On the other hand, if you erase the 1 plus B part, this is the projection. The one plus b part, this is the projection part, then the statement that the query mercillus squares to a lattice translation by one side also appeared long ago in the literature, perhaps even dated back to the paper by Kadanov and Sivan, where they emphasized that Kuhmer's one year transformation should be viewed as a half-lattice translation in the Z2 even symmetric sector. But if you combine the both, this leads to a non-inversible operator of your Invertible operator of your many body pointed system, which squares to the product of these two. For people who are familiar with CFT, as you take the continuum limit, this lattice translation becomes approximately one, and you recover the CFT algebra. Okay. So I told you what the commutation relation between this operator with the poly X and poly Z, but I haven't talked. But I haven't told you its action on the state. So let me make a few comments on this operator. In the paper with Nadi, we derived this operator by first performing a Jordan-Wigner transformation of the Ising model back to the Kitayev chin. And there's a Maharana lattice translation, which leads to this non-invertible symmetry. And it's closely related to the Maharana zero modes and hence the factor of root two. And hence the factor of root 2. Coming back to the Ising model, what this operator does is that it maps the O plus paramagnet state to a GHZ state, and vice versa. The ordinary spin-flip symmetry B will exchange the O-spin up state with the O-spin down state, but this more interesting operator D swap a paramagnet state with a GHD state. And as you can see, the state And as you can see, the states that will be invariant under the non-invertible symmetry will be a linear superposition of the paramagnet state and the GHZ state. Another thing I want to comment about is if you go back to this expression, this expression doesn't look translationally invariant. I start the product of this expression from site number one. And then I stop at site L. And you can see that. And you can see that at the very last site, the expression looks a little bit different from the rest of the site. So this expression doesn't look translationally varied. We work on a closed periodic chain. There is a translation symmetry. But in reality, the product of this blue operator and the red operator turns out to compute with the translation symmetry. So this is an expression of the operator that makes the non-invertibility of the operator manifest. However, it Manifest. However, it obscures the fact that this is actually a translational invariant operator. Now, I'm going to give you a second expression for the operator in terms of a matrix product expression. So the same operator can be written in this MPO form where the MPO tensor take this following expression. The bound dimension is two. That's why here I'm writing a two by two matrix. Matrix. And here, this trace is the trace over the bound dimension. From this MPO expression, it is manifestly translationally invariant. However, the fact that this operator, this MPO, has a kernel is now obscured. So we have two expressions. Neither of them makes all the properties of this non-invertible symmetry manifest. But combining the two expressions, you see all the different aspects of it. see all the different aspects of this MPL. Related operators, I should say, related maps between different Hilbert spaces. We're also discussing these first two very nice references. Okay, so I told you a new operator in the Hamiltonian Ising lattice model. It implements the Quermer's one year transformation. But what is it good for? You know, Ising model is exactly solvable model. We don't want to solve the Ising model for the hundredth time. For the hundredth time. So, what can we learn from this new symmetry? Well, to that end, we have to depart from the Ising model. So, in this very beautiful paper by O'Brien and Paul Fendley back in 2017, they studied this deformation of the Ising model. It's the next two nearest neighboring deformation. First, it preserved the Z2 symmetry because it's even in the poly Z, but you can also easily see that it preserves the Z Z Z Z Z But you can also easily see that it preserved the Quermier's Weinier transformation. Under the Quermus-Weinier transformation, x goes to ZZ, ZZ goes to X, and this turn goes to the next turn, so on and so on. So this is a deformation that preserve both the Z2 and the non-invertible symmetry. And I also put back the coupling G here. If you carry on G, you preserve the Z2, but you break the non-invertible symmetry. So in total, we have a two-dimensional field. So, in total, we have a two-dimensional phase diagram. Along the horizontal axis, both the Z2 symmetry and the non-invertible symmetries are preserved. And they use DMRG to find the following phase diagram. At lambda equals zero, that's the original critical Ising model, which in the low energy is described by the Ising CFT. And there's an open region here where the low energy phase stays at Ising CFT. Ising CFD. And then there's a critical transition where the critical point is given by a tricritical Ising CFD. It's a different CFD with a higher central charge. The central charge for Ising CFD is one half. Tricritical Ising CFD has C equal to 710. After this point, the system becomes GAP. But it's not a trivially GAAP phase. It's a GATT phase with three degenerate ground state. Of course, by degenerate, I mean... Of course, by degenerate, I mean that in the thermodynamic limits, the three states become degenerate. In finite volume, there's a splitting that's exponentially small in the system size. Okay, so that's an interesting phase diagram. What are we supposed to make out of this? You see, along this horizontal axis where the non-invertible symmetry is preserved, the low energy phase is never trivial. Energy phase is never trivial. It's either described by a CFT or it's described by some gap ground state, a gap phase with degenerate ground state. And that smells a lot like the Liebschul-Matias obstruction. And indeed, that's not a coincidence. In this paper, which is closely related to an earlier paper by Michael Levine, it was shown that take any homilian, any Take any Hamiltonian, any finite range Hamiltonian, that commutes with the non-invertible symmetry D. The thermodynamic limit has to be either gapless or gap with the number of ground states being a multiple of three. So the fact that in this particular example, we see a non-trivial phase diagram is actually not a coincidence, but it's a consequence that follows from this non-invertible symmetry. Now, in theoretical physics, we see Now, in theoretical physics, we see a factor of two all the time. Three is perhaps less common. So, how do we understand this three? Well, there's a very simple explanation. If you turn on this G-coupling constant, on one side you reach a disorder phase with one ground state. On the other side, you reach a older phase with two ground states. The presence of the non-invertible symmetry implies that older and disorder coexist. Indeed, that's the picture. Exist. Indeed, that's the picture I was drawing here. The non-invertible symmetry exchanges a disorder phase with the older phase. And the state that's invariant under the non-invertible symmetry is a superposition of the disorder paramagnet phase with the older GHZ state. Such an older disorder coexistent phase could either be a conformal field theory or it could be a gap phase, a first order transition between First order transition between these two phases. And the last time I checked, one plus two is three, and that's where the three comes from. So you can view this as a Leap Schultz Matias constraint, but not coming from an ordinary symmetry, but from a non-imperturbal symmetry. So this gives you some non-perturbative constraints on the phase diagram for many body points. This is one application. All right, so now I'm going to move on to the second part of. I'm going to move on to the second part of the talk, where we're going to generalize this story to higher dimensions, in particular to Tori coding 3 plus 1d. So the Hamiltonian we're going to talk about is the Tori code Hamiltonian with a transverse field. So we're going to work on a three-dimensional spatial cubic lattice. There are two kinds of turns in the Tori code. The first is a platet turns of disease, and the second is a star turns. And the second is the star turns of the x. We're also going to add a transverse field x on every link. In fact, for the following discussion, it's more important that we have a transverse field, whereas the star term plays less a role. So that's why I put it in gray. So don't put too much attention on the star term. The heroes of the story were going to be these two terms. In the 70s, Wagner asked himself the following question. Ask himself the following question. He asked himself, Well, there's a beautiful story of Kramer's one-year duality for the one plus one d-I-Cing model. What's the most natural generalization of that story when we go to higher dimension? And he realized that the simplest generalization is actually a duality transformation written here in the 3 plus 1d Z2 gauge theorem, which is equivalent to Tori code with a transverse field. Now, this transformation maps. Now, this transformation maps a single x on the link to a product of z around a plaquette that's shifted from the original link by a diagonal half-lattice translation. You should view this transformation as the 3 plus 1D generalization of the one-in-the-IC model. You start with x on the site. You do the Kuhner's one-year transformation. You obtain a pair of Z on the link. Here, you start with X on the Here, you start with x on the link. You do the Wectner transformation, you get a product of Z on the plaquette that's half lattice translated from the original link. Similarly, when you apply the Wagner transformation on the product of Z, you get X. This Wagner transformation leaves the 3 plus 1 detori code Hamiltonian invariant precisely when the coupling constant G is 1. It's very similar to the story of the Very similar to the story of the query's wagner duality of the critical Ising model. So now you can ask: is there an operator, a non-invertible operator, that implements this Wechnier transformation? It turns out to be difficult to write down an expression in terms of the sequential quantum circuit in 3 plus 1d. But with the help of cancer network, we can give a convenient and uniform expression for this outbreak. So I'm going to quickly go over Zx calculus. Over Zx calculus. So I'm going to first write the Kramer's one year operator in terms of Zx calculus and generalize that to the vector transformation. So Zx, most, the two ingredients, the three ingredients of the Zx calculus are known as the green spider and the red spiders. And these are graphical presentations of such tensors. And the yellow box is the Hadamard box. In this language, In this language, the polyz and polyx is represented by a green and red dot with a phase pi. More generally, the phase alpha enters into the relative phase factor in the definition. And there are various rules that you can manipulate with the ZX diagram. All these rules leave the actual operator or tensor network invariant, and they can use. invariant and they can use can be used to simplify the presentation of the tensor network. I'm not going to go over all the rules. There's a beautiful review here that explain and derive all the rules. Okay, with this lightening review, let's go back to the non-invertible operator in the Ising model. In the Ising model, we have already talked about two presentations for the non-invertible query's one near operator, one in terms of this. one in terms of this, one in terms of the sequential circuit, the other in terms of the matrix product operator. But if you write it in terms of the zx diagram, it takes this very simple form. Now, equipped with this presentation of the Kuhrman-Wanner operator, we immediately find a generalization to the 3 plus 1 detorio code with a transverse field. So the operator takes this complicated projected entangle pair. Entangled pair product operator. It's a pepo. So it's a higher degeneralization of the MPO here. In the paper, we work out the operator algebra obeyed by this non-invertible vector operator. It has a very interesting interplay with the membrane operator in the Tori code. In 3 plus 1D Tori code, the logical operators are the string operator and the membrane operator. String operator and the membrane operators. And this operator has a close connection with them. In 1 plus 1D, we saw that the Puerris one-year operator exchanges a paramagnet disorder phase with a GHC state. In 3 plus 1D, the corresponding non-invertible operator exchanges a paramagnet O plus state with a Tori co-ground state, and vice versa. So, this is, you can view this non-invertible operator. This non-invertible operator as an operator that creates a torical ground state from the product state. Okay, so in this paper, we further generalize this non-invertible operator to any generalized ising-like Hamiltonian that's based on a tenor graph. Put differently, given any classical LDPC code, we can associate a corresponding non-invariant. A corresponding non-invertible operator that implements some transformation that takes a poly x to some product of z. And this cover a lot of examples, including 1 plus 1 d ising model, 3 plus 1 d to code. There are also examples involving 2 plus 1 dtori code coupled to ising matter field, and also the cluster model. So I think I'm almost running out of time. So, in the last few minutes, let me just say that. Few minutes, let me just say that beyond lattice models, there are also many other applications that might be a little bit foreign to the audience here, but let me just quickly go over them. In this paper, we also use non-invertible symmetry to give a reinterpretation of the pion decay in the real world. This is with these two collaborators. And we also talk about time-reversal symmetry and strong CP problem in high-energy physics in a follow-up paper. Of paper. There are also applications to axion physics. Axion is a promising candidate for dark matter in our universe. And the non-invertible symmetries in the axion physics give you some constraints on the axiom photon decay rate. Perhaps more related to this conference, in this other paper with Sahan Sef Nashri, we constructed a new kind of asymmetry protected topological phase, but now the symmetry. Topological phase, but now the symmetry is a non-invertible symmetry. In particular, we realized that the ordinary 1 plus 1d z2 z2 cluster state is a non-invertible SPT. And we found robust edge modes protected by non-invertible symmetries. Finally, in a recent paper with two excellent students from MIT, we find new lattice chiral symmetry guided by non-invertible symmetries. There's an interesting analog of this. There's an interesting analog of this whole story in quantum field theory, especially in three plus one dimensional quantum electrodynamics. That's the same QED studied by Schringer, Feynman, and Dyson. It turns out that the real-world QED in the massless electron limit has an exact non-inversible global symmetry. The operator takes this complicated form. You don't have to know anything about this operator. Let me just say in words. Let me just say in words that this red part is actually the path integral for a fractional quantum whole state. So the slogan there is somehow the fractional quantum whole state cures certain anomaly in QED and give rise to a non-invertible symmetry. The details of this operator doesn't matter, but let me just highlight that it also consists of an invertible part. This operator is an exponential of something, so it looks invertible. Something so it looks invertible. It's an invertible operator, but it's not conserved. Multiplied by something that's non-invertible, but conserved. This exact non-invertible symmetry explains the helicity conservation. It's a special kind of conservation law in the electron-positron scattering process in the real world. And if you remember, this operator actually has a lot of resemblance with the Quermars-Weinier operator we just discussed in the first part. Operator, we just discussed in the first part of the talk. They both consist of an invertible but not conserved part, which is the unitary sequential content circuit, and a non-invertible but conserved quantity, which in the Quermer's one-year case is the projection operator. Of course, these are two different, very different systems, one plus one D eigen lattice model versus the continuum three plus one D QED, but somehow it's the symmetries that unify this. Symmetries that unify this two content system into a unifying framework. All right, so that's basically everything I want to say. Lastly, I just want to say that more generally, there's an active community of people working on generalized symmetries. It touches upon many different fields, quantum field theory, quantum condensed matter physics, quantum information, string theory, particle physics, mathematics. There are a lot of Simon's collaborations that have. Of Simon's collaborations that have overlapped with this endeavor. There are also a lot of activities, including summer schools and workshops that has happened, that has been going on since two years ago. And for those of you who are interested in this subject, you can watch some of the lectures I gave at these three summer schools. These two are more kind of smattering quantum information focused. And in the starting from In the starting from March to May, this spring, we will have a KITP workshop on generalized symmetries. And with that, I thank you for your attention. Thank you. Eric? Yeah, can you hear me? I just have a quick question. Can you say anything about boundary conditions? You're always assuming figuring boundary conditions. You're always assuming the boundary conditions. Excellent question. I can say a lot about boundary condition. In fact, I wrote a whole paper about boundary condition. So, coming back to the Quemmer's Weiner transformation, so you can say, oh, you know, I gave the whole talk on a periodic closed chin. What if you work on an open chin? Then what would I have to say? The thing is that if you do Cohemer's one-year transformation, let's go back to this ambiguous equation. If you do Cohemer's one-year transformation, If you do Cruemer's one year transformation twice, you take xj to xj plus one. But on the open chain, you don't have lattice translation symmetry. So this transformation wouldn't even leave the Hamiltonian on the open chain invariant in the first place. So I would not be motivated to talk about what's the operator behind such transformation in the first place on open chain. Put it more invariantly. On the closed chain, there is a non-invertible operator that commutes with. Non-invertible operator that commutes with the Hamiltonian. And this symmetry, this non-invertible symmetry, is broken by any sensible boundary condition you can write down in the Ising's model. And more generally, it's an interesting question to ask. If you start with a closed periodic chain with certain invertible or non-invertible global symmetry, is there any boundary condition that preserves these symmetries? For this particular question, For this particular Quermus-Wennyer symmetry, there's no boundary condition preserving it, just because it mixes with lattice translation. But there are more interesting non-invertible symmetry where there are boundary condition preserving it, such as the one I alluded to in this paper on the cluster state. And for those non-invertible symmetries that is compatible with certain boundary condition, you can start talking about edge modes protected by the non-invertible symmetry. About by the null imprint of so much. Okay, so, but for instance, with the phase diagram that you showed with the deformation of this chain, if we did that phase diagram with open boundary conditions, then I think a lot will change. For instance, the three will definitely change. And it is possible, which I didn't check, that you might get a region where the ground state might be non-degenerate on an open chip. Generate download open chip. So, indeed, this space diagram, we are making statements about the closed periodic boundary component, where the symmetry is there. Any other questions? Right, let's thank the speaker again. Thank you. Move on to the next. Move on to the next talk.
