with G H prime is distributed according to P of F prime, endowed with G prime, then we want that the random variable H is in law the same as the pullback of H prime with respect to this symmetry. So this is some of our wish list. And yeah, so why and where does this come from? So for this let me go to two-dimensional Me go to the two-dimensional case. So let's assume that now with g prime is a closed-orientable surface. Then we have the uniformization theorem. And the uniformization theorem tells you that this manifold is basically one of the three types. So the three types are mentioned here. So it could be the sphere. So, it could be the sphere, or it could be the Euclidean plane, or it could be the hyperbolic. So, essentially, you need only, if this conformal changes, you only need to consider three types of manifolds. And now, what you want to consider is a random surface, so to speak. So, now you want to draw a random phi, so phi as a function of a manifold, draw, with respect to some probability measure. Measure and you consider now the conformal change with this random phi. And this is now then called G prime. And so a particular case of this would be the Liobil quantum gravity. So phi would then be gamma times h, where gamma is some parameter and h is a Gaussian phi. And h is a Cauchy free field. But there's a problem in this way of saying this: namely, that h is not a random function. So h is not a Gaussian frequency, it's basically a distribution. Okay, so yeah. So maybe let me briefly tell you something about Bausian free fields. So, what is a Gaussian field? So, what is a Gaussian prefield? It's a collection of standard Gaussian RAM variables, h tested against phi, where phi could be infinity or let's take here h1, so we only need h1, with a covariance structure given by the Divisionly energy. So, if we compute the covariance of the random variables h tested against phi and h tested against psi, then this is the same as computing the inc. then this is the same as computing the integral of gradient phi times gradient sine. This is Bautian free field. And this can be seen as a generalization of Brownian motion to the two-dimensional. So Brownian motion is now a process defined on R and now you have a field, so it's defined in the two dimensions. It's defined at the two dimensions. It goes in some sense from two dimensions to R. But with the difference that the Bronic motion you can evaluate at the time point, and the Gaussian free field you cannot evaluate at a space point. And in some way, so the Brownian motion, this gives you a random path. And now the Gaussian free field gives you a random surface uniformization theorem. Uniformization theorem. And what is crucial here is the conformal invariance of the Dirich energy. So if you consider the Dirichlet energy, which comes from this covariance structure, and you make a conformal change of your metric, then the Dilichni energy remains the same. Remains the same. So it's the Dioschi energy as conformal invariants. So this is an interesting feature here of the Gaussian free field. And so let me say a little bit now about this Lyrial quantum gravity. So what is the goal of the Lyrial quantum gravity is to find canonical random surfaces. So as similar for the Browning motion. Similar for the Brownian motion, so the Brownian motion gives you a canonical random path. Now, the city of recurring gravity will give you a canonical random surface. And this has been introduced by Polyakov in the 80s in the setting of bosonic strength theory. So, for the Browning motion, you have a point, and the point is now moving randomly in space, and this gives you this Browning curve. This Brownian curve, and now in the setting of the string theory, we have not an initial one-dimensional object as a point, but you have strings, which is a two-dimensional object. And this string moves now randomly in time, which swipes out in space-time the surface. So this is roughly the idea. But the problem here is now that contrast to the Brony motion, which makes sense evaluated at different time points. Different time points, the Gaussian free field is much more worse behavior. So it behaves much worse. So this definition of this conformal change with the Gaussian free field, this doesn't make sense, since age is a distribution and not a function. That's why you cannot evaluate at your points. Okay, so how can we understand this then? So what what what is then the renewable So, what is then the new quantum gravity? And there are several answers. So, one answer comes from Miller and Sheffield from 21. For the particular case where gamma is equal to the square root of 8 divided by 3, then it can be shown that the level quantum gravity is the scaling limit of uniform random planar maps. This is also resembling the This is also resembling the Brownian motion case. Brownian motion you can also approximate by simple random box, and here you take these uniform random planar maps. And this has to do with the work by Le Gaulle and independently also by Mirmont, namely firstly, the scaling limit of uniform random planar maps is the Brownian map, and Miller and Shen. And Miller and Sheffield showed that in this particular case they can assign a geometry to the Lyroparticle gravity, and this is asymmetric to the Browning maximum. So the Browning market also has a metric structure. Okay, what else can be done? Maybe it's difficult to speak about metrics, but maybe we have some volume, some area measure on this object. And there's quite some research which goes back to the work by Cahan from the 80s concerning the multiplicative model chaos and also by Beth Bartil and Scheffel, Bold and Wagners and Sharmoff. They constructed an area measure for gamma in the range between zero and two, the two, the so-called neural quantum gravity measure. So roughly speaking, And roughly speaking, you can view this as just the volume measure associated to your conformal change of your original metric. But still, okay, this doesn't make sense, right? So you have to make sense of this object, and this can be done by subtracting the variance and considering an approximating sequence of each. Okay, and now concerning the metric, and some of you already know, okay, there's some metric in this particular case, but also later it was found out that there's a metric structure also for other gammas, still in the range between zero and two. So first it has been shown by Ding Du Witta and Draconet in 2020 that they consider the so-called Consider the so-called neuroville force passage calculation, which comes from some modified versions of the Gaussian free field, that you have some tightness of these metrics. And later it has been shown, it has been established some characterization so that you have the uniqueness and you have the convergence of your metrics. And the limit then is called the quantum gravity metric. And now our motivation is to ask: is there a way to generalize this compact two-dimensional map for this two-dimensional question? Say something about the higher-dimensional case. Okay, so what is now the naive goal? So we want to consider some law. We want to consider some law of Gaussian field, which is informally given as the exponential of minus one half times some energy. So before this has been the Virginia energy in the two-dimensional case. And integrate here with respect to the uniform distribution, at least informally, of continuous functions of M. I mean this is a Functions of m, I mean, this doesn't exist, so this is really an informal way of saying this. And yes, so this is the energy, and this is the associated bilinear form of some operator A. And so our idea is now the conformal invariance requirement, yeah. So if you change now your metric conformity, then your energy um stays the same. Stays the same. And in the case n equals to 2, so in the two-dimensional case, this is satisfied by the dictionary which has looked at this law. And so, okay, so this is the goal, Gaussian fields with color formal invariant energy. If um we have that our dimension is not equal to two, then the Dirtschule energy is no longer conformally invariant. No longer conformally invariant. So you can write what it is, and you have now this extra factor e to the power of n minus 2 times 5. So this is equal to 1 if and only this is you have dimension 2. In four dimensions, what is more promising is the Weiner-Plausian energy. So you have the integral La plus u squared integrated with respect to the volume. This is still not controversial. This is still not conformally invariant, but it is close to. So, what you get here is some lower order terms. And it has been noted by Thanites in the 80s that if you add this curvature terms to this bila Plusian energy, so this is the energy curvature of gradient and the scalar curvature times gradient squared. times a gradient squared, and this energy is conformed to curvatures here in the four-dimensional case. Okay, so what about the higher dimensional cases? So let us assume from now on that Mg is an n-dimensional, smooth, compact, connected, remaining manifold with a boundary and n is even. Then a result. Then a result by Graham Jen Rason and Spaling from the 90s tells you that there is an energy which is called the co-polyharmonic energy because it's somewhat polyharmonic and it has some lower order terms. So it consists here of the Laplacian minus Laplacian to the power of n divided by Divided by 4. So if we go back here, if n is equal to 4, you get exactly this Weimar-Laussian energy. It's a general case divided by 4. Okay, and also you have an operator. This is called the cold polyharmonic operator. So this is So this is simply a constant times minus L plus the power of f over 2 times u plus some lower order terms. So this is the way we choose the constant there, so that it's on the dimension. And again, okay, so in case n is equal to four, you have the bi Laplacian and in the case n equals to two you have the the Laplacian and this. The Laplacian line bounds, which gives you the original energy. Okay. So now what we want to do is want to consider some grounding. So that means we want to consider functions which have integral zero. And we consider the grounded sublab space. So this just consists of It consists of taking the pre-image of the minus La Glacian to this power s over 2 of your grounded L2 space. And we have the usual Sobolev spaces. Okay, so La Glacian is now a map. Swanza Laglausian is the map from Hs to the grounded Sobolef space of order S minus two. And we also consider the grounded green operators here, which are given as the inverse. Given as the inverse. And now what we want to consider is so-called admissible manifolds. These are manifolds where we know that our energy is positive. So that means that our operator is positive definite on this ground ensemble space of order n over 2. So that we can consider the Green's functions of this operator. And large pass. And large classes of n-manifolds are admissible, so for instance, in the four-dimensional case, all compact Einstein four-manifolds with positive, with non-negative rich curvature are admissible, and also all compact hyperbolic four-manifolds with spectra bigger than two are also admissible. So classes of manifolds which are admissible, that's good. And let's assume for the SQL that um I have an admissible manifold. High-level admissible manifold. Okay, and in this case, we can define the copolymering operator, as I already told you. So, this is now the operator which we call kg, so this is the inverse. And also, we consider the bilinear form just given by the inner product of two functions convoluted with this current k. K. So, K has an integral kernel. So, this is also part here of the theorem now. And an interesting feature, an important feature of this integral kernel, K, is that it has logarithmic divergence. Here we have the logarithm of the distance between x and y. And this is This is important, which we will see later. And also, this hints that we want to construct Gaussian fields with covariant structures hidden by this kernel. So, the sense that these Gaussian fields are critical in some sense. So, observability always shows some in some sense a critical. In some sense, a critical behavior. So, this is what we want to do now. We want to consider Gaussian fields, the so-called copolyharmonic Gaussian fields, which have as covariance structure this copolyharmonic green kernel. So, this is again a family, HU, of centered Gaussian random variables, final sub probability space, with covariance given by our. Given by our bilinear form used by our copyharmonic green function. So the interpretation is that if you could test against points in your space, then the expectation is equal to zero, and the expectation of hx times hy is just the green skirt, k xy. Okay, so now So now let's assume that we have some probability space and a sequence of identically distributed random variables which are standard normally distributed and furthermore sine j sequence of eigenfunctions and mu j sequence of eigenvalues for our copolynonic operation. For our copolyharmonic operators. So this exists because we assume that we are admissible. And what you would like to say is now that your copolyharmonic field has this easy expression, just taking the sum and taking the eigenvalues to the power of minus 1 over 2 times psi j. And now you also multiply with the noise psi j. This is now a formal expression. This is now a formal expression, and the question is: okay, how can you make sense of this? And the answer is now that you can make sense of this, and this co-polymonic Baptist field is a random variable with values in the rounded sublock space of or minus epsilon for any epsilon degrees than zero. So, this is also part of the next theorem now. So, you can write the co-polyarmonic field H as this. Polymonic field H as this sum. This means that for each L, a set out Gaussian random variable HL. So this is now something you can also test against points in your manifold. And this is just given as a partial sum, just some of two elements. I generate just nice functions, so this is now a random function. And we have convergence of this HL against H in L2. So P is some fixed probability space where your psi js are living on times this negative solid space. So in particular, this means that for almost every omega you have that the limit H omega is this negative solvent space. In this negative subcolor space. And moreover, you have that for every u in h, in this negative subcolor space of order minus n over 2, the family u tested against hl is a center l to bounded martingale, and you have convergence of the random variables u tested against HL against u tested against H in the H in the L2 space SL goes to infinity. H has this quite simple expression as the sum of its eigenvalues. Okay, so it's some picture. So maybe you're starting with the surface and you change now with your surface, the structure of your surface with this. The structure of your surface with this approximation of your Gaussian field, so with this component of Gaussian field. Now you let L go to infinity and you get more and more a rough structure of your surface. It's more and more a fractal-like structure. Yeah, this is a 2D picture, yeah. This is now called. Yeah, sorry. Okay. Yeah, yeah, right, that's right, that's right. Okay. And so what we also have as a crucial result is that the copolyarmonic Gaussian field is conformally invariant. What we will be grounding, as we will be grounding, comes from the fact that we always consider functions which have each equal zero. And if you change your volume, then you have. Your volume, then you have to reground them accordingly. And if you have now H, which is a copolynomic Gaussian field on M and G, and delta with G, and now you consider the conformal change G prime, or finance infinity, then H prime, which is just given as H minus this grounding procedure, is the cold dynamic quotient field on MG prime. That's also. That's also a conformal invariance feature. Okay, so the next thing I want to talk about is about discrete approximations. So now let us go to the very simple case, namely that M is just a continuous torus. So that's a bad object. And we consider now a discrete approximation. So we put a mesh on the torus with mesh size 1 over n. With mesh size 1 over n. And so let's consider the discrete Laplacian, delta n of f, this is just on the discrete Laplacian, which comes from your mesh structure. And we can consider the eigenfunctions phi z and phi minus z, and also the eigenvalues which we call that az. And I have this specific form of the sum of the sine squared. And what we now consider. What we now consider is the discrete polyharmonic kernel, and this is simply given by KLUB. So we have here this normalizing constant, and now we sum here overall the Z which are in this finite box of size L, mesh on the script. And we have just cosine and we divide by these eigenvalues to the power of n over 2. Yeah, this is somewhat the same what we did before, but now in these discrete frameworks, discrete operators. And now we can associate the polyharmonic Gaussian field on the discrete torus. So this is a centered Gaussian field with covariance function. Gaussian field with covariance function coming from the these kls which I showed you before. And given now IID standard normals, then the discrete polyharmonic Gaussian field we can just write as we also already did before as the sum over all these points in the box of size L and one over these eigenvalues we that's called L not. times the standard normals times phi z. This formula makes sense because this only is a sum over finite number. And so in contrast to the continuous object, you have an explicit formula for the law of these discrete function cases. So you can really write this as an exponential with this normalizing constant, and this is your energy. And here you can really take just a really big measure because n is now finite. So n is just n to the power of n. So this comes from your grid on the torus. And now the question is: okay, what The question is: okay, what does this discrete version do with our continuous version? And so we have here a result concerning the scaling limit. Namely, we have convergence of the fields HL to HSL goes to infinity. Namely, if we test against functions of these sovereign spaces, so that means that f is just a continuous function in particular. And we have also converged. And we have also convergence of the Fourier extensions of HL. So HL is defined with the help of the Fourier basis, of the sigen basis, of the discrete Laplacian, and this you can just extend. This also stands on points which are not on the grid. And this holds in each H minus epsilon and also tested against tested by H step in H minus epsilon. We have convergence to the continuous polyharmonic function field. Okay, and so these are the fields. What about the geometry? Okay, so maybe let's go back and recall what we wanted to do. So we fix an admissible manifold Lg and a copolynnomonic Gaussian field, which we have defined now, H, which goes from some probability space to the space of distributions. Space of distributions. And our naive goal is to study now the random geometry. M, we're endowed with the random conformal transformation. So gh, e to the power of 2 times h times g. And in particular, when once went to study the associated random volume measure, this is given as following formula, and the random metric. And the random metric. So my random metric is just considering curves. It's not so clever. Why? Maybe pretend the phi is the gamma here. And we take the speed of the curve. And you have to reweight everything with h of gamma. And then you just take the integral and you minimize overall curves. So this is the associated random metric then. Metric, then. As I said before, due to the singular nature of the noise age, these objects do not make any sense at all. Consider first some approximation, and also you have to consider re-normalization as well. So in the case and so in this famous case n equals to two, there has been quite some research. Has been quite some research. So we can replace age by suitable modifications and also proper renormalizations. And this leads to, and also for sufficiently small gamma. And this leads to sequences of random measures, mu H L, and random distances, D H L, which converge to non-trivial limit objects. So this is a result by By Sheffield and Watson Wargas, they constructed this limit of random measure, which is called the Nio-Eukanti gravity measure. And here you see this renormalization. So this is simply variance. And also later by these sequence of papers. sequence of papers that they constructed the nearby quantum gravity metric. And you see this is much more complicated. So you have here also some parameter called d gamma and also here you have a re-weighting lambda of depending on gamma and l. So the construction of the metric is much more Construction of the metric is much more involved in some sense. And what I also already told you is that in this particular case, that gamma is the square root of 8 divided by 3, you know much more than the limit of this uniform planar maps. So we now try to do the same for the measures. So this is now For the measures. So, this is now the goal. So, we have M as before, a compact manifold of even dimension, then H control is an equation field. And what we now consider is we define a random measure, mu L, which is given by some density times the volume, or M. And the density is just as before. And for HL, we simply take these partial sums HL. Partial sums h of this eigenvalues with an approximation of h. And K is the variance of this H else. And then what we get is that if gamma is suitably small, so smaller than there exists a random measure of mu and m such that mu l converges to mu and more precisely mu lambda. T row for H u um of L versus H t rho T with respect to U in L1 and also P almost surely I say and this measure is now we call now as nearly quantum gravity measure in accordance to the two-dimensional case okay so maybe one quick remark so this is not now the So this is not now the proof of the result. So this is a weaker assertion. So you see also that here gamma is only smaller than square root of n, and not smaller than square root of 2n. But if you have gamma is smaller than square root of n, then you also have that these integrals are L2 bounded particles. And so this gives you a hint how to prove this theorem. And I show you this because this I show you this because this shows you why this logarithmic divergence is important. Because what you need to show here for this proposition is that you need to calculate the expectation of y L squared. So what is yl squared? Okay, this is just inserting the measure mu L and then you take the expectations and so here you have So here you have minus gamma squared over 2, and so you take now the expectations of this first guy here, and now you have some cancellations, and what you get then is e to the power of gamma squared KL, and this you can estimate by e to the power of gamma squared k. And now you use the logarithmic divergence, right? And what you get is then, so here's a logarithm, and there's minus Minus this distance x and y, and now you get this gamma squared in front. And so you see that this is finite if and only if gamma squared is 1. So this logarithmic divergence is important that the integrals remain bounded. Find that, yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay, we know a little bit more of the structure of these measures. So if gamma is smaller than square root of 2, then almost surely this measure mu does not charge sets of vanishing H1 capacity. So what you can do now is you can consider a random Dirichlet form on the space L2M, which is now endowed with the random measure. The random measure. So, this is an Dieletian form. By the standard theory, then you can construct a Niobil-Browning motion and you can show that this is a random time change of the standard Browning motion on M. And further, what is a key property is the quasi-invariance under conformal transformation, terms of conformance transformations, are important in this talk. So, if we have a This talk. So, if we have the neural current gravity on mg, and we have mu prime, which is the neural quantum gravity measure of mg prime, where g prime is a conformal change, then you have also that mu prime coincides in law with mu up to this prefactor. This prefactor is really a deterministic factor and also consistent with a two-dimensional case. So, if you two-dimensional case. Two-dimensional cases. This is really the formula known in two dimensions. Okay, let me briefly tell you also about this discrete approximation. So we did this for the fields, and now let us also do this for the measures. So let us recall: if m is not a continuous torus and we consider the discrete approximations of the mesh of it, then we had the discrete versions of the torus. Had the discrete versions of polymorphic Gaussian fields. And what we, of course, can do now is we can associate a discrete global quantum gravity measure to this field. We're just inserting HL instead of H in this formula we had before. And ML here is just the normalized counting measure. And as before, we have also here convergence of So, here convergence of these discrete measures to the content object on the tolls. This is the next result. So, here the first part, you will see that we have somehow worse range for gamma. So, we have here if gamma is smaller than the square root of n over 2, n over e, and we assume that our mesh on the torus is hierarchically ordered, then we have that. Then we have that our discrete random measures converge to the random measure in law and in L1 as I goes to infinity. And also, similar this holds true for the measure associated with the Fourier extension of this discrete polyharmonic field. So remember, this is defined with Remember, this is defined with the eigenvases of your discrete Laplacian, but this is also defined for points which are not on the mesh, on the grid. And then you have also convergence for the so-called semi-discrete random measures. And also if we change the eigenvalues in our formulations, so which is then called so-called spectrally reduced semi-discrete. Reduced semi-discrete measures. So we get also convergence in a larger range. So the full range of gamma smaller than square root of 2n. And the reason why the ranges differ is that in this construction, which is this Gaussian multiplicative chaos, we use in 1 and 2 the eigenvalues. And one and two, the eigenvalues of the discrete Laplacian. So we have really a worse, a smaller range of gammas for which the convergence inside holds. And in this third assertion, we really just replace the eigenvectors of the Pistrigg Laplacian by the eigenvalues of the Buschung Laplacian. So that's the reason why we get the larger range. Okay, so maybe let me summarize what we did here. What we did here. So, we constructed copolyharmonic fields on admissible manifolds of even dimension, and we constructed the associated new gravity measures. And we proved for both objects conformal quasi-invariance. And moreover, we considered the discrete worlds or polyharmonic Gaussian fields and yields associated with quantum gravity on the discrete torus. On the descriptoris, and we also studied the scaling limits. I mean, both objects converge to their continuous counterparts. And now, of course, we have still some open questions. So, our first interesting question would be that one would like to consider discrete copyright quotient fits on manifolds and not only on the torus. And then, moreover, Moreover, of course, discrete Liverpool quantum gravity measures on manifolds as well. That's something just measures as well. And also what are their scaling limits, so on this possibly curved spaces. And last but not least, of course, I would like to understand also some kind of metric. So metric may be associated for some. For some modified versions of these fields on curved spaces, or also maybe in this simple or flat case some metric obtained by approximating by some discrete versions, so these discrete fields would be interesting to study. But yeah, let me stop here. To study. But yeah, let me stop now. Any questions and comments?
