Of Accladian lattices. Thank you. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak about this topic in this workshop. So actually, as I mentioned in the abstract, there will be two parts. Only the second part is really related to my own. Related to my own work on the subject, but I wanted to spend some time recalling in details the definition of this Grayson Stuller filtration and see whether it can have some application to the computation of a comology of arithmetic groups. So, to start with, I will fix some I will fix some definition and notation for the rest of the talk. So in this introductory part, a Euclidean lattice will be simply a pair consisting of a free Z module together with an inner product on the here on the R. Here on the R vector space span by L. And so with this data, there is a natural notion of co-volume associated to a lattice, which can be computed in terms of the determinant of the gram matrix of any basis of the Basis of the lattice L. So then I want to insist a little more on the third point, which is that for me, in the rest of the talk, a sub-lattice will mean a primitive Z submodule of L, meaning that it That it coincides exactly with the intersection of L with the Q-span of M. In other words, the quotient L over M is torsion free or say differently, M is a direct factor of L. So only sub-lattices of this form will show up. Uh, this form will show up in the rest of the talk, so I completely disregard other sub-lattices, so there will be no indices or torsion quotient. So later on, when I use the word sub-lattice, it is to be understood in this meaning. So, in particular, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set Between the set of sub-lattices of L and the set of Q vector subspaces of the Q span of L. So I make this remark at this point because later on we will see that the filtration of L that I will define shortly. Shortly, is in fact a filtration of the space itself, and not it's not to be considered as a filtration of the lattice, but rather a filtration of the space by subspaces, by two subspaces. But of course, it involves somewhere the lattice. So I will be a little more precise on that in the next slide. So another So another notion which is useful is the notion of quotient of lattices. And in particular, it's important to notice that the quotient of a lattice held by one of its sublattices with the previous meaning for sub-lattice. meaning for sublattice. This inherits a Euclidean structure which one can define, for instance, by identifying the R span of the quotient L over M with the orthogonal of the subspace, the real subspace span by M. Well, I won't give more precise definition, but this is essentially the way you can canonically handle the quotient with a Euclidean structure. So, two more notions that will be useful is the notion of duality. The notion of duality. So at this point, I define the dual in purely algebraic terms as the set of homomorphism of L to Z, group of homomorphism from L to Z. And again, there is a Euclidean structure inherited from the Euclidean structure of the set. Of the set of linear forms on the underlying real vector space. So the precise definition is here, but it's not important now. And finally, since it will be main object of interest in the second part of the talk, I recall how one can define the tensor product of Can define the tensor product of two Euclidean lattices, namely, if two Euclidean lattices are given together with the inner products indexed one and two here. Then you just define the tensor, the inner product on splits, on split elements. Elements using the easier formula you can think of. And then you just extend this definition by bilinearity to get a well-defined inner product on the tensor product of the two spaces. Okay, so when speaking of tensor product of Euclidean lattices later on, Later on, the Euclidean structure, the inner product I will have in mind, will be of that shape. Okay, so now I will define the Grazen-Stuller filtration. So actually, I should rather name it Stuller-Grayson filtration because I think Stuller was the first study this, and only a few. And only a few years later, Grayson also did a contribution to the subject. So let me briefly explain how it is defined. So I take a lattice air and for convenience and also to be current with the figures I have, the pictures I have prepared, I will normalize it. Normalize it so as it has a volume one. It's irrelevant for what follows. And then what I do, so there is a picture to explain the filtration, which is built in the following way, namely for every sub-lattice M of L, you plot the points which coordinate With coordinates given by the rank of M and the logarithm of its volume. So it gives you a bunch of points. Well, not much to say about these points so far. And then what you do is that you add the vertical lines at zero and infinity. zero and infinity. And you, and sorry, not zero and infinity, at a zero and n, n being the dimension, I forgot to state it, n is a dimension of L. And then you take the convex L of the resulting set of points. Okay, so that's what I did here. And then you see some polygon. Some polygon showing up, and this will be the basis of the definition of the filtration. So what I call the profile of L is a polygonal boundary of this convex L. And what one can show, but it is not obvious. There is some very ingenious trick. Very ingenious trick to prove it is that the vertices of this profile, so of this polygonal boundary, correspond to a uniquely defined chain of sub-lattices. So this is an important property and not so obvious because it means, for instance, that if you look at this point, that point here, Point here. It means that necessarily there is one and only one sublattice achieving this volume. One sublattice of this rank achieving this volume. Otherwise, this point would not be on the boundary. So there are some very specific geometric properties of this profile. Of this profile, which are not of use and which are fundamental for what follows. Okay, so this is what I will call the Grayson-Stuller filtration. I will explain in one of the next slides where it comes from. So, this is just the same picture again. And so, there is an important notion. So there is an important notion that I want to mention right now, is the notion of semi-stability. And precisely, one says that a lattice is semi-stable if its profile is flat, meaning that the filtration we have just defined is trivial. You see, all these vertices just disappear. Vertices just disappear, the profile is flat. There is no vertices except, of course, zero and n corresponding to the dimension. So in that case, in the case of the semi-stable lattices, the filtration reduces to L0, which is zero, by the way, and L1, which is simply L itself. Okay. Early tip, okay. So, can I ask a quick question? Yes, is it possible that on such a line there is another point that so that the line is still straight, but it's not actually a point that points forwards? Sure. So it is possible. This is why I call this notion semi-stability. Stability would mean that there is no other point on the flat line. Points on the flat line. Does it answer your question? Sorry, does it answer your question? Yes, it's it. Thank you so much. Okay, okay. And so that's for the summary stability. Actually, this is an important remark you made because this is You made because this is something I think that has to be explored. What happens on this semi-stable but not stable lattices? I will say a word about that later on. And so just for historical reason, I recall where all this comes from. So actually, Stuller and Akhtar in the and after him raisin studied this question inspired by work by Quillen and Ser who defined such a filtration for vector bundles over curves or over function fields I would say and derived some some property for the homology of some group in these settings. Some group in these settings. And Raison and Stuller tried, and in fact, succeed in adapting this idea to get some kind of alternative to the Borel Ser compactification using this filtration. So I will say a word about that later. And if one wants to go back So, back to earlier works, all this is modeled on the theory of Arder-Narasinam's Arder-Narasinam's filtration for vector bundles over algebraic curves. So, in this theory, there is a notion of slope. I'm not sure that the word slope was coined by Arder and Arcinam, but it But it translates at least in the case of Euclidean lattice. So formally, the definition of the slope of a lattice corresponds to the quantity degree of E divided by the rank of E in the case of a vector bundle. And associated to this notion of slow. To this notion of slope, there is a notion of a minimal slope. So, this will play a fundamental role in what follows. So, in particular, another way to express semi-stability is to say that the minimal slope of L coincides with the slope of the lattice itself. And maybe. And maybe one remark is so this question has been studied a lot by Bost, who in particular showed that this set of slopes could serve as an alternative to the As an alternative to the successive minima of a lattice, and in some respects, it has better properties than the successive minima. I will be a little more precise on that in the next slides, but I will just summarize this remark by saying that By saying that both works suggest somehow to replace the successive minima of a lattice by the successive slopes that I will define in the next slide. So here it is. So you see using the same picture as before, once you have drawn Once you have drawn your profile, you have a set of vertices and you have a set of slopes corresponding to the successive edges of the profile. So these quantities are the successive slopes. So this is the quantities that can be used as an alternative to the successive minimum. To the successive minima for arithmetic purposes. And some remark I've already made in the introduction and I want to stress on is that in fact this set of slopes is in fact associated not really to the filtration by sub-lattices but to filtration by But to filtration by subspaces. And this is because, as I already mentioned, a sub-lattice is completely determined by its Q span and vice versa. So actually, the set of successive slopes can be defined as the slopes of the successive quotients of the corresponding. Of the corresponding subspaces. So, this is just a matter of notation, so to speak, but this is the notation I will use from now on. So, when I write something like that, you have to keep in mind that this slope, the definition of this slope, has to do with some underlying lattice L, which is fixed once and for all. So once and for all, but then the sequence of subspaces is just a sequence of two vector spaces. Okay. Okay. So now I just say a few words about the relation of all that stuff with the cohomology of arithmetic group. So this So this, all I state here is contained in the papers by Stuller and Grayson. And so to be, I try to be as precise as possible, but I don't want to spend too much time on that. But so I will identify the set of Identifies a set of Euclidean lattices with fixed. So somehow I fix the underlying lattice, which will be Z to the D. And what will vary is the inner product. And with this convention, the set of Euclidean lattices can be identified with this set of symmetric matrices. Matrices and from this identification, you can define a topology on X tilde and also on the set X, which is just X tilde mod homotesis. Okay, it's kind of projective version of X till. And so using the Grazer Stuller filtration, Filtration one can define some distances to the various, so to speak, cusps. Namely, if F is a subspace of Q to the D, there is a well-defined distance from a point X in X tilde to F. So I don't give the definition, but I just mention Mention some properties of this distance. So the first property is that the distance of X to F is strictly greater than one if and only if F is a vertex of the profile of the lattice corresponding to X. Okay, so this is the same picture as before. Similar As before. Similarly, the distance is one if f is on the profile, but on the straight interior of an edge, so not a vertex, and if f is above the profile, which means that the sub-lattice corresponding to f is above the profile, then the distance. The distance is strictly less than one. Okay, so this does not characterize the distance, but this is the only property I will need. And with these remarks, it's easy to see that the semi-stable locus, the set of semi-stable lattices, corresponds to the To the set of x such that the supremum of all these distances is less or equal to one. Okay, and more generally, for any t greater or equal to one, one can define this set x semi-stable t by enlarging a little bit the upper bound here. So, this is necessary to for some of the result in Grayson's paper to obtain a manifold, because if t equals one, some of the objects that will show up now are not manifolds, they are singularities. And so I try to summarize very briefly. To summarize very briefly some of the main results of Grayson's and Stuller works, which is that this set I've just defined. So for any T greater or strictly greater than one, this is a quantum tractable manifold with boundary. It is compact, modulo GLD of Z. And another important property is that Property is that its boundary is homotopy equivalent to that of the T building of QG that shows up already in many talks yesterday, and as well as the complementary of the semi-stable set. And moreover, the homotopy may be chosen so that it respects the action of gamma. So, in principle, this can be of some use to compute. Some use to compute the cohomology of gamma. So the next slide is just a bunch of completely open questions because I don't think that much people have worked on that so far. So one first open question is, is there a naturally defined cell decomposition of the semi-stable? The semi-stable locus, of course, compatible with the action of gamma. And a similar question for the boundary. And if so, how does it compare with the well-rounded retract and the Voronoi cell decomposition? And an important, well, maybe not so important, but I think it is important, remark I wanted to make is that, so with respect to this With respect to this putative comparison, is that there have been some computation made by Kim. So I don't remember the first name, unfortunately. So this won't help a lot if you are looking for the paper on math finance. But there have been some computation which shows, for instance, that most of, but not all, the perfect forms are. Forms are semi-stable. In fact, as I remember well, what he checked is that all perfect forms up to dimension seven are semi-stable, but there are two exceptions. There is one exception in dimension eight, and only one, because in dimension eight, the list is complete. And among the, I don't know how many forms he tested in dimension. Tested in dimension nine, but I think something like half a million. And he found only one which is not semi-stable. But I would like to know if this has some meaning with respect to comology or not. Was it predictable or is it a surprise that some perfect forms Some perfect forms are not in the semi-stable locus. I don't know. So those are questions for which I have no answer. Okay. Any questions so far? Because I will switch to a kind of different topic? Sorry, can I ask another question? I hope I'm not disturbing you. Um is it correct that the that the s uh supremum on the last slide is always at least one, even if if it's a semi-simple uh lattice, then you still get the supremum one, even though the distances are all smaller than one? Sorry, I didn't uh understand. Is it this possible? What uh can you hear me? Is my microphone not loud enough? Sorry. No, I think it's too loud, to the contrary. Oh, it's too loud. I'm sorry. Contrary. Oh, it's too loud. I'm sorry. Don't worry. Yeah, it's better. Yeah. Okay. I was asking whether the supremum is always at least one or is this can actually be smaller than one? No. It can be smaller than one. I mean, it depends if you if you allow zero. Depends if you if you allow zero if you zero it is one but if you don't if you as I did here if you if you exclude the the zero subspace and the full space it can be strictly less than one yeah okay for for for stable lattices it is less than one okay yeah that's it okay so Okay, so now I will turn to the second part. And first of all, as a transition, I will very briefly explain how all this extends to number fields in general. So there are various equivalent formulations of this theory. So one have to make a choice. One have to make a choice. So I choose to stick to Grayson's original work. So actually, he didn't speak of Hermitian vector bundles, but of OK lattices. So this terminology of Hermitian vector bundles is just to remind of the geometric origin of all that. So to be more to be to be uh more uh more precise and probably more pedantic uh i should say that where those are uh vector bundles over the the spectrum of okay uh okay being the the the ring of integer of k but uh uh well it's not important uh so um just uh in simple words what is uh an emission vector bundle over the Hermitian vector bundle over the spectrum of the ring of integer of a number field. It is just the data of a finite dimensional k-vector space together with a lattice. By lattice, I mean a projective OK submodel L of maximal rank. Not necessarily free. Not necessarily free, except Free, except, of course, if the class number is one, and a collection of Hermitian forms at infinite places. More precisely, at real places, Hv is a positive definite symmetric form, and at complex places, it's a Hermitian form. Hermitian form. Okay, so that's the way one can generalize the notion of lattice. Okay. And essentially, all previous definitions carry on easily to this setting, namely the volume, the notion of sublattice, of quotient, of dual, and also the definition of slopes. I won't give a slightly different slope. I won't give precisely the definition of the volume, although this is the most important quantity in all this theory, but just to convince you that I'm not hiding anything sophisticated, in the case where L is free, then this volume is just obtained by taking the product over all infinite places of the determinant. Places of the determinant of the corresponding gram matrix with an exponent which is, sorry, I forgot to define UV, it's one or two according to V being real or complex. Okay, so this is a standard notation. So this is essentially the same definition. Essentially, the same definition as usual, as for usual lattices over Z, except that pay attention to the fact that this is a product, not a sum or anything else. So it's a product. And in keeping with some remark I already made, I will make maybe questionable abuse of Questionable abuse of notation, which is that I will use the same letter E to denote Hermitian vector bundle, which is a data of a vector space and a lattice and a bunch of Hermitian forms. But I will use the same later to denote the space, the underlying vector space, and the Hermitian vector bundle. When I say E, one has to understand that there is a and And there is a lattice involved and a set of inner product at infinite places. Okay, so with all these data, I can define slopes and slope filtration in exactly the same way as I did before. So I won't recall that. Recall that. So, but believe me, there is nothing, it's not more difficult in that setting than in the case of Z. Okay, so the question I want to address now, so Philippe, how much time do I have? I'm completely lost. How much time? You can use still five minutes. I have to hurry up a lot. So, I. A lot. So, I seven minutes if you want. Okay, okay. You're very nice. So, the question I wanted to address is a question of the tensor products conjecture. So, this is a conjecture which was formulated by Boston in analogy with what is known for vector bundles over curves. Bundles over curves. And the conjecture is that the minimal slope of the tensor product of two Hermitian bundles is the sum of the minimal slope. So this is by no way obvious. The only thing which is obvious, which was on the previous slide, is that you have this inequality. Inequality because if you take the destabilizing subspace of E and the destabilizing subspace of F, and you take the tensor product of these two spaces, then the slope of these subspaces is equal to the sum of the slopes of E and F. And by the very definition of the minimal slope, it is an upper bound for the minimal slope of E tensor F. Tensor F, but that's the only easy fact you can prove about that. Everything else is difficult. And one difficulty is that the canonical filtration is, in general, very difficult to compute, and the conjecture is very difficult to test. So I just summarize very briefly what is known. It is known to be true in small rank. So there is a misprint here, it's not a comma. Is a misprint here. It's not a comma, it's a point. It means that if the product of the rank of E and the rank of F is less or equal to nine, then it was proven by Boss and Chen that the conjecture is true in that case. And actually, the proof is very difficult, very intricated already. It's trivially true if E and F are unimodular lattices over Z. I will say a word about that in the next slide. And also, there are some conditions. Under which it's true, which has to do with the action of the automorphism group. So I won't say anything about these two cases because I run out of time. And the most definitive result in this direction was obtained recently by Guy Raymond. We proved that when he is E is a is a multiplicity free as a G module, then the conjecture is true, whatever F is. Okay, but now what I want to the case I want to concentrate on is the case of isodual Hermitian bundles. So to define isodual Hermitian bundles, I first have to define what an isometry is. So it is simply a calinear map that maps Collinear map that maps L, the underlying lattice of E, onto M, the underlying lattice of F, and that respects the various Hermitian norms at infinity. And in particular, Hermitian model is isodual if it is isometric to its dual. And in this situation, one can associate a cabilinear from B C. bilinear from B sigma to any isometry between E and its dual. And of particular interest are the case of orthogonal isodual bundle and simpletic isodual bundle. And a first theorem I want to mention is that in fact if you want to prove or disprove If you want to prove or disprove the conjecture, you can restrict to isodual Hermitian bundle, and in fact, you can even restrict to orthogonal Hermitian bundle and even to simple or alternatively to symplectic Hermitian bundle. And finally, you can even restrict to isodual and semi-stable vector bundle. So if you are able to prove the conjecture in this particular In this particular case, then the conjecture, the general conjecture is true. So this actually is not difficult to prove. At least the first four equivalents are easy to prove and they just rely on this silly construction, which is that you can always embed an army bundle into an isodual one and even into an orthogonal or sympletic one. The fifth assertion, Azilaton. The fifth assertion is a little more delicate, so I won't say anything about that. And so, probably the most important fact is that given an isodal Hermitian bundle, then its raison stellar filtration has some very specific symmetry properties. And in particular, it turns out that all All components of the filtration are totally isotropic with respect to the form Bσ, and there are also some properties of the successive quotients, which I summarize in this picture. So this is what the gradients, stolar filtrations of an isodual bundle look like, and these horizontal lines. And these horizontal lines just mean that the corresponding quotients are also themselves isodual bundles. So this play a role in the demonstration, in the proof of the next result. So in particular, the first step here, the destabilizing subspace is always a totally isotropic space. And using that, and I will finish with that, you have a series of You have a series of results. So, first, you can prove that under some mild assumptions, which are always satisfies if chi is either totally real or complex multiplication. Then, if E is a multiplicity free as a G module, G being a group of automorphism of E, then it is automatically semi-stable. Automatically semi-stable. So, this is a property you can show using this stuff. And so, more importantly, and unfortunately, I really run out of time, but using the signature of the form B sigma, you can obtain a series of results which allow to prove the conjecture in some cases. In some cases. And for instance, I will end with that. An interesting particular case is that when you consider the tensor product of what I call a quasi-unimodular bundle and a Lorentzian isodual bundle, then under certain conditions, the conjecture is true. Under this Under this very annoying assumption that I will for sure be able to relax soon, but just not to state theorem that are not completely proved so far, I just kept this assumption for the talk of today. Okay, so sorry for For going over my time. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you. Is there complementary questions on the talk? Either on the part one or the part two? Yeah. Perhaps I. Perhaps I want to make a small remark on the first part. So, where you ask for the cell decomposition. So, in principle, the whole thing can be done for any smooth, semi-simple, maybe split reductive group scheme. So, instead of looking at S. So instead of looking at SLN, you could as well look at the symplectic group. And here, for instance, you ask for the cell deposition of XSS and for the symplectic group, SP2. For me, SP2 is what other people call SP4. So for SP2, I would like I would like to see the cell decomposition of this XSS. Maybe it follows from what Mark and McPherson did. But they have to take a covering. And so I do not know whether. Yeah, so what I'm saying, you can ask the same question for any. Same question for any semi-simple group scheme, and already for the first not SL2, not SLN or SL6, S7, 8 group, I do not know for the SP2, I do not know the cell composition, and I would like to see it. This is a problem I want to mention. I want to mention. Okay. So the space is yeah. Yeah. So maybe I don't know if Mark is still there, but maybe if Mark wants to comment on it. No, no, I do not. No? No. No, it's not there. Yeah. Okay. So by the way, it is a Jung Su Kim. Kim, you think so? Yeah, so it is Jung. Jung Su Kim, so it is on semi-stability of perfect lattice. Yeah, I have the paper somewhere, but I don't know. Does it appear somewhere? I have a preference. Yes, yes, it appears in some American journals, but not so well-known American journals. Yes, but so in fact, it could also result because. In fact, it could also result because to connect the Voronoi cell decomposition to the one from the semi-stable decomposition, then we should be also able to answer the question for SP4 or SP2. But I have no explanation for for your the I mean for dimension eight it is a bounce the bounce lattice which is not semi-stable. I don't remember I think so but uh no it is an affirmation it's an affirmation sorry yeah it is an affirmation and uh It is an affirmation, and I don't see how it could connect to, for instance, the comological results. I mean, the only thing that we can see either in the example for dimension 9 and dimension 8 is that each time it is related to either E7 or E8 in the 9 dimension. So I don't know. Is there some similarity? Is there some similar experiment in the Hermitian case? So, this is a question. Not that I know, but that's something one can do. I mean, you can test all the list of perfect forms of over quadratic rings and test them for semi-stability. Yeah, yeah, that's something that is easy to do in principle. At least in small dimensions, of course. At least in small dimensions, of course, relatively small dimensions, yeah. Okay. Is there other questions or comments? No, there are all. So thank you, speakers. Thank you, Rono, again. So, I need to stop the recording. Sorry.
