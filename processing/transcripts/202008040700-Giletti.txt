We'll be able to come in two years if we get the opportunity of to this conference in two years. And so I recall that the talk is 20 minutes plus five minutes questions. So the first speaker of this second day is Tomaji Letti, who is going Who is going to talk about propagating terrorists in multi-dimensional and spatially periodic domains? Okay, so thanks to Luca. Yes, thanks, Luca, and thanks to all the organizers. Let me just make it full screen. Okay. Okay, so again, thank you to all the organizers as well as the staff as well for making this event happen. Even though it's online, I guess the switch was not so easy to handle. So, easy to handle. So, thank you very much. Um, okay, so let me go directly to my talk because I don't have that much time, and also, um, to show you the setting of this problem. So, as Mike Techov said, if you briefly saw it, so I'm going to be talking today about some specially periodic racial equations. And of course, I will be looking at propagation phenomena, sharing wave solutions of this kind of equations. So, thank you, Julio. And um, okay, so I have some probability both in the diffusion here. Uh, I wrote a positive, but you can could have some matrix. I mean, nothing important, just any elliptic diffusion operator here, and some heterogeneity also in the reaction term F here. So it depends on both X periodically and LU. And also both have the same period, of course, so that is chromistruly periodic. And of course, so the propagation phenomena in this kind of equation. Phenomena in this kind of equation, it depends a lot on what is the function f. And so I will be more explicit, a little bit more explicit about the assumption of f, but at least for a start we'll at least assume that there are two steady states. And just for simplicity, I'm taking these as zero and one. So f of zero, u equals zero is n equal to zero. And f of u equal to one is also identical to zero. So at least those two steady states. And also I know that many people And also, I know that many people here on the other side of this computer know about this kind of stuff, but just in case, let me briefly describe what may happen. So, if you start from just looking at one dimension, if you start from this kind of ebb side type initial data, then of course because of diffusion, the curve of the solution is going to to smoother, of course. But still, you will we will going to be to stay close to one on one side and close to two on the other side, so you have some kind of interface. The other side, so you have some kind of interface between those two steady states which is going to move as time passes. And so, the whole question immediately when you want to be farming. Sorry, Toma. Sometimes your voice is very low, so maybe it's okay. I'm just going to be closer, but enough. It's okay. Okay. Okay. And so we want to know how this interface. And so we want to know how this interface moves as time goes by. And again, it's going to depend a lot on the choice of a function f. So let me just talk a little bit more about some classical cases, which are the ones that most of you are used to already. And so in particular, if you take, so I'm just forgetting from about the spatial probability to make it more classical. And so if you take f as the logistic function. As the logistic function or KPP function, then there is going to exist some solution, which of course are entire solutions of the type u of x minus ct, which goes to both of the steady states, as x minus ct goes to plus infinity or and minus infinity. And so those are special solutions, but it is well known that they are attractive solutions in some sense. And so if you start from every side type initial beta, as I showed in my previous slide, when you're going to converge to one of these choices, To one of these Charlie-Front solutions. However, if you take different functions f, then it's not as clear anymore that such a Charlie-Front solution is going to exist. And so I'm giving two examples here. So first one is a bit... I always say it's a bit silly, but I always like to say it anyway. Even though today it's not really the topic, but if you take f identical to zero, then of course you're just going to have some kind of heat equation, at least if A is also. Heat equation, at least if A is also homogeneous. And then, of course, in the heat equation, you have no such charging point solution because everything just flattens and level set goes away from each other. So, just I like to mention this example because it's a good reminder that degeneracy on F may cause some trouble. It's a bit extreme example, but more generally, this kind of degeneracy may cause some trouble. So, this is not really the topic today. The topic today is more about the second example which I give here. Second example which I give here: if F is, say, tristable, so usually we are used to monostable and bistable reactions, but tristable is, of course, if you look at something which looks like this. So this is a function f of u. So again, I'm on this side just talking about the homogeneous case to make it simpler. So there is no x variable in f here. And so if you just look at the OD associated with the reaction, so without diffusion, then the left most steady state. The left most steady states, the middle one, and the right most are going to be stable steady states, and the other two are unstable steady states. And this is actually also true in the Russian Devil equation. So it's quite clear that if you know about a bi-stable equation, probably the case for most of you. So it's clear for a bi-stable equation. So for each part of a function f, you have a traveling wave. So there will be a traveling wave going from zero to the middle one, and from the middle one to the upper one. But it's not clear that you will. Per one, but it's not clear that you need to have a charming wave going directly from zero to one. And in general, it's not true to you. You don't have such a charming wave, and you need a slightly more general notion in some sense, which is what is in my title actually, even though I skipped the strand of my title, that it's where you need the notion of probating terror. And so let me mention before I'm giving this notion of probating terrorist, because this happened, this existed actually. This existed actually before the works I'm going to talk about today. So, in the Homer's case already in Fat and MacLeod paper in the 70s, such a situation was considered. And so, they introduced this notion of terrace, but they called it minimal decomposition at the time. Okay, so let me mention right properly what is the point of us. So, the goal is to discard propagation phenomena for such reaction times, such as. Such reaction times are true stable and even more complicated with any number of stable states. So, first on this slide, I'm just giving the notion of persisting charging form because, again, the previous slide I was only talking about functional case to make it simpler. But my talk is going to be about spatially periodic. And so you need an appropriate, slightly more general notion, which we call prostating trans. So it's basically the same thing, more or less, but... The same thing, more or less, but some basically there are two changes. So, the first one is that because I'm talking about higher dimensions, longer dimension one, so I cannot write x minus ct, of course. So, it has to be x dot some unit vector minus ct. And this unit vector is going to be the direction of this traveling front. So, it's also a planar traveling front, something because of depends mostly on x dots this unit vector. And okay, so this. And okay, so this change we have to make in the also in the Roman case to make it a multi-dimensional function. And the other change is truly because of the heterogeneity, because just a function of x minus ct, even in dimension one, it cannot exist if you have some heterogeneity. Because if you, as a traveling wave moves, the environment around the traveling wave is going to change also. So you need to keep some memory of the heterogeneity. And to do that, there's a definition. That in this definition of perceiving charge front, you add some variable x. So it occurs both here in the traveling front variable, in some sense, and as a first variable, but capital U, this function capital U, has to be periodic in this first variable. So you have to keep memory of it heterogeneity and you are consistent with this heterogeneity in some sense. And as before, you only need to connect to steady states. So they may be periodic in general, of course, because of the heterogeneity. They may be periodic in general, of course, because of the heterogeneity and q1 and q2. Okay, another actual notion of parameters. So, as I mentioned, so the idea is that if you have many steady states, so it's not clear that you have one traveling wave going directly from the lowest to the uppermost steady states. So, you don't have one traveling wave, but a family of traveling waves. And this is precisely what we call a problem. This is precisely what we call probes. So, the more rigorous definition is on this slide. Let me go just in a little more detail. So, it's given by two sequences. So, the first sequence is the sequence of steady states, which are going to be connected by the front surface terrace, because you don't know quite where you're going to what will be the stops of your traveling rate, basically. And so, POK is a sequence of paired steady states going from one to zero, and they are ordered. One to zero, and they are ordered. Again, you could replace one to zero by overperadic steady state, but just to fix the ideas through this talk, one will be the higher steady state, and zero will be the lower steady state. So, occasionally, we call this QK the steady state, the platforms. And then the second sequence is a sequence of traveling fronts connecting both successive platforms. So, for each index K, you have one traveling front. You have one charging front connecting QK minus one to QK, and of course, this charging front has some speed CK, and they are all in the same direction. So, I'm looking at the providing terrace in one direction, so the other direction is fixed, sometimes it can be any direction, but you need to fix the direction to get to providing terrace. And okay, so up to this point, it will be actually quite easy to find such a sequence of charming fronts, but to make it meaningful. Fonts, but to make it meaningful, the Cauchy problem, you need the sequence of speeds to be ordered. So you want the lower level sets of the, if you think of the Cauchy problem, you want the lower level sets to go faster than the higher level sets. And so in the large time behavioral solution, the only kind of sequence of traveling fronts that you could get is a sequence of traveling fonts whose speed whose speeds should be ordered. So we put that in our definition of operating terrace. That in our definition of the probability interest, and again, that's what makes it meaningful in the European problem, and it's also what makes it harder to find the probability interest. Okay, so it's modeling so something like this. So, in this case, you have three traveling waves connecting one to two thirds, two-thirds to one-third, and one-third to one-zero, something like that. Okay, so I'm going to mention a few results about existence. Results about existence. There are several results that I need to mention today. Sorry, sorry, Toma. There is still a problem with the microphone. I think that Zoom sometimes treats your voice like noise and lower the level, I think. So maybe if you speak louder, maybe it would work. Okay, let me just you still hear me, right? Yes, okay. We see the screen, we don't see you, but we see the screen. I cut the video because I'm getting closer to my computer. Probably don't want to see because I have a way to increase the volume, but it will take a few minutes. So maybe it's better if I just go like this. Like this. So, sorry about it. Okay, it's okay now. So, some results. So, I started working on it while I was a postdoc with Hiroshi, Hiroshima, seven years ago or something like that. And so we had two papers actually together. One was also with Arnaud Ducor, and one is more recent, just the two of us. And so we only consider the one-dimensional case. One-dimensional case, spatially periodic, but only one-dimensional. And under two kinds of assumptions, which are both written here, we prove that there exists probable interas, which is in some sense attractive. So I'm only giving a very rough statement here. And actually, our assumptions were even a little bit different in these papers. But basically, we provided some sets of assumptions where such projecting to us exists in dimension one. Again, I'm insisting that it was only in dimension one. Again, I'm insisting that it was only in dimension one because we used some kind of intersection number arguments, and this kind of argument only works in dimension one. So it basically consists in counting the number of zeros or intersections between two solutions of the parabolic parabolic equation and use it as some kind of a Lyapunov function. And of course, counting the number of zeros doesn't really work in a higher dimension. So it's really purely one-dimensional argument. So we had some. So we have some existence results, some stability results, but only in dimension one. I'm also mentioning, maybe shortly because it's time very fast, but so as I first said, so there was some earlier work by Feinstein applied already 40 years ago or something, but only in the Robjungs case for existence and of Terraces. So they called it many men decomposition, but it's basically the same thing. Basically, the same thing. And more recently, there was also a series of works by Peter Polacić, and also in the Romplus case, but in the Romulus case, it was much marginal conditions, including some very degenerate situations. And also, it gave some stability results also in higher dimensions. And okay, so the issue is that, so as I said, so in the predicted case to. So as I said, so in the predicate we only had results in one dimension and our proof relied heavily on the fact that it was one dimensional. And in the hormones case you don't need to worry too much about dimension because turning waves are purely one-dimensional objects because the problem is in boundaries rotation. So if you look at a planar turning wave in one direction, in the homogeneous case, it's actually a solution of a one-dimensional problem. But in the spatially periodic case, of course, But uh in the spatial periodic case, of course, it's not uh the case anymore. And so the gap from one dimension to higher dimension is uh much harder basically in the uh higher dimensional case. So this is why we did some work with Luca, so our chair today, and to try to deal with spatially periodic framework in any dimension. And so what we proved here, this is our mean result, so asking that was two. So assume that those two assumptions, so you have a finite number of stable product steady states. So again, to fix the ID, zero is the smallest and one is the largest. And those stable steady states are all linearly stable, and any other predicted state is linearly unstable. So our assumptions are a little more restrictive than what we had in dimension one, because we need those non-tangency assumptions. So stable is not enough, we need the linearity stable. Linearly stable and linearly unstable for other 10 states. But anyway, under this assumption, then for any direction, any dimension and any direction, we have a probating terrace in this direction going from one to zero. So in the quite complete result in that sense, so in full existence results of a probate intervals. And furthermore, so it's not. And furthermore, so it's not so important today, but just to give a particular case on the next slide, those steady states which are involved in the terrace, they have to be some of those stable steady states. So you cannot stop at an unstable state. Okay, so and in particular, therefore, if you have only two stable steady states, which is a bistable case, then we will recover the existence of a unique traveling wave connecting one and zero. Because again, so the resultance is a Because again, so the result on the previous slide it gives you a teras, but because the terrace can only stop at stable steady states, and the stable steady states are only zero and one, when you think that the terrace can only contain one single font, going directly from one to zero. And also in this vast table case, actually not a new result, it was uh were some earlier works by Fang and Zhou, which was in 1D, but actually in some abstract dynamical uh framework. Dynamical framework, which can be applied in some sense in a higher dimension. And also, Ducor had basically exactly Arnold Ducor exactly the presult here, but we recover here with a slightly different approach in our paper with Luca. So I don't know, I know that I don't have time to go into the proof, so I'm just mentioning here that the proof follows some approach which was developed by Weinberger using some monotony dynamical systems, some kind of a fixed point. Dynamical systems, some kind of a fixed-point approach, some sense. Again, I don't have time to go into the proof, so I'm just going to leave it at it for now. Okay, so as some sense mentioned in the beginning, so existence of point intervals is a good thing, of course, but the point of point intervals, just like the point of a training wave is, is to describe the lifetime behavior of a parabolic equation. Of a parabolic equation. And in particular, usually, what you want to know is the spreading speed or even spreading profile of solutions when you start from the compactly spotted initial data. So this is what we are currently working on, actually, with Lucas. I'm not going to give you really any results, but just some ideas and to try to convince you that this problem is actually quite harder than you may have expected. Okay, so let me first recall what happened in the homogenous case. So I'm just looking at the standard case, or I'm forgetting about teraces for this slide. So if you look at homogeneous bistable case, so in an equation like this, I'm taking the most classical example of cubic bistable non-linearity. So if you take this equation, it is very well known that you have a charge in France with some speed T star in all directions. T in all direction, and again, because of the prime infinite primitives, the speed is going to be the same in all direction. And here, the speed is also positive because I took theta less than one half. And so, in this situation, so if you start from a compactly spot initial data, which has to be large enough in some sense, I'm not going into the details of that, then the solution is going to spread with speed C star in all directions. So, if you move at a speed which is less than C star, regardless of the direction, C star, regardless of the direction, you will see a solution goes to one. But if you move faster than C star, also regardless of direction, you will see the solution goes to zero. So another way to say this is the spreading shape is the ball of reduced C star. So it's, I call it here the normal spreading shape because everything is going in time, of course. But the level sets are located around C star T. The norm of X, I mean, the level sets are located around. I mean, the rebel set are located around the ball of a reduced C starting. So, if you normalize it in time, you just get the ball of reduced C start. So, what makes the picture in some sense easy in the Roman case is that the speed is the same in all directions. But in the sparsely paid case, and I will tell you a little more about it hopefully, the speed may depend on the direction. So, you get a slightly more complicated picture, which is that the spreading shape is no longer a bull. Planning check is no longer a robot check, but it's what is often referred to as the root check. So I don't have already a lot of time, so maybe I will just keep this. But you have this formula for the spinning speed. You can clearly see that if C star does not depend on P prime, then you just get that W star is equal to C star. So you recover what I just said in the Romance case. But when C star depends on the direction, then it's non-goverable. Than it. It's not non-goverable, so slightly more complicated spreading sheet. And so I want to briefly mention what could we do in the case when you have a providing turf. So here, of course, everything I wrote in this slide, I'm starting from the assumption that there is a unique term in front in all directions, otherwise it does not make that much sense. So could we get some kind of similar formula when there is a probability interval, which points? When there is a probability intervas which contains two fronts or even more than that. And so what I write here is some kind of a conjecture. So the difficulty is going to be that things depend on the direction. And so here I'm pretty confident in this conjecture, but anyway what is the conjecture? So assume that the speed things depend on the direction, but in But in not too bad way, basically. So I'm assuming that all speeds are positive because otherwise you will have no spreading if you start from compactly spot initial data. So this is a necessary condition. And assume that what I call the shape of the terrace here does not depend on the direction. So the platforms are the same in all directions. So in particular, if there is a unique charging wave going directly from one to zero in all directions, the platform does. The platform does not depend on the direction, but assume that there is, for instance, true fonts in all directions, and all those fonts connect the same telistates. So it's actually not always the case, as I will show in the next slide. But in this case, then we expect that the Frei-Gander formula will work, the formula which I gave in the previous slide will work more or less the same. And so I wrote it here, but basically you have a wolf shape, you have a formula between each platform. On each between each platform for each family of traveling fonts, and this will give you the spreading behavior of the solution. So, this is what I wanted slightly more details here. But again, maybe because I'm already a bit late, I'm sorry about it, but I will just go ahead already. And okay, so the issue is that, so in this case that I just mentioned, it seems that things are going rather smooth. Things are going rather smoothly, basically. But it turns out that this assumption that I mentioned about the platforms being the same in all directions, it's actually not true in general. And so, in this paper, first paper with Luca, we actually find a situation in 2D, but we couldn't have it in a higher dimension, of course, where the TARS has two fronts in direction 1, 0 and only one front in direction 0, 1. So we've So we have a formal result, a proof that such a situation truly occurs. But here I'm just showing you some numerics to illustrate this situation. So this figure is, it shows the solution starting from compactly spot initial data after some large time. And each color is a level set. And so basically, you can see if you go in the right direction, for instance, so in the middle part, you are orange, so you are close to one. You are orange, so you are close to one, but then you have on the far to right, you are close to you are close to zero, which is a blue color, not blue color, but you have some middle part which grows in time, where the colour gets purple, which means that you are converging to some other intermediate steady state. So this means that you have one front here and one second front here. So two fronts in the propagation, and if you have two fronts in the large time year of solution, you expect that you have also two fronts in the truss. And on the other hand, if you look at the vertical direction, you see that the purple zone. Vertical direction: you see that the purple zone is actually very small, which suggests that you are going directly from one to zero, so you have only one signal front in this vertical direction. Sorry, Toma, yes. Yes, sorry, sorry. So, okay, maybe I will just stop here and thank you very much for your attention. So, sorry about doing other things. Thank you. Thank you, Soman. Thank you. Thank you, Thomas. So maybe there is time for a very, very short question, if any. Otherwise, we directly go to the next speaker after three minutes stop. Okay, since we are already a bit late, so we directly stop here. Thank you again, Tomá. So we resume in So we resume in four minutes for the second talk. Thank you.
