So I have not prepared forty-five minutes, and that's how much time I've been slotted. The idea is that you interrupt me. Especially I hope that I'll say some things that are controversial. So especially if you disagree with something I'm saying, you should interrupt me. You'll be wrong, but you should still interrupt me. Now, certainly, of course, as you all know, it's a talk is much better with communication. Just having a short flat guy pontificating isn't nearly as exciting as seeing him get riled up because someone asked a hard question. Because someone asked a hard question. I must concede that it's a bit intimidating to speak to a room full of mathematicians about mathematical reasoning, especially when the focus for this week is mathematical reasoning from a math education perspective. And all of you have thought longer and deeper about math education than I have. So it certainly is a bit intimidating. But I'm going to forget all that and pretend that I'm an expert on it. But my discussion, things we're going to talk about, Discussion, the things we're going to talk about are certainly going to be very biased. And anyone that speaks about mathematical reasoning is going to give a very biased perspective for, well, lots of reasons. For one thing, there's this comping that we all know about in mathematics into at least two broad, ill-defined blogs, applied math and pure math. And a response to mathematical reasoning that an applied mathematician would give would be, you would expect to be different than what a pure mathematician would give. Different than what a pure mathematician would take. And it's really a spectrum, and it's not just a one-dimensional spectrum, there's lots of other things than pure and applied, but what I mean. Also, likewise, there's different styles for a mathematician. There's problem solvers. There's a blob of mathematicians that are more problem solvers. They focus on an individual question and pursue it until they crack it or give up on it and then move on to the next one. And there's theory building. Move on to the next one. And there's theory builders, people that don't give a shit about individual problems and just go on developing their structures and proceed from there. And of course, there's a spectrum between this, and there's other styles that are involved as well. But anyway, so we have these different things going on. So in order for you to see in what ways I'm biased, to maybe modulo out my biases, I regard myself. I regard myself as mostly a pure mathematician, but I'm interested in almost all the questions I work on are questions that were motivated, or at least you could argue, are motivated by physics. And although I love to theory build, my theory building is focused on there's a problem that I'm working on. So it's a problem that's going to take years for me to crack, five years, ten years for me. To crack five years, ten years, who knows? And in the process of working on this problem, I'll build the theory that I need to help attack this problem. So, in that sense, I'm a theory builder. All of us are theory builders, birds, I think Frison Dyson's word for that is, and frogs, things that hop around on the ground solving problems. We're all sort of a combination of those two. But mostly, I would say I'm a pure mathematician who's mostly a problem solver. So, those give you my. Problems. So, those give you my biases. Okay, I want to start with the thought. Everyone knows, all of us know, there's no doubt, that mathematics is very important and it's becoming more important. I'm noticing that this camera is doing weird things because I piece too much, especially when I'm a little bit uncertain. You can turn it off so you don't see yourself with people. Yeah, it's okay. It's mostly harmless. So, um. I just lost my train of thought. So, um, yeah, so we. My train of thought. So, yeah, so everyone knows that mathematics is very important and it's becoming surely becoming more important. So, you know, we're getting better and better at fighting wars largely because of our mathematics. Our companies are getting better and better at destroying the planet and the people on the planet using mathematics to make themselves more efficient. And there's good things that we do too, I suppose, with mathematics. So, mathematics is certainly becoming more and more important, there's no doubt about that. And more important. There's no doubt about that. Sports teams, we're in this Downing Cup playoffs now, and all those hockey teams, maybe the Leafs, are hiring mathematically and statistically trained people to help them ICE a better team. So mathematics is certainly very important. That's not something that's worth stating, even though I've just spent five or nine minutes talking about it. What is maybe something that's worth stating, but not stating too loudly, is that math courses are not important. Is that math courses are not important? We like to think that they are. We tell people that they are. We want people to say that they are because we want them to want our universities to hire more mathematicians. But the reality is, mathematics courses are not important, at least the ones that I've been associated with. Almost everything that I learnt as an undergrad, I've never used a treat substitution in my life outside of a classroom, for example. So my brother-in-law is. My brother-in-law is a physiotherapist. He's a very successful physiotherapist. And I was complaining about the courses that my kids are taking in school and how they're learning useless information about biology or whatever it is that they're learning. And he said, you know, Terry, I learned the quadratic formula in school and I've never used it outside of classrooms. So what we teach, almost everything that we teach in our Everything that we teach in our courses, in our math courses, I think it's fair to say, I certainly have no doubt, is useless. So, the good side about that is that we have some space in our courses. They've granted us all these hours to teach. We don't need to spell out integration techniques or how to invert matrices, at least not to the nauseating detail that most of us do. I'm sure some of you, this criticism does not apply. You, this criticism does not apply to you, but for some of you, I think it does apply. So, for example, I think I know that we're living in the golden time of mathematics. So, this is the most spectacular time to be a mathematician. Part of it is not our credit at all. We're living in a time when computing science is booming, when physics is kind of useless, but very interesting mathematically, stuff like that. So for example, it's not the golden time of fundamental physics. Of fundamental physics. That happened 100 years ago with Einstein and Heisenberg and the development of relativity and field theory. And now it's, well, those physicists are distracted by very interesting, coming up with very interesting math problems for mathematicians to do things. We're in the golden time of mathematics. And we've taught 10,000 students, undergraduates, this year. And I wonder how many of those students walked out of our undergraduate courses thinking, hey, Undergraduate courses thinking, hey, isn't it cool that this is the golden time for mathematics? I bet most of those students don't know that it's the golden time of mathematics. We have them for so many hours, and they've taken two or three or four or five math courses with us, and they come out of their undergraduate education not knowing that this is a special time for mathematics. So I don't know, there's something. I know that we're caught up in this exercise of Calt 1, you have to give them all the stuff that they need in order to succeed. Give them all the stuff that they need in order to succeed at Calc 2, and that means there's no time to talk about, and then Calc 3, and this treadmill of amazingness, truly amazingness. But surely we can do a better job, I think, than the job that we're doing right now. So what I would like to propose is a little bot experiment. Imagine that we were forced, Tudor came down with a new policy, and they're supposed to, all of us. And they're supposed to, all of us, all adults, are supposed to take a course on something that's totally different from anything that they've ever taken before. So maybe for me, my kids love dinosaurs. I loved dinosaurs when I was a kid. So maybe I would take a paleontology course. And so what would I like to learn in this paleontology course? I wouldn't want to learn. I don't care who discovered the first T-Rex skeleton or what year that was. I don't need to know the I don't need to know the morphological similarities and differences between theropods and sauropods and whatever else that you're probably going to spend some time learning about. Or even the evolutionary tree of humans. This is all stuff that probably I'll learn and it's not terrible, but it's not stuff that I'm excited about. What I want to learn about is what do you do as a paleontologist? Do you find a hill somewhere and you sit down and you start chipping away? How do you decide that hill? Have you decided that pill? How much of your day is spent digging around and looking for bones? When you find a bone, what do you do next? You go to the library or you watch videos on ostriches, how ostriches fly, and that helps you figure out how to put your skeleton together. These are kind of cool questions. What are the big issues in paleontology today? What are the controversies that are going on? Do these controversies ever get resolved in paleontology? It's not really a science, let's face it. So, how do these things get worked out? And it worked out. And so, and what are some of the big breakthroughs that have happened in paleontology in the last little while? So, dinosaurs, or birds are dinosaurs, that's pretty cool. What other cool things? So, I've learned some of these by watching videos with my kids, but I would love to hear a real professional paleontologist tell me these things. I would find that utterly fascinating. And I think most of us don't do that in our courses. Students come away with stuff that they're going to forget in 20 years. That they're going to forget in 20 years. So I'd forget about the morphological differences between varopods and sortopods, but I'll remember what this person tells me about the exciting controversies right now in paleontology. That would be pretty cool to hear. I don't think I'd ever forget. Most of what I teach my students are probably things they're going to forget. So I've decided to collect some, you know, to bring some order to my rambling. I'm going to collect my I'm going to collect my thoughts on mathematical reasoning into four headings. The first heading is precision. So of course, mathematics is precision. Now, we can find the antiderivative of 0% of the functions out there. More generally, solving differential equations of 0%, we can solve 0% of them. Percent of the time. We can find the roots of a polynomial zero percent of the time. So, when I say precision, I mean we actually do approximations all the time. We spend our time doing approximations. But our approximations are precise. More precisely, we understand the errors. We can estimate just how wrong our roots of this polynomial are. You can tell how many decimal places it's accurate to or whatever. And so, we have some controller for expanding some things, a Taylor series. Taylor series chunk 8 at some point, we know what the error is going to look like. So, our approximations are precise. So, that's what we mean by precision in mathematics. Or at least that's a small piece of what we mean by precision in mathematics, because mathematics is not just about numbers and functions and stuff like that. That's a small piece of mathematics. There's a whole conceptual side of mathematics. So, what role does approximation play in conceptual? Approximation plays in conceptual mathematics? Can anyone make a guess? What would you say? So we know what approximation means in evaluating some number. i equals 3.14159, 22 over 7 or whatever. So we have some, we know what that means. But what does it mean conceptually? When we approximate something conceptually, can anyone see a place where that occurs in mathematics? A famous place where that occurs in mathematics every day. Occurs in mathematics every day. Something like drawing a line? Something like what, sorry? Drawing a line? That wasn't what I had in mind. So, yeah, I see what you're saying. So you're saying this. Do you want a particular line? This is the real line, even though it has a thickness of about two millimeters and its length is about three quarters of a meter or something like that. It's certainly not the real line by any stretch of the imagination. No, I mean something more conceptual compound. So this is, yeah? Roll of analogy? Okay, that's good. Okay, that's good. So, these are things, all these things are going to touch on later. So, what I had in mind was if-then statements. So, most of our theorems are if-then theorems, or where the converse is not true. They're not if-and-only of. So, if and-only of theorem would be a zero-approxation thing. This thing over here is the same as equivalent to this thing over here. Those are usually not the interesting theorems. The interesting theorems are the ones where this is true, then this is true. This is true, then this is true. And you lose information when you're doing that, just like you lose information when you replace pi with 22 over 7. But these theorems are most important theorems because what they've done is you've lost information, but you've hopefully isolated some bits that are the interesting bits that weren't obvious in the way that you'd written it before. So I would say that's approximation, what approximation looks like in conceptual math. Anyways, so precision, even when we use approximation, Even when we use approximation, our approximation is precise. Now, this gets us to the whole idea of mathematical rigor and proofs. I think it's very, very, very easy to overestimate how important proofs are in mathematics. Proofs are not that important in mathematics, really. And so I would say that proofs are to mathematics what grammar is to Mathematics, what grammar is to literature. So if you read Shakespeare, I'd say there's no 300-page significant book which is grammatically correct, and that's not the important. What's important about the literature is the way the characters interweave. Maybe there's some dilemmas that are going on. I don't know. I don't know how to write a book, but it's But it certainly isn't about grammar. The challenge isn't to write 300 pages of something grammatically correct, and the point is not to write 25 pages of something that's mathematically rigorous, even though there's a hell of a lot of papers out there which do exactly that. The point of mathematics is to make connections, to interweave these connections between different objects and black. We all know what the point of math is. So it's very easy to overestimate the importance of proofs in. Of proofs in mathematics. So, other things that contribute to what I would call precision in mathematics are definitions. So, extraordinarily profound contributions to mathematics are definitions. So, for example, the definition of a continuous function, delta epsilon definition, is highly non-trivial. All of us know what a continuous function means. It means you can draw it without your pencil leaving the paper. Without your pencil leaving the paper. But to convert it into something precise, that was a pretty damn impressive stroke. And it was done relatively recently, sometime in the 1800s. That was when we came up with the definition of a continuous function. And another famous example would be the definition of a manifold. So that's a pretty cool definition, and it came even more recently around the turn of the century. So the definition of a manifold tells you how to describe something that has global structure, like a sphere. Has global structure, like a sphere or a torus or whatever, and it does it by patching together locally trivial things. Each one of these patches looks like a piece of R2, but the way that you sew them together allows you to completely capture everything there is to capture about your weird surface. So, as I say, that was a turn of the century. So, definitions are a fundamental part of mathematics. And I'm not sure if we emphasize that. We emphasize that in our classes. So, another extremely important part of mathematics is conjectures or visions. So, at least one of us here did their PhD on language program. So, language program is the deepest part. I think most people would say it's the deepest part of math. If that phrase has meaning, it's probably language program. By the way, language was a Canadian. It is. It is a Canadian, I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry. And so, from Vancouver, I think. So, anyways, so on a much, much, much smaller scale, this picture, this vision, conjectures are how we write up a proof. When it's a hard proof, a proof that's going to take a few pages, take a few weeks, or a few months, or a few years. We map out, like Langlands did, a sketch of how we could imagine. Did a sketch of how we could imagine the dots that you think we might be able to connect to. If I can get to this thing here, then I should be able to maybe get into here, and then I'm inching my way closer to... So you do that with this tapestry of guesses and conjectures and stuff like that. Also, coincidences. So maybe this isn't exactly an example of precision, but it's how you develop precision. So another Canadian, John Mackay, noticed. Mackay noticed about 45 or 55, how much? These two numbers are almost the same. And he put this in Christmas cards to famous mathematicians, Fields Medalist. John Conway was one of them, John Thompson, Fields Medalist, saying, Isn't it cool? Isn't it wonderful? Isn't it amazing that these two numbers? Isn't it amazing that these two numbers are so incredibly close? And so, of course, there's a context to this. One number occurs in group theory, something far over here, and the other one is a group theory from around this time, the 1970s. And this one here comes from math that's 350 years old, modular function, mother of all modular functions. Revolve modular function. So, this is how this started. Something that building the bridge between these two worlds got a mathematician, being a participant in building this bridge, got the main protagonist of the story a Fields Medal a few years later. So this is starting with something so simple as this. A simple little coincidence begat a very interesting mathematics, very precise mathematics. So there's much, much, much more precision in mathematics. So there's much, much, much more precision in math than exact equations. This integral, this integral, indefinite integral equals blah plus c, don't forget the plus c, and or rigorous proofs. There's much more what's going on in math than math. Okay, the next thing I want to talk about is out of scratch. This has to be mentioned. So math matters. So, mathematics is so exciting because you have the power of abstraction, you have the pervasiveness of abstraction, you have the notoriety of abstraction. And so abstraction is a good thing. Abstraction is inevitable. It's an inevitable consequence of understanding something. So, like, some examples of abstract, like, this happens all over the place. Like, this happens all over the place. We saw in Raphael's talk today about number, how non-trivial the abstraction of number, that we call number, is. And there's lots of other examples. So this turn I had to teach the fundamental theorem of calculus, like many of you. And this is a highly non-trivial step. You're saying, think about this complicated beast here. Think of this as a function of x, and then differentiate it. You're going to get something simple a little bit. You're going to get something simple. That's a pretty impressive abstract step there that we're telling our students to do. So, abstraction happens all over the place, in small steps and then big steps. But it's absolutely an inevitable consequence of how we understand things. So, it happens in all other areas, of course, not just math. So, I'm not a cook. I'm not a good cook, as you'll discover in about 30 seconds or so. But one time when I was at home with my kids, there were I was at home with my kids. They were young, I have twins, and one of them was sick. And this sick kid wanted a peanut butter sandwich. This was the only thing that would shut the brat up, was a peanut butter sandwich, which is easy enough to do, even me being not a good cook, can come up with a peanut butter sandwich, except we had no bread. And so we had peanut butter. We had no bread. And so, but being a human being capable of abstract thought, I reasoned. Of abstract thought. I reasoned that what is bread other than tasteless starch? In Germany, it's not tasteless starch, but in North America, for the most part, it's tasteless starch. So, what's another example of tasteless starch? Pasta or potatoes, there's all kinds of other examples of them. So, what I did is we had leftover mashed potatoes in the fridge. So, we had a peanut butter smoothie. And so I told my son, I had something better at this time than a peanut butter sandwich. I had a peanut butter smoothie. And actually, I think it tasted pretty good. But yeah, to use the pasta idea, you could do the same with all, you could do the same thing all the time. People like ketchup and french fries. Well, why not? French fries, what are French fries? They're tasteless starch. And so we've learned that tasteless starch is the same as pasta. These are all part of the same little group. And so we put ketchup. Group and so put ketchup on pasta. Maybe you also want the vinegar kind of cuts the grease, so maybe you fry your pasta and then put ketchup on it. I've never tried that. Actually, I don't really like ketchup, but I bet it would be okay. I'm sure my kids would like it. At least it's a multi-so, this is an example, a bad example, of abstraction. Of abstraction, that's right. Because bread or pasta or mashed potatoes are part of this. Potatoes are part of this blob called tasty starch. And so there's this blob here, and that's what abstraction is. So when we understand something in anything, whether it's curling, or maybe curling is a good example, but cooking or mathematics, when you understand something, you start to lift things up to a different level. And that different level is things become interchangeable, this is creative, and it's a good thing, and it's a And it's a good thing, and it's a naturally, instinctively, wonderfully human activity. And we do it all of the time in math. So, in math, it's so easy to come up with piles and piles of examples of some phenomena, and we collect these examples using abstraction. And so, it helps us see the patterns that are going on and forget about the details that aren't so vitally important. Important. So, when we understand something, we move from the particular, tasteless piece of bread, to the general. So, for example, why is the sky blue? So today, it's not very blue, but sometimes it's blue. Why is the sky blue? Does anyone know how to answer that question? It's not a trick question. It's just question: Why is the sky blue? Diffusion. Diffusion, right. It's the way that light interacts with gas. And so why does light interact with gas that way? Well, basically Maxwell's equations. So it comes down to Maxwell's equations. And so we're answering a very specific question with generalize it by talking about these scientific principles. We're entering the general. We're entering the general, going into the more abstract realm. You go to Maxwell's equations, where it's just, I don't know, five equations or thereabouts that capture all kinds of other things as well. So we're making massive progress when we do this kind of abstraction. As we go more general, things generally get simpler. But as a consequence, they get more abstract. So that's all that's going on in math: as things are getting simpler, as we're doing. As things are getting simpler, as we're doing a natural human activity, abstraction, things are just getting more abstract. So, maybe why students have issues with abstraction in mathematics is because we rush it, perhaps. I don't know. You guys will know better than me. But I would say that abstraction is a consequence of understanding, in, for example, mathematics. It's not the goal of mathematics. You can't force it. I would say that. I would say that the point is not to create your abstract principles, your big wonderful theorems. The point is, that's part of it. What you've now done is you've created new tools for you. The point is to be able to also go in the other direction and to go from your wonderful abstractions, your wonderful if-then theorems or whatever, and then apply it to things that are much more concrete. So go from the general. More concrete. So go from the general to the particular. If you don't do that, then that's a poor mathematics. That's a poor instance of abstraction. You want to be able to mix peanut butter with your mashed potatoes. That's a good sign. If all you're doing is just clustering together these blobs in the ether, what value is that? So, for example, you could tell a pitcher: imagine that you're hired by some baseball team. And some pitcher asks you, you're a pretty smart guy. Pitcher asks you, You're a pretty smart guy, you're a mathematician, why am I pitching so poorly? And so you tell them, Well, that's just Newtonian physics. Well, maybe some biophysics. And you walk away. Well, that's abstraction taken to the stupid extreme. What you want to be able to do is use your understanding of Newtonian physics, use your understanding of biophysics, and tell this person something. Maybe they. Something maybe they don't really love baseball, so I don't really love biophysics here. But that's why I would never be hired by baseball team. Is there anything you can do to help the Winnipeg Jets? Yeah, I agree. That's uh yeah, I don't know. Actually, Terry works for you. Yeah, so um abstraction happens. Abstraction happens and it's good when it happens, but it's not the goal. It's not the end. Okay, so let's talk to something else. We like to think math is universal. It's timeless. It's timeless. And this is an important thought. So, for example, I'm not going to waste too much of my time asking on some question that talks about the digits of some number, because that's a base 10 thing, and we might be the only intelligent species in this corner of the galaxy that uses base 10. So, I'm never going to, I don't think anyone seriously is going to worry about questions like: tell me properties of cosine. Of cosine of p degrees where p is some prime number. This, there's nothing probably that's interesting. These are transcendental numbers, and they're random transcendental numbers. There's nothing special about this. The reason is because degrees, 360 degrees in a circle, that's an Earth thing. 360 is a massively divisible number. That's close to 365, the number of days that our planet takes to go around the sun. And so a different planet will, you know. And so a different planet will, you know, they might choose 120 or 90 or who knows what would be the the na you know, the silly units that they choose from the degree. The real degree units, as we know, is radians. So the right question would be something like, what can you tell me about these numbers where p is any prime? This does have problems. You can say interesting theorems about these numbers. And so what guides you to throw away this and look at something like this is the idea that math should be universal. idea that math is math should be universal so we like to think that intelligent intelligent clouds of bacteria in a saline sea under the surface of Mars let's pretend those are really bright these blobs of bacteria and they're capable of high math then we would like to think that that in fact we do think this is how we're supposed to communicate with extraterrestrials is through mathematics they're supposed to know about prime numbers and elementary mathematics and And elementary mathematics, and probably better math than us. We finally can talk to them, we can ask them to come up with that one-margin-long proof of Fermat's last theorem. So that's what we all believe, that math is timeless and universal. But the reality is math is not timeless and universal. And so the reason is because we've known this for 2,000 years or more. And the reason is because statements aren't of absolute statements in math aren't. Aren't of absolute statements in math aren't of absolute validity, they're valid with respect to an axiomatic system. So we have to agree ahead of time on some list of axioms before we can agree on consequences. The angles of a triangle sum up to 360 degrees is something that's not true in non-employed geometry. So here's a slightly controversial example. So we teach our students, most of us, many of us teach our students. Most of us, many of us, teach our students math on that. And I don't know what your experience of this is, but some students get it probably because they saw it in high school or they saw it from a better instructor at university. But some of the students really struggle with this. And they bomb the exam question that's on this and everything else. And maybe part of the problem is I didn't respect enough subtleties in this. On the subtleties of this. This was so, why is mathematical induction true? It's probably a good sign that a student is concerned about mathematical induction. They're not completely willing to buy it as a way to prove. By this point in the course, you're telling them this is rock-solid proofs in math. This is not like a court of law or physics course or something like that. This is different. And then we present them something like mathematical ducts. So mathematical conduction is an axiom. It's one of the piano's axioms. Piano's axioms. This is vaccines, as you all know. You heard about it in Raphael's talk. That happened around the turn of the 20th century. And this is one of the axioms. So it's defined to be true. And so we shouldn't, you know, it's kind of meant to be something that can question. You're allowed to question an axiom. And so it's something that we should explain and motivate. So mathematical induction arguments existed. The ancient Greeks did them. But the ancient Greeks did all kinds of things that were kind of mathematically. We're kind of math about it in a bit dubious. And so it is something that we should do a better job explaining, I think. Like explain to them what the natural numbers are and how this is accepted as just help you come up with what the properties of the natural numbers are and use something like mathematical induction to rule out some of the sick demographics. Some of the sick, the not quite natural numbers. They're out there. Anyways, so a better example, a less controversial example of the social convention that is math. So I claim that math is a massive component of mathematics that's a social convention. So another example of this, a very famous example, proofs by contradiction. And so, again, students struggle with the legitimacy of this. Legitimacy of this. And they're right to struggle. The students that question this are probably the better students. They're the one who should question this, actually. And in fact, there's professional mathematicians that don't believe in proofs by contradiction. The intuitionalists. So all I'm saying is we have to, we like to pontificate and say this is truth, this is true. You can use proofs by induction or proofs by contradiction, but this is an agreement that we all. Contradiction, but this is an agreement that we all have. A significant example in higher algebra classes is the XM of choice. So, Zorn's lemma is used to prove several things, and it's not this controversial thing. Not everyone today believes in XM of Choice Zorn's lemma. So, another example, I don't want to waste too much time on this kind of stuff, is everyone knows that 0.99 repeating equals 1, right? Everyone knows this. Except maybe the first time you show this to someone, if they haven't seen it in high school, then they might start. Haven't seen it in high school. Then they might start questioning it. They might say, well, if you subtract it, you get something that has a lot of zeros, that's for sure. I'm not even sure how many, that's how many there are. But certainly more than the five or so that I really can nail down. But eventually there's going to be a one at the end. But why aren't they right? So this is, why couldn't it be infinitesimal? Why couldn't this be, so that we might call it epsilon, and one over epsilon is equal to an omega to infinity and blah blah blah. Omega to infinity and blah blah blah. This is completely consistent with mathematics. It's not consistent with the axioms of real numbers, but. And so we write down these things glibly and we tell them things like, well, 0.33333, that equals 1 third. We multiply both sides by 3, or we use the geometric series sum. And so you end up with some glib arguments where you're pushing down our students' intuitions and fears and stuff. Math is a social convention. We accept when we talk about real numbers like one. But real numbers like one, we accept certain axioms. So we should be a little bit honest with them. We don't have to give them all of the completeness axiom and stuff like that, but we can at least be honest with them to say that the would-be people, maybe this bright bacterial clouds in Mars will have a different view for them. The natural thing are infinitesimal quantities, and they calculate this a hell of a lot easier. They'll struggle to understand how we humans are considered. We humans are insistent on this strange thing that we call the real numbers. Okay, let's leave that behind. Let's move on to the final topic, which is the process of doing math. Okay, so maybe the, I'm not sure what the typical view of doing math is for a non-mathematician, but Mathematician, but perhaps it's something like this. You sit around, I'm talking about pure math now, I'm talking about helping NASA do whatever NASA is doing. So you come up with some hard problem, maybe Pfizer gave it to you or you stumbled on it yourself, and you sit down in a chair with a big stack of scrap paper and a large garbage can and a few pens, and you start. You ask the question, okay. Ask the question, okay, how do I prove this? Don't forget a calculator. And you have to have a calculator. So I think that's not the way most of us do math. So I'm not talking about Math Olympiad classrooms, that's a totally different game. I'm talking about when you're actually trying to create mathematics. The way I think that you create mathematics is you've been working on some problems you have solved. You've been working on some problems. You have some problems in the back of your head. You've been thinking about them for five, ten years, maybe. And you're at a conference in a beautiful place in McDonald's, and you're sitting down beside someone and they're talking about what they're working on. And you drift away because it's not terribly interesting, to be frank. But they say something that kind of seems intriguing. Or you're wandering through a library to check up some book to find an example for your calculus class or something. And you stumble on some book with a weird title and you crack it open. Book with a weird title, and you crack it open, and just by accident, you start to notice some weird things. You might attend someone's talk at a conference like this and hear them talk about something you don't know anything about, but it's analogous. It seems structurally analogous to what you know something about. Anyways, there's just these little hints of little clues that come up, that you have little threads that you can just pull on. Pull on, and most of the time when you pull on them, nothing happens. These two numbers turn out to just be some coincidence. That's all that it is. But sometimes you get some interesting action. You pull the thread, and the thread keeps coming and coming, and something is happening. It becomes an interesting metaphor on this thing that you have. This person that you're talking to, you start asking him questions or her questions, and she can. Questions, and she can tell you things that are probably true about your problem just based on analogy with what she's working on or whatever. So that's, I think, the way that math is actually done. Little clues like that. And so then you sit down in your comfortable chair with lots of scrap paper and a few pens and a large garbage can. But now you have some place to start. You know a context. You know that it's analogous to what's going on in geometry. Analogous to what's going on in geometry over here. Or if you have a book on that geometry topic and you start to read it with the perspective of trying to apply it to your particular problem. But another thing that is certainly true of doing math is that math isn't a religion in the sense that there never is one way to go from point A to point B. That's why students have such a hard time learning how to do proofs because there seems to be 20 Groups, because there seems to be 20 trillion different ways to try to connect this statement to this statement. And which one do I take? Eventually, they'll get some intuition and it's great on this, but at the beginning, there's just too many trails. And that's the way that the math is. You can't say that I'm going to force this to work. I'm going to use whatever Taylor series to solve this problem, and I'm going to ignore all their clues. You have some bitter rival on the other end of the country, somewhere in Toronto, probably. And um and so you uh so that person uses some other technique, but you refuse to use that technique. That's not mathematics. So in math you use whatever. Math, doing math is like a street fight, really. And so in a street fight you might have your preferred weapon, maybe a switchblade or something like that. But in your street fight you sometimes can't use it for whatever reason. It might be kicked away. And so then you grab whatever. It might be a rock, or it might be a handful of sand, whatever. Be a handful of sand, whatever. You use whatever you can in the street fight, and that's what you use when you're doing math. You're declaring war on something, and you use whatever you can to solve it. There's lots of different methods and techniques to follow to get there, and you follow them all. Like an electron follows all these different paths. You do the same in your attempt to crack the problem. So that's what I think doing math is all about. I think that the classical maybe picture is a little bit too naive. Too naive. So, I'd like to end my talk with a metaphor that I think captures what I think of doing math as. So, for me, this metaphor is: imagine that you're in a park and there's lots of trees all around, and you're just wandering through this park, and you see a squirrel. I don't know about you, but I've never caught a squirrel before. That would be a fun thing to tell my kids about when I get home. And so I start chasing after the squirrel. And so I start chasing after the squirrel, I tiptoe slowly at first, and then I start dashing when I think I'm getting close enough. And the squirrel zigs just when I was about to pounce on it, and it zags again, and whatever. And so this goes on for quite a while. And I'm sure you've seen me this morning. And so there I am, zigging and zagging while the squirrel is zagging and zigging. And eventually the squirrel gets tired of this activity and climbs a tree. A four-human? Yeah. Yeah. So I'm running around zigzagging after the squirrel. And what I get to, because the tree bowed squirrel is way too high. It's chirping at me. The other squirrels are chirping at me. And so I leave. And so that's what doing math is all about, I would say. And so in math, the squirrel is the little idea that you had. So maybe this idea that you've got this little thread that you start to pull. And maybe you got it from a conversation with someone. That maybe you got from a conversation with someone at dinner. The tree is the theorem that you're going to end up with. And you have no idea, when you start chasing this squirrel, what theorem you're going to get. No one knows. But you know that there's a good chance that chasing the squirrel will never catch the damn squirrel. But you will find a tree. The squirrel will help you find a tree. So that, I think, is what math's all about. That's it. Thank you very much, Terry. We have some time for questions. Any questions about what Dr. Terry told us about? Thank you, thank you for your talk. So, I just have a bunch of questions, but I just want to focus on one or a comment/slash question on social conventions. So, there are conventions like the colors of the US dollars that happen to be green. That's a convention that could have been red or blue, and the economy would more or less work the same way. Euros, different colors for different amounts, and so on. Driving on the right side or the left side, those are conventions which not change the activity. Change the activity in a fundamental way that we're taking to funding. Now, in math, there are certain conventions, of course. You talk about definitions. One convention slash definition would be, for example, zero factorial equals one. Sure. You define that, conventional, and so on. Exactly. But there are certain things that are constrained such that the conventions are not doable in a certain way. For example, division by zero. For example, division by zero, which would be great not to have that exception every time we write something and say blah blah blah, except for it, right? So if it was just conventions, then why not we find a convention for it if we want to eliminate exceptions and so on. So it is social convention, I love that idea, of course, but there's constraints to the conventions and that makes math different from other types of human activity. From other types of human activity. Absolutely. It's different from like poetry where you could imagine a world, or science fiction, where you could imagine a world where you could divide it. You can divide by zero, it's called projective geometry. So you just don't get normal arithmetic. But you still get the magic of going off to infinity and fundamental importance in understanding what's happening to your curve or your shape when you're at infinite points at infinity. So there always is a journey. So there always is a germ of. So we know we can't take square roots of negative numbers, but actually you can broaden it out to complex numbers. You lose certain things, like order, you know, your order for complex numbers, but you get a very rich thing. If you divide by zero, then you're going to have problems with distributivity and stuff like that. But you do get other things. So you lose the arithmetic properties, but you do get a totally meaningful coordinate system, sort of Cartesian coordinates, if you want to call it, homogeneous coordinates. Homogeneous coordinates, where it's of fundamental importance. So, but absolutely. So, mathematics is constrained ultimately by rigor. But what I mean by social dimension is just that, in the not so exciting thing about whether you define P. So everyone knows what a prime is. Those are the numbers that are only divisible by plus or minus 1n itself. So 1n itself. But then 1. So one in itself, but then one is a prime number. And so then you get, you have to decide: is one a prime number? Is the group with one element a simple group? You have all these stupid examples. So is a field with one element a field? So these are stupid, these are not very exciting examples. But when it comes down to axiomatic systems, so I think probably any intelligence. So the question I would ask is: an intelligent species on a totally different planet, so they are not on some rocky planet like ours. Rocky planet like ours, where visual is the main sensory apparatus, but something that's totally like even a dolphin. Would dolphins have invented real numbers? I don't know. I don't know the answer. Well, you need symbolic reference. That's right. So actually, now I'm even less certain about that. But so there's some parts of mathematics that are so fundamental to our mathematics that I honestly am not sure. Sure, this part, and we're already our math is still quite young, even though it's really blossoming right now. There's things like, as I said, the action of choice where people don't agree. I don't know. So that's what I sort of mean by social convention. So for the most part, probably dolphins will know about piano's acts in. They probably will believe in methodological induction. What I kind of meant by this partly is that students, so our students, we should give them a little bit of. We should give them a little bit of credit. I mean, not just cut them a little bit of slack that they could be struggling with some of these notions because they're it's easy for us because we've drank the Kool-Aid. You know, we're part of this society. Even we like to think of ourselves as loners or whatever. We're part of this community. We've adopted these preventions. We know that. But students haven't done this quite yet. And so we should just cut a little bit of thought. That's kind of what I meant by this. But I think that in math, we are severely constrained by logic, but that isn't. By logic. But that isn't. I mean, there still is lots of legal room going on. So thanks for coming. So you dismiss proofs as being not that important to mathematics, and you lionise definitions as being fundamental. Yeah, we better proofs. What extent the definition is merely the collection of objects to which that proof applies? Oh, no, definition is much more. So definition is telling you. So, definition is telling you, like, look at the definition of continuity. So, we all know what continuous functions are, at least we think we don't, long before the delta epsilon definition came into being, or whenever it came into being. But that made it precise, that made it amenable to proving things. How can you prove something rigorously by saying that it's something you can trace with a pencil? So the intermediate value theorem becomes a button. Ethereum becomes above the x-axis, and then I have to cross, like things just become a little bit trickier. So, no, partly I'm trying to be controversial. So, proofs are, of course, an important part of math, just like grammar is an important part of language. Without grammar, then we're not going to be comprehensible to each other. Be more specific then. I mean, Lakatosh's discussion of the definition of polyhedron via the collection of examples and the proofs and so on. Collection of notes and the proofs, or something. Where do you stand on that? Oh, I don't know. So, is this proof to reputation? Yes, I loved that book, but that was a long time ago that I read it, so I'm going to have a sort of, I'm going to not quite remember. Yeah, so for me, a definition is something that takes a paragraph in a textbook or maybe two paragraphs. Like, for me, it's something very concrete. It's much more than just a collection of examples. It's something that, so it's something like the Del Capslan proof of continuity, where definition of. Or definition of a group, or like it's something that is a concrete collection of phrases that isolate some particular class of things. It's the abstraction step. So it's giving a name to some cluster of things that maybe you never thought of as all belonging to the same abstract beast. So I wouldn't say that proofs are less important than definitions. I mean, I probably said that, but they're all part of the same big application. They're all part of the same big happy family. And I think that we vastly exaggerate. We're talking in our study group, as you'll find out on Friday, we're talking about what, like you guys are as well, what mathematical reasoning is all about. And I think it's to have a course on introduction to proofs, that's just missing the whole point. It should be an introduction to mathematical reasoning. Proofs are a big part of that, but there's other big parts of that too, and you can't divorce them. And for students that are scared of math, And for students that are scared of math to focus in on the scariest bit of this, I think that's bad pedagogically and it's bad mathematically, to be blunt. So, definitions, for example, like mathematical reasoning is the process of, it's what mathematicians do. That's what it is. And we conjecture and we approximate and we guess and we define and we prove and we do all kinds of things. And proofs are just a small part of it. But we focus on it because that's what distinguishes us from physicists and scientists and chemists. And being scientists and chemists and poets and whatever else, that's why. But it's, but you know, we're humans first and foremost in touch. So there's a whole hell of a lot more going on to us than coming up with proofs. So proofs are what I, you know, that's, I write my papers and I want to have non-trivial proof in there and stuff like that. There's much more to math from proofs, and we sure don't act like it in many of the courses that we teach. I'm not saying you guys. That we teach. I'm not saying you guys, but me more generally. Me excluding you guys, I'm sure you feel you gave two very different examples of social conventions. The first was about what you called universality, what I would label as taste. The first question is tasteless, and the second one is entrance. And the second one is interesting or has value. And I totally agree that's personal. But do you think that having good taste is a social convention? You said universal, but that sounds wrong to me. Right, so I'm probably not using the right words. Like, I'm not very good at varying things in advance, and so I sort of start to throw out words and thoughts and criticisms and whatever. And criticisms or whatever without really meaning. But what I, yeah, so the way that I would, so taste is certainly a social convention. But I would say that this isn't just a matter of taste. I would say that that's a dumb thing to do mathematically. Because it's using, it assumes what's important, what's meaningful, is what's sort of, what I would say universally meaningful, is this little circle on top, the notion of a degree, and that isn't. Degree and that isn't. That's based on some weird choice Babylonians made a long time ago. And there's a reason they made it, and 365 days in a year, and 360 has lots of numbers dividing it, and blah, blah, blah. But this is a question that those bacteria on Mars are surely going to be on an algebra exam or something. Do you guys think so? Yeah, I think so. I think any creature. Any creature, do you think that they will have geometry, algebra, analysis, combined? Because I just like not long ago, you can see how contradictory I am. Self-contradictory. So not long ago, I said the real numbers are eight fantasy. And now I'm saying cosine is a meaningful function. So yeah, so you have to be careful. But at least I would argue that this one is more universal than this one. So this one, no other creature in the galaxy probably. Um, in the unit, in the galaxy, probably would ask this question, you know, something equivalent to this question. Whereas it's possible to imagine other creatures, like I would say, creatures that grew up on a stony planet probably will learn eventually to ask that question. So, yeah, I mean, we kind of tend to think that mathematical reasoning is important, but as you pointed out, it's based on social convention. Like, we're all based on some axioms, and we just decide that these axioms are targeted. And you could think that we think it's important that that's exactly something present the way we think. But Guy Rappel told us this morning that actually humans don't see. Or maybe should we emphasize more in our course the dependence on the absence and the whole thing too? I don't know. Yeah, like I'd say kind of a lot, you know, I think that we all, you know, I think that probably the natural I think that probably the natural numbers are a pretty universal thing, probably. But I think that we just have to appreciate the fact that it's not, these things aren't kind of self-evident. This is an axiom. Mathematical conduction is an axiom. It's one of Giano's axioms. And so it's not something that is supposed to be obvious or whatever. It's supposed to be something that comes about if you stare at what the natural numbers are long enough, then you'll come up with a notion of mathematical deduction. And that's not the way that I teach it. So I'm embarrassed to say. So next time I teach. I'm embarrassed to say. So next time I teach it, I'll do a better job. But I think that we undervalue. So, as far as teaching goes, I think that we probably undervalue the social convention, that we've already drunk the Kool-Aid, we've already bought into some of our conventions, and a lot of things that we do so effortlessly and mindlessly is going to be just a bit of a jump for a student because they haven't completely bought into those conventions yet. And that's a good thing, we should not discourage them. And that's a good thing. We should not discourage them from that. If they're going to start to self-doubt themselves, if they're not as good at math as they thought they were, if they start to wonder, everyone else is nodding their head, 0.9 repeating, of course, that equals 1. Three people shouted out before I got to finish the equation because they knew this already. They were talking about it in school. But it's actually not an obvious thing, and it's something that does deserve some discussion. So I'm just, I don't know, like I just say that I don't think I'm I'm as aware of social convention in mathematics in a meaningful way, not in a silly way like one is a prime number or not, but in a really meaningful way. I don't think I'm as aware of this as I should be. But that's what I would just say. The next time I teach this and someone struggles, squints, a good student or not so good student, I don't know, someone's squinting at it, then I won't just sort of repeat what I just said, put it in a louder voice. Put in a louder voice. I'll try to do a better job at trying to justify the natural numbers, what the natural numbers are, the way that we mean when we say natural numbers is the following. You don't need to get into Kano's axioms, but at least appreciate that it's a... Maybe. Maybe it's fun to actually study what happens if you have a price. Yeah, right. Yeah, I have a comment on this induction, and this is 0.99. And this is 0.999. Both are my favorite questions. First of all, induction is part of the piano axioms. I think that it is only part of the story because for many people, the piano axioms don't have anything to do with the natural numbers. You may be satisfied by saying that the natural numbers are 0, 1, 2, etc. Etc. That's it. And then you may ask, what about induction? And then the answer could be that this induction lies in etc. And then you may approach natural numbers via the Piano's axiom, okay, then there is induction. But you also may define natural numbers at spherically. And again, in all these cases, ways of laboratory natural numbers, you are not. Numbers, you are not able to prove induction because induction is part of what you mean by 0.999 is very nice to discuss because people have various arguments why it is true and various arguments why it is false. And then it could discuss on what now. Actually, all these arguments have arguments have big holes in them. And so the real, so to say, real question in my opinion is what does this 0.999 etc. mean? What do this any end of the decimal mean? Because we speak very clearly about them, but we never have stopped to think what we are meaning. Right, so unless you're really dealing with completeness axiom and what limits mean and stuff like that, which at this stage you don't know. At this stage, you don't know. So it's, yeah, there's subtlety to this kind of stuff. And I think that I'm too clip myself with more than I trained cool stuff. And also, in terms of social convention, are just the terms like definition, theorem, and so on themselves, right? Because it's not very hard to find students who get mixed up between the difference between a definition and a theorem, although to us, it could work, right? But that's a statement about some math thing, that's a statement about some math thing, right? They might come with different colored boxes. It might come with different colored boxes in the book, but questions? Yes. Just a little empirical contribution to the math induction thing. So with one of my grad students, we did an experiment in which we set up a situation with these are undergrad students at the university level, and they had to run some induction proofs, and they picked that correctly and so on. But then there were. Correctly, and so on. But then they were supposed to explain a visual proof with the sum of the first odd numbers being n squared. And they had to explain that in a TikTok video type to some person on the other side of the planet, New Zealand, Australia, or something like that. And they could not use the algebraic notation, so they had to explain beyond words and so on. It's amazing how poorly they did to explain that. Poor they did to explain that, but moreover, then we tested the conviction, the degree of being convinced about their own explanation. So, we said that there was a recent article by a mathematician in Europe who showed that, in fact, there were exceptions to some of the statements. Some not, for example, there's no largest natural number, they would agree with that, but there were many others, including the one for the addition for the first. Addition for the first n odd numbers. And most of them agreed that when the numbers were really big, then there would be exceptions. So the question is, it's not so natural, the whole natural number story about the induction part. And this, now we did empirically, so we ran with different conditions and so on. And these were university students. So just to throw that in, to say that they might feel away about. Say that they might feel that way about any math proof, but they kind of haven't. Like, there's that old physics experiment where you take this massive, heavy ball, and you have someone standing there with this massive heavy ball on a pendulum, just this massive, heavy ball, and then you let go of it and it swings. It takes forever to get to the other side. Slows down, stops. And it starts picking up speed, picking up speed. And it's this massive, I don't know if I told you this, but it's a massive, heavy ball that's coming closer and closer to your face. To your face, and very few people won't flinch. I'm sure I would run. So we just don't, when it comes right down to them, we don't have much faith in science. Comment about proofs. I once heard a talk given by Tommy Dreipus, who is rather well known mathematical education researcher, and it was about a study of It was about a study of proofs and there were various questions related to different aspects of what the proof means. And then the reactions of the students who were tested were completely contradictory. And very far from the beautiful idea of a mathematician that when you have a proof, then you know it. So that's what hopefully we would help. So that's what hopefully we would help train them in our introduction to mathematical reasoning course. Okay, well, thank you very much. Thank you, Kelly. Okay, so I'm going to wrap up today.
