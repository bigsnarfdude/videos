Mostly today I'm going to tell you about three bubbles. Sometimes I will tell you about two bubbles. And I have this subtitle called a foam hadron collider. So I'm going to explain the subtitle to you. For those of you that are not experts on high energy physics, which includes me, ordinary matter is made up of three quarks. Either protons or neutrons are made up of three quarks. You build this big machine under the Durham Albums in Switzerland and you bomb up. In Switzerland, and you bombard two quarks together going very, very quickly. They form this thing called a weak vector boson. This is called a Feynman diagram for those of you who haven't seen one before. The weak vector bosons then collide and form something called a Higgs boson. And then the Higgs boson is this magic particle there from out. And then they break up into bottom parks. It's lovely science. The electricity bill is very high. I don't get grants that big. My research grants together that big. That. So instead of doing three quarks, I'm going to do something much cheaper, which is three bubbles. So I'm going to be talking about foams, and I'm going to be talking about foams flowing in channels. So foams are non-Newtonian fluids, and channels are like porous media, so sort of this fits the film of the conference. And I'm particularly going to be interested in when bubbles exchange their neighbours. They undergo things called T1 topological transformations. So all the talk is going to be about these T1 topological transformations. Transformations. When bubbles rearrange, the structure changes its mobility, so it changes its pressure to velocity relationship. That means it's non-Newtonian, so it really is a non-Newtonian for it moving in a channel which is a bit like a paul's nominal. Okay, so what really inspired this work was stuff that was done almost 20 years ago now by Nikka Drenkin. And she looked at bubbles flowing in a channel. So, what you're looking at. A channel. So, what you're looking at there, you're looking at it from above. There's a glass plate, a rubber sheet on top of the glass plate. You cut a track in the rubber sheet and another glass plate on top. So it really is a helix all cell. And you've got these bubbles in this zigzag fashion. If it moves slowly, the bubbles come out in the same order, but they don't come. If it moves quickly, what happens is if the bubbles on the inside track The bubbles on the inside track overtake the bubbles on the outside track. Why does that happen? It all happens due to viscous drag. If you're on the outside track and you want to keep up, you have to move faster, but you've got viscous drag relative to the plates. Your viscous drag gets bigger as you get faster, and eventually the viscous drag gets so big that the capillary forces can't hold the structure together, so the structure breaks apart. You can see that in experiments, you can see that in simulations with. See that in simulations with the viscous froth model. So, what Drendcken effectively did was design a cyclotron or foam cyclotron. I don't want to do a cyclotron, I want to do something called a linear collider. So there's geometric asymmetry in Drinking's problem. There's an outside track and an inside track. I want to do something different. I want to do something topological asymmetry. So, what I mean by topological asymmetry. What I mean by topological asymmetry is unequal numbers of films attaching to one unit or another. So as you're still looking at down this room above, this structure that we call a lens, because it looks like half of a lens, it's the hydrogen atom of photophysics, if you like. There's two films forming a bubble and one film attaching to the opposite side of the channel. I'm going to call the upper channel wall, I'm going to call the upper channel wall, the lower channel wall. Remember though, that. Lower channel wall, remember though, that you're really looking at this downcomb, so those are really side walls. I've got topological asymmetry because I've got two films on one side, I've got more drag, and what happens when I start moving this quickly is that that bubble is left behind, and this film starts moving. So the bubble that's left behind is really how it can move. It gets stuck. And one film moves another. What we do know, however, is if we have an infinite number of bubbles, it never breaks. You can move it very, very quickly. Breaks, you can move it very, very quickly, and the structure is moving without breaking. So, how can we find a bridge between the lens that always breaks, the infinite staircase that never breaks? What we decided we were known to break through bubbles. And the question is, are three bubbles going to break or are they not going to break? That's the question we're going to try and answer today. Three is a difficult one. We know that in science. Newton tried, he did gravity and he did the sun and the earth. And he did the Sun and the Earth, and that was fine. And then he did the Earth and the Moon, and that was fine. And then he put the three things together, and it was too hard for me. This problem, I sort of deceived this problem, I guess, about 2006. It was too hard for me for a very long time. And so I've got this very bright graduate student who's Carlos Torres or Yard. He came along and he cleaned up the problem and resolved the problem. No, no. So three is not just. So, three is not just a difficult number in science, it's a difficult number in literature, in life, and in the movies. So, I googled famous love triangles, and I came up with this one from Casa Blanca, Sir Martin Green, Victor Laszlo, and Ilsa Lawrence. So that one, and the other one that came up, which I guess is a bit awkward these days, it's gone with the wind. And Ashley Wilkes, Rec Buckle and Scarlett as well. We'll hear more about. We'll hear more about these love triangles later on. So, what can happen with three bubbles? We know that three is a complicated number. This is where we start. That's the equilibrium system. And there are lots of different outcomes. So, Carlos and I, we have to become a lot of zoologists, and we have to classify all these new species, essentially. On 3 o'clock, there is the T1U because it's breaking out the upper channel wall. Because it's breaking at the upper channel wall, it's U. That is the same way that the simple lens breaks. We have these new modes of breaking, which are T1Ls. They're breaking at the lower channel wall, but they can break downstream or they can break upstream. This one, T1C, same thing that Rencken saw in her experiments. It's a vertex-vertex collision, that's what the C means. T1C means breaking in the center or breaking by a vertex-vertex collision. It can break by. Vertex collision. It can break right down the middle sometimes, and sometimes it doesn't break. What happens depends on the pressure that we impose, and it depends on the area of the various size of various bubbles, which is measured in 2D. And so we were quite happy to get that because most of the time this breaks, but sometimes it doesn't break. So it's forming a bridge just as we expected between the simple lens, it always breaks, and the infinite staircase. This point is quite important because it's a definition slide. I've got bubble one, bubble two, and bubble three. Bubble one and bubble three are the same size, but they can be a different size from bubble two because I can feed the two populations, I can feed the different sides of the channel from different bubble populations. Then I have vertex 1, vertex 2, vertex 3, and this distance L1, that's going to be quite important, that's the distance. That's going to be quite important. That's the distance from the up channel wall to vertex one. If that number is big, then bubble one and bubble three are big. And then I've got L2, which is the distance from the up channel wall to vertex V2. If L2 is small, that means bubble V2 is big. So L1 and L2, they're just surrogates for bottom space. I've got my topological asymmetry, and now I'm going to start moving this thing, and I'm going to get some out-of-equilibrium grab. I'm going to move it out of equilibrium, and I'm going to. Equilibrium and I'm going to look at how the film shrinks to zero length. If I shrink to zero length, I'll get one of these topological equations. I've tried to avoid putting too many equations in this talk, but this is the definition. This is really the equation slide. What we're interested in is looking at the motion of foam film elements, and then to create the foam film, we just added the elements together. This is the equation that the foam film. This is the equation that the folk fill elements obey. The viscous drag is the difference between a pressure term, pressure difference across a film, and a surface tension curvature term. There are two types of curvatures. There's curvatures looking down at this from above and curvature looking at the side. The curvature I mean is the one looking down from above. The curvature at the side, I won't try and explain it now, you can ask me afterwards. It actually gets sort of embedded into the drag term. Embedded into the drake term. It gets hidden in the drake term. So that's the governing equation. I don't want to dwell too much on that. To tell you what happens with T1s, I'm going to draw an analogy between the length of the foam films and the distance between the camel and the ground. I could have made it a moose, but I decided to make it a camel. There's various ways I can load a camel. I can put straws on the camel's ground. And that is a quasi-steady approach. And that is a quasi-steady approach. I am gradually adding the load to the camera. Sometimes what happens is that after a certain straw, the camel just collapses. And it collapses to the ground. The distance, the length scale, which in this case is the length of my phone call, that suddenly goes to zero. Sometimes the camel can be into yoga and it can go gracefully down. There is another way I can load up my camel. Instead of putting it one straw after another, that's a steady. Another that's steady or a quasi-steady load. I can do another type of load, which is just I hit it with a very large driving pressure all at once. Most of the time, if I do that, I just end up with squash cameras. Occasionally, I have a camel, a superhero camel, any load I can portray anypall resist, and that's the state that doesn't break. It depends on which bubble size is on. Okay, so these are some of the calculations. So, these are some of the calculations. I should say everything here is dimensionless. So, pressures are made dimensionless on capillary units, on surface tension units. Lengths are made dimensionless on the size of the channel, so it's one unit across the pressure. Areas, these areas are made dimensionless on the square of the channel width. So these are areas of 0.5, pressure 0, pressure 10, pressure 18.3. Pressure 18.357. L12 is the length that separates bubble one from bubble two, and what you can see is as we increase the pressure, it just grows gracefully to zero. So this is the camel that does yoga and can go to the ground, and that's what it means. Doubling the buckle size now, so I'm up to buckle size one. That's the equilibrium state. I can increase the pressure. I see there. Increase the pressure, I see the length going down, but then something slightly weird happens. I get to a pressure of 51 and I can't go any further. Then what I discover is I can actually reduce the pressure and as I reduce the pressure, the length increases. So there are two branches of solutions. One branch turns out to be stable, the other branch turns out to be unstable. So if you're a mathematician, this is called a saddle node bifurcation. What happens in practice? What happens in practice is you load up this channel, you reach a certain score and it just suddenly collapses. But that's a dynamical collapse, it's not a quiz-state collapse. Increasing the bubble size by 10%, and I get a state that I can get to very, very high pressures, and it doesn't break anything. And so it actually goes to a finite state at very, very large pressures, arbitrarily large pressures. Arbitrarily large pressures. So, this is the one that doesn't. Okay, physicists like phase diagrams, so we've got a phase diagram. These are the various outcomes that we can get. L1 is, remember, big bubble 1. L2 is, if L2 is small, that means big bubble 2. So, in this region, I get the T1U's breaking at the upper churn wall. In this other region, I get the T1Cs, those are the internal vertex. Those are the internal vertex-vertex collisions. Somewhere in between those two, I get these saddle node states. It's not quite sure if it one script was T1C or a T1U, so it alts for something in between, which is a saddle node state. The bottom right-hand corner, then there's a zoom in the inset, and the first thing you notice, it's a mess. There's a reason it's a mess. These are quite big bubbles, and when you have big bubbles, you have some very long films, and you also have some very short films. So we have lots of films that are competing. So, we have lots of films that are competing to be the shortest. So, there's lots of different things that can happen. The important ones are the PV Graton 1. That's the state that doesn't break at all. So, we do see stakes that don't break at all. And then there's this tiny one, which is the T1U prime, which is the one that breaks down the middle, but it very, very rarely happens. So, the T1U prime is very, very rare. There are seven films in the system, seven potential ways it could break. Only five of those are seen. Only five of those are seen. The reason that only five of those are seen is that the other two involve states that have lots of films overtaking states that have few films. So states that have lots of drag overtaking states that have little drag. So they involve tortoises overtaking pears, and that doesn't happen in this system. Okay, so something that is also interesting is that this state here where it resists breaking, it's quite It's quite rare. If we look at the cases that there exists a solution that doesn't break, regardless of whether or not we reach it, it's a much bigger region. So there are lots of solutions for this system not breaking that we just never reach. And why is that? What we discovered is one thing is this weird bandgap behavior. So we put a small pressure on the system and up to about pressure four, it then Pressure four, it then undergoes one of these saddled oak graphications and progress. And then there's this band gap, and there's no solution. And then at pressure about 15, this new branch of solution starts off. What that tells you is if you take your very wimpy camel, put a few straws on it, it will just collapse. But if you hit this wimpy camel with a very heavy load all of a sudden, it becomes a superhero. So we've seen that's that's really quite weird behavior. Okay, so everything I've said so far has just been about the first topological transformation, or if you like, the first step in my phase diagram, in my Feynman diagram, where I took my quarks and I collided them together and formed with them. I now want to go further, I now want to go all the way through the Feynman diagram. So I want to do multiple T1 transformations and I need unsteady state simulations. Unsteady state simulations because some of the states I might be accessing they might be short-lived intermediates like weak vector bosons that I'm asking. And what I'm trying to find is can I find a heads boson? So once again we have to become like zoologists. There's a few things and so we have to come up with a nomenclature. A few things I should mention. These look like cartoons. They're actually calculations, they're not cartoons, but I'm presenting them as Cartoons, but I'm presenting those cartoons because it's easier to present them as cartoons. That's the first thing. Second thing is the nomenclature that we had to come up with. And so it's the sequence of events. So the first topological transformation here happens on the lower channel wall upstream, so that's called an L1 primed. Then the next one happens at the upper channel wall, so that becomes L primed U. L prime du and then the next one happens at the lower channel wall again so it becomes L prime d u L. So all these subscripts tell us the path, the topological path that we get through. So it's like a Feynman diagram. We can reach this state called the bamboo state right at the end of the path. That doesn't break. The other thing that's important is we don't have to follow the path right to the end. To follow the path right to the end. It can stop after just one transformation or two transformation. And that happens quite often. It doesn't initially happen here. Those are the ones that start with the T1L prime, lower channel wall upstream. These are the ones that start with the T1L, lower channel wall downstream. But there's a couple of different branches. I can end up in this three-bubble bamboo state, but I can also end up in this two-bubble bamboo state with one bubble that behind it. These are the paths that begin with T1U. They're starting to get quite complicated. One state that's actually quite important is this one that's in the bottom right-hand corner. That is the UCU state, so upper channel wall, vertex vertex position, upper channel wall. For those of you who work in UK higher education, the initials UCU will probably mean something to you. For those that you don't, we don't work in UK higher education. You get a higher education, then you just think of Gone with the Wind. So, in this version of Gone With the Wind, Scarlet O'Hara leaves Ashley Wilkes and Rhett Butler Mined in Atlanta, and she goes off and does her own thing. So, the Gone with the Wind analogy will come up with the closing again. These are the states that begin with T1C. One that I do want to point out to you is this one, which is the T1C frame. C prime. Okay, so the U prime, I said, is very rare to be the first transformation, but it's actually quite common to be the second transformation. So it very rarely comes first, very often comes second. For those of you that were watching the football last night, it's rather like the English football team. Okay, so one of the things that we did talking about topological arithmetic. Talking about topological arithmetic, we define this thing called an asymmetry index. It's just the number of films attaching to the outer kernel wall minus the number of films attaching to the lock kernel. So the initial state has a topological asymmetry index of one. When I undergo the T1U, things don't get better, they get worse. I have three attaching to the upper channel wall, and then one attaching to the lower channel wall. So that sort of suggests that the T1U is not going to happen in isolation. It's going to lead to a Isolation. It's going to lead to a chain of other transformations. The T1Ls, on the other hand, they restore topological symmetry. The T1C does nothing to topological symmetry because it doesn't involve the walls, it involves inks and the optics. So we looked at all the possible states, where could we end up? And these were all the ones, all the possibilities. So we could break up, we could get these various sorts of bamboos, or we could get these two bubbles. Could get these two bubble states on the right-hand side. Now, they're two bubbles, but they're not stacked along the channel, they're stacked across the channel. Now, which of those were the ones that the system liked to go into? Well, the title of the talk was Three Bubbles Good, Two Bubbles Better, and that gives you a hint. It's actually this one on the top right. That's the one that the system really likes going into. And it turned out, surprisingly, to have the highest mobility. This system is not trying to minimize its energy. Is not trying to minimize its energy. Well, it's trying to minimize its energy, but it's being forced out of equilibrium. So it doesn't minimize energy, it just seems to maximize intelligence. I don't know why. So we can now start doing high-energy foam physics, if you like. This is the energy versus time. The energy is just the length of all the films added together. And you can see what happens is that the energy goes up and it relaxes. And the very last transformation that restores topological symmetry gives us really. Symmetry, that gives us really good energy reaction. Something else you can see on the right-hand side is that some of these states are quite short-lived. I'll have a topological transformation, the energy goes out a bit, but then it shoots back up again. It doesn't need to finish at an energy lower than it started, because it's not trying to minimize energy. It's trying to decrease its energy, but it's being driven out at minimal energies. I've got some phase diagrams similar to the ones that we looked at before, but these are now the phase diagrams. At before, but these are now the phase diagrams for the entire paths. Lots of UCU states at fairly low pressures, but also lots of states that the system is still strong enough to resist. So I haven't put enough straws on the campbell's back to break it yet. When I get to pressure of 20 capillary units, I suddenly see lots of Cu prime states. And something else that I see is that the Cu prime starts to invade the former news and states. Very high pressure. States, very high pressures, there's a few states down here that don't break, and lots and lots of cement constants. Looking at things statistically, I've got this is the pressure versus the types of T1s. This is the no T1 state. So if pressure is very, very low, nothing breaks, but as increased pressure, the population of that state goes down. The UCU state starts. The UCU state starts going up, but like its UK namesake then starts feedering out. So that's, if you like, the Scarlet-O'Hara state, and I've also got this prime state. And that's the one that wins a vibe pressure. So that is very much like, if you like, the Cu prime state is the heat spose on phone physics. It's the one that we can see it. It's very common, but you need to get to high energies, high pressures, you know. I don't have a complete. I don't have a conclusion as such. Instead of a graphical abstract, I have a graphical conclusion. So we have this 3 is a very complicated number. How does the system resolve itself? It resolves itself in the Casablanca fashion, in which Rick Blake can use Zilsa want to get on the plane with the Britlablasloid and space itself with Casablanca. Future work, we've done three bubbles, we now want to do n bubbles, we're really just taking very small steps there. Taking very small steps there. And I guess probably what I would say is really what country bogarts as far as the end. But I think it's going to be a long process, but beginning of a beautiful friendship. So thank you for your attention. I'm happy to take questions. Yes, cool. Question of Sony? Thank you so much, Paul. This is really interesting. I maybe learned, I know less now about particle consistent. I know less now about particle physics. I know more about phones. You couldn't know this about particle physics in 11.
