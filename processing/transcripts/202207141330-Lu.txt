For to allow me to give this talk remotely, I learned a lot from this conference, in particular, a lot of estimates, analysis of different operators and the different equations. And they are all very useful to my own research. So those being said, my research, I'm a differential geometer. My research is on the spectrum of Laplacian on manifold. So that is the operator I. The operator I'm studying is pretty, I would say, standard. It's the Laplace operator on manifold or on singular space, on space. And more precisely, it's the Hodge Laplacing manifold or on space. So the operator is pretty much standard, but the space themselves are more complicated. So as we can see, we cannot get concrete results. Not get concrete results because the space is complicated, so it's very difficult to find the exact values of eigenvalues or locate the spectrum of the Laplacian operator. So what we are interested in differential geometry, we are interested in the change of the spectrum, I would say the deformation of the spectrum with respect to the deformation of the space. Of the space. So, as the first classical example by Doduzik, it's basically he proved the continuity of the eigenvalues of Laplacian on k-forms in the following sense. So suppose we fix a space, let's say fix a compact manifold, and we know that on any compact manifold, there are infinitely different Riemannian metrics you can assign to it. So, making them different. To it, so making them different Riemannian metric, and suppose that I have a sequence of Riemannian metric which is convergent to another Riemannian metric in the C0 sense. So we don't assume any convergence in the derivative. And then the result says that the case eigenvalue of the manifold with respect to the metric Gi is actually convergent to the case. Convergent to the case eigenvalue of the limiting Riemannian metric. So, the proof is not difficult, but it's a little bit surprising because if you write out the Laplace operator explicitly in terms of the Riemannian metric, you will see that it contains the Christoffel symbol. And the Christoffel symbol apparently will have something to do with the derivative of the Riemannian metric. Of the Riemannian metric. So we don't assume that the derivative of the Riemannian metric is convergent in any sense. However, the eigenvalue will be convergent. So that's a classical theorem, which is still very useful and interesting in the sense that it does not require any curvature assumption in the definition. Okay, so that's the first result. First result. I guess that's the first result of that type. And later, there are two important, actually, one, very deep results first approved by Fokaya in the case where we assume that all the curvature, remaining curvatures are bounded and then later improved by Chico and the coding by only assume that the Richie curvature has a lower bound. So the statement of this type of These types of problems are as follows. So, if I have a compact sequence of manifolds, so those manifold could be very complicated. And so, those eigenvalues of the Laplacian on functions, so they only proved for the Laplacian on functions, they are actually continuous with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff topology. So, let me interpret this a little bit. So, we have like manifold, which is Like manifold, which is getting thinner and thinner, then in the limit, it will go to it may collapse. And the collapsing procedure could be very complicated. And during the collapsing procedure, the topology could change, everything could change. The smooth manifold could change to singular manifold. But as long as they assume that in all these sequence of manifold, we only need to assume one curvature assumption, which has a lower bound. Assumption which has a lower bound with a fixed uniform lower bound for all the sequence of manifold. Then, what they proved is that on this on the limiting space, which could be as singular as one can imagine, they can define a second-order differential operator, which people can call Laplace operator. And then the eigenvalues of lambda k is going to convergent to the eigenvalues of the limiting Laplace. So, this is the implication. Limiting Laplacian. So, this implication is that the spectrum of the Laplacian on the limit space is also discrete. You have elliptic regularity, basically, and compactness. So, the only exception for their theory is that the manifold cannot shrink to one point, which is also a case of Gromov-Hausdorff limit. It shrinks one point. When you have a one point, it's really hard to define the second-order differential operator. But that's the only exception. But that's the only exception. So that's basically the Ethereum, and these are the starting point of my talk. All right. So the natural question is, they only proved the result for the Laplacian on functions. So the natural question to ask is: how about Hodge Laplacian, those Laplacian working on acting on differential forms? And if you think about this, you would see that this is not a You would see that this is not a very well-defined question. Because when we have Gromov-Hausdorff limit, a n-dimensional manifold could collapse into any manifold. As long as it's not zero-dimensional manifold, it could be like this. It eventually goes to like one interval. A manifold without boundary could go to something with boundary, like the interval has two boundary points. Has two boundary points. And so if you think about this, you see this question is well defined for functions, but not well defined for differential forms. To say, if you want to study two forms here, but this guy is the limit is just one dimensional. So there's no way one can even define two forms in a limiting space. So this problem itself is not well defined. Of course, one can assume the non-collapsing condition saying that the limit. Plapsing condition saying that the limit has the same dimension as the original question. But that's not what I want. I'm interested. I'm interested in the non-collapsing situation. And for the non-collapsing situation, as I said, the question itself is not well defined, but I found a weaker version of the question. So namely, instead of studying compact manifold, let's consider non-compact manifold. And for non-compact manifold, And for non-compact manifold, I'm not going to directly prove that the spectrum is continuous with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff topology. What I want to prove is the following. Basically, I want to locate all the possible spectrums of the La Hoch-Laplacian on non-compact manifold. So the theorem we proved is as follows. So assume that I have a non-compact. So assume that I have a non-compact manifold, I have a non-compact manifold, and which is we call it asymptotically flat. So here the definition of asymptotically flatness means that if you go to the infinity of the manifold, then the curvature tensor, the sectional curvature or the curvature tensor of the manifold actually goes to zero. And this notation called the asymptotic effect manifold is different from the asymptotic It's different from the asymptotical strike manifold people study in general relativity, where they also assume not only the curvature has to go to zero, but also the manifold has trivial topology at infinity. So the point of our theory is that we only have the curvature assumption, but the topology of the manifold can be as complicated as one can imagine. So what we proved is the following. Proved is the following. So let delta be the Hodge Laplacian on differential k-forms. So then the essential spectrum of the Laplacian is a connected set. It's starting from, it's an interval. It's from some alpha k, which we call the button essential spectrum, and all the way to infinity, and there are no gaps in between. So this is what we try to prove. And at the first glance, this has nothing. And at the first glance, this has nothing to do with spectrum continuity, but later we will see how we can make use of the result. We didn't use the result of Chigo coding of Kaya, but we use the idea and the spirit. All right, so just here is an example which showed us that the spectrum could have a lot of gaps. So this is not a good example because. This is not a good example because I create a singular space, it's not a manifold. So, suppose this circle represents a fixed compact manifold, and then I can use the sequence of identical same compact manifold and attach them at one point. And in this way, I created a singular space. So, this is a singular space, singular space. But it turns out that we can define the Laplacian operator just as. Find the Laplacian operator just as we have done for manifold because these attachments are just their dimensions are so small that you can ignore them. Their capacity is zero, so you can ignore them. You can freely extend your Laplacian without any problem. But then you will see that the spectrum of this non-compact manifold, assuming that this on either side, the space goes to infinity. So this is apparently a non-compact manifold, but the spectrum A non-compact manifold, but the spectrum remains to be the same as the spectrum of each sigma lambda i. So, so suppose lambda i are the eigenvalues for the all the eigenvalues for the compact manifold, but the globally the spectrum would be discrete. They are made from, I'm sorry, they are not even sigma i, they are just the set of the exact same spectrum of a compact manifold. So that means the essential spectrum, because they repeat. The essential spectrum because they repeated them infinitely times. So the essential spectrum would have a lot of gaps because, other than those lambda i's, all points are non-spectral points. So post ledo and post and the shung and the trend, they actually proved that this example can be deformed. You can smoothing that by using little turnover to make them smooth. And you can use them to construct the manifolds with a lot of gas. The manifolds with a lot of gaps in the spectrum. So it's easy to find that the question. This example shows that it's very easy to find the manifold, even their curvature could be bounded because this is a theoretical manifold, but then the spectrum has a lot of gaps. So this is the example. So our result is that if we not only assume the curvature is bounded, but also assume the curvature goes to zero at infinity, then the spectrum has to be. Then the spectrum has to be a continuous interval. So that's our main result. And we have a conjecture we are not able to prove, but the question is in line of Chica and the coding. So if we assume that not just the sectional curvature to go to zero, but let's say we have an SM particularly non-negative Richie curvature. Richie curvature is just part of the sectional curvature. Can we prove the same result? Can we prove the same result? So we cannot prove it. We cannot find the counterexamples, but the hope that there's some hope to work on that. And so people may wonder why, so actually in this situation, non-compact manifold is even easier than the compact case. I'm not able to find, to prove any result in the compact case. Or I can, but it's I can, but it's ugly because I have to put a lot of assumptions. And so, usually, non-compact manifold has more difficult, complicated topology and geometry than compact ones. But for the spectrum, there's one thing we can take advantage of. So this is called the zoom in, zoom out. Zoom in. So basically, if you start with Mg as a compact manifold. Mg as a compound manifold, and then you rescale the Riemannian metric by an epsilon i, and if shown i goes to zero, then the result is very boring because the manifold just shrinks to one point. And when it shrinks to one point, it loses all the information. You cannot recover the information one point. You can tell going back to tell the information about the original manifold. However, this is good for non-confirmed manifold. Just think about this if you start with. Just think about this: if you start with Euclidean space with a fixed point, and you can keep shrinking your manifold, you will still get the Euclidean space. So, in general, if you have a non-compact manifold, you can use this procedure. Well, at least the limit will somehow exist and it would not be one point. So, therefore, in this case, in that non-compact case, at least the limiting space will remember the information of the original. The information of the original sequence that it is convergent from. Okay, so that's the main difference. And here there are some analysis part. We know that how to locate the essential spectrum, we have the classical well criterion, which means that if you have a self-adjoint operator H, so lambda belongs to spectrum, not necessarily lambda is the idea. Lambda is the eigenvalue of some eigenform, but it's okay if there's a so-called approximation eigenform, h minus lambda action Possi j is not equal to zero, but close to zero, that's fine. So that's the classical while criterion. But in differential geometry, the classical while criterion is almost not useful in the sense that in In the sense that on an abstract Riemannian manifold, the only classical function we can play with is the distance function. And because of the structure of the Riemannian structure, the distance function is Lipschitz, but it's not C2 in general. It has cut locus. The distance function reflects the geometry. So at some point, it's not going to be C2. So, but then if you use the Laplacian operator, Then, if you use the Laplacian operator acting on the distance function, you basically get a distribution. And such a distribution is almost never in L2 space. It does, we can prove that it's locally L1. So therefore, we developed the so-called generalized wow criterion, which we will say that under this slightly weaker condition, we can prove that the lambda belongs to the spectrum. That belongs to the spectrum. So here we still have the Laplacian acting on an eigenform, which is made from the distance function. That will give us a distribution fine. But on the other end, we use basically the resolvent. We use the heat kernel to actually make the test eigenform to be more smooth so that the inner product, a very non-smooth object, take inner product, a couple. Take inner product coupled with a very smooth one, it does make sense. At least it won't be undefined. And so, as long as this is going to be small, then we proved that essentially lambda belongs to the spectrum. So this criterion probably is well known to functional analysis because the prove it is just using spectrum decomposition theorem. But after we introduce this in geometry, then we can prove. In geometry, then we can prove a lot of new results. Okay, so the first result is that if we can assume that the Ricci curvature is so-called asymptotically non-negative, it's slightly weaker than non-negative Ricci curvature. It can be bigger than negative Ypschond, but Ypshong goes to zero as we go to the infinity of the manifold. And then we are able to prove that the essential spectrum of the Laplacian functions. Plusing functions occupy all the possible spectrum points zero to infinity. So, this is not a new result. It was proved by Strong, Jia Ping, and other people, including ourselves. So then, but this is the first time we use this generalized Y criterion, we can give a direct proof. Proof. All right. And so the bottom spectrum is again captured by the Rayleigh quotient as before. So how to start with that? Well, we first defined the button spectrum. So the button spectrum is, do I have six minutes? Yes, you have exactly six minutes. Great. Yeah. So how to prove it? Well, we first, of course, we are. Well, we first, of course, we are able to define the button spectrum which we can use large balls to on the manifold. We just draw a large ball and on this large ball, we study its first button eigenvalue. And as the ball goes to infinity, and as the center of the ball goes to infinity, then the limit will give us the lower bound of the essential spectrum. So this is well known. But it's an interesting question. But it's an interesting question: is so how large those those balls should be? Okay, so in the definition, RI could be for different manifold, RI could be growth as fast as one can imagine. So what is the upper bound? What is the limit? What is the speed of RI goes to infinity? So this is something we think is interesting by itself. So if we assume that the Ricci curvature So, if we assume that the Ricci curvature is essentially non-negative for the manifold, so then any RI, no matter how slowly they go to infinity, the large ball of radius R will capture the essential spectrum. So this is also true for hyperbolic space, but I'm not able to prove it. For example, if the curvature is somewhere between two negative numbers, that's something it's unknown. We have the same question for the We have the same question for the graph and the Laplacian operator on our graph. So, there are similar questions asked. So, in general, we don't want RI goes to infinity too fast because even using that way, we are able to capture the bottom of the essential spectrum. It's in terms of estimate, it's not very useful. But anyway, so since we assume that the Richie curvature is non-negative, so we captured this. So we captured this lower bound of essential spectrum and we give a name. So those balls with slower growth of radius, we call this a minimal sequence because their first eigenvalue goes to the bottom spectrum. Okay, so then, as I said, I want to shrink this a little bit. And you can imagine you can shrink it carefully so that number one, when you shrink it, the curvature blow up. It the curvature blows up, but we assume that at infinity the curvature goes to zero, so it's possible that you can shrink it and the curvature still goes to zero. Okay, it goes to zero slower. So this is number one. So you can always do that. And then number two, as I said, you can use larger ball and shrink, you still get, you can use huge ball and after the shrinking, you still get a large ball. So after you're doing that, so basically BXR. So basically Bxi Ri, and they shrink it by epsilon igi, and keeping the curvature of those balls still goes to zero. Then there are three cases. So by the general Chica coding theory, those sequence of space will convert, a subsequence will be convergent in the Gromov-Hausdoff sense to some limit. Okay, so what we want to assume is that we want to distinguish the three cases. Are the three cases? The first case is the minimum sequence, the so-called injectivity radius goes to zero. That's almost the case. Injectivity radius goes to zero. That's almost the case to say the original big ball is just similar to a big ball in the Euclidean space. So I will skip that. That will be easy because you can compare your manifold to the Euclidean space and you can do the computation directly. And the second situation is that the minimal sequence. Is that the minimal sequence, there's a lower bound of the injectivity radius? That's also an easy case because essentially that limit the possible different topological type. And the third case is the most difficult case that the injectivity radius goes to zero and the limit could be a singular space. And in that sense, that's the most technical part of the proof that we have to resolve the singularity, basically. So I'm almost So, I'm almost running out of time, but I just want to give you just I will use the last two minutes to give you a quick proof. So, this is okay. This is not okay, but we will know that if the injectivity radius is zero, then those spores will be convergent to flat space, space with zero curvature, but with topology. And we were able to handle that. So I will skip that. So this is easy. You still do Zick. If it was bounded, it goes to the flat space. And we wrote another paper before we proved this result on how to study the essential spectrum set of flat space. And we did that. We have done that. So the most difficult case would be half-sing case. And that means the injectivity radius. And when that means the injectivity radius goes to zero. And we can split this into two cases. The first case is okay. So even it's collapsing, but the limiting space is smooth. And in that case, basically it's the product. Basically, it's collapsing just the product, but you crochet the circle and you get one line. And basically, it has a product mainly for the structure. You can still do it. So the most difficult case is that if The most difficult case is that if the limiting space is singular, then we so that so the analysis technique is we just want to avoid the almost eigenfunction to be the mass is concentrated on this singular space. So that requires a lot of techniques in both analysis and in geometry. And I will skip that part. Thank you very much. And thank you again. And thank you again for being remote park. Thank you. Thank you very much. Is there any question or comment from the audience here first? Can you also go to higher order or the next eigenvalues for all the minutes? Can you go to this first or the second eigenvalue? Sorry, I didn't hear you. The second eigenvalue? Yes, for each of the manifolds, do they also converge? Do you have information about that? So we only so this method only captures the essential spectrum. So I'm not able to tell about the discrete, I mean, discrete spectrum fine, those non-essential spectrums, because I want the manifold. Because I want the manifold to just the certain spectrum to repeat it infinite many times so I can take the limit. Did I answer your question? Yes, yes. Any other question, comment? I actually have a question. I don't know if you see me. If you have an asymptotically plant manifold, An asymptotically implanted manifold for which your spectrum is zero infinity. You know that you do not have eigenvalues below because your class is positive. I don't know that. The eigenvalue question is much, much more difficult to answer. I don't know. But my question is: suppose that your ground point in the essential spectrum is not zero. Oh. So you have to be excessive. So you have a complete example of a manifold, a specific asymptotically type manifold for which you have eigenvalues below the bottom of the central space. Yes, if my answer understand your question correctly. So we can find manifold such that this is alpha to infinity, where alpha is actually positive. That's correct. That's correct. So, what we can do is essentially, okay, so it's the product space. So, if we have, so let M be a flat, compact flat manifold. And let's say M cross zero to infinity. So, so then, if, for example, if we want to study two forms onto that, so it will start with the first eigenvalue of m. eigenvalue of m then to infinity so so indeed we have we have it's the spectrum is from zero to infinity and not from zero from a positive number to infinity and that will so so of course below the essential spectrum if there are other spectrum point there will be eigenvalues uh i can I can construct if you ask me to construct one example, I can probably do that. It's just a variational principle, just the need to, because you change anything locally on a compact set, it won't affect the essential spectrum, but you can change things locally to make the you can find the test form or test function so that you can tell that there's another. You can tell that there's another spectrum below the essential spectrum that has to be at Higgin value. Thank you. Any other questions or comments? No? Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Okay, thank you. Right, so we have an open problem session, but I propose 10 minutes break. Minutes lake, then I think we need an order for the open problems. I think there is Jeff who wants to do the open problem.
