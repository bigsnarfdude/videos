Thank you very much, Nana, for the very kind introduction. Thank you all for joining from wherever you are at the moment. So, good morning, or good afternoon, or good night. So, my talk will be about Calviar metrics. Sorry, my screen just went black. We can see still the slides. Okay, good. Sorry about that. Okay, good. Sorry about that. Yeah. So my talk will be about calabia metrics for complete intersectional calabia and tori varieties. And this is work that has been done over the last year or so. The pioneering work was together with Laura Anderson, James Gray, Aniki Raguam from Virginia Tech, and Matis Geldis and Sam Krippendorf from LMU Munich. Munich and more recently, and the main focus of the first part of my talk: work with Martelina Laffos from Uppsala, Andrew Lucas from Oxford, and Robin Schneider also from Uppsala. And for the second part, I will be talking about work that appeared earlier this year together with Anthony Ashmore from Chicago. Good. So the motivation for my talk is you can ask the following question. Can string theory? Can string theory describe the universe we live in? And the answer to this is studying the landscape of string theory. But you could also ask, in some sense, the converse question. So are there phenomena that never occur in string theory or also phenomena that always occur in string theory? Like statements of the type that you can never have global symmetries in string theory. Symmetries in string theory or statements like whenever you're moving an infinite distance in moduli space, an infinite tower of states becomes light. And these are questions about the swarm term. And recently, we've seen many conjectures about things that always happen or never happen in any quantum theory of gravity or more specifically just in string theory and hints that maybe string theory can describe every quantum theory of gravity. The U of gravity. For me, one of the most important or intriguing ones is the Swampland distance conjecture. And of course, we had very nice talks on this on Monday already, so I will just restate it. It was conjectured 15 years ago by Oguri and Bafa. And it says the following. You take your favorite string theory, compactify it on some calabiao at some point P1, and you compare it to the same theory that you get if you go from point one to point zero in the modulized phase of your compactification. In the moduli space of your compactification. If you didn't know the shortest geodesic distance between these two points by d, then the the at p1 has infinite tower of light states with mass of the order e to the minus m e to the minus alpha d, where alpha is an order one constant at the Planck units. So whenever you move, essentially the statement is whenever you move a Planckian distance, sometimes In distance, sometimes it becomes comes down with an E-fold of mass. And it's a very interesting conjecture because it relates something that's going on in the target space to something that's going on in the moduli space. That's what I like about it. So we wanted to check this conjecture. And we wanted to check it for the simplest setup that we can, which is the crintig. So essentially, what you would expect. Essentially, what you would expect to find is if you were to plot, let's say, the geodesic distance in modelized space on the x-axis and the logarithm of the mass and y-axis, you should find this line with a slope apparently approximately minus one or minus alpha in this case. Good. So doing this means we have to, first of all, compute geodesic distances in the modelized space, and second of all, massive. Space and second of all massive string excitations. So let me not even go there yet. Let's just think about what we would even do to compute the y-axis in this plot. So good. So to compute it, you would start, for example, with the 10D Fang-Gordon equation. This is somewhat schematically, but I just want to get the point across. So you have your Laplace operator acting on your 10D field is zero, where your 10D field is just dm dm or dm dm or remembering that there's actually a metric in there it's gm n dm dn now you decompose your 10 daplus operator into a 4d laplace operator and a 6d down version and you decompose your 10 d field into 4d field and a 6d field and you decompose your 10d metric into a 4d metric in a 6d metric and now if you look at the eigenfunctions of the 6d dull inversion here so delimpersion phi equals lambda phi you find equals lambda phi, you find that you can write this operator itself again in terms of the metric, the inverse metric, just like this thing here. And then if it's curved, you have this determinant of g's in there. If you take this eigenfunction, Lunversion phi equals lambda phi, and you put this decomposition in here, what you would find is something like lambda 4d, sorry, Laplace 4D. So Laplace 4d plus lambda action 54d equals zero. And this is, of course, the Klein-Gorn field. So it's a Klein-Gorn field equation for a massive field of mass m squared. So the eigenvalues of this 6D Dullen version will be the massive excitations of your string that is inherited from the compactification. So in order to compute the spectrum of So in order to compute the spectrum of the 6D operator, we do need to find the eigenvalues of this operator. And this actually requires knowing the metric. You see the metric appears here, here, and there. So if we do not know the metric on the six-dimensional space, we cannot find the eigenvalues of this. There's one exception, we can find the zero eigenvalue using chromology, but for the massive non-zero eigenvalues, there is. So because this relation doesn't exist, I have no idea how to do this other than actually constructing the metric and solving this equation. So to compute the tau of massive states, we actually need the Calabian metric. And that's the motivation for my talk. That's the motivation for my talk. I want to compute this tower of states, and for this, I will need to compute the Calabiarometric. So, my talk breaks actually down in two parts. In the first part, I will discuss Calabiarometrics. I will give a brief introduction and then explain how we actually obtain them from machine learning. And in the second part, I will construct the massive spring spectrum. So, the y-axis, I will construct geodesics in complex. Geodesics in complex structure modelized space for the quintic, that's the x-axis. And then I will just plot how the mass changes as the geodesic as you evolve along a geodesic in modelized space. And finally, I will conclude. Good. So as you, most of you might know, a Calabio manifold is a complex Keller manifold of vanishing first turn class. And the theorem by Calabi and Yao says. Theorem by Calabi and Yao says that a complex Kerla manifold with vanishing first joint class admits a rigid flat Kerla metric. So if you have a complex Kerala manifold with vanishing first joint class, you can find a unique metric in the Kerla class that you fixed that is richly flat. This is a Yao proved this existence, Color B proved uniqueness. But the proof of Yao is non-constructive. So why we know it exists. So, why we know it exists, and that's the reason why we're always working with Calabiel. We know that in principle we can find a Richie-flat metric which satisfies the string equations of motion. We actually don't know how to construct it. So let's see what the problem is. Well, the first thing, complex is actually pretty easy. You just need to make sure that your manifold patches together appropriately. So you choose a complex structure, let's say i equals square root of minus one or minus square root of minus one. square root of minus one or minus square root of minus one and then you just ensure that on the transitions here um everything goes smoothly the second property is harder it tells you that your manifold being kaylor means of course you can get the metric from a kayla potential and you can define a kayla form as um s g ab sorry that's the title Sorry, that's a title. No, no, it's correct. Yeah. So it's GDZ A rage dz barbary. So if you have the Kerlo potential, you can very easily construct the metric. But if you just have the metric, it's very non-trivial to actually integrate it to find the Kerlo potential. An easier check for something to be Keller is that the Keller form here is closed. So dj or dj by dzA. dj by dz A equals del J by del Z Bar equals zero. If K is already d d bar, so if G is already d d bar K, acting with another D or D bar kills it. So it annihilates the Caliform. The Caliform is closed. That's a simpler cross-check than actually trying to reconstruct the Kala potential if you're giving a Kala metric. So that's also doable. The third property. The third property, vanishing first joint class, can also be done very, very easily. And we have literally hundreds of millions or even half a billion constructions how to do that. The problem is to then find the unique representative of metrics inside the space that is a Ricci flat. So, what's the problem here? Well, you can just write down the Ricci tensor, and I did. Answer. And I did. It's this expression. And then, in principle, what you have to do is you substitute the metric as d d bar k in here, and you get a differential equation of fourth order that involves d, derivatives of d, inverses of d, and so on. This is just a horribly complicated differential equation. If you could solve it, you would be done. This is not what Yao did. This is not what Yao did, though. Yao actually realized that, or actually proved a simpler equation. So you can translate this into a second-order differential equation. And the way to do this is the following. If you are on a Calabio, you can write down the Kehler form because it's a Kehler manifold. And then on a Calabio 3 fold, J cube will actually be proportional to the volume form. So if I take J with J with J, you can see. Which j, which j, you can see that you get a totally endosymmetric combination of g's here that gives you this determinant, and then you just get dz1 which dz1 bar, dz2 which dz2 bar, dz3 which dz3 bar. However, this is actually not the only volume form you can construct on a colour BR. So if the color BL has a vanishing first turn class, this is equivalent to it having a having a 3-0 form, which is this form here. This form here, and we actually know how to construct this for colour VR manifolds in the case of the quintic, you can just construct it in local coordinates by going to a patch in P4 and then solving implicitly for one coordinate, let's say z4, scaling z0 to 1, and then writing down, hdz2, hdz3. And you take the derivative of the defining polynomial of the quantity with respect to the equation that you solved for, and that gives you a Solved for, and that gives you a local expression for the holomorphic three-form. If you take this holomorphic three-form and watch it with its complex conjugate with the zero-three form, you get again a volume form, this one here. So the volume form, the 3,3 form is unique. So this means that the volume form you got, the 3,3 form you got from constructing J cubed is actually equal to the 3,3 form that you get from omega, which omega bar. From omega which omega bar up to some constant, and this constant is called kappa here. So, what this means is instead of minimizing this complicated or instead of solving this complicated expression here, I can actually solve this equation here, which is much easier. So, I'm trying to find a g such that square root of determinant g is equal. Square root of determinant G is equal to dp by dz absolute value squared. So this allows me to turn this complicated fourth order equation into a complicated second order equation. And this complicated second order equation is what's called a partial differential equation of Mojan pair type. So where is the very Where even is the equation here? This looks like just an equation in G and then in omega. So, where's the differential equation coming in? The point is to see that the Calabiao theorem tells you that you fix a Kerler class, and inside this Kerler class, you can find a unique Ricci-Flat metric. So, the Calabiao metric, the Ricci-Flat metric, will be given. The Riti-Flat metric will be given as some reference metric with some fixed scalar class that you specified, plus d d bar phi, where phi is just a scalar function that depends on the complex structure and the position where you are on the Calabia manifold. So you're constructing Calabia manifold by using a non-riggy flat manifold, so a non-rich flat Non-Riggy flat manifest, a non-Ritchie flat metric, this reference metric here, and you're adding this dd bar piece that actually makes this reference metric the flat, the Ritchie flat metric. So the problem is, so, and this now is a differential equation in this unknown function phi. For the reference metric, we can easily construct non-Ritchie flat metrics on Calabier manifolds. And Calabier manifolds. This is not a problem. The problem is to find a Richie flat representative. So the name of the game now is to solve this differential equation for G, Calabiao, which if I cube it has to be equal to omega which omega bar. So I get something like the determinant of this d d bar phi term here. And this is what gives rise to this Morse-Pair type structure of differential equation. Of the differential equation. And this is actually what Yao did. And Yao solved this Monson pair-type equation to prove that you can always construct a solution. However, we are in a little bit of a peculiar situation here. We have this partial differential equation in phi, and usually when you have a partial differential equation in a function, you want to know the function. We don't actually care too much about the function. What we The function. What we care about is the Calabiel metric. So we only care in a sense about the derivative of this function. So we only care about the combination of d d bow phi. Whatever this thing is, this will be, well, it will be a three by three matrix. And whatever it is, it should correct our reference metric such that the result is really flat. So the idea is, you want to do this eventually. And we want to do this eventually with a neural network. So we would set up something that represents not phi necessarily, but for example, just dd bar phi. Of course, we could also just represent phi and then take the two derivatives. We have different options here. So what we just did is we took a partial differential Took a partial differential equation with four derivatives and we translated it into a Monsa-Per equation, which has two derivatives. And if we are not interested in phi, but just in dd bar phi, we are actually now having some sort of quote-unquote algebraic equation for the Moorser pair loss. We still need to take a derivative to ensure that it's Kayla because we need to ensure that Ej is zero, so we need derivatives of this metric to check the Kerler property. And check the calor property. But other than that, this equation just involves another G here. And we need to check that this is complex, that it's calibrated taking derivative, and then we need to ensure that with this new metric, still j cubed is equal to omega squared. So there are different things you can do. One of them is to just use a neural network to learn the metric phi. The second thing you can do is to write a neural network to learn the debar of phi. So in this case, the color biometric would be some reference metric plus whatever the neural network tells you. Or you could do something where the color biometric is equal to the reference metric plus the reference metric times whatever the neural network. Reference metric times whatever the neural network tells you. Or you could do away with the reference metric altogether and just sort of directly minimize the Richie curvature by essentially solving j cubed equals omega squared subject to the metric that you get being Kayla and subject to it being complex. There are different answers and we compared These four, sort of writing it as a network that learns phi directly, writing it as something that learns metric directly, writing it as something that learns dd bar phi, and learning something that writing it as something that learns essentially dd bar phi divided by g reference ab. Good. Before I show you the results, I need to discuss how we actually construct this reference metric here. And for complex projective ambient spaces, sorry. Yeah. So for complex projective ambient spaces, there's a canonical choice for this metric, and this is the Fubini-Studi metric. The Fubini-Studi metric can be easily constructed in these projective spaces and then. It in these projective spaces, and then you can just restrict it to the colour BR, and you have a metric on a colour BR. It's not a Richie-flat metric, but it's a representative or metric on this space. Actually, sorry, which screen am I sharing? Am I sharing the one that has the Am I sharing the one that has the preview, or am I sharing the correct one? You're sharing the correct one. You have the reference metric. It's good. Okay, good. There was a weird green bar somewhere. Okay, good. So the way you construct the Fubini-Studi metric expressed in a way that allows us to generalize the Tauric varieties is the following way. So you write the Kerla metric in general. You write the Kerla metric in general in terms of sections of the Kerla coin generators of your variety. And for projective spaces, these are essentially just the sections are just the homogeneous coordinates. So the Fubini-Studi metric expressed in terms of these sections or in terms of these homogeneous coordinates is just dd bar log sigma, where sigma is the absolute value squared of these i's summed up. Is zump up. So this is an expression of homogeneous coordinates. Now you can go to affine coordinates. You can scale one of these z's to one, and then you get something like one plus the sum of the other squared. And they cannot all vanish simultaneously because that's not a point in the projective space. So this log actually makes sense. So you never get log of zero. So, by on a more higher level, constructing the sections of the generators of the Kerla cone and constructing this expression, we have obtained the Fubini-Studi metric for this particular projective ambient space. And then we can just go ahead, pull it back to the color BR and get a non-Richie-flat metric on the color BR. For toric ambient spaces, you can do. For toric ambient spaces, you can do something similar. In fact, you do exactly the same thing. You find the sections which are now called SI of the Calicoin generators of the Tauric variety. And these now will not just be the coordinates of your Tauric variety XA, but they will be some monomials in these XA. So now you can write down again a metric which is d d bar log sigma where sigma is the is d d bar log sigma where sigma is the sum of these absolute value squared of these sections so the way to think about this is you take these s i these sections and you think about them as being coordinates of some projective ambient space which is of the dimension of the number of sections that you can write down and now you have this expression and again you can just use toric scalings to scale Just use Tauric scalings to scale your Tauric coordinates xA here. This will always scale one of the sections to one. So you get again this form of one plus the sum of the other squared. So this log is again well defined. You can write it down. You can take the derivative and you get a metric on your toric colour Bial, which is pulled back from the Amian space, which is not written. From the ambient space, which is not really flat. So, with these constructions, we can actually for all quite a scarcity and for all complete intersection colour BL century varieties, we can write down a reference metric on the color BL. And from there, we can then go on and compute the correction that actually gives the Richie flat metric. However, this is not all that we need to do with the reference metric. Eventually, we Reference metric. Eventually, we will be interested to actually compute things on the Calabiao, and this actually means that we need to integrate usually. So, let me take a very short digression and explain how you actually can do numerical integration. So, let's say you wanted to find the area of a circular lake here. So, what you can do is you pick up a bunch of stones and you throw them in a regular pattern. First in the top left, then next to it, then next to it. Left, then next to it, then next to it, and so on. And you just continue throwing in an equally spaced lattice, and you count every time you hit the lake versus every time you don't hit the lake. In the example I've drawn here, I have 41 by 41 throws, so 1681 throws, and I counted that 1245 of them hit the lake. So the area of the lake will be the area of this known region, which is just a rectangle of size 2 by 2. Which is just a rectangle of size two by two. And then the fraction of this area that is covered by the lake is then just 1245 by 1681. And this gives an answer of 2.96, which is kind of close to pi. But of course, I can improve this if I just throw more stones. I find that I now hit a I now hit the lake more. I'm probing these regions more densely, and I'm getting better results. I mean, results that come closer and closer to the pile. However, this is actually not how I manage to throw stones. When I throw stones at the lake, I do something like this. There's a lot of noise on there. I might have a bias to throw to the bottom right here. So in practice, this wouldn't work by counting or. This wouldn't work by counting, or it would converge much, much worse. If I know this bias, however, if I know that I tend to throw to the bottom right, I can correct for this by weighting the points that I threw in the top left, for example, or just in the left more heavily. So for every two points that I throw to the right, I count them only with one half and or one. And the ones I throw to the left, I count with twice this vector. So I can correct for this if I know my bias. And if we want. And if we want to construct points on the Calabier manifold, we have a very similar problem. We can construct points, we have an equation, a polynomial equation, and we know how to solve a polynomial equation. Well, we can't do it analytically for a quintic, for example, but we certainly can do it numerically. There's something that's called homotopy continuation, which allows you to find all the points on a Calabiao. So you take a random starting point. You take a random starting point and you find all the solutions. But we won't know the pattern of these points. So we won't know our bias with which we threw to the bottom right versus the top left, for example. So luckily, there's a very powerful theorem, which is due to Schiffman and Zeldich from 99. And it tells us a construction we can do that will allow us to know. Will allow us to know the bias that we introduced. It will not give us this regular pattern, but it will allow us to compute for every point a weight with which we can weight it such that when we were to compute the area, we would know which way to multiply the point to obtain the correct result. And what this theorem tells you is that the zeros of the random sections of p to the Of p to the n are precisely distributed according to the magnitude. May I ask a question, Fabi? Yes, please. Yes. So in your previous slide, how do you figure out the weights for the different stones that you draw? How do you figure out those weights? So if I just throw stones, there's no hope for me to figure this out. I mean, I throw them randomly. Figure this out. I mean, I throw them randomly. The stone have different trajectories, and I just have terrible aim. So there's no way of actually knowing. You could try to, if you know that sort of your right-hand and you tend to throw to the right or whatever, you could try to put in some correction factor. But if it looks like this, which was purely random, there's no good chance of knowing the correction factor. The point is, if I construct points on my colour B Au, Points on my calabiao with a specific prescription which was given by Schiffman and Zeldich, then I can compute my bias. Then I can compute for each point. I can just compute. I should rate this with factor 1.735. I should rate this with factor 0.954 and so on. So this theorem of Schiffman and Zeldich tells me how to weight each point that I found on my colour BL. Okay, thank you. Yeah, thank you for Chris for. Thank you for Chris for asking. So, what I need to do is, I need to construct random sections on Pn, intersect these sections with themselves and with the Calabi R. I will find some points on the Calabio. And the point is that I can now compute using this theorem how to weight them, whether they are all sort of in this dense bottom right region, so I should weigh them with a factor less than one, or they are all this not so dense top left regions. Not so dense top left region, so I should weigh them more heavily and so on. So, what you do is you construct a map from your Tori-amiant space into the section space that is generated. In case of Pn, this is again just Pn because the sections were just the homogeneous coordinates. So, you do this in the torque, I mean. In the toric amend space, you construct a map from the toric coordinates into the section space of your catalog generators. In this case, this is not just the dimension, so this is not just k plus 1, but it's whatever the number of sections you have here. But you construct this, you write down the sections, you intersect them, and you get a bunch of points for which you know how they are distributed. So, the whole procedure that I just explained can be summarized in the following way. First, you start with your ambient variety, then you find the calicone generators. Then, you construct this map into the projectivization of the sections of your calicone generators. You find the common zero lobe psi of IID Gaussian sections in the sector with the colourbiao hypersurface. You construct a reference metric, you pull the metric back to the You pull the metric back to the colour BL, you construct the volume measure, and you compute the weights of these points. That's a lot of things to do, and it sounds kind of complicated, but luckily it can actually be automated very easily. And that's what we did. So we wrote a code that integrates into Sage, which is sort of a convenient place to be at if you want to work with topic varieties, or we wrote a code that also A code that also, I mean, the same code also integrates into Mathematica, and it's very easy to use in Mathematica to set it up. You just sort of load it, you initialize it, it's set up, you specify your polynomial that defines your complete intersection colour BR, and then you just do generate points. Tell it I want 50,000 points with a Keller model one, one, and it will just generate these points, it will generate the weights, and so on. So on if you are on Sage, you again you install the package, you define. So, this is all just Sage code. You define your favorite part, Scargett Kalabiow by giving some vertices, constructing the polytope, triangulating it, constructing the Tori variety. And now our code starts where you compute all this data, the section data, and so on. You find the different patches. We store the centauric data, and then you. And then you just create a point generator here and you compute 50,000 points. So these three lines will allow you to do all these things. It's available on this GitHub page, and you can just download it and install it and then use it from either Mathematica or from Sage, whichever you prefer. I should say that the version that's currently on there doesn't include the There doesn't include the Sage integration yet. I'm working on getting this up there. And as soon as I find a little bit of time, I will actually upload it. At the moment, when you download it, it doesn't yet have the full stage integration of what I was describing just now. Good. But now we have a code or we have a method how to construct the reference metric and how to find points in the color BL. So now we can go. Now, we can go ahead and write this neural network that, based on the reference metric, finds a correction such that the resulting metric is the origin flat-Keller metric. And that's what I want to talk about next. And for the purpose of this part, we want to think of the metric as just being a function which takes a point in the moduli space, so in the complex structure in Kala moduli space, and a point in the color B. And a point on the colour B O and it maps it into a complex transmission 3x3 matrix, which is the metric. So all I need is essentially a function from some point in R to the N into some point in C three by three. In the case of the crintic, what this means is I need to specify, sorry, in the case of the Famat crintic, which is x0 to the five plus x1 to the five plus x2 to the five. To the five plus x2 to the five plus psi times x0 x1 x2 x3 x4. Um, I have only one complex number in there, which is this factor of psi in front of this x0x1, x2 term. This has two real degrees of freedom. I have to specify a point on the colour BR, which I can do by specifying, for example, a point on the ambient space, which are five complex numbers. Space which are five complex numbers for p to the four. So these are 10 real degrees of freedom. And what I'm getting out is a complex emission three by three matrix, which has three real and three complex or nine real degrees of freedom. So I'm interested in map from R to the 12 into R to the nine. How do you construct this map? Well, the easiest one I could do is just take a linear map. I could do is just take a linear map. So I take a 12 by 9 matrix, this has 108 parameters, and I just adjust these 108 entries in this 12 by 9 matrix such that I get as close as possible to a metric that's pretty flat and complex and tail. So now we know that this metric does not depend linearly on the point you're at in the colour below and on the complex structure and so on. If it did, then probably. And so on. If it did, then probably Yao wouldn't have had such a hard time proving the existence. So we make it more complicated this map. Instead of mapping directly with a 12 by 9 matrix, we first take a 12 by 100 matrix, so we bloat it up. Then we make the map non-linear by taking, let's say, the hyperbolic tangent of each of these 100 entries of the vector. Then we multiply by another 100. we multiply by another 100 100 matrix we take again the tangent and finally we take a we multiply by a 100 times 9 matrix so now we have written down a map which takes us from r to the 12 to r to the 9 by going via r to the 100 in between and applying some non-linear function such that our overall composition of maps is not just linear. So now we have parametrized a complicated non-linear map. And then And then we find these parameters in this 12 by 100 matrix, in this 100 by 100 matrix, in this 100 by 100 matrix, and so on, such that the result is richly flat, Kayler, and complex. And what I just described to you is actually a feed-forward neural network. And these feed-forward neural networks are known to be universal approximators. So this means they can actually approximate. Actually, approximate mild assumptions any function that you want to approximate. Just like there is a question on the chat from Paul. Yes. Yeah, sorry, you are on. Yeah, I didn't find the right moment to stop you. So I just have a quick question. When you go back, the TOREC computation that the TUREC set up, the TORIC hypersurfaces, where you compute the cannabiometric. where you compute the kalabiometric in your package um i i i think i just wondered how sort of how flexible the package is and what you like what you require like if you require things like if the ambient space is smooth or if if all the all the divisors in the calabiao descend from the ambient space or if it's also okay if for example a couple of if the ambient space has more uh uh uh kilacone generators than the calabia itself The Carabiao itself, or is it so? Yeah, so are there any requirements on those? Good. Yeah, so if you have more generators, more calico generators on the Calibi R than you have on the ambient space, then you won't be able to use the sections of the ambient space to construct the calicon generators. That's correct. So you only get access to those. To those where you actually get restricted from the ambient space. For complete insection calibrals, that's essentially all of them, except for 40. For emotary varieties, I don't know the number. For cases where you have more in the ambient space than you have on the calabial, well, you could just throw them away. If they are lying in a facet, you could just, I mean, not worry about them if they don't intersect your calabial hypersurface. Fact your colour the hypersurface. But could I also do it with a singular ambient space? If I really say blow on the ambient space, if I blow down some stuff, and could I use that? Because then I would have trouble, I guess, already to find a good metric on the ambient space. It's a good question. I haven't thought about it. So we have, so far we have only used it for simplicity, sorry, for simplicity helicons. For simplicity electrons? Yes, it's a good question. I haven't tried to use it. So, so far, we use it for we have used it for simplicity colour cones and for favorable setups. Great. Okay, yeah. Just wanted to know how to. Thanks. But I don't, so very often, some of the triangulations of a toric variety actually. Of a Tori variety actually gives you a actually gives you a similar to Calicone. So I think you will still have access to them, maybe not to all triangulations. Thank you very much. It's a good question. Good. So the thing that I have described here. Have described here is a feed-forward neural network, and it can learn any function you like. So, in particular, it can learn your function, it can learn the RITY-FLAT network. Questions, of course, if it can learn any function, how do you get it to learn the function you want it to learn and not something else? And that's a very complicated question, and it's a very active area of research at the moment. But I won't try to answer it in this talk. So, schematically, So schematically, you can draw this neural network as a map from R to the 12 to R to the 9 with 3 times R to the 100 in between and some non-linear action on each of the nodes here. This is the setup that we used. And now you can go ahead and, well, in your case, it might not be R to the 12 because you might not be taking the Fermat critic, but something more complicated. You might not want to have 3 times 100 nodes. Three times 100 nodes in between, you might want a different nonlinearity and so on. So, in principle, you could set this up for every manifold. And again, we have automated this to do this completely automatically. So, if you want to do it in Mathematica, what you would write is just train your network. You would specify three hidden layers. In this case, I took a 64, not 100. You specify the activation function. You tell it how often it should iterate over all the points. How often it should iterate over all the points that you just constructed, and you tell it into how many bunches to break up the points that you constructed. And this will now generate the neural network, train it for you, and return to you a neural network that describes the Richie flat Calabiel metric. And then you can get, for example, the weights of these points, or you can just get the metric by doing Calabi metric on some points. In Sage, this looks very similar. You construct your neural network here. Neural network here by using again three layers with 64 nodes and some activation function. Then you define the you define the correction that you want to learn. In this case, I took the phi model. So this learns the phi of d plus d d bar phi. You train your neural network and then you can compute the Calbiou metric by calling just the thing that you just trained on a bunch of points. Points. So with these, I don't know, what, 15 lines of codes plus the last 15 lines of code, you can, in theory, train your neural network for the Coitiscar list or for the CC list. Modulo, the subtleties that Paul was asking about, whether or not this works for non-centric hell accounts. Good. So here are the results. What I'm plotting is. What I'm plotting is, we need to make sure that j cubed is equal to omega squared. That's what I call the Monsoon pair loss. So, this measures how much j cubed deviates from omega squared. Then we have a transition loss, which measures the complexness. So, we construct transition functions on the ambient space, put them back to the colour BR, and compute then the metric in different patches, what it should be if it followed the correct transition functions, versus what the neural network actually tells you. Versus what the neural network actually tells you when you give it points in different patches. Then we have we compute d of our metric to ensure that this is close. So this is how much dj differs from zero. And by minimizing d3, we will make sure that we get a complex Kerala manifold with vanishing first current class. So if we manage to get all these three things to zero, we are done. In the training. And in the training, we don't get them to zero, we get them to 10 to the minus 1, 10 to the minus 2 here, 10 to the minus 2 here. So, this is an approximation. Of course, it's a numerical algorithm. You will never find zero, but it's the good approximation. And you can see if you actually plot the Richie scalar here versus how close you are to. You are to satisfying the Mozambique-Pair equation. So the Mohanzapier equation is: remember, J cubed equals omega power. So one minus J cubed double omega power has to be zero on all points if you actually satisfy the Montserrat-Pierre equation straight on. So what should happen is as because of Calviaro's theorem, as you get closer and closer to satisfying this, the metric is unique that satisfies this. metric is unique that satisfies this so you should be getting closer and closer to r r equals zero here so by plotting this we actually find that as sigma gets smaller and smaller r gets smaller and smaller and we've actually approached this point here after some initial initial hiccups here along a linear trajectory so we're going towards the origin here we're going towards zero zero and this happens And this happens for many colour VRs that we check. So, if we didn't know Color B's proof of uniqueness, we might be tempted to conjecture since we always end up down here at zero Ricci curvature as soon as we satisfy the Mozambique equation or as soon as we satisfy J cubed equals omega squared. You might be tempted to say that you can only go here. But for us, it was surprising that. For us, it was surprising that this happens linearly for neural network, and we have no explanation for why that is. Sorry, Fabien. Yeah. May I ask a question again? Yes, the equation that you showed us had a kappa, right? I think there was a kappa between J cubic and omega squared or not. Is that thank you? It's an excellent question. Thank you. It's an excellent question. So before I said j cubed is equal to kappa omega squared, I just simplified the equation. There should be a one over kappa here. You can absorb this kappa in omega. Omega is only defined up to global scaling, but yeah, there should be a one over kappa here. That's absolutely correct. Okay, thank you. Just for the sake of simplicity, I dropped it here. But yes, it's very, very good observation. There's a one over kappa. Of course, in the code, there's this one over kappa just for the ease of exposition. Carpet just for the ease of exposition here, I dropped it. Thank you. Good. So now we have a method to construct a color BR matrix. We just have this code. And the second part of the talk will now be to go ahead and use this code to compute the massive string excitations. And the second part will be much shorter, so don't worry. Other questions on the Other questions on the first part before I go to the second? It seems not. Okay, then I'll continue to the second part where I compute the massive string spectrum. So now that I have the metric, I can find the eigenvalues of the six. The eigenvalues of the 6D Laplace operator, and once I have these, these correspond then to the mass eigenmodes of the 4D modes. So, what I will have to do is I will have to construct the Calibia metric at different points in the moduli space. Then I choose some function basis in which I can expand my eigenfunctions and I construct them again. Functions and I construct them again from sections of line bundles divided by this sigma squared to some power. And this sort of the reason for choosing this particular set of bases is that this would be an eigenbasis of the Laplace operator of the Fomade. Sorry, a basis of the eigenvalues of the Eigen values of the Laplace operator with respect to the Fubini-Studi metric in the Amian space. So if we think about the Calabiar metric coming from this reference metric plus some corrections, this would be an answer. And then we're trying to find different linear combinations of these to make up for the fact that actually the Ritchie-Flat metric is not the Fubini-Studi metric. So now that we have this set of functions, we expand our function phi as our function phi as some phi alpha phi a alpha a and we compute the Laplace operator on these functions here compute the matrix elements and this thing here involves the metric so once we have this metric these eigen eigenvector I mean these matrix elements that give us the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator we can diagonalize it to see these eigenvalues and we will have To see these eigenvalues, and we will have found the massive string excitations. In our example, we construct a section basis such that we can compute the first 1225 eigenvalues on the quintig. This means that if you want to go higher or even if you're approaching the larger ones, we have truncated our eigenfunction bases, your results will get worse. But for the certainly for the first. Get worse, but for the certainly for the first, I don't know, few hundred, this truncation is totally fine. So we can now compute the massive string spectrum at any point in moduli space. So in principle, we can plot for each point in moduli space. We can plot the tower of masses that we find. That gets us closer to our goal to compute, to check this formula distance conjecture, but we still need to deal with the geometry. Need to deal with the geodesic distance. So we need to translate the different points that we choose in complex structure moduli space into a geodesic distance. And I will explain how we do this here. So geodesic in just in general is the shortest, or so it is a short, I mean, an extramizing path between two points and it satisfies this externality. And it satisfies this externality condition to D-Zig equation. And this is again a partial differential equation in the curve parameter that depends on the metric. This time, the metric on the moduli space, not the Calabiar metric. So now we are purely in moduli space. Everything I'm saying now depends on the metric on the moduli space here. If you solve this differential equation, and that looks much easier than the Mauritius equation we just saw, you can compute the geodesic distance by just Geodesic distance by just doing this curve integral. So, what you need to do, this becomes an exercise in numeric algebra or in numeric analysis, where you solve this geodesic equation using some Runchcutter or Adam Spatch forward shooting method to get from P1 to P2. And then you use a numerical integration to construct the geodesic distance. So, how do we construct the geodesics? How do we get these gamma ABC? For this, we will need the metric on the complex structure moduli space. And actually, the metric of the complex structure moduli space is also Kerla metric, and it has a Kerla potential minus log integral omega h omega bar. Taken now as a function of the complex structure and parameters in here. Parameters in here. So to compute this, there are standard techniques. You choose a basis of three cycles that are orthogonal in this way. So you have H21 plus one of these and H21 plus one of these. And then when you compute omega-wage omega bar, you find an expression which is of the type zi times gi bar minus zi bar times gi, where these g's and z's are what are called the periods of your Calabiar manifold. Of your Colour Biow manifold. And you can find these as solutions to hypergeometric Dicar-Fuchs differential equations. So there you go. There you have again a complicated set of differential equations. But actually, these are solvable and Philip and collaborators solved them and after them many more. So we can, there's a way of constructing these differential equations. Again, just giving your toric data. And then you can solve them either analytically, in which case you'd often find hypergeometric. In which case, you'd often find hypergeometric functions, or you can solve them just numerically. And we did both. And here's the result. So, if you plot the metric on your complex structure moduli space for the Famat printing, this is what you get. You get a function that looks like this, where I wrote this psi as e to the i phi, and I'm plotting sort of the radial component here and the exponential. The exponent, the exponent as an angle here. The thing to note is that even though psi appears linearly here in the solution to the Picard-Fuchs equation in the hypergeometric function, psi only depends on psi to the 5. So you actually divide your region into this fundamental domain with a 72-degree opening angle here. So you actually identify this point here with this point. This point here with this point, that's actually a more accurate picture of what this metric looks like. And this singularity here is the conifold point that you have in your printik. And it has another singularity at psi equals infinity. So there's an infinite distance singularity, and there's a finite distance singularity here at the conifold point when psi equals one in this in this convention. Good. So we can construct this metric. We can. We can construct this metric. We can use in the mirror map, we can translate what we just did in the complex structure model like space into a result in Kerala modelized space on the mirror. And we can now use this metric to compute. We can use this metric to compute the Christoffel symbols, and from the Christoffel symbols, we can compute the geodesic distance. So that's one thing we did. We just used So that's one thing we did. We just used Philip et al. solution, exact analytic solution in hypergeometric functions. We used a large volume approximation. So the large volume point is when you go out to infinity here and you see in the beginning there's all kinds of things going on, but then it actually becomes rather regular. The large volume means essentially that this t is large and this means that this psi is large. In this case, the function becomes very similar, just very simple. Function becomes very similar, it's just very simple. It just becomes three over four imaginary part of t squared. This throws away all these terms that give you all this non-trivial behavior close to zero here. And we also constructed a basis of three forms, computed their matrix, the inner products, which allowed us to read off the metric purely numerically by doing these numerical integrations by throwing stones into lakes. Stones into lakes to get points on this ambient space that we then interpolated to get again a picture like this. Doing all this, we found the following picture. So, what I'm plotting is G, the derivative of G, and the Christoffel symbol. And you see that I plot them for the exact solution for the large volume. For the large volume approximation and for the numerical approximation, and you see that they are all more or less on top of one another. So, for our purposes, both the large volume approximation and the numerical approximation actually reproduce the exact results. And I've plotted some geodesics here, so from this point to that point, you're just evolving in the radial direction from here to here. You're evolving a little bit down and going back up. So, it's shorter to go a little bit, to dip a little bit into the. Go a little bit to dip a little bit into the larger R component, come back up if you're connecting points at the same radial component at different size. And then if you're changing both R and psi between the first, the final and the initial point, you follow trajectory like this. So you just compute these geodesic distances. And as you can see, sort of the space is curved. If you were to sum this squared plus this squared, of course, you wouldn't get exactly this square. Great. So now we have. Good. So now we have the geodesic distances, and we can finally make a plot like this. We're plotting either just the choice of psi or the geodesic distance between two points and the log of the eigenvalue of the Laplace operator. And we find a plot like this. So, what I'm plotting here is what we have done is we have fixed psi to some value. Side to some value, constructed the Calabier metric the way I've just shown, solved the Laplace operator, and found a tower of states lying here, here, here, here, here, and so on. Then we chose a different side. We computed points here, here, here, here, here, and we interpolated. We did this for many points, and we interpolated these lines here, and then we translated these different points in sky into a geodesic distance. Point in sky into a geodesic distance. Before we even computed the geodesic distance, we did this and we were kind of surprised. So, first of all, what you can see is this line down here has degeneracy one. So, this is a single point. This line here, the orange line, has degeneracy 20. So, when we computed the matrix elements, we found 20 times the same eigenvalue lying here. We found four times the same eigenvalue lying here. We found 30 times the same eigenvalue lying. 30 times the same eigenvalue lying here, and so on. So there's this degeneracy in the spectrum. This degeneracy is actually to be expected and can be explained from space-time symmetry that you have. We took the most general from out crinting, sorry, the most general printing and we divided out a symmetry group such that we only have one complex structure parameter rather than 101. So by doing this, we introduced some symmetry and the degeneracies that we find here. degeneracies that we find here are actually representations of this discrete non-abedi symmetry group that we divided out so that's that's explained why we have these curves of degeneracies what surprised us was that there's this behavior where curves with small degeneracy so this green one has degeneracy one at four this one has degeneracy four this one has degeneracy five and we found that those which And we found that those which have a small degeneracy become lighter, and those which have a large degeneracy, like 30 or 20 or 20, actually become heavier. So there is a relation between the degeneracy or the representations of your symmetry group that you divided out and their behavior, the behavior of the eigenvalues. This is interesting because I would have had. Because I would have had no idea what this thing looked like if I couldn't construct a Calabiel metric and I couldn't compute the eigenmass of Laplace and I would have no idea that stuff is running up or down. However, I can just using some finite group theory, which is in this case admittedly kind of complicated, but again, you just put it on GAP and GAP solves it for you. You can find these mu's very easily without using any fancy techniques of neural networks or sections of blind bundles and so on. This is really just finite group theory here. And this is really just finite group theory here. So, if we could establish this map more precisely of why, sort of of when degeneracies run up or run down, this would allow you to see these things happen without having to compute any of these complicated things. Also, what it means is that you find these level crossing phenomena. So because you have something that runs down and something else that runs up, they cross at some point. This crossing is kind of peculiar. Is kind of peculiar. So let's say I was very lucky or unlucky, depends on how you want to see it. I had computed the degeneracy here. But I would have found is 24 points sitting at this one mass. 24 is not a dimension of the representations of the symmetry group that I divided out. So this looks very weird. And the question is: is there some symmetry enhancement or so at this point? But I couldn't see any. So this seems to be purely accidental. And probably it is. We have no crossing symmetries in quantum mechanics, which tells you that spectra don't cross in or don't cross in co-dimension zero, but these points are, of course, in co-dimension one in complex structural moduli space. So it's not a contradiction. We also have in random matrix theory, we have eigenvalue repulsion, which tells you that if you construct a random homotopy between different Hermitian matrices, Different Hermitian matrices, the eigenvalues actually don't cross, but they sort of approach and then they run apart again. So, what this tells is that the Hermitian matrix that we computed for the Laplace operator is not a random matrix. There's some very special structure. Can I just ask a quick question about that, Javier? Yeah. Yeah, so I love generally applications of RMT to string theory, but there's always a question of whether the IID assumptions that are made about universality are at all valid in a string theoretic context. At all valid in a string theoretic context, and in other contexts, the evidence is that no, there are correlations. Is that the simple way to explain why? I mean, obviously, there's correlations in Calabiao metrics on the moduli space of Calabiao. Is that how you understand the absence of eigenvalue repulsion here? Yeah, it's a great question. I can't provide a good understanding because the, well, first of all, I do not really know the dependence of the complex structure of the calibiometric on the complex structure. Of the Calabiometric on the complex structure. And even if I knew that, I would still have to translate it into then dependence of the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator in terms of, I mean, I know how it enters with it enters the square root that G, dA, one over square root that G, G A, B bar, D B. So if I knew how G depended on psi, I would be able to, and if I knew the symmetry, I would be able to reconstruct the dependence of the Laplace operator on the complex structure, and then I would be able to say. Complex structure, and then I would be able to say how the random matrix assumptions are broken. But I can't, I mean, in the absence of me knowing how this goes exactly, I can make a more precise statement other than saying it is broken, obviously, here. I see, right? So that would be sort of the rigorous way of demonstrating that they're broken. But I guess a weaker version is to just say, I mean, eigenvalue repulsion, I think, I don't know, depends on IID assumptions, which would just kind of be absurd to expect are valid. Would just kind of be absurd to expect are valid in this context. Is that right? Like, even if you can't do the rigorous version, is there any reason why you would expect those assumptions to hold here? No, no, yes, I agree. I mean, yeah, nobody would. Yeah, so the eigenvalues of this of the Laplace operator are just not random, as you said, random IID Gaussian variables. Great, thanks. But I, yeah, I don't know. So I don't know how random, how much you have to break. How random, how much you have to break it to break the eigenvalue repulsion in homotopies of random matrices. So, I don't know by how much you would actually have to break it such that you all of a sudden get level crossing. And that would require knowing the functional dependence on the complex structure. That makes sense. Thanks. Okay. We are a little bit over time, but I get to my last slide. Okay, great. So, my last slide is now taking this plot and instead. Taking this plot and instead of plotting ψ here, I'm plotting the geodesic distance. So we do find that states become exponentially light. If I take the logarithm and I use my numerical integration and use my psi to compute the geodesic distance, I can plot this in terms of the geodesic distance instead of in terms of psi. And when I plot this, I find for the lowest two, so the green one is. Two, so the green one is the green curve here, and the orange one is the orange curve here. I've only plotted the lowest two. I find this, and now I fit a line through these masses at different geodesic distances, and I read off its slope to be 0.45 plus minus 0.02. This is, funnily enough, extremely close to a conjectured bound on alpha, which is one over square root of six, was conjectured. One over square root of six was conjectured by David Andreou and others in this paper. I have to admit to my own shame, I missed this paper. David was kind enough to point it out to me. So this was a very blind analysis. We didn't aim for this one over square root of six, but it comes very close to this one over square root of six. So the point is we have this Swampland distance conjecture predicted behavior, and we satisfy the bound that is predicted in this paper. Predicted in this paper. So, asymptotically, this seems correct. In the beginning, there are some subtleties. So, you see that you can move, I don't know, 0.4 or 0.3 Planck units, and there is no tau of state that comes down with e to the minus square root of six times 0.3. In fact, if anything, at 0.3, your states are heavier than they were before, so you're not ruining your low energy. So, you're not ruining your low energy effective field description by moving, in this case, 0.4 Planck units or so. The tower of states that comes down was initially not the lightest tower, not the lightest state. So you might have a chance of running much further than you actually thought before invalidating your effective field theory. And of course, this becomes a question of the slope here. And apparently, we already have the lowest slope that we can have if this conjecture is correct. And it also depends again on. And it also depends again on sort of when which dates are coming down. If they were very high initially, the ones with high degeneracy, you would have a longer chance of running. And if you only need a few Planck units, you actually might not get enough E-folds to spoil your effective theory. Of course, asymptotically, the statement is correct in this case. And asymptotically, you will get an infinite tower of massive states if you continue to run this to infinite distance to the decompactification point. The compactification points. I mean, I have another question real quick. Yes. So, this was sufficient for some fine distance conjecture, but it didn't have to be KK modes that were coming down, right? That's correct. Yes, we only check the KK modes, and in our case, the KK modes come down. That's not surprising in our case because we are going towards the decompactification limit. Yeah. So, yeah, it could have, yeah, that's correct. So, if I had only found things that run up here, this wouldn't have disproven this from the distance conjecture. Proven this from the distance conjecture. There could have been other states that actually became light that we weren't studying right here. That's that's a good statement. Thank you very much. And I guess another point is that because of the decompactification limit, states had to come down associated with KK modes, but they didn't have to come down exponentially. And you're seeing exponential. Yeah, they didn't have to come down exponentially. They didn't have to come down with the slope of one over square root of six. And in particular, they shouldn't have risen up. Thank you. Good. So I'm running out of time. So I will just very briefly flash my conclusions. We explained how to compute color biometrics numerically using neural networks. We can do it for Korotaskarke, we can do it for CCs. We prepared a package to do this. And we found that we are approaching the Ritchie-Flat metric linearly as we improve this and Marshall-Pair equation. We use this to check the Swampen distance conjecture for one specific. Form the distance conjecture for one specific case for the Famat quintic. And we computed the spectrum using this metric. We computed the GTZ distance by constructing the metric in moduli space, computing the distance. And we found these plots which satisfy the somewhat distance conjecture with the lowest conjectural existing bound. And we found this level crossing behavior of some things running up while others are coming down. Things running up while others are coming down, which is related to the representation that these states form under the symmetry group of your color BR. And we have no explanation for why this behavior actually happens. Okay, sorry for running over time. And thank you very much. Okay, I'm not too sorry. There was also a discussion in the middle. Let's thank Fabian for his very nice talk. And there are already And there are already questions for you. James Gray? Hey, Fabian, thanks so much. And if you turn off this transition loss or you modify it to be whatever is dictated by the complex structure, sorry, by the SSV structure equation that you want to have, you can use the same code by rewriting this to specify whatever you like. I should say that in the That in the phi network, where we sort of write the metric as G Fubini study plus D d bar phi, you're just learning phi, you are staying KL automatically. So there's really nothing you can do. But the other networks that we included where you're learning G rather than D D bar phi, you can modify this to then you create a non-Kerlon network. So I just got a bit confused there. So you're modifying the transition and not. So you're modifying the transition and not the DJ term? Sorry, did I? No, you're modifying the DJ term. Yeah, yeah. Okay, good. Okay, great. Okay, that makes a lot of sense. That sounds very flexible. Thank you. So the new addition over our paper with James was that, well, we introduced different types of metrics, and we introduced this DD bar primet, which allows you to fix the Kerala class. So in the original paper, the Kerala class was fixed because we only did it for the Fixed because we only did it for the crinting, and for the printing, there's only one color parameter, so you don't really have to worry about this. But now that we are doing in principle, many, many color parameters, you need to worry how to actually keep the color parameter fixed. And if you use this spy network, you can keep it fixed. And then you're also automatically staying tailored. Yeah, but that's for the applications. That's an extremely useful addition. Yeah, great. Thank you very much. Thanks for Chris. Very much. Thanks for Chris. Thanks. There is a question by Mehmet. Demetas, you can. Hi, Fabian. Thank you for the very nice talk. There was a part where we needed the generators of the Kaler cone to take our sections in. My question is, Diapo, say that I have a Calabiao whose Keller cone is not the same. Colum is not the same as the ambient space. What would I do in that case? How would I apply? Can I apply this algorithm? How would I do it? Good. This question is very similar to the question that Paul asked. So in the moment, we only ran it for simplicity calicones. If you were to identify the calicones of the calicones of the ambient variety, and just running with this, there's a chance that. Just running with this, there's a chance that the calor cone of the colour BL might be larger than the one that you actually specified. So you might only be probing a sort of a subcone of the calor cone with this method. I see. But even if I take just a subcolone, the metric that I'm going to get are going to be correct. It's just that I can't explode the whole cone. Is that the case? That's correct. Yes. Okay. I mean, yeah, you would be missing the point. Essentially, yeah, you would be missing the the point. I mean, the if you if your calicone is is slightly larger than the one you're probing, you wouldn't you wouldn't be able to sort of access to to make some volume of some curve or device or whatever, exactly. I see. Okay. Thank you. There is a question by Jamasimo. Yes. So hello. So, hello. I just wanted to ask you whether, do you understand whether you are saturating the lower bound for the distant conjecture? And also, whether you can then try to apply your numerical methods to, let us say, prove other kind of Swampoland conjectures. Good. Yeah. So in our case, this is a In our case, this 0.44, whatever we find, is very close to one over square root of six, just numerically. Why we find the lowest possible bound in this case, I don't know. As Jim pointed out, it could have been that actually none of the KK states are the ones that satisfy the Swami distance conjecture. And stuff could have just been running up, or this couldn't have been sort of the most extreme one. There could have been some other state coming from some other. Have been some other state coming from some other effect that was becoming lighter even faster. But we already identified the one that becomes sort of the lightest, the fastest. So, this did the job in this case. But I don't have any into, I mean, I can't tell you why the bound was satisfied in this case. It would be very interesting to repeat this for different colour BRs to see whether it's also satisfied or actually also exact this bound in other colour BRs. We haven't done this so far. In other colour BRs, we haven't done this so far. We have only run it for this one particular example. Second question was whether I can use this to test other swampland conditions. And well, the answer is I knew that this particular one sort of required knowing the metric. For other conjectures, I'm not sure whether knowing the Calabi R metric would actually buy you a lot of things. So there the problems are more about instant uncorrect. So, there the problems are more about instant incorrections or other conjectures that you need to compute. But, of course, as was very nicely explained in Monday, the different somblands conjectures are somehow related. So by probing the swormland distance conjecture, you are implicitly probing the weak gravity conjecture if you establish the connection between the two. So, it would be an interesting exercise that I haven't done to go through these trendy conjectures or so that you. 20 conjectures or so that people have put forward, and see which others also depend on actually knowing the Calabiel metric. But from the top of my head, I can only think of the swamp distance conjecture. Okay, thanks. There is a question from Paul. I also have one more quick question. So, like, with regards to this degeneracy that you see. uh degeneracy that you see in the in the massive state uh spectrum because you you were saying this uh this uh this you can attribute to the uh like to the discrete uh symmetries that you're um that the quintic has and i think you said it's not a billion right or you think it's not a billion it's that five times that five semi-direct product that five so it's an extension it's an extension of that five by z five times that five right and then the representations you get are let's say And then the representations you get are something like the fundamentals or like certain certain or like a 30-dimensional representation. Exactly. So we yeah, so you write down this set five times that five similar product as five. And this has a one-dimensional representation, a four, a five, a 20, a 30, and a 60. The 60 we don't even see here. The 60 comes down, or actually it runs up, but it starts much higher than what I plotted here. We do find all the representations. Presentations, so some completeness. But yeah, so the highest one I haven't plotted. Okay. I've plotted it, but it's not in here. So that's sort of also like a pretty good hint that this is like an exact symmetry that is not broken by, I don't know, maybe anomalies or I don't, I could, I mean, that the symmetry that you see in the geometry is also really there in the spectrum or? Yes. Okay, cool. So then you. Okay, cool. So then you could also use that. You think you could also use that for more complicated geometries to find? You could even turn this upside down, right? You could try to find the symmetry group if you say, I don't know, you find an 196,000 dimensional representation and could reconstruct maybe the symmetry group of the geometry. Yeah, I agree, but I think it sort of what I had to do to get to this plot was immensely complicated. This plot was immensely complicated. I had to compute color biometrics at different points in Kerala modelized space. I had to write down a Picard-Fuch system. I had to find a hypergeometric function. I had to find eigenfunctions of h to one in non-holomorphic forms. I had to find inner products of these. I had to find a tangent space. I had to solve the geometric, I had to extrapolate the geodesic distance. I had to integrate it numerically, and I had to then extrapolate this and get this plot. So I would be surprised if this is the easiest way of finding. This is the easiest way of finding symmetries in a Calabi R. So, it probably is easy to just look at the sections and see and construct the maps between them. But I agree in principle it should be possible. Thanks. Thank you. Yvonne has a question. Yeah. Hi. Sorry, Fabian, maybe I missed this, but what do you mean here with M Planck? What do I mean by M plan? M-Planck. by implanc implanc yeah so the um this is in this is in in einstein frame where the star one term has as a one over uh implanc so yeah so i i i normalize it such that i'm staying in einstein frame during and for this calculation and this fixes then what my geodesic distance is in planck units and the what it depends on the volume or not volume six okay yeah but and so in this case you were just Yeah, but so in this case you were just changing in for these plots we were changing the complex structure. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, we keep the volume fixed, we transform to Einstein frame, and then we read off the distance in this frame. Yeah, okay. Yeah, thank you for the question. I didn't clarify this, and it's very important because if you allow yourself to change the coefficient of the answer, I mean, of the Einstein term, you can make this coefficient out. term you can make this coefficient alpha to be whatever you like actually and so it's important that you actually sort of fix fix the coefficient to be in a convention where you can actually rave the planck mass in front and then only then you can read off what the what the alpha term is or a sensible value for the alpha term okay yeah thanks okay thank you while we wait maybe for another question i can maybe make my questions so in fabian thank you very nice Fabian, thank you. Very nice talk. And so, this plot there, I mean, this symmetry you are modelling out. One of one way of mowing out these symmetries is to get the mirror of the quintic, no? Yes, so the yeah, but yeah, that's right. So, the mirror quintic, but in this case, sort of if you restrict yourself first to this space and then take the mirror, you're effectively taking the mirror of something that only has one complex structure, so then this has one Keller modulus. Structure, so then this has one Kerala modulus. Um, and you only have one Keral modulus, so this effectively then also only has one structure, one complex structure in the neural. So you're you're restricting yourself to this to this point when you mod out this symmetry. So, okay, so then this is not when you say that you have this thing with only one complex structure, it's not really the measure of the quintic, it's not the one that has like 101 killer and one complex structure. On one complex feature, no, no, I'm modding out the symmetry before. Um, so this one line you can see at the bottom here, this is the one complex structure model. So, this is this doesn't have the generacy 100 in one, this is the generacy one. So, there's one massless field here, and that is the complex structure modulus. If I were to take the full metric, I would find, so the full quantity, I would find 101 points lying at zero mass all the time. Mask all the time. Okay, but then you can also, I mean, doing a part not with this procedure and get the metric for the measure of the quintic, let's say specifying this you can also with the program. Yeah, yeah, yes, absolutely. I mean, then you wouldn't have this degeneracy anymore because you wouldn't have a space-time symmetry. But yeah, the program works. I mean, we ran the program for things that are much more complicated than the current TV and it worked. And the current again, it worked. Okay, but I haven't tried. So, the reason why I took the mirror, so why I took this highly symmetric space is because constructing constructing the metric in a 101-dimensional moduli space is very complicated if you want to do it numerically. So, I was, I didn't try, I didn't attempt to solve the Picard-Fouch system for the most general quintic. I just knew that Philip had solved it for the Famar quintic, and we wanted to focus on the simple. And we wanted to focus on the simple case first. The computing calibometric won't be the problem. I expect that you run into more problems actually and trying to find the GD's existence in the 101-dimensional space. Okay. And something else. So if I go now to this program that you published there, and I say I want to construct the Calabi out that is a complete intersection. So I give you the projective spaces, the polynomial, and the symmetry. I want to mode out. I want to mode out so it works. So I can give this data and obtain this symmetry. Yeah, so what you specify is you need to specify already the polynomial. So what you're specifying is already the symmetric polynomial, the symmetric polynomial with some random coefficients in here. Okay. So what I did, so this is this is the bi-cubic. So P2 times P2 with equations P3. With equations V3, and you just write down the terms that you want and the complex structure coefficients. So, this already relies on you having specified, sort of having modeled out the symmetry. So, removing the sections that are not invariant or the monomial here and setting equal to. I have to do this by hand and give it it as input. Exactly. It takes its input, it takes the complete and section colour beow, and the output is the colour bear method. Okay, great. Okay, great. So, is there some more question? If not, we still have three minutes. I will ask.
