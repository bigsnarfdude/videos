Indeed, I will jump on the theme that Janutz already introduced in the beginning and talk about W star super rigidity. And actually my very first slide contains some of these things that Janutz has been saying. So let me quickly somehow summarize this. So what is this about? The whole question is about to what extent can we actually recover a group G from its ambient group phenomenon algebra L of G. Phoneman algebra L of G. And in the most extreme setting, and this is the kind of result that we are after, a group is called W star super rigid. If whenever lambda is any other discrete group that happens to have the same group for Neumann algebra, then the groups must be isomorphic. And the famous rigidity conjecture of Kohn that I would phrase actually a little bit differently than Jonutz was phrasing. Then you're not washing it. I would phrase it as lattices in higher-ranked simple E-groups have this property. Sometimes it's phrased as arbitrary property T groups having this property. But historically speaking, we should really realize that when Anakon was stating this conjecture, these were the known property T groups. And if he would have, I'm absolutely sure that I should discuss this with Ala, if he would have known all these weird hyperbolic property T groups, he would not have made the conjecture with. He would not have made the conjecture with property. So I think honestly, there are counterexamples in the hyperbolic setting. But anyway, but this is, of course, an extremely beautiful problem. In terms of superhigility, the first instances were found in my joint work with Adrian Ioana and Sorien Popa now already quite a while ago. The groups that we had were weak product groups, so the initial data always consisted of a group, gamma, discrete group. Consisted of a group gamma, discrete group gamma, acting on a countable set I, then making this infinite direct sum, and then a semi-direct product by shifting a direct sum. Now, I will not go into the specific examples that we have there, because they are indeed specific and a bit unpaqued. But then two years later, with the student Mihai Berbeck, we give a more conceptual class of examples where actually the acting group is a product, it's gamma times gamma. times gamma, acting by left and right translation on gamma as an index set, and then actually if you take this as the initial data for your left-right weak product, then for a large class of gammas, and this includes all free groups, all hyperbolic groups, there are quite a few groups that you can put in the class, you have super rigidity for these left-right weak product groups. Now, very recently, if you Now, very recently, a few years ago, and I think we will hear about this later also in the conference, there were actually examples constructed by Ivan Joanna, Ossiva and Son of groups having property T, of course not arising as these with products because they would not have property T simply, but as somehow non-trivial extensions in the same spirit. You would still have a normal subgroup that looks like this and a quotient that looks like that. Looks like this, and a quotient that looks like that, roughly speaking, not exactly, but there is a particular cycle involved. Okay, now what I really want to talk about today is about a new degree of supering that with my student Milan Donville, we found recently. And Milan will also give a lightning talk on other variants of these results this afternoon. But actually, we go for two improvements of the rigidity statement. The first is Rigidity statement. The first is that we will also allow for Ducos cycle twists, and I will explain what this means. And we will look at what also somehow Jonutz at the very end touched upon. We will also look to super-rigidity results up to virtual isomorphisms, where we are looking at what does it mean for groups to be virtually isomorphic, what does it mean for two factors to be virtually isomorphic. Good. As a somehow side corollary, more of the methods than of the Corollary more of the methods than of the theorem, of course, here. I will also show you how this leads to two unfactors such that no amplification of it can be decomposed as a twisted group phoneme algebra. So that is actually quite a long history. Already, way back then, Alan Kon and von Jones could come up with two anfactors that cannot be written as a Groupfon algebra. That was because they could prove that there are two anfactors that are not isomorphic to their opposite. If you tweet. Their opposite, if you tweak, uh change the order of the multiplication, then Adrian Ioana could use his methods to come up with two one factors such that no corner of the two one factor, no two-an factor of the form P and P with P a projection, is a twisted group for Lyman algebra. But these methods could not rule out that, for instance, two by two matrices over N would nevertheless be a twisted group for Lyman algebra. So, but the method here will allow for arbitrary applications. Allow for arbitrary amplifications. So I will, in the roughly first half, give the more precise statements and introduce some of the background terminology. And then in the second half, I will go to the two key methods that Junuts mentioned, using co-multiplications and using the theory of height. And I will explain how this is used to somehow prove these results. Okay, so first, what about twists? So we have seen a group. Twists. So we have seen group fund algebra in the introductory talk. Now we will also allow for a co-cycle twist. So this is of course related to so-called projective representations. A projective representation of a group is like a representation except that the multiplicativity only holds up to a scalar. Now that scalar, you give a name, you call it mu, and then that scalar satisfies a Tucson cycle relation, and all functions. And all functions from g times g to the circle that satisfy these Tucson cycle relations, they form this abelian group of toucohomology where you actually have to mod out touco cycles by the trivial touco cycles, so the co-boundaries. So whenever there is a function phi that satisfies this, you would say that mu is trivial and the quotient is h to 1. Now, so projective representations give rise to two. So projective representations give rise to Tucsycles, but Tuca cycles also come with a um regular, say, mu representation. So whenever you have a mu, a touch of cycle, you can twist the left regular representation in the natural way. So you're not only left translating, but also multiplying with the scalar. And then this generates what is called the twisted group for an archival. So this is a canonical construction. And if you want an interesting example that shows And if you want an interesting example that shows already that typically much more non-commutativity may arise out of the co-cycle twist, you could take a bi-character, a bi-character meaning that it's multiplicative both in the first and in the second variable. That's in particular a two-cocycle. And if you do that with a canonical bi-character on the group Z2, you see that Z2 becomes very not abelian. Then, if you co-cycle twist the group phenomenon, Co-cycle twist, the group fundamental algebra C2 with this canonical to co-cycle in the irrational, it's on the nose, it's a little exercise, isomorphic with the cross product with irrational rotation, and you get the hyperfinite one function. Just a simple example. Good. So what is then the precise statement of super rigidity with cocycles added? So I will state it right away. It will hold for for It will hold for cross products with free groups and so on. So, let me introduce this class of groups for which it will hold. So, for those who know, we introduce this class C, very much attached to Tako Ozawa's work, of groups that are non-amenable, nevertheless weakly amenable, that are bie-exact in the sense of Ozawa, and an extra-technical condition, for instance torsion-free, but enough would be that the centralizer of a non-trivial element is always a trivial. It's always a keyable. And don't bother about this set of abstract conditions. The good thing is that all three groups are inside, free products of amenable groups are inside. So there is a lot of room torsion, free hyperbolic groups are inside. And then the result is that if you take the same left-right read product as before, so we are not changing the groups. You look at the same left-right read product, then actually we have this enhanced. Have this enhanced super rigidity, namely, if you take any other group with a Touco cycle and you take also any Touco cycle on G, if the twisted group Von Neumann algebras are isomorphic, then really the pairs of the groups with their Touco cycle must be isomorphic in the strictest possible way. Namely, there is an isomorphism between the groups, and after sending the Touco cycle on one group to the other one with the isomorphism, you get something. The isomorphism, you get something that's equivalent up to a cobalt. So then, of course, you may wonder how much of a non-empty statement this is. Well, it's always a non-empty statement in the sense that you allow here arbitrary groups with arbitrary cocycles. But actually, these left-right read products, they typically have a very rich two cohomology theory. So, the two cohomology is always non-trivial, first of all, and secondly, I mean. And secondly, I mean, if you take groups like a free group, it's huge. So you can compute the tocohomology, by the way. It's not too hard. So there are lots and lots of token sites in the picture. Okay. That's one enhancement of superrigidity. The other one goes to virtual isomorphisms. So let me introduce the terminology here as well. So first on the two one factor level, and then we will see what happens on the group level. Happens on the group level. So, what does it mean for two unfactors to be virtually isomorphic? So, that's phrased in terms of bimodules. So, a bimodule, MP-bimodule, that is, okay, now I'm getting confused. So, a MP-bimodule is called bi-finite if it's finitely generated both as a left M module and as a right P module, and if such a bi-finite. And if such a bi-finite bimodule exists, we say that the two one factors are virtually isomorphic. So now this may sound a bit weird. So let me phrase it in another way. For this, I first have to tell you explicitly what are these amplifications of two n factors. So we all know that you can take a corner or that you could take two by two matrices over m, but in general we take a corner of n by n matrices, and if the trace value of And if the trace value of the projection is t, we say that this is the amplification m to the power t up to unitary conjugacy, it doesn't depend on the choice of p. So what is now a bifinite bimodule using this language? Actually, any bifinite bimodule is the same thing, it's unitarily equivalent to having an embedding of M into an amplification of P with the image being a With the image being a finite index. So it's allowing for two things: you allow to amplify things and you allow to pass to finite index subfactors. And this is the kind of operations you allow, and then you call things virtually isomorphic. Okay. Now, in the context of group phoneme algebras and twisted group phoneme algebras, you then wonder what are like the sources where these virtual isomorphisms between two and two. Virtual isomorphisms between two and factors obviously arise. And they obviously arise from virtual isomorphism of groups, but also from specific kinds of touch cycles. So let me explain this. The first source of such virtual isomorphisms is when groups are virtually isomorphic. So what is the terminology here? Two discrete groups, G and lambda, are called virtually isomorphic. If they are isomorphic, up to two operations that you allow, you allow to pass. That you allow, you allow to pass to finitely mixed subgroups, and you at any stage allow to take quotients by finite mobile subgroups. And a little thing, a little computation shows you that it's not necessary to iterate this, so you can just say that groups are virtually isomorphic if there exist finite index subgroups G0 and lambda zero in G and lambda. These finite index subgroups have finite normal subgroups and the quotients arise from them. And the quotients are isomorphic. So that's the definition of virtual isomorphism. And it's a small exercise, nice exercise to make. If two groups are virtually isomorphic, you write a very explicit, explicit in terms of all the data here, of course, very explicit bi-finite bi-module between their group for Lab and Algebra. So that's one source. Second source of virtually isomorphic quad factors is. Is that a Tuco cycle may be of what we call a finite type. A Tuco cycle we call a finite type if it arises as the obstruction of a finite-dimensional projective representation, which may or may not be the case depending on the Tucos cycle. Now, if you have a Tucos cycle that arises from a finite-dimensional projective representation, pi, you can write with that an embedding of the twisted group. Embedding of the twisted group for Neumann algebra into matrices over the untwisted group for Neumann algebra. So the UG being the canonical unitary that satisfies the twisted relation is then sent to pi of G tensor U of G. U of G is just multiplicative in G, but this one is multiplicative up to mu, and so you see that this is a well-defined star homomorphism. And it also has an image of finite index. Everything is kind of straightforward to check. Is kind of straightforward to check. And this gives you a canonical bi-finite bi-module between a twisted and a untwisted Kupfoneum algebra if the Toukov cycle is of finite type. So two sources, when groups are virtually isomorphic, Kupp-for-Neumann algebras are virtually isomorphic if the Tucos cycle was of finite type. Also, harmonically, things are virtually isomorphic. Yes? Yes, I think so. Yeah, yeah, definitely. But of course, with the sister algebra, you would probably no you wouldn't need anything else. Yes, I agree. You would say that there are, yeah, I think so. Reduced sister algebras, maybe full, I don't know. Okay, so then the rigidity theorem becomes, again, for the same group. Becomes again for the same groups that once the group phoneme and algebras twisted are virtually isomorphic, that can only be because of one of the obvious things that happened on the previous slide. So let me explain this a little better. Still the same left-right-weak products, still arbitrary other group lambda and arbitrary Tucson cycles, then the existence of a bi-finite bimodule between the twisted group for Levin algebras. For Levin Algebras, meaning virtual isomorphism, is equivalent to the groups with their two cocycles being virtually isomorphic. And this we now have to state in a precise way. It means that you can find finite index subgroups in the groups. You can take a quotient by a finite normal subgroup, and after that, you transfer the two cosicles, and they should be. Cocycles and they should be the same up to a cosycle of finite time. Because that, so now I have to parse this into this definition, and I will right away make it a bit easier, since G is anyway an ICC group, there won't be any finite quotients in finite index subgroups of G arising. So the statement becomes a bit easier. So the statement then just becomes that lambda admits a finite index subgroup, and then there is a homomorphism. And then there is a homomorphism from lambda to G, lambda 0 to G, with finite kernel and image of finite index. So in particular, lambda 0. Lambda is a group that's virtually isomorphic to G. And then, of course, once you have this homomorphism, you can compose the Tucson cycle with the homomorphism, and you can compare it to the Tucson cycle that you had on the other group. That comparison, the diffusion. That comparison, the difference actually in the abelian group of toucohomology, the difference should be a touco cycle of finite type. And this is if and only if, because if you have this initial kind of data, the methods of the previous slide produce you on the nose this kind of virtualized models. Yes. And the bimodule you started with will come from, I mean, this virtualized model? Uh yes. To a certain extent, yes. To a certain extent, yes. But you have to be a little bit careful. But I think you could also, we didn't include it in the paper, but you can get from that also a description of all bi-factor time. But it's a bit subtle. Okay, so even if you wouldn't care about the tuple cycles, but you're just interested in the kind of rigidity question that L of G and L of lambda can only be virtually isomorphic if the groups are virtually isomorphic. Already that was not. Isomorphic. Already, that was not the kind of result that was available. And here you have the two somehow combined. Okay, that's for the rigidity theorem. Let me now make the sidestep to which one factors may be decomposed as twisted microfonnet algebras and then go to some of the methods in the proofs. So there is a generic theorem behind. So you can, of course, make these. So you can of course make these left right read products or left right cross products also in a more von Neumann abstract way, namely you could take any base von Neumann algebra. So let's start with any non-trivial, we need it amenable, non-trivial amenable traits for Neumann algebra. Take an infinite tensor product of it indexed by gamma. You have gamma acting on the left and on the right by translating the tensor factors, and you build The tensor factors, and you build the cross product. This cross product would be the group fundamental algebra of the read product if A0 was the L of Z over 2Z or the group fundamental draft of the base of the read product. So you can always build this. And then what we show is that it's equivalent that to be able to write an amplification of M as a twisted. Of M as a twisted group for Neumann algebra, this happens if and only if the original base is a twisted group for Neumann algebra. Okay, now you may say if you're after giving examples that cannot be written as a twisted group for Neumann algebra, you have only replaced the problem to having a base that cannot be written as a twisted group for Neumann algebra. But of course, we allow ourselves even base. But of course, we allow ourselves even bases that are finite dimensional. So, because that still gives you cross-products that are one factors. So, for instance, it's a one-line exercise. If you take the two-dimensional base and you take the trace not to be the uniform one, not giving one-half, one-half as trace values to the two projections, then since there is only one group with two elements, I mean, it's not very hard to show that this A0 with its trace is not a twisted group of an algebra. Example, if I have an algebra that goes behind this. Okay, so that's for being not a for the result saying that there are indeed very explicit two-an factors that cannot be written as equist algebra. Now, how do we prove this type of results? So, the approach is to use the method of co-multiplications, and it indeed goes back to the paper that I wrote with. The paper that I wrote with Adrianoana and Sorin Popa, but actually dates back a little further. So when we were looking at super-rigidity for cross-products, Sorin Popa and I already used it in an earlier paper, then also Adelia Noana used it for cross-products, so it has a bit of a history. Anyway, so what is all this about? So you have to imagine that you're given a very specific group G, like this left-right read product. Left-right read product, but the method is generic. But what is always behind is that you are looking at a very specific kind of group G on which you know a lot of things, and you'd like to understand, imagine L of G is isomorphic to another group fund algebra, what can I get out of this? Out of the mere fact that L of G is written as another group fund algebra, what does it give me? Well, the only thing Well, the only thing somehow that it gives you is the co-multiplication. So this group fundamental algebra L of lambda has its own unitary generators V of S, multiplicative in S, and that produces an embedding of M into its tensor square, namely sending Vs to Vs tensor Vs. That's what they usually call the co-multiplication. Now, that's the only Now, that's the only thing you somehow take from the fact that M has been decomposed as another group fund algebra. It produces you an embedding of M into M tensor M. Now in very specific cases, like for instance this kind of M, we can basically understand all possible ways to embed M into M tensor M. It's not easy, but that's what we can do in these very specific cases. And then you may hope to come back and deduce that actually. Back and deduce that actually lambda had to be basically the original group. Okay, so this works very well if you decompose M as another group for Neumann algebra. It doesn't work if you decompose M as a twisted group for Neumann algebra. But there is a variant that works. We just have to add a tensor leg. Imagine that M is decomposed as a twisted group on Man algebra. A twisted group for Norman algebra, what does it give you? Well, this twisted group phoneme algebra has its unitary generators, and that produces an embedding of M in a triple tensor product, where in the middle you take the opposite algebra of M and you map Vs to this triple tensor product. And now you let's look at it. Vs is projective perturbed by omega. By omega. Thing here, the two cocycle is omega. Here the two cocycle is omega, but here the two cocycle is omega bar. So the two cancel out nicely, and you do get an embedding of m into this triple tensor product. Okay. So that will at some point be the only thing at the start that we use from the fact that m has been decomposed as another twisted group for Nebraska and algebra. But of course we not only have isomore. Not only do we have isomorphisms, we also have virtual isomorphisms. In the story, if you have a virtual isomorphism, a virtual isomorphism is given by a bi-finite bimodule, but we have seen a bifinite bimodule is the same as embedding the 2,1 factor as a finite index subfactor of an amplification of the other one. So, actually, we still get some kind of co-multiplication, namely, let's talk about. Multiplication. Namely, let's try to follow the argument. Our M is supposed to be virtually isomorphic to P. That virtual isomorphism produces for me an embedding of M into an amplification of P. P is a twisted group from an algebra. With that comes an embedding of P into P, then sort of P opposite, then sort P. Amplify this and we get this embedding. Amplify this and we get this embedding. Now we have also P being virtually isomorphic to M. So P is embedded into an amplification of M. So we compose this in each of the tensor legs, and we end up with an embedding of M into an amplification of this triple tensor product. You would say, and what if also here M is twisted? Because then even one. Goes then even one further. Namely, if also n is twisted, we first embed L of G into the twisted and the untwisted, well, the twisted and the opposite twisted, and then again proceed. So the bottom line is only that whenever you have a virtual isomorphism between two twisted group phoneme algebras, it will produce you some. Produce you some kind of embedding of M into a multiple tensor power and then amplify it. And the tensor factors, they typically are all M and M opposite, but they can all appear in all kind of ways. Okay, this is a bit vague, but I'm trying to explain what is the only little piece of information that you use because when you get as When you get as data that M is virtually isomorphic to another twist of Finneman algebra, what it gives you is such an embedding, and that's what I'm writing up here. Any virtual isomorphism between L nu G and any other twisted group for Neuroman algebra produces you such an embedding. And then, of course, in the ideal world, I would now say, okay, here is a full list of all possible ways to embed L of G. To embed L of G into this tensor product, well, that's too much to ask. I wouldn't be able to classify all these embeddings altogether. So I still need a little more. The embeddings that arise from these virtual isomorphisms, they have a few extra qualitative properties. I will show you the key one in a minute. And what we really do is to classify. And what we really do is to classify for our group fundamental algebra here all embeddings having this good qualitative property. And then you come back, interpret things. Okay, what is this property? The notion that the way we coined it, we called it the coarse tensor embedding. So let me take some time to explain this. So first of all, a Hilbert pie module is called coarse. Is called coarse. If it's contained in a multiple of the default course by module, so the course by module is one that you always have. It's the Hilbert space, it's L2 of M tensor P, and then M is only acting on the first tensor factor and P only on the second one. This is playing in the theory, if you compare it to representation theory of groups, it's playing the role of the regular representation. So that's called the coarse bimodal. Uh by module. Um an embedding of M into a K-fold tensor product, we call it a coarse tensor embedding, if the following happens. So whenever you have an embedding of M into something else, you build a bimodal. You look at the Hilbert space of the factor on the right, on which you can act on the left by the embedding, and on the right you act just by the tensor property. Just by the tensor product. Okay, now the key thing is: if on the right I leave out just one of the tensor factors, the resulting bimodal should be coarse. So what does this intuitively mean? It intuitively means that psi of m should really spread out completely evenly over the k-tensor factors. So let me show, for instance, what maybe I have to. We show, for instance, maybe I have to sh, because the fact of writing it with k factors is not explain it with two tensor factors. So imagine that you had this and no amplification whatever. So what is ruled out by this coarseness assumption is that, for instance, psi of m would only live here. That's ruled out. Let's rule out, because then by no means, then by no means L2 of M1 tensor M2, M1 tensor 1, psi of M could be coarse, because it would be just given by the embedding of M into M1. So that's the furthest away from a coarse bimodal. The same coarseness rules out that psi of m will go only in M2. Only in M tau. It really has to spread out completely over the two tensor factors to have, and near over the k tensor factors, to have this coarseness property. And if you think of co-multiplications, they are, of course, the ones that spread out the best. I mean, they really spread out the best over the two tensor factors, and they have, like, it's a very easy exercise to check, they have this coarseness property. This coarseness problem, yeah. Okay, um, so the technical thing we prove is that for our to one factors, we can actually classify all coarse tensor embeddings and then try to get back and get to conclusions. Okay, let me try to briefly explain how you can ever try to do this, and I will try to give the This and I will try to give the different main ingredients. So assume that you build such a left-right cross product. So we have a Bayes algebra, you index it by a group gamma i, you left-right shift, and you build a cross product. Already in another paper that Soviet Popo and I wrote, we actually described all possible ways to embed such an M1 into an amplification of M2. Into an amplification of M2. And what we do now, using somehow the same ideas, what Milan and I did, is to classify all coarse tensor embeddings in the same state. There are a few steps in the argument, and this will show you what type of ingredients or results you need to know on the groups gamma involved. The first thing is that the embedding will always map our, say, normal. Our, say, normal subalgebra, this core subalgebra Bi, will be essentially respected by the embedding. Psi of B0 will, in the sense of, sort of in Popa, this is intertwining by modules, which I will not explain, but roughly speaking, it's a weak variant of being able to unitarily conjugate psi of B0 into this position there. This has to do with the fact that Do with the fact that in such cross products, the only place where amenable and sufficiently normal or regular sub-algebras can sit is actually inside the base. So it's a bit, a very weak variant of this is if you take a hyperbolic group, you will never have an amenable normal subgroup, for instance, which is of course a triviality, but or infinite amenable normal subgroup. Amenable normal subgroup. In the group Fonomen algebra of a hyperbolic group, you will never have an amenable diffuse sub-algebra whose normalizer is still large, is still becomes non-amenable. That cannot happen. So somehow, psi of B0 is an amenable algebra with a large normalizer, and the only way where that can sit up to unitary conjugacy. Up to unitary conjugacy and all kinds of technicalities is in the tensor product of the piece. Second, you have to see where the embedding psi sends the group fundamental algebra quite. There is other very fundamental work of Takozawa and also Surin Poppa saying that if you take, for instance, a hyperbolic group for Neumann algebra, it's a solid, so in a It's solid, so in a hyperbolic group fundamental algebra, there is no place for two non-amenable things to commute. There is no room for that. Here we have groups and group fundamental algebras with this property. Inside a single gamma i, there is no room for non-amenable things to commute. Now, by the very initial construction, the two copies of gamma zero, they commute, and therefore the only way that this can be And therefore, the only way that this can be compatible with the whole story is because they essentially defer, they only can live in each time in E in one of the denser lattice, again up to all kind of intertwines and so on. Third, you still have to go a little further. These unitaries, they now live in parts of the coupon. Of the group von Leibniz algebra, but we even want them to be like group-like. We want to deduce from this group homomorphisms, from gamma 0 to gamma 1 to gamma k and so on. And that uses an even more subtle argument that goes back to Solin-Krov's clustering methods, showing that, and I will explain that much more in detail on the next slide, that the wave psi sends the group gamma times gamma. Sends the group gamma times gamma to the group phenomena on the right has positive height. I have to explain this. And only then you can conclude that psi must essentially be coming from a group embedded. And then you're in good shape to start analyzing all kinds of things and to go back and to find that your groups had to be the same and the cycles had to be the same and so on and so forth. What is this height about? And now, if you got lost in the technicalities, here we go completely back to a very basic and general setting. So we take actually any group for Neumann algebra. Take any group phoneme algebra, and then you take an element, and that element has a so-called Fourier decomposition. So an element can be written as a linear composition. Linear combination, infinite. And of course, there is convergence in a two-norm only of the basic, the generating unit that is UG. You can decompose it like this. The scalars, they have a formula. The scalar is the trace of ug star A, and we would call them the Gourier coefficient of G Fourier coefficient of the element A, which corresponds, of course, to the case where the group is z. So given an element A, we look at its largest Fourier coefficients. So the maximum of the absolute value of all its Fourier coefficients. So it's somehow the where does it live the most? Now, if it happens to be the case that lambda is a That lambda is a subgroup of the unitary group of L of G. We define the height of that subgroup as the infimum of all heights of elements in lambda. So here is the theorem, and then you will understand it a bit better. The theorem that we proved in our paper in 2010 is that if you have an ICC group, G, that is written as an other group for Levin algebra. Other group fundamental algebra, and if the other unitaries coming from the other group happen to have positive height, and what does this mean? So you have L of G written as a group phenomenon alpha L of lambda with unitaries Vs. Having positive height means that there is a delta such that for every S in the other group, Vs has somewhere a Fourier coefficient above. A Fourier coefficient above delta. Somehow you are tempted to say, okay, let's take that position in G where the Fourier coefficient is the highest, and then let's hope that this map now, this is now a map from lambda to G, is somehow close to a group homomorphism. Of course, this is by no means literally true because there are typically a few Fourier coefficients that are large and it's also not on the nose true, but it turns out Don't know it's true, but it turns out to be equivalent with the existence of a unitary such that, in the algebra, such that the unitary twist of my unitary Vs is on the nose multiples of group elements of the other group with respect to a homomorphism, isomorphism between the groups delta. And this is even only if. So high positive is even only if there is a unitary that twists. There is a unitary that twists the one group for normal algebra elements on the other ones. Yes? Can I ask? Did you start off with any assumptions of the relations between unitaries here? No. Just any collection? Yes. Well, it's group phenomenon algebra. Yeah, yeah. So for ICC groups, this holds in full generality. Being able to conjugate this one set of unitaries onto the others up to a multiple is equivalent with the height being positive. With the height being positive. So, what we actually need in the paper, which I will not go into, is that you also need variants of this height theorem where you only look at embeddings and where you also allow twists. But that's not the key point here. Now, the key point is that we have this height theorem. And I also want to say a few words because this is a nice new consequence on how this, what's behind the This, what's behind the proof of the height theorem? Interestingly enough, it uses in a non-trivial way the theory of quantum groups. We have no proof of the height theorem without using quantum groups. So, what is the reason? The reason is that what is really behind and what is a key ingredient in proving the height theorem has to do with unitary Tucson cycles but dual Tucos cycles. So now it becomes a bit tricky. It becomes a bit tricky. So, when you have a countable group G, a unitary Tuco cycle, but dual Tuco cycle, if you wish, is a unitary in L of G tensor L of G that satisfies this Tucsycle relation. Now, you may not recognize this as a Tucson cycle relation until you would think of until G is a billion, and then you will see why this is called. Will see why this is called a dual toker cycle. So when G is a billion, which is of course very much not what we will be looking at, but anyway, if G is a billion, then L of G is of course L infinity of the compact dual, G hat, and the co-multiplication, delta. Becomes again delta. It's really, it has to do with the co-multiplication in it has to do with the multiplication in the group. So delta of a function f evaluated in xy is f of x times y. And then just by duality, and the co-multiplication becomes. And the co-multiplication becomes this co-multiplication on L infinity of g hat. Now, if you then interpret the formulas here, this is really saying that omega of xy times omega of x times y comma z equals omega of y comma z omega of x comma y z. I mean, you can go into it. It's really a Tucson cycle on the dual object. Yeah. Now, what we proved is that if you have such a kind of dual two cycle that at the same time is symmetric, and symmetric means that if you flip the two tensor legs, that you get the same touch cycle, then it must be a co-boundary. And a co-boundary in this story is normally it would be there is a function phi such that your thing is phi of x times y, phi of x phi of y, but you read the same formula here. The same formula here. Okay, why shouldn't we be surprised that such a thing enters into anything related to W star superrigidity? Well, whenever you have such a Ducal cycle, you can write a new co-multiplication. A new formula, omega delta of A omega star, will be also a so-called co-associative map. Associative map, and if the co-cycle is symmetric, it will be a symmetric co-associative co-multiplication, which actually always comes from another group. So if there would be, luckily there aren't, if there would be such symmetric non-trivial tuco cycles, you would rule out right away the possibility of supering the future. Future. But they simply don't exist. Okay, so why am I mentioning this and stressing this? Because, of course, I got a few times the question, and what about the category of discrete quantum groups? And actually, it's a bit surprising, because if you go to our favorite examples, all these left-right reproducts, well, actually, they have plenty of unitary Tucson cycles that are non-trivial. Of unitary Touch cycles that are non-trivial, but that are not symmetric. So, these examples, there are plenty of unitary Toucho cycles that are non-trivial and non-symmetric. This gives rise to a twisted co-multiplication, and that twisted co-multiplication induces, canonically, and the couple of cycles are very easy to write down, examples of discrete quantum groups with the same quantum group phoneme and algebra. So these examples. Algebra. So these examples, none of them remain super rigid if you enlarge the class of discrete groups to the larger class of discrete quantum groups, which was a bit of a surprise. So therefore we said, okay, let's try to modify the example a little bit and to give an example that at least also survives here. And that can only be done if you add one layer, namely if you can give examples. Namely, if you can give examples where all unitary token cycles are trivial. So you need not only examples on which automatically the unitary token cycles that are symmetric are trivial, but all of them have to be trivial. And that can be done. So here is the little variant of the construction. And that will be also my last slide. So a little variant of the construction, very explicit, is the following. So you start with the free group. So you start with the free group acting on Z2 by the standard group of automorphisms. I'm fewing here F2 in SL2Z in your favorite way. I guess we all have the same favorite way. So let's assume this in my favorite way is more precisely defined. So you look at this action of F2 and Z2 by group automorphisms, and then you build a kind of twisted left-right. That left-right weed product thing. So you build this discrete abelian group, and you act in this way by group automorphisms, and you make your semi-direct product. So this one remains super-rigid if you also allow for discrete quantum groups. So if you have any other discrete quantum group that happens to be isomorphic, you can even take corners isomorphic to a corner of L of G, then the projection must be. Value of G, then the projection must be one and the discrete quantum group was actually G. Now you wonder why is this the case? Well, the three things that go into it is this is a non-trivial quantum group kind of thing that you have to prove, that in this case, actually all unitary touch cycles are co-boundaries. So you have to solve this kind of dual touch homology problem. And there is another thing. Then there is another thing, and maybe here I can take one second. You might have been wondering why was the base in all my examples z over 2z and not something more complicated? Because there is only one group with two elements. I could have taken z over pz with a p a prime. There is only one group with p elements. What you actually need is something that, well, let me explain it here. What you would need here to even What you would need here to even hope that such a thing can be true is that if you take the base L of Z2, which is L infinity of the two torus, then this two torus should not have another structure of a compact group, but as a measure space. I mean, I'm not talking about a topology, then it would be easier. So, as a measure space, the two torus should not have another compact group structure for which this nice action by my favorite and better. Nice action by my favorite embedding of F2 is still by group automorphisms. If this had been the case, you produce canonically another group or quantum group at decomposition. But with this specific example, you show that this is impossible. And then, of course, you can still play a little bit on the base if you would say you could also make true discrete quantum groups that are superintendent, but I think we call it two. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. Do you have any
