Thank you, Pedro, for the nice presentation. Thank you very much. I'm sorry that I couldn't join that much during the conference being in California time, although for Pedro probably was the same, but he felt more obliged to be on being organizer. So, okay, so what's the objective today? So, I would like to talk to you. Like to talk to you about several recent works that I have done related to the question of phase transitions. So I want to explain you, well, first I would like to explain a bit the origin of the questions, and then I will get into several particular results in particular cases for the Cooker-Smail model and in the case of periodic boundary. For in the case of periodic boundary conditions. So, quickly to set up the problem, and I don't want to spend too much time in these introductory slides because, for you, most of you, this is really not needed. So, the only thing I want to say in this slide, it's quite interesting to look for steady states of these kind of interaction equations, which are defined by an interaction potential W, which I'm going to assume is radial and it has, for instance, in the For instance, in the easiest case, it's just a possible singularity at zero. And finding steady states for general W of that form might be more might be complicated. And you see here an example of one steady state computed with a particle method that has a funny looking kind of interesting triangular soccer ball shape. So in principle, in this kind of problems, with the interesting things about the Interesting things about the balance between attraction and repulsion in this non-local kind of non-linear Fokker plant, kind of non-linear drift equation. And there is the version in which we localize repulsion and localizing repulsion way of doing that is essentially to substitute the repulsive effect by just a non-linear diffusion. Again, I don't want to explain too much that because To explain too much that because I'm sure you have heard from me several things like this before. So, essentially, in that particular case, now all the attractive effects are modeled just by the non-local term. And in the non-linear diffusion, you have the repulsive effects. So, the question here is when you're going to have a balance between these two, and what are the new phenomena that you can get out of that balance, if any. Okay, so that has been one of the interesting questions. And it has been one of the interesting questions that have been devoted a lot of time during the last years. A quick reminder for some of you that this equation has a gradient flow structure in the sense of probability measures. And just quickly, an important thing I want to make is remind you is the free energy. The free energy functional is very natural. It has the two terms that you expect, total potential energy, which correspond to the first bending red over here. The first term in red over here and the entropy that corresponds to a non-linear function of the local density, leading to the diffusive term. This capital Phi is related to the non-linear pressure P in some relation that is written here. The Phi is assumed convex, and in that way you get the entropy-entropy dissipation kind of relation, at least formally, for that PD. Okay, good. So So, this kind of question appears in many, many different fields. And I want to make the emphasis for the first transition business I want to discuss today, mainly on the math biology applications, because it's a question that somehow was posed by several of these problems in the last five, ten years. And I will show you a couple of these examples. Will show you a couple of these examples just for motivation. So, okay, so one of them is Keller Siegel, and very big Keller Siegel. I mean, it's always nice to see one experiment. You see here some guy with apipette that is putting some bits of this chemical system to which these particular cells are attracted to. And then you see the movement of the cells that are able to somehow sense the direction of the. Sends the direction of the increased concentration, and they are just moving towards the source. So, what you want to model in this Keller Sigma models is this kind of overall movement of the population at the level of the many, many cells, not just five or six like here, but 10 to the something. And already at the beginning of the 70s, Keder and Sneago wrote these equations. These equations, I mean, which are in the case in which the cells are able to produce that quantity themselves. That's why they are coupled to a chemotractant. And essentially, you neglect some of the blue terms here in the reaction diffusion equation. For the concentration density, you invert this, you substitute here, you get an equation like the one I had before with a Newtonian potential here in the classical case in two dimensions. Okay, so this is just a quick This is just a quick reminder of the classical color signal. But today, I want to, in fact, the classical colour signal will be with linear diffusion here. Okay. But today I want to show you what happens when we put a non-linear diffusion here in a step and in one of the simplest situations. So let's go to one dimension on an interval, no flux boundary conditions, and I'm going to put a non-linear diffusion. And I'm going to put a non-linear diffusion here, which is going to be just the square of the density. And it makes sense a lot, in fact, from the modeling viewpoint to use n squared instead of linear diffusion because it's a way of precisely localizing the repulsion. If you localize a repulsion in the easiest way, which is to say that the repulsive part of the potential, you localize it as a v at 10th at zero, what you get is n-square. And there are many papers in math biology. Papers in math biology in which they make this as a way of introducing volume size effect in the Keller-Siever model with a lot of implications in different directions that I don't want to discuss too much more. But then let's have a look at that. Sorry for the change in notation. U is now the density, V is the demo track and as I said, let's take the Keller-Siegel model with all the terms in an interval. In an interval with no flux boundary condition. Okay. So let me show you some numerical experiments here. So I'm going to start with an asymmetric initial data. You don't see the initial data is over here. It's just a small perturbation of the constant steady state. Of course, you have the constant steady state. That's the first comment I want to make here. You always have the constant steady state for the density on an integral. On an integral, and here I'm doing an asymmetric small perturbation of the constant steady state. And what you get is, in particular, values of chi, which is the strength of the attraction versus the diffusion, then the stable, the constant steady state is unstable. And there is a convergence towards a steady state that in fact concentrates on the boundary here and is comparison. Let me run it again. For this very same value of this chi here, if you take a symmetric initial data, it does converge towards the constant steady state. So this is already a very, it's given you, well, I mean, I stopped here at this time, but believe me, if you continue with this time, it just goes to a constant steady state. So this is a strong indication that what you have is that the constant steady state is unstable. Is that the constant steady state is unstable, but it has a stable manifold, probably including maybe we don't know in theory, I will explain that later, maybe including at least symmetric initial data. So symmetric initial data choose in that range the parameter of the constant steady state, while asymmetric initial data either concentrate to the left or to the right with a shape that is the same but just symmetric. Depending on the symmetry, okay. Can the situation be more complicated even in one dimension? Can we do something? Being in one dimension, it makes our life much easier to solve particular for finding steady states in this particular case. So, in fact, you can and you can compute almost everything by hand in this case. And let me show you what happens. You, what happens? So, you can write all explicit stage or plenty of stationary states in terms of the kind of bifurcation diagram, in terms of the chemo attraction rate, so the constant in front of that gives me the relative importance of repulsion versus attraction here. And you see that for chi small. Small. So between zero and a particular value two, the constant steady state that corresponds to this solid line is asymptotically stable. That's what you see, and it's the only steady state. And then at that point, immediately at that point, you have infinitely many stationary solutions that you can compute by hand. And from that point, there is a bifurcation branch that gives you at least two stationary solutions in the interval 2, 5. interval two five i will come back to these two because uh and then again you have at each of those numbers that we can compute you have vertical lines vertical lines for the bifurcation meaning that there are infinitely many stationary states for those points and then a bifurcation branch that goes over that emanates from that point and in fact the shapes we know what are they so you have this one parameter familiar solution and size size This one parameter familiar solutions, as I said, for these values. And then, in the first branch, what you get are things that have one single bump, either to the left or to the right. As you move along through the branch, they are getting larger and larger and more concentrated on the boundary as they should. The second branch, what you have is a double bump that can be even included in the whole interval or separated and concentrated in both ends. But again, the same. But again, the same if you go along the branch, they just get thinner and thinner and approaching a dedax. And the other branches, you see how it goes, you will have one and a half bumps, two bumps, and so on. And in fact, you can construct many other stationary solutions more than this that are asymmetric. So in fact, as soon as you cross two, you have infinitely many stationary solutions in this problem. And you have this whole And you have this whole zoology of different branches of stationary states. So, knowing the long-term asymptotics here is rather complicated in the sense of identifying basin of attractions of different solutions. Okay, so that's just to give you an example that you can compute explicitly how complicated in a very simple example of this family the number of stationary solutions can be. Number of stationary solutions can be. Let's see another example of this family of solutions that came from a swarming model, an interaction model with alignment. I will not explain that much the modeling side, just let's write the equation. This is what is called a local Cooker's name model with noise. And I write V as the variable because it's a kinetic equation in principle. Because it's a kinetic equation in principle, the model. And I will immediately look only at the homogeneous case in which f, the distribution function, doesn't depend on x. So here, the three bits of the modeling here is that you have a tendency to go to a fixed speed. So individuals go syntactically, they tend to go to speed one, to models of b equals one. This is the local. equals one. This is the local alignment in which v you have a relaxation of v towards its mean velocity. The mean velocity computed as the first moment, the expectation in velocity of the distribution function. And the last term which is noise in velocity. Okay, so as usual in kinetic theory we look first at homogeneous cases. So let's look at the equation for the homogeneous. The equation for the homogeneous, especially homogeneous. Now, think about the V as an X does really matter from the math viewpoint. This is an equation that resembles very much the equation at the beginning with linear diffusion. Now we have linear diffusion. And why I say that it resembles very much? Because exactly you can write it as a gradient flow with an interaction potential. The interaction potential is one of the simplest you can think. It's just the quadratic. Is just the quadratic. Its gradient is V, and this gives rise to that term where the only known locality enters, which is the first moment of F. And here you have an external potential, which is a double well potential. So a kind of double well in the sense that the degeneracy is for all the sphere modulus of D equals one. You think about it in just one dimension. So you have a double well potential with just two minima velocity. Just two minima, a velocity one and minus one percent. Okay, so the free energy is what it is, what you expect, as usual. And you can explain, you can write a bit more explicit here because it's got the simplest structure. And this is the free energy. And you see the interaction term is just given by the first monomer square. Okay, so what is interesting about this is that the non-linearity is, let's say, lower dimensional. Lower dimensional because the nonlinearity of the equation goes only through a moment. So, in fact, then you can compute the steady states here again. So, how you compute the steady states? Okay, so let's look for, as usual, for the ones that make that what is in bracket here is constant and then it has to be zero. You go with the algebra. In the case of linear diffusion, what you get is an exponential of. What you get is an exponential of that form. And okay, so and then the interesting thing is that for this to be a steady state, the only thing that you have to ensure is that uf is its mean velocity, meaning its first moment. So, in fact, you can compute the first moment of this quantity and then look for the roots of that. A roots of that function. So if you have an f of f is this shape here, you have an f of that form such that when you compute integral d minus u f d v, this is equals to zero, then that u gives rise to this stationary solution. Okay? So in fact, in that way is how you reduce to a lower dimensional setting, as I said, being the nonlinearity. Being the nonlinearity are lower dimensional, and what you end up to count how many stationary states you have, you end up in trying to count in all the roots that you have for this function as a function of u and as a function of the noise. So what we prove in that paper I already referred before with Alicia Barbaro, Justin Prode Tamizo, and Pierre Legon is that this gives rise to a This gives rise to bifurcation, and we can study the bifurcation by doing implicit function theorem applied to this complicated function in principle. And you can show that there is a branch that comes from zero noise, that it starts from one of the minima of the potential. So say in one dimension to simplify, you take the minimum of the potential at one or minus one, and you have a branch that emanates from there. And then you have always the uniform state in which. uniform state in which what it means uniform uniform in the sense that u is zero when u is zero is always a solution and then you have an explicit solution which is e to the minus the potential divided by the nuts so in fact here what happens is something very similar counting the i mean counting the roots of this function is like an s shape when you change the noise you make it the less s shape and at some point there are no three roots There are no three roots, and then you have only one root, which corresponds to the Mass Vellium to a unified. So essentially, what you have, let me go directly to the picture, you have a bifurcation of that form. So you have U, this is U in terms of D. So U equals C is always a solution, giving rise to the Maxwellian steady state. And you have a curve for each value of alpha, which is another parameter that I have there, that gives you the other solution. gives you the other solution with u positive there is another one with u negative that gives you the branch so in fact in one dimension you can say that this this is like a fork like thing where you have three solutions for any given value of the noise one that is the no preferred direction one that they prefer direction to the left or they prefer to move towards the right so again it's a very simple model of this kind in which you have also Model of this kind, in which you have also bifurcation driven by noise, driven by the strength of one and repulsion versus attraction in this kind of model. Okay, so this is just to show you the steady states so that you can find them by some using some American methods that we developed with Rafa Bilo and in Way Hu. This is for the case of linear diffusion. You can do the same with this kind of double wealth potential with non-linear. Of a double well potential with non-linear diffusion, and then you get the same distance, you get a bifurcation. Here, I'm just computing the stable stationary state for each value of the noise. Sorry about the change of notation, sigma instead of d and you see when the noise is small, you get it more skew symmetric, and then it becomes more and more symmetric, and noise gets stronger. Okay, so we get to the point is can we? We get to the point: can we do a general theory for finding what are the branching points for stationary states of this kind of equations for the whole family? So, we started to work on the periodic case and the total scales. So, let me see. Pedro, how many minutes do I have left? Because I didn't pay attention when I started. I cannot hear you. Sorry. You have like six more minutes. Okay, very. Six more minutes, okay. Very good, good time. So, I'm gonna try to sell well the results now. So, the total scale, okay. So, the question would be, what can you do for the general equation, either linear or non-linear, on periodic boundary conditions in terms of W? What are the conditions on W that brings you the assistance of branching points, and what can you say about the structure of the branchings? About the structure of the branching. So, of course, the general, and we didn't put ourselves in a complicated setting with the interaction. Just say that the interaction is a C2 potential. Okay? Coordinate-wise, even to make sense with periodic boundary conditions in any dimension. Okay, so in fact, let me just give you a little A little hint of the main result that we get. So, in fact, being in period boundary conditions, what we look carefully as the Fourier expansion of the interaction potential, the Fourier modes. So the first thing that we can say is that if the potential, all the Fourier modes of the potential, and this is the right normalization of Fourier modes that I'm using by counting all. By counting all kinds of symmetries here. So you have all the Fourier modes are non-negative. Then it's what we call the potential H stable. That's the boring case. That's the case in which the constant steady state, that is always a steady state, is globally asymptotically stable. Okay? And what we did is, in fact, let me just go directly to Just go directly to this result. What we did is to show bifurcation in terms of the noise as soon as there is a negative Fourier mode. So you give me any negative Fourier mode at that point, K star, for that mode, K star, we can find a kappa star, which has this formula in terms of the value and in terms of the normalization. And in terms of the normalization of the Fourier modes, such that there is a branching starting from that point from the constant steady state. So essentially, that's the condition we need. And there is another condition is that there is a condition what we call non-degeneracy or non-resonant, that there are no other Fourier modes that has the same value of w hat of k divided by state of k. W hat is the Fourier. Of k w hat is the Fourier, is the just the Fourier mode, and theta of k is the normalization, okay? The coefficient of the Fourier mode and the normalization of the corresponding Fourier mode. So, if there is no any other resonant mode at that level and this is negative, we have our bifurcation. And how we obtain that? By doing a candle-Ravinovic theory over the equation. The equation that the steady state satisfies. The steady state should satisfy an equation like that, which is an implicit equation because the row appears given the convolution upstairs. So what we do is apply Grandel-Ravinovitz theorem in the right functional setting, starting from the constant state state to have a bifurcation branch. Okay, this works so the non-degeneracy enters on the fresh. Non-degeneracy enters on the Frechet derivatives of this functional to apply Candelagravinovitz and to say that you have the possibility of having a wife branch. Those of you that know a little bit of Candelarinovitz, you know that, I mean, yes, you have this always this transversal condition that you need to prove at the crossing point. Okay, the same applies for nonlinear diffusion, just that the functional setting is completely different. Setting is completely different. So, this was the paper with Risha Guab Guavalani, Greg Pabliottis, and Andres Lichten. That we did linear diffusion cases. Richard Guavalani has been a PhD student of Greg Pabliottis and myself. And with Rishab, we used the same ideas in terms of the strategy to look at it in the non-linear diffusion case. The main difficulty is very technical. Is very technical. The technical difficulty here is first, you are dealing with degenerative diffusion equations. I don't have to explain you in this audience all the difficulties on that. And then the functional setting has to allow for comparably supported functions with the right regularity at the boundary depending on M. And then the bifurcation branch will find it here in L infinity, whereas before we were doing in L2. So there we were doing, we were doing trampled rubber. We will do it. We were doing Krandal Ravinodics in L2 for linear diffusion. Here we do Krandal Dravinods in a complicated and more complicated space. So this changes all the proof, but the result is exactly the same in terms of the conditions. As soon as you have a negative Fourier mode and is non-degenerate, then you compute bifurcation branch for that every negative Fourier. Emote. Okay, so this answers the question of how many bifurcation branches you are going to have in the periodic case, but this doesn't tell you that much about what happens outside a small neighborhood of each of the bifurcation points. So we were asking ourselves, what happens at the first bifurcation branch? Because you know, I mean, if you are a physicist and you want an application of any of this kind of thing, what you want to know is when the first phase transition happens, especially. Happens, especially now that we are talking about so many problems with climate modeling and things like that. No? Okay, so they want to know when is the first phase transition and how can we detect that we are close to the first phase transition. So we were asking ourselves, what can we say about the first one? And with that, if you give me just two minutes, I wanna, sorry, I cannot pass here. I will just Cannot pass here. I want just this picture. So I'm going to explain you with just this picture two scenarios of negative Fourier modes for which we can say things about the first phase transition point. So in the one on the right, the one that we call the dominant mode scenario, you have that the first mode is much more negative than all the others, then these. Then, this leads to what we call a continuous phase transition, meaning that when you arrive to that point, there is a branch that goes out of that point and period locally. So there are no from the flat stationary state. So there is a branching that goes out continuously from the constant stationary state. While did you have this scenario in which two modes are, I mean, that you have different. Are, I mean, that you have different Fourier modes that are of the same size, and that there is certain direct condition or kind of resonance between the Fourier modes, then this leads to the fact that the bifurcation branches from points beyond, I mean, farther away, can bend backwards. And then your first point in which you And then your first point in which you have more than one stationary state is what we call this continuous phase transition because you are in a constant state state, and all of a sudden, at that point, you have another stationary state far up in whatever norm you are looking at. So there is a kind of that the bifurcation branch bends backwards. And we have if conditions on the free remotes, as I said, Okay, de Vondara piano, Marca. Okay, so good. So these are the two scenarios that you can find, for which we have understood a bit what happens at the first phase transition. First phase transition. And the same, in fact, I just want to go to the last part. The same in fact happens both for linear and non-linear diffusion. The only comment I want to make on non-linear diffusion from that point of view is that in most cases in non-linear diffusions, we obtain these continuous phase transitions. I don't have time to explain that, and we were looking hardly to see if we could find. Looking hardly to see if we could find continuous phase transitions. And you can find them, but very particular parameters. I mean, for instance, we can prove that this M is in between one and four. Okay, I need to go exactly. Well, in fact, between two and three, we can prove between two and three that there are no There are no continuous phase transitions, no matter what. All phase transitions are discontinuous. But as soon as m is equals 4, we can give potentials for which you can have continuous phase transitions. So we still don't understand the general picture, I mean the full general picture of branches. And I just want to mention that a very interesting question on this now is also to get Is also to get an understanding of the basin of attractions of some of these stationary states. And with that, I'm sorry if we went over time a little bit. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much.
