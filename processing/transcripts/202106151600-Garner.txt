And again, thanks for the invitation to speak here. This is actually some joint work with Jeff, so maybe I'll write that first. And so I guess you could see this as sort of the next step after what I talked about yesterday, which is a result of Hun Yung describing the free tangent category. Describing the free tangent category on an object. So now we're talking about an object with an affine connection. So I guess Rory's just been telling you heaps about this kind of stuff. So I'll just very quickly to clarify the mind, just remind you of the main definition involved. So if C is a tangent category, and we've got an object. And we've got an object M in C, then an affine, oops, an affine connection on M. And the way I'm going to set it up is just as a map k going from t squared of m into t of m. into t of m such that I can express t squared of m using this map k and its two other projections down to tm, namely I've got k this new map, but then I've also got the two maps I already had, T P and P T. And so those should express T squared M as a threefold fiber product of T m over m. Of Tm over M. So this diagram star is a limit, okay, and then a bunch of other axioms, which I'm not going to write down. Okay. But this first thing is key, and I mean, it's telling us that kind of so the second tangent bundle is. So, the second tangent bundle is generally a bit complicated to understand, but it's telling us that when I've got an affine connection, it's really easy to understand because it's basically just three tangent vectors, which are kind of like a vertical part, a horizontal part, and then some kind of torsion or twist. Okay? All right. So, as I just said, so you saw yesterday. The free tangent category on an object is this category of V1 of these certain commutative rigs, sorry, commutative monoids. No, commutative rigs. Yes, sorry, commutative rigs with With built-out vitamin potent. So, what's the corresponding pre-tangent category F on an object with an affine connection? All right, and so these sound like similar questions, but in fact, the answers have very different flavours. And so, what Jeff and I are trying to do is answer this second question. So, goal, sketch and answer. All right, and so the reason these have very different flavors is basically due to what I'm now going to talk about, which is local coordinates. About which is local coordinates. Okay, so I've got my object. I'll call this object M. So since M in F has an affine connection, that's our assumption. So I'm just going to assume that F exists for the minute and then work out what it must be. So, because of that, we know by this main fact here, we can see at the top of the screen. I mean, that, just to restate, is saying that Tm squared, oh sorry, T squared M is isomorphic to Tm times over M Tm times over M Tm. And as usual, I'll usually write just that as T3M. Write just that as T3m via these three maps, which I'm going to write in a particular order, namely, well, the order I showed you above, TP, PT, and K. So, I mean, there's a whole bunch of conventions you have to adopt when you're doing this, but this is my convention here. I thought I'd just explain that. Okay, but more generally, this means that I can describe all the iterated tangent bundles of Iterated tangent bundles of m tm tkm and so on and that's because t preserves pullbacks of these pm maps because of that we can see that if I take t and apply it to tkm this is going to be isomorphic to t sub 2k plus 1m. 2k plus 1m. Okay. And so what that tells us is that objects of F can be taken as this set here. I just take TKM where K Where k is greater than zero. And I'm going to describe how the tangent factor acts on those. Well, it's just what I said above: t of t km is t 2k plus 1m. Okay? And let's also note that the TKMs are the Are the distinct powers of Tm over M the F is in fact going to be a Le Viere theory? Okay, a Le Viere theory is just a category whose objects are the distinct powers of a given object. A given object. And so that means that really we've reduced the problem to finding a nice Le Viere theory which describes the free tangent category on an affine connection. And that seems a lot more tractable problem. Okay. And so basically what we're going to do is you're going to work out what things have to be in this Le Viere theory by virtue of the maps that have to exist in this tangent category. All right. Now, as I said, As I said, there's some notational conventions that we need. I mean, basically, we just need to sort out how these isomorphisms work, right? Because, I mean, this isn't literally true. It's just an isomorphism. So I have to choose which isomorphism I want. And that's just a kind of matter of ordering things in a certain way. And so let's say this. I'm going to write generalized elements of TK sub. Tk sub m as vector a, which is a1 up to a n via, I mean, the obvious projection maps pi i from TKM to Tm. Okay, so this is a generalized element of TKM, and these things here are all generalized elements of Tm via these projection maps. So, I mean, that's not really terribly. Not really terribly controversial. But then the point is that what we also need to know is how am I going to write generalized elements of T of T km? Because after all, the maps of our tangent structure involve kind of things going from T of something into something or from T of something into T squared of something and so on. And so we need some convention for writing such things. And so I'm going to write these as u A. As u a b like this via and then I guess this has two n plus one elements, sorry, two k plus one elements. So I need to write down two k plus one things. So the first thing is this u, and this is t p composed with t pi one, which is equally t p composed with t pi two. Basically, I just take this t km, project it down on top of Km projected down onto m and then I hit all of that with t and that gives me this first projection and then I only have two bunches of k things and that's p t after t pi i and t p after sorry k after t pi i okay all right so i'm not going to dwell on this but just to ensure that my notation makes sense Ensure that my notation makes sense. Okay, and so as said, the goal is to figure out what things have to be in our Le Vere theory in terms. Of these local coordinates. All right, that all clears so far. Good. Okay. And so it's just a matter now of going through all the stuff involved in the tangent category and seeing what comes out. Now, because you've got plus m and zero m, and those are maps from t2m to tm and from m to tm. That tells us that our Le Vere theory includes the theory of commutative mononies. Okay, because I mean it's visibly there. Because I mean, it's visibly there, and once we know that, actually, we can dispatch four of the structure maps of the tangent category straight away. Once I've got that, I can just write down what they are. So I can dispatch the match p plus. Can dispatch the maps p plus zero and l immediately, and so I'm just going to tell you what the formulae are. So, for example, p of t km, that goes from t of tkm into tkm. And I said that's u AB. And I basically just mapped that to A. Okay, and if you look at the conventions that we had before, then that's just visible from that, that that's how P T K M works. Works. Okay, then I can also work out the zero map, which goes from TKM to T of T Km. And basically, just from the axioms of a tangent category, I find out that that must take A and send it to zero, A zero. Similarly, I can work out what plus must look like on TKM. So this goes from T of Tkm times over Tkm T of TKM into. Of Tkm into T of Tkm. And so if I work out what that is, well, that turns out to be a UAB, so that's something in T of T Km. This projected onto TKM, projects onto the second factor. That's the thing we just wrote on the line above. And so the next thing is I take VAC, because they have to agree on that second factor. And so to sum those up, I just use my commutative monoid operation in my Commutative monoid operation in my Libya theory to take sums like this. Okay, and that all just follows again from just looking at the axioms for a tangent category. Finally, we have this vertical lift, which I don't have room to write there, so let's put it down here. So the vertical lift looks like this. I take UAB and I B and I send that to, it turns out, zero zero A zero u zero B. Okay, so that all looked a bit random, but again, I just work it out and that's that's what it is. So what's left? It doesn't look like we've got very much left to do, and we don't apparently have that much left to do. What we've got left is we don't yet know how T works on maps, we don't yet know how Works on maps. We don't yet know how the switch map C from T squared to C squared works, and we don't yet know what the axioms of the tangent category net us. So I'm going to start with C. It turns out that all sorts of stuff from differential geometry just kind of pops out. So I knew absolutely nothing about. Sort of embarrassingly knew I knew absolutely nothing about kind of Riemannian manifolds when I started doing this project, and so I just started calculating madly, as I'll show you. And in the end, I just turned up all these weird terms, which I didn't understand. So I asked a differential geometer, and they explained to me what torsion and curvature were. And I think it's really neat because without knowing anything about this, you can kind of just magic them out of thin air, as in about shows. Thin air, as in about to show you. So the symmetry map Cm from T squared M to T squared M is given as follows. It takes U A B and it maps it to A U B plus T of A U. So there's a sort of overloading of T here, but you'll have to forgive me that. So this T has got nothing to do with the tangent structure. This T is in fact torsion. In fact, torsion. And so, what is this T? So, it's a bilinear thing from T2M to Tm such that TAB plus TBA is equal to zero. Okay, now I've written the word by. Now, I've written the word bilinear there. So, at a crude approximation, you could just think that means by additive, i.e., being linear with respect to this commutative monoid structure that we have in our theory. But what it really means is, I guess, commuting with the lifts, so commuting with the L maps, in a sense, which I think I just saw Rory talking about previously. So, bilinear in here is meant in the stronger sense. So, bilinear in here is meant in the stronger sense, but I'm going to ignore that and act as if I meant it in the weaker sense. And at any point, I'm sure you can kind of reconstruct what's going on there. Okay? All right. So there are a whole load of proofs. I'm not going to give you all of them, but I'm just going to do this one because it's the simplest, non-trivial one. So you can get a flavor of how these things work. Okay, so the first. Okay, so the first point is if I look at TP and PT, then these are commutative monoids of T M via Okay, so I mean, why is this? Well, anything of the form P is a commutative monoid, and then T preserves these pullbacks along P's. And so, if I apply T to T M down to M, which is a commutative monoid, I get another commutative monoid. And so, and if I work out what the structure maps are in local coordinates, I see that basically I get that UAB sum over PT and then VAC. So this. C so this must be just given by u plus v a b plus c and on the other hand I can look at u A B sum over T P U C D and this is just U A plus C B plus D. Okay. All right, so I have these two commutative monoid structures and so now let's try and investigate what C must be. C must be. So just because of the axioms, so C kind of sends T P to P T and vice versa. And so in local coordinates, that tells us that it has to be of the form C of U A B must be UA because I swapped T P and P T. And then I've got something here. I don't yet know what it is, but it's some function phi of U A and B. Phi of U, A, and B. Okay? So I just have to work out what phi is. And I can do that just by using some facts, further facts about C. So C is a map of commutative monoids. So this is just part of the axioms for C from Pt to Tp and from Tp to P T. We can say that, well, the fact that it preserves the unit ensures that this holds. So phi of u00 is equal to 0, which is equal to phi of 0A0. And then something about preserving binary addition. And that tells me that phi of u plus v a b plus c must be equal to Must be equal to phi of u A V plus Phi of V A C. So this is simply writing out what it means for C to be a map of commuted monides like that by looking at the components and then focusing on this last component here. And so that's one of the axioms that I get like that. And then the other one says that phi of u A plus phi of u A plus C B plus D is equal to phi of U A B plus Phi of U C D. Okay? All right, so that's good. So how do we use this? So I'm just gonna call these star for later reference. All right, so now I'm just going to start decomposing stuff. So, what's phi of UAB? Well, I can use this axiom here to say that that must be the same as phi of u A zero plus phi of zero A B, right? Because if I had U and zero and zero and B. As u and zero, and zero and b, then I get u and b. And so that's just an instance of this axiom. And now I can use the other of these axioms. So I can use this last axiom here to say that this second term further decomposes as phi of zero A0 and phi of zero zero B. All right. All right, and then this here already tells me this term has to be zero. And so we've just got these two terms to understand. And so now we use another axiom. So another axiom of a tangent category is that C after L is equal to L. And what this tells us, if you look at, I mean, we wrote down what L is. Look at, we wrote down what L is, and we've said what C is, so I just check what happens in the last components, then that tells me that phi of zero zero b must be equal to b all right so if I now write t u um u a for phi of u a zero then we get That phi of uab is equal to T UA plus B. Okay? We did what we claimed up here. Right, that was the claim. I seem to have called that T A U. It's no big deal. Let's call it T A U. I don't know why. Maybe, maybe no, I think I'll change this. And call this T U A. Doesn't really matter. There's some convention. I mean, I better stick to the convention actually. I think this is the correct convention. I mean, correct in the sense that it's consistent with what I write elsewhere. So let me do that. Okay, so this is TAU, apparently. Okay, right. So that's it. So, why is this bilinear? Well, I mean, you can just see that it's bi-additive by looking at this, right? If I set this last thing to be zero, then these are exactly expressing bi-literative. Then these are exactly expressing bilinearity in the first two arguments. And I mean, that's not the same, that's by additivity, actually, but bilinearity, I mean, the argument's basically the same. And so why is TAU plus T UA equal to zero? Well, that comes because C squared is equal to the identity. So if you think about applying C twice, I end up just I end up just adding TAU plus T UA to B in the third component, and that should get me back to B. And so TAU plus T UA had better be zero. Okay, good. So I thought I would just take a moment to go through that proof because that shows you how this arguing in local coordinates kind of works out. Okay. Okay, all right. Having done that, I'm now just going to stake a bunch of stuff which are basically very similar arguments, but significantly more complicated. So so far, this C was just C sub M, right? And we've got to describe what C sub T K M is. And it turns out that when I start. And it turns out that when I start doing that, something else crops up, which a differential geometry would call curvature. So let's suppose I now look at not Cm, I look at C T M. So this is a map that goes from T cubed m to t cubed m. Okay, and so I have to write this out in local coordinates. I have to write this out in local coordinates. So I am going to do this, and you're not going to really enjoy it, but I'll do it anyway, just to show you the kind of stuff that happens. So T cubed M is T of T squared M. And I said that T squared M can be written as triples UAB. And so T of that can be written as triples like this. And so I've got to send that to another such triple. And I basically just apparently randomly permit. Just apparently randomly permute the factors. So I get uva primed. And then in this last factor here, I'm going to sort of adorn it with various other things. So I apparently get V primed plus T U V, and then I've got B, then I've got B primed plus, and then I've got something else here. I've got R U V A. Okay. And so, what's R U V A is a trilinear map R from T cubed M to T M such that R of A B C plus R of A C B is equal to zero. Is equal to zero. And this is what a differential geometry would call curvature. And in fact, C sub T K M given by a similar formula. So, I mean, similar in the sense that I just vectorize it, right? So, some of these things. So, some of these things that are just single entries get turned into vectors, but otherwise, it's the same. Okay, so that completely describes how C works. So, remember, the last thing that's left is the action of T on morphisms, and we haven't said anything about that. So, this leaves only the action of T on mat. So, we've got to describe the action of T on max. Okay, so, and the important point to note here is that everything so far Has only involved kind of multilinear maps, right? So the only things we've actively introduced have been these things T and R, which are multilinear. Now, these expressions here are not kind of purely multilinear, but they're the things I get from kind of applying weakening and contraction to multilinear things and then possibly adding them up. Things and then possibly adding them up. Okay, so if you like, I could take a bunch of multilinear operations and generate a Le Viere theory from them. And everything I've got so far arises in that way. And so what that means is that actually when we describe the action of T on maps, it's really enough to describe how T operates on multilinear maps. Okay? And then there's an easy way of extending that. There's an easy way of extending that to sums of weakenings and contractions of multilinear maps. So let's say that. So everything so far has only involved sums of re-indexings of multilinear maps. So it's enough to say How T acts on these. All right, and so actually I'm just going to describe how T acts on bare multilinear maps. And then you can kind of extend that to sums of weakenings and contractions of multilinear maps in a way which is sort of reasonably. Which is sort of reasonably intuitive, and I'm not going to actually tell you exactly how it works, but basically is unproblematic. So, okay, if f is multilinear, then I can describe tf in local coordinates as follows. I take u, a, b. And again, I just do this by one of these sort of calculations that we saw previously, just from the axioms in the local coordinates. So, what does it do? It takes that two. It does it takes that two, let's get this right. This is a u, and then I apply f to my vector a. Looks good so far. And then basically I've just got this b, which is kind of the tangenty part. And so what happens to that? The following happens to that. I get nabla f of u a plus Plus the sum over I is equal to one to k of f of vector a with b i substituted for a i. Okay, so if instead of b instead of writing b's here, I wrote nabla a's, then this formula here would be that I have nabla f. would be that I have nabla f of u a and then here I've got f of some a's but with one nabla a substituted in for that. So that's kind of a more differential geometry way of writing it but I'm just sticking to these plane coordinates here. So anyway what is this nabla f thing here? Well it's a k plus one linear map nabla f. f oops so going from tk plus 1m to tm okay and so this is called covariant derivative of f okay and as i said using this we can also describe without introducing Describe without introducing any new components how T acts on sums of re-indexings of sorry, of multilinear maps. Okay, and as I sort of indicated, that should be enough because those are the only things that came up elsewhere. Okay, so we've now described all the data which is required to capture the maps in this free tangent category. So we have an R, we have a T. R, we have a T which are bilinear and are trilinear and bilinear respectively. And then we have a thing which takes a k linear map and turns it into a k plus one linear map called covariant derivative. And now you just calculate madly what all these axioms say. Okay, and basically most of them are trivial, and the non-trivial ones are the following. So, functoriality of t gives you two axioms, which are the nullary and binary chain rules. So, the nullary chain rule says that nablar of the identity applied to u A is zero. And then the binary chain rule says that if I take a k linear map G and I take the and I substitute in a bunch of A bunch of multilinear maps f1 up to fk, the covariant derivative of that is the following. I can take the covariant derivative of g and plug in f1 up to fk. I guess I need to put sort of an identity in here somewhere. So I don't know, it's okay, right? So Then I take G and I do nabla f1, f2 up to fk. And then I go all the way down here. And then the final thing I do is I do g of f1 up to fk minus one, nabla fk. Okay, so that's the chain rule. And so that just comes from functoriality of composition. And so the rest of the axioms you get are really to do with the symmetry map. So there's the Maclean hexagon for C, which says, I mean, it's the thing you get in the action for a symmetric monodal category. And in the case of C, it's saying that it's a kind of Yang-Baxter operator. So this is, well, there's a So, this is well, there's a whole bunch of these hexagons. So, there's a hexagon for C sub n. Okay, and this means the following. It says if I take the symmetric sum, so I'll explain this notation in a minute. So, S of R X Y Z is R X Y Z plus R Y Z X plus R Z X Y. So, it's the cyclic sum. So, S equals cyclic sum. Equals cyclic sum, then that should equal the cyclic sum of nabla t xyz plus t of t xyz. Okay? And then I also have the Maclean hexagon for C sub T M. For C sub T m this gives me another axiom, which says that the cyclic sum of nabla R of W X Y Z plus the cyclic sum of R T W X Wxyz is equal to zero. Okay. So these two things are called the Bianchi identities. Again, I had no idea what the Bianchi identities were before I started doing this. And I kind of back formed that that's what they were. And there's one final. And there's one final axiom, which is how do I know that this C is natural is natural? This has to be a natural transformation, right? And this gives me one final axiom, which is a bit complicated, so I'll just write it down. So R U V F X, and so this is for all K multilinear F. F so R U F X plus Nabla squared F V U X is equal to sum from I equals one to K of F vector X with R U V X I substituted in for X I Plus nabla f of t uv vector x plus nabla squared f of u v x. Okay, so that's a bit of a horror. That's called the Ricci identity. And that's it. It that's basically all the axioms now are captured by those things I've written down. So I've just got time to tell you what we think the solution is to the problem. So we haven't actually done anything like proof yet, but this is the idea. idea. So everything we've seen so far involves only multilinear maps. So what I'm going to do is rather than generate our describe our Levier theory directly, I'm going to describe it in terms of an operad. And so we're going to define the following notion. An operad with connection is a symmetric commutative monoid. Commutative monoid enriched operad, O with the following data. So I've got an equivariant operation NAPLA going from O n to O n plus one. I've got special elements t. T in O two and R in O three, which are suitably anti-symmetric. And then they've got to satisfy the axioms one to five above. Okay, and all those axioms really are axioms about, I mean, they're linear equations, they have exactly the same variables. Equations they have exactly the same variables appearing on both sides in each term on both sides. Okay, and so that's the definition. And so the theorem, hopefully, is the following. There's an adjunction as follows. So on the one side, I've got operads with connection. Operads with connection on the other side. I got tangent categories containing an object with an affine connection. So tangent cats with an object with affine connection. Connection and these are operators with connection. All right, so the goal is to the claim is that there's no junction. And this I'm going to call end. And this I'll call free. And so what, where? I'm going to tell you what the two things involved are. So end. So end of a tangent category C containing an object M with affine connection is the opera of multilinear maps TKM to Tm okay so well I'll say that a bit better so it's the operator of multilinear maps Your maps. So and C M K let's say N actually, let's call it N, why not? N. So the energy maps are just all the things from TNM to M, which are multilinear. And then because of the argument we made above, that thing is an operad with connection by all the stuff we just figured out. And where? And where? So I'm going to tell you what free of O looks like. Free of O is the Le Vere theory of O algebras. Okay, so when I've got an operad, I can look at algebras for that operad. And an algebra for that operad is going to be a commutative monoid equipped with interpretations of all the operations of O. And so this is really just the Levier thing. And so, this is really just the V theory generated by that operad. Okay, now if this theorem is true, and again, we've basically done none of the work to show that this theorem is true, but it seems like a nice theorem, and it seems a very plausible theorem given what we've done above. So, now we'll call it a conjecture. So, if this holds, then the free tangent category with an object with affine connection is exactly the Le Vere theory of algebras over. Of algebras over the initial operand with connection. Now you might say that's not really an answer to a coherence problem because you've just reduced one free object to a different free object. And that is a completely reasonable statement to make. And so you might say this is not a final solution to the problem. It's not a maximal solution to the problem. Right. However, it's 746, Richard. Yeah. However, these data are indeed much simpler than the data we started with. In particular, they give you a nice internal language for working with maps in this category. So I think in that sense, they're going to be quite useful because now I can just reduce to kind of manipulations from universal algebra in order to prove stuff about this free category. Category. All right. And that's probably a good place to stop. So thank you all. Thanks, Richard. Any questions, Richard? Ben? Yeah, I was wondering, like, have you done any maybe Have you done any maybe search for a category, like a naturally occurring category that kind of acts like this thing? Maybe it isn't the thing, because like the free tangent category is V1, which. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I guess that's what I was getting at at the end, right? All we've done here so far is to reduce from one free object to a different free object, but without having. Object to a different free object, but without having a kind of without having a naturally occurring description of this, or at least a thing that it embeds into naturally. But I agree that that would be the goal, but that maybe this gives you an easier way of reaching that goal. Of course. I was asking about like candidates or like places you were looking. No idea. Places you're working. No idea at the moment. No idea. I mean, I think that would be really good if anyone has any thoughts about what. I mean, I don't even know where to start with the search for such things. So, I mean, completely unclear at the moment, but that would be fantastic. I agree. Michael, question? So, yesterday you talked about how the Vay algebras are related to tangent categories. So, do you So, is there any connection between what you've described here and Vey algebras? Can you see how the Vey algebras act on these free objects? So I think basically the idea is that kind of when you've got an affine connection, all these complicated V algebras all kind of collapse down. So Uh so there's basically an embedding of finite dimensional vector spaces into V algebras where basically I just so if I take an n-dimensional vector space then I can identify it with k of x1 up to xn quotiented by and then all the xi xj's. So basically this wn, this object wn. W n, this object w n. And so that gives you an embedding of finite-dimensional vector spaces into V algebras. And basically, that's the part of V which you get once you add in this affine connection. So all the kind of more complicated V algebras involving tensors all get collapsed down to these just W sub n's. So and basically Basically, I think the connection is telling you how to manifest that collapsing. That's the sort of best idea I have at the moment. Does that make sense? Yeah, thanks. Any other questions, Richard? All right, let's thank him again. And we'll start again at 10 minutes.
