To be here in Banff. I think many of you, this is the first time you've been at this facility, but I've been here quite a few times and really enjoyed. And I appreciate the invitation from ESCO and the other organizers to be here. And I'm going to try to, this is a condensed version of my title. I'm not really actively changing it. I just make it all fit on one line. I'm going to try and hit most of the terms that are in the workshop title, but. Shop title, but no promises. I mean, like William, I'm not on any particular mission. Maybe my only mission is to make sure you get to lunch on time. So I never want to be the person standing between a conference group and the next meal. So, this was March. There we go. Okay, well, you know, nothing new here. I want to start with just the block sphere. The block sphere as sort of the computational representation of a sort of single qubit two-level system, just as a kind of humble object, and then maybe introduce some more geometry into this picture as we go, and then use that to eventually again make contact with some of the sort of advertised themes of the workshop. So, I want to go from maybe rethinking some of the For maybe rethinking some of the mathematics, if you like, of how we view quantum logic gates acting on the Gloss sphere, and go from there maybe to some interesting experimental implementations of those ideas, touching on topology and building of quantum circuits along the way. Okay, so here's something everyone knows and loves. Maybe I'll erase some. Maybe I'll erase some of the decorations from this. So, you know, there are maybe two fundamental states, maybe poles on here that I just forgot about, that I just removed, that are zero and one states. But nonetheless, somehow all of these states are all on an equal footing. And the fundamental thing is that wherever this block sphere is living, you could pretend that it's living in. You could pretend that it's living in C2 or some Hilbert space, even though that's not exactly the case, because there was a quotienting by a global phase. That means this actually lives in some singular space. But let's forget about that. Here's some sphere maybe in some ordinary vanilla Hilbert space, and we're looking at unitary transformations or automorphisms of that Hilbert space that preserve the sphere. And sort of so single qubit quantum computing is affected through this picture. Through this picture. But maybe one fundamental thing I want to do is sort of separate the initial sphere and the final sphere, if you will. I want to think about this as a process between a source block sphere and a target block sphere. So maybe de-identifying this. So instead of thinking about it as a kind of transformation of one logical sphere, think about it as having a starting sphere or a starting sphere. Starting sphere, a starting fiber, and a terminal one. And this may seem just like an affectation, but if we go with it, you know, there might be some interesting features that one can coax out along the way. One being that, of course, one might think, depending on your physical quantum computing implementation, the application of a single logic tape, you could either view it in a discrete and digital way, or you might view it in a kind of continuous and analog way, as a continuous transformation. Continuous transformation of this qubit. And I think that the latter, the sort of analog point of view, might sort of suggest that one might want to think in this way, that there's an initial sphere and a terminal sphere, and they're being mediated by something, whether it's time, the time of the application of the gate, or maybe something happening over space. So, you know, I want to sort of break this up maybe into. Break this up maybe into stages, and so maybe it's still discrete here. And then maybe, again, here are the sort of Hilbert spaces or pretend Hilbert spaces that these live in. And then, you know, sort of make this more continuous as time goes on. And again, the parameter here might be time, or it could be some manifold. But in any case, I want to view this as some kind of continual process. But I'm just applying a single gate here. But I'm just applying a single gate here, but viewing it as happening over some space of parameters. If I go with this idea of it being happening over space, so here's this auxiliary space, maybe it's one-dimensional, maybe it's two-dimensional, it could be, there's a lot of choice here. These Hilbert spaces, I can think of as living. As living over this. So, to each point in this parameter space or this manifold or whatever you want to call it, I have a Hilbert space in which the corresponding block sphere lives or almost lives. So you might refer to this as a Hilbert bundle. You might want the way in which we're varying from one Hilbert space to the next to somehow reflect the geometry of this. If this is a smooth manifold, it's been coordinatized nicely with charts, and those charts have good. With charts, and those charts have good overlaps, and you might want this family of Hilbert spaces to honor that in some way. That might be too much to ask, but it's something at least mathematically or theoretically you could impose if you so wish. So an example could be time for your... It could be time manifold, so just the real line. It could be just the real line, exactly. And it's a good question, if you allow. Yeah, absolutely. Will you also cover mixed states? This is like for. This is like for a pure state in Hubber space, but the density matrix was that covered by your talk or something trivial extension or it's for future work. I would say it's a trivial extension. I won't talk about that in this talk, but that's something that's been on our minds. But it's not written up. But that's a great question. I mean, you kind of know where the story is going in some sense. So that's good documents. So here's this. So, you know, here's this initial fiber, here's this terminal fiber, it's a process going from here to here, and you have all of these block spheres along the way. So what used to be the block sphere in a single Hilbert space is now, I feel like, a block tube in a Hilbert bundle. So this is the setup that I want to consider. And I want to consider unitary transformations of this entire structure that preserve now this block Q. So if I start with an initial state. So, if I start with an initial state here, by the time I get to here, it's also on this sphere and not somewhere else. And again, here's some example space that we could be working over. Oh, sorry, I didn't hear. I got a bit lost. So, essentially, this block sphere is naturally like a family parameter of one qubit, right? We just have a one qubit. Yeah, yeah. So, if I apply I'm gave to the qubit, I would imagine. Uh I I would imagine that my my evolution in time is given by the trajectory of this cubic point in the block sphere. Uh how does it uh coincide with your uh evolution? That trajectory that's happening on one sphere I'm sort of smearing it out over this family. Yeah. Why is it convenient to think sphere and not to have spheres? Well, I mean we're we're thinking about both. We're not it's not it's not Thinking about both. It's not either or. I mean, these are block spheres, and what would have been a trajectory on one, you know, I look at my initial quantum state and my final quantum state is just the initial state is here and now the final state is here. It's both at the same time. Okay, yeah. It's good. It's good. Thanks. So, you know, one way you might try to put in motion this idea of unitary transformations preserving this tube now is to consider. Now is to consider, well, again, this is some vector bundle here. So I'm going to call this Hilbert bundle E just to give it a name. And this is over M, this parameter space. I want to consider a connection in the usual sense, differential geometry, general relativity, whatever you like, wherever you're first exposed to it. But I want to consider a connection on the spectra buckle. And the reason why this is important is I. And the reason why this is important is that a connection produces linear maps between any two fibers. So, if this is equipped with a connection, it's a way of taking states on one of these fibers and mapping them linearly to states on another fiber. And this is just parallel transport. So, connection really is just an ordinary differential equation. If you don't want to think about it as some sort of fancier gadget, it's really just a differential equation that produces a That produces a cross-section, a cross-section of this bundle, and I want a cross-section that passes through the block Q, is what I'm trying to engineer. So it produces a cross-section, let's call that X of E, over some curve in here. I mean, this, you know, to Will's question, this could be just some one-dimensional thing. This could just be a curve in and of itself, but it could also be some higher-dimensional surface, and it might have curves on it. So if I pick a curve in M, Curve in M, then this differential equation produces a cross-section of the bundle over that curve that passes through a given initial state. So I pick an initial state, that's my initial state on one of these spheres, and what this differential equation is, is it uniquely produces a section starting in that state and going somewhere else in another fiber. And if you like, the transformation from that initial vector to that latter vector is first and foremost. Is first and foremost a linear transformation. So the equations, if you like, is summarized really simply just as this. So this is, if you like, differentiation along the vector field of this curve, and we're saying that this section is produced, is a conserved quantity of this motion. And also the initial state of this section is whatever we prescribed in the first fiber. And so just schematically, And so, just schematically, here's M. I picked some path or some curve in it. Here is the data of the bundle. And this connection is taking states here, which are really the initial conditions of my differential equation, and producing terminal states here. Now, the issue is that for a given connection, the parallel transport map is always defined, but it may not be unitary. It may not preserve these Hilbert, these, these, these. These block spheres. However, if the Hilbert bundle is Hermitian, and that's a stronger, of course, each individual Hilbert space has an inner product on a fine. But I'm asking for them maybe to also vary nicely in a family. So if the whole Hilbert bundle is Germitian, then the bundle admits a unique connection compatible with that global inner product called its Chern connection. And that, in fact, preserves the block to you. And then furthermore, if the surface And then, furthermore, if the surface M has its own metric on it, and if our bundle E is actually the tangent bundle of the surface, or maybe the tangent bundle twice, and that's just for dimensional reasons, because I want this locally to look like C2, the usual treatment of a single qubit. Then there's a unique Hermitian inner product varying on the Hilbert. Product varying on the Hilbert bundle that's compatible with this metric, or is really is this metric. And then the natural curves to pick on the surface for this parallel transport to take place are really the geodesics with respect to this. So there's a whole sort of natural geometric package here. And so, for example, if M were a Riemann surface, then it would come with its own metric, and all of this would be set in motion. And you would get, if you like, a sort of continuous gate that passes. Continuous gate that passes through this overt button. What is a natural curve? The geodesics, the distance-minimizing curves. But it sounds like a definition for the natural curve. Yeah, natural means distance-minimizing. On M. On M, yeah, exactly. If M has a metric, then I can measure distance and I can look for curves between two points that minimize the distance. Between two points that minimize the distance. Those curves are the ones that I want to pick. Maybe natural is natural to me, but I'm just so. I think there was a misunderstanding with your formulation by natural groups. Yeah, I thought you were defining two different things, and then you proved that. Oh, no, this is this is a yeah, this is sorry, yeah, I'm not, this isn't its own sort of mathematical idea that I'm saying. Mathematical idea that I'm saying is this is a matter of taste to me. The natural curves are the best curves from my point of view are the optimal ones that you do sense. Yeah, exactly. But so your E is now this double tangent bundle. Yes. Yes, I picked now a particular bundle, which happens to be Hermitian in the right way. Exactly. So in this. So, in this sense, we have a kind of geometric generation of single-qubit gates. So, a Riemann surface, M, so I'm really focusing on 2D structures here, compact 2D structures topologically. A Rhema surface M has a metric. If it's genus 0, if it's the sphere, it's what's called the Fubini-Studi metric. If it's genus 1, the total. Genus one, the torus, it's the flat metric. If it's genus two or larger, it's the Poincaré metric. But they come with these natural metrics, and then that sets in motion a unique transport operator that, again, maps any block sphere onto another and gives you a unitary flow along the block two. So if you like HM, which is really a choice of the genus and a metric, and I say there's a choice here because once you get the genus two or larger, there's not just a single sort of, you know. Single sort of Poincare or negatively curved metric. There's a whole family of them, a whole moduli space of them. But once you make that choice of genus and then metric, if there's choice there, then this is, if you like, a geometric construct that achieves a distinct gate that can be used to transform block states in this sort of continuous variable quantum information way, this kind of CVQI that's of interest to you. So again, So again, the picture might be: you know, there's an initial block state, there's a terminal block state, we sort of fill it in as this bundle over this manifold, maybe this 2D surface. And if all the right data is specified at the beginning here, then where this particular state, whatever it is that I pick here, where it ends up here, is completely determined. I'm not sure what happened with this slide, I think you can ignore it. This slide, I think you can ignore it. But in any case, I wanted to show you this picture. So, this is not a block sphere. This is one of the possible M's that I'm taking. So, this is just the Riemann sphere, a genus zero surface. So, I'm imagining that this process is taking place here. So, this is genus zero. And I also have to mark my initial and terminal fibers. So, I'm going to take the poles. So, there's a Hilbert space, there's a whole bundle. Hilbert space, there's a whole bundle on this entire thing. But there's a Hilbert space here, and there's a Hilbert space here. And then one simply does, you know, parallel transport. I start with a tangent vector here and do the usual thing and see where it ends up here. It will reverse direction. And so this is really the poly X gate, but generated through this perspective. What's convenient is to maybe think of the start and the finish of this process as punctures. Of this process as punctures. I'm going to actually rip open the surface at these two points. And if I take some topological liberty, that's really the cylinder. I mean, the twice-punctured sphere, if I open this up and open this up. And I don't really want to deform this. I really want to keep the geometry intact, but we allow ourselves some liberty. Topologically, it's homeomorphic to this. And the idea of punctures is useful because you can. The idea of punctures is useful because you can now start to compose. These are gates, again, is what we sort of established. And then you want to compose gates and make a circuit. Well, these punctures are geometrically where I'm going to sort of glue these surfaces together and compose. Then you could ask, what about the identity gate? I mean, can you achieve that? I guess that's a basic question. Well, you know, I don't really want my parallel transport then to. Really, I want my parallel transport then to change the state. So, I want to do something on flat space. So, I might as well, but I need to treat it as a surface and maybe as a compact surface. So, what I'll do is, you know, I'll just take a standard tiling of the planes, just flat space, wrap it up into a torus. Like I said, this is topologically non-trivial, but not geometrically non-trivial. It just has the flat metric on it. And so, you know, a tangent vector here is a slide. You know, if this is my initial point, just pretend, and this is my terminal point. That tangent vector would just. My terminal point, that tangent vector will just slide and nothing will happen to it. And that's that's you know, so this surface corresponds to the identity gate. And if I think about it as a you know, a puncture for the starting fiber and a puncture for the ending fiber, it's really the twice-punctured torus, like this, with the flat metric. So, this is a geometric picture of the identity gate in this sort of continuous variable single keygo system. So, as I said, you know, introduce. As I said, introducing punctures is a means of composing gates, at least topologically. And actually, introducing more than two punctures is interesting because it allows for multiple input-output qubits. So now if you want to start introducing more than one qubit into the picture, you can do that by playing with the number of punctures. So if I had the three-punctured sphere, it would look like the pair of pants, and it was an input cubic. And there's an input qubit, and then there's a tensor product state here with coming from two qubits. And I can do the same thing. Everything I was doing before, I could think about parallel transport here. So another interesting thing about this is that diffeomorphic compositions then offer equivalent circuits. So here's some circuit that I made by composing these things at their punctures. Things at their punctures, and then there's three inputs here, two outputs here. You could show that you could argue that this surface is actually diffeomorphic to this surface. This is a genus 2 surface, actually, with five punctures, and it's actually diffeomorphic with the right choice of metric to this one with two punctures and genus 2 and 5 punctures. So, this is, if you like, a circuit that completes. A circuit that completes the same program is this one, and we recognize that at a geometric level. Here you go from left to two months right. Yeah, this will not be well, it it depends what you mean, I guess. Um again, if I start I guess, again, if I start with a state somewhere here, like this puncture, I can transform it in a unitary way to something over here. But you're right that something has changed fundamentally about this circuit because of how I've organized the inputs and outputs. Can you glue the identity so that the final state has three qubits? Can you glue these punctured tornadoes? Yeah, I mean, you can play that sort of game. So this you view as a transformation as something that acts on three qubits, which is great. And then in the end you have two qubits. Yeah, but I'm also just viewing it at the level of, you know, I have an individual state that starts here or starts here or starts here and then I just see where it goes. That's how I'm viewing a circuit from this point of view. All I'm doing is transporting a state from here to one of these two. To one of these two. I guess the question maybe boils down to what does the pair of pants mean for you in terms of a quantum computation language? Yeah, so like the pair of pants, for instance, again, is, if you like, let's orient it so I start with the two. I'm sort of choosing a state on one of these two qubits and seeing where it goes from there. It's a state in the tensor product of these two, but and then I just watch where it goes into this final state. Under this, I have no control over where this map takes me. It's set in motion from the very beginning by the parallel transport, and then I just see where it goes. So transform states, and it will end up in that block sphere at the end. Because it's a map from V tensor V into V. Partial transform. Partial trace, for example. It's like exactly, yeah, yeah, exactly. In fact, that's the language we use in the paper. Yeah. In fact, that's what this part is all about. So you might recognize that really, if we forget all the geometric information, forget the metric, forget the bundle, forget the, you know, just the assignment of vector spaces to the punctures and the topology, we're really talking about a TQ of T. So if you like ignoring the metric and the bundle structures, Like ignoring the metric and the bundle structures, but retaining the composition rules and the assignment of vector spaces and the punctures is a forgetful functor to a TQ of T. But working from here, you can now introduce those features. You can thicken an ordinary topological quantum field theory with differential structures and bundles in a way that things still compose in a categorical way. So, this is something that we worked out with a PhD student of mine who'll advertise. PhD student of mine who will advertise Mahmoud Azam in this paper here. So, this is where we sort of worked out all of the composition rules of this type of data. And we were sort of picking paths along these surfaces and watching what the parallel transport does, but turning those parallel transport, it's like a relay of parallel transports, turning that into formal composition rules that extend the baseline. The baseline TQFT here. So, this was the paper, and I would say that the main difficulty in this is the fact that if I start with if I decorate this with some connection and I'm trying to do parallel transport and then pick it up as I go from here to here, depending on what the underlying metric was here and what the underlying metric is here, and what the underlying metric is here. The underlying metric is here, and if the underlying metric was here, this choice can be highly, let's say, highly non-continuous, highly singular. And so, what you have to do, you have to do some very, very careful analysis, and you have to kind of ramp down the connection as you approach this colour using like a bump function. And then you have to ramp up the next connection as you start into the next colour. So, you have to smooth out mathematically the transition from one to the other. It's actually very, very natural in the end, but it's actually quite. But it's actually quite, I would say, quite difficult mathematically. And so I praise Matt Mood for his sort of attention to detail and his patience through struggle here. Now, this is all fine, but you could ask, can you, in some sense, implement physically such a scheme? And I think the main challenge here, and by the way, I didn't miss. And by the way, I didn't necessarily say this, but yes, you can identify some particular gates, like I mentioned poly x, but generally, these gates that you get are themselves the solutions of some differential equation, and they may be very non-explicit, and you may only be able to write them down in an approximate way as some 2x2 matrix of approximate entries, taking in the initial vector and then giving you the sort of the final state. But in any case, But in any case, if you wanted to try and manufacture this as a system, well, I guess the point is that you can't really manufacture in any natural or even artificial way negatively curved surfaces, at least at first glance. Maybe the key is to remember where the Taurus example came from, the Genus 1 example. So this came from a Euclidean lattice when I showed you that an ordinary flat lattice. That an ordinary flat lattice. I mean, I used a square lattice, but if you start to now go more towards material science, you might prefer a sort of honeycomb lattice, which would produce the same thing. Are you thinking this concept of many, many false materials? That's a great question. I'm only thinking about 2D materials. And finite genus. So finite genus, two-dimensional Riemann surfaces. Compact Riemann surfaces. Dimensional Riemann surfaces, compact Riemann surfaces with punctures. I'm not thinking about anything else, but you could ask all of these questions and you could do what I mentioned about transforming these states could be done over any manifold. But that's a great question. For reasons in integrable systems, you might want to consider infinite genus instead of finite genus, just for example. But the key sort of trying to manufacture this is maybe to remember again that the Taurus came from a The torus came from a lattice. And you can unwrap a surface of any genus, but the lattice may be hyperbolic. And if the genus is larger than one, you can ask what lattice leads to that surface when you quotient by translation of the lattice cells. If you can do that, then you can view this whole setup, the signals propagating, being transformed along the lattice. Transformed along the lattice. And what you're seeing on the surface, on the Riemann surface, is a reduction of those, that sort of single-particle free dynamics. So if you wanted to get, so maybe a good thing to mention, I don't know how aware people are of it, is that if you want to produce a genus G surface, then you should take a 4G sided. A 4G-sided tessellation of the plane. So that's why, if you want genus 1, you take a square lattice. It's not exclusively that, they actually come in groups of four. And if you forget about odd-sided things, because you'll have a side left over that's troublesome, and just focus on even things. So four and six produce genus one. So that's why, in conventional electronic band theory, if I have some sort of gap system on a honeycomb lattice, Gap system on a honeycomb lattice, the effect of position space and Brion zones will be tori. But that's coming from the fact that if I identify opposite sides of a hexagon, I will get a genus 1 surface the same as I do if I do a square, which is, I feel like an underemphasized fact in mathematics, but maybe not in physics. But then the point is that if you want to get genus 2, then you really need to look at eight-sided octagons or 10-sided things. Or ten-sided things. And I'll always take just one representative of each class, so I'll just work with octagons. But the problem is, if I try to tile the plane, two dimensions with octagons, I get something silly that looks like this. I have all kinds of empty space that cannot be filled in unless I do this. So this is the plane represented as the hyperbolic, represented as the Poincaré disc. Represented as the Poincaré disc. And here is a regular tiling of the plane, if you like, by hyperbolic octagons. And so this is exactly commensurate with what I was saying earlier about choices of metrics on surfaces. This is, if I were to persist with the Euclidean metric, I would get this sort of defective, highly defective picture. I mean, there's too many defects here to work with this. But if I work with the Poincaré metric, Poincaré metric, then this, then I am able to tile in a nice way. These may look different as I go out from the center, but in fact they're all the same. Every side has the same length, every angle is the same, the area of each of these cells is the same, but computed with the Poincare metric, not, or with a Poincare metric, not with the Euclidean metric. And then if I take the quotient of this surface, The quotient of this surface by the symmetry group, by the translations of these cells, which form what's called a Fouxian group, which is actually a non-commutative group, by the way. So you're into sort of a little bit of non-commutative geometry here. The translations of the hexagon or the square, that's an abelian group. But actually, the group that expresses the translations of this is actually non-commutable. Discrete, but non-commutable. Commutative. Discrete, but non-commutative. And if I quotient by this, I will get a genus II surface with an inherited negatively curved metric or Poincaré metric. And so we get back to the kinds of surfaces I was talking about earlier. So instead of, but the point is that this is something that I could try to engineer, and the reduced space dynamics of it would be what's going on on this sort of compact or compact punctured surface. So again, you know, here's a more So, again, you know, here's a more fanciful picture. And if I maybe identify opposite sides, there's actually more than one way you can identify sides now. You could identify opposite sides, or you could identify a side with a side two away. But however you do it, you can produce a genus II surface now. So the idea is to propagate signals here, understanding that the actual effective dynamics is here. Dynamics is here. So the idea is to turn then this into something like this. And I don't know who has seen this before, but this is, I mean, this looks like some sort of on-chip device, and I guess that's what it is, but it's a synthetic material. So this is an artificial hyperbolic lattice. It's based on a septagonal tiling. So they chose odd side. So this was manufactured by. Manufactured by Alicia Collar and Andrew Howe and Matthias Fitzpatrick at Princeton, but now Alicia is at Maryland. So this is a thin film of niobium on a sapphire substrate. These are coplanar waveguides and resonators that have been reactive ion etched and photolithographed onto this chip. Onto this chip. And so, this is an experimental setup for exploring the transformation of these signals, exactly as I've been talking about, in something that resembles or pretends to be hyperbolic space. So, the way in which this is achieved is that the tunings, the couplings between each successive ring, decays in a way that resembles the hyperbolic metric or the Poincaré metric. And so there's some, and this is a And so there's some, and this is a superconducting device, it's run at about 1 Kelvin. There's been some limited success seeing signatures of sort of hyperbolic signal transformation here. So things that look like they're traveling along hyperbolic geodesics. But I would say that this is very early. But this is from manufactured or at least published in 2019 in Nature. And this is the underlying lattice. And this is the underlying lattice that it's based on. This is another similar experiment. This is like a tabletop experiment, room temperature. This is from a nature communications article in 2022 by a different group. Legenhager was the sort of first author, as a PhD student in a group in Germany. And again, they're different kinds of telltale signatures of hyperbolic propagation that one sees here. I don't know as much about this as I do about the sort of superconducting version, but I just wanted to include it for a kind of completeness. But one maybe needs to do a careful theoretical study of actually how signals propagate quantum mechanically along, at least along, let's say, this kind of device here. And so, this is sort of another side of my work, which was in parallel. Work, which was in parallel to computational rules related to TQFTs that we're developing. So, this is with Joseph Macheko, who's actually based here right in Alberta, in Edmonton, at the University of Alberta. And so, you know, one of the things that Alicia and co-authors lamented in their paper where they produced this synthetic hyperbolic lattice was the lack of a hyperbolic band theory in the sense of Bloch-Loquet theory. Sense of block loqué theory. This is precisely what we were kind of working on actually in parallel with them at the same time, which is trying to work out band structure, predict band structures, for these kinds of lattices. In my mind, I was motivated by what we're doing with these TQFTs and thinking about the sort of higher genus setting, which, you know, the Which, you know, the, if you like, the genus one setting of what I was talking about before is already covered in some sense by an electron or a photon propagating in that domain is already covered by ordinary band theory in 2D. We're trying to think about higher genus band theory here. And so this is sort of continuous space band theory, if you like. So this is, if you like the eigenvalue problem or the Schrödinger, the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a Hamiltonian, which is just A Hamiltonian, which is just a continuous space Laplacian, or in this case Laplace-Peltromy operator, because we're talking about something negatively curved, as well as some periodic potential that remembers or plays well with the lattice. So in a couple of papers, Joseph and I worked out in some kind of approximate sense this sort of band theory story. Story. And we did interesting, I think, numerical experiments. You could take, so this is the start of a tessellation, of a genus II or octagonal tessellation. This genus II surface that you get by quotienting, by translations of this, or identifying opposite sides, is what's called the Voltze surface. These things are marked here are the symmetries. These rotations. Symmetries. These rotations are what generates the non-commutative symmetry group of this material, if you like. And you could take this fundamental cell and you can triangulate it and do some numerical experiments on it and see what the band structure, at least on this one piece, might look like. So this is a picture of actual electronic, well. Actual electronic, well, this is a numerical prediction of actual electronic bands. You can see a gap here. The coordinates here are, this is like a half rotation in a generating circle, going up to pi, a sort of half rotation along one of the generating circles of the Brion zone. This is for the zero potential case, which of course is completely periodic in a silly way. These are plots. In a zero potential case, what do you mean? In a zero potential case, what do you mean? So that the Hamiltonian here is just the Laplacian, the Laplace, the Laplace operator. So just the kinetic part, but no potential. Potential is zero. But it's not a tube binding model that you're using. No, no, not here. No, but this is. So this comes from a non-zero potential. Yeah, exactly. It's the empty lattice model or the. But this is. So here we turned on a non-zero potential. Non-zero potential. No, but if it was a tight binding model, you'd have to make some choice of the top parameters between the sites of the lattice. Yeah, and in this case, we do that. And you can see how these perturb away from the empty band structure. And these are just kind of color plots of the wave functions associated with these energy bands. So you can, the point is you can do, at least in some approximate sense, some band theory here and make predictions that can be tested. Make predictions that can be tested with these experiments. And I think I've touched upon most of the words somehow in the title of the workshop, but I wanted to get to exact solutions, which I think somehow is the main term in the workshop. But maybe I'm still talking about approximate things. But another type of analysis for trying to understand these sort of single electron or single photon dynamics has been WTB. Dynamics has been WTB type analysis for this eigenvalue problem. Some of you may be familiar with the topological recursion of Einard or Antum or ANAR to Rantum Chekhov, which is a kind of genus zero perturbative expansion of wave functions, which produces whatever exactness you want in an H-bar parameter. What another PhD student of mine, Another PhD student of mine, Christopher Mahedio, who's now a postdoc at UIC, we're doing was trying to take the usual topological recursion and implement it in higher genus, which means a couple of decisive mathematical changes, including changing the recursion kernel. So this relies on the so-called Bergman kernel, and we had to change that kernel significantly to function with a higher gene. With a higher genus initial curve, but nonetheless, we're able to produce perturbative wave functions, which, if you like, correspond to these punctures on these surfaces taken all together, these really are perturbative wave functions. They're computing something within a logarithmic CFT. But I won't go into any detail about that, but this was the reference. But so there's a few different things going on here. You know, we're motivated by a particular way of understanding. Way of understanding quantum circuits and gates that were more focused on continuous variable quantum information that led us to interact with experiments that could realize that setup artificially. Whether or not those experiments are successful determines or is determined by whether there's some agreement with fundamental theory, like coming from band theoretic predictions of From band theoretic predictions of the sort of single particle dynamics. And then we were looking at different ways of extracting to a sort of sufficient exactness that data. So maybe I'll end with just some comments on new experiments. I'm working with a group in nanofabrication at the Institute for Quantum Computing in Waterloo here in Canada to make maybe. Make maybe slightly more sensitive versions of the experiment that you saw of Collar and companies. So, this is work in progress. So, this is similar to the Collar experiment. This is eight-sided. So, this is a high-purity aluminum film on a silicon substrate. You can see a very similar pattern of resonators here. Of resonators here. This is an actual picture, sort of micrograph picture of a junction in an actual device that's been constructed. We've manufactured several versions of these now. There's eight-sided ones, but also 12-sided ones, in order to explore the genus 3 picture, which that hasn't been done by anyone else yet. And this is a picture of an actual signal analysis. Signal analysis, if you like, from this device here. So, you know, this and this, or this and this, are the punctures, if you like, sort of the start and finish, the starting node and the terminal node. And this is what a sort of circuit looks like here. These spikes, and this is a vector network analyzer graph. This is sort of the so-called S21 output. And you know, this sort of signal here seems to be suggestive of perhaps detecting the genus II hyperbolicity, but we're trying to replicate this in other genera, and it sort of remains to be seen. But the experimental aspects of this design will have been accepted for a March meeting paper, so for next month. But it's very much sort of preliminary thing. Sort of preliminary thing, but the point is to try and do a little bit more than the collar experiment, including one thing I should say about the collar experiment is that somehow even at one television, too noisy to see the spectral gap, so one that we predicted numerically. So we're trying to see that here. But the hope is that, you know, kind of concatenation of these chips is a kind of, with the right tuning, is a kind of realization of. Of realization of the mathematical continuous variable quantum information approach talked about in the first half of the talk. So, you know, this is a snapshot of various kinds of work in progress, and this is a more complete list of papers that I've been sort of referred explicitly to this paper, or these first three papers, and this last one, some further papers in the hyperbolic lattice construction and theory. Lattice construction and theory are here with various co-authors and students. And here are some of my collaborators. So I mentioned Alicia Collar, who's here, Joseph Macheko, who's here. The NanoFab Lab at IQC that I mentioned is run by Mateo Marian Tony, who's here. And these lattices that I showed you at the end were manufactured by Chris Hsu, Mahmoud Azam, and Christopher Mahede who were two PhD students. And Christopher Maheda were two PhD students I mentioned on the T3OT's paper developed with MacMu. This is a large part of his PhD project. The WKB analysis and topological recursion was the PhD of Chris, different Chris here. And you've seen a lot of nice pictures. Those were drawn by a former student of mine who's now at Berkeley, Elliot Kienzel. This is what he prefers, I think, as his avatar. He co-wrote one of these papers. We co-wrote one of these papers on hyperbolic band theory. These are, I just want to acknowledge funders and also industry partners who partnered in various aspects of this work. And that's it. And I think I'm finishing exactly on time. So down to the minute. Thank you. Any further questions? Thank you very much for the talk. So I have a couple of questions, if there's time. So the first one is: the example of hyperbolic matter you showed, I guess it should be the effect of the fact that translations are normal billion, therefore higher dimensionally reducing representation. Absolutely correct. And the question is: how do these higher dimensionally reps affect the band structure that you show? Perfect question. There's something I didn't ask. It's something I didn't advertise at all, but you're exactly right that because the symmetry group of the lattice is now non-abelian, you now, in principle, have representations of all orders, of all ranks taking place, not just abelian ones. And so, in fact, this has a very stark and pronounced effect on band theory in the sense that usually in two-dimensional bread and butter electronic band theory, you have some reduced for a latter. Some reduced, for a lattice, you have some reduced position space, which is a torus, and you have its momentum space, which is another torus, and they're Fourier dual to one another. Now the picture is very different. You have your reduced position space, which is some higher genus surface of the kind we're trying to manufacture here. And then the momentum space, the crystal momentum space, is now a disjoint union of infinitely many different spaces. You have the abelian part. Spaces. You have the abelian part, which is a torus, but it's a higher-dimensional torus. And its dimension, its real dimension, is twice the genus. So you see in ordinary two-dimensional band theory, you have this two-dimensional torus, and you have this two-dimensional other torus, the momentum space, which is two times one, two times the genus. Now is two times G. So in just in the genus II setting, it's a four-dimensional torus. And that's just the abelian part. And that's just the abelian part. Now you have the two-dimensional part, whose dimension is even higher and whose topology is even more complicated. And then you have the three-dimensional and the four-dimensional part, or maybe I should say, rank four, rank five, and so on. And each one of these has a band structure over it. So you have a band structure, gapped, ungapped, whatever it is, on the abelian part. And then you have another one. And you should think about these as infinitesimal or quantum corrections to the abelian. To the abelian part. Statistically, the abelian part still dominates. And if you forget about this other stuff, you still have a pretty good approximation to what's going on. But if you want to think about very somehow high-order effects that you're trying to engineer in a material, if you think about bandgap engineering and you're trying to engineer some custom behavior, you could try to interact with this sort of higher order data. Now, in these experiments, that's far beyond what we're doing, like experimentally. But theoretically, we see. But theoretically, we see the picture, and it's exactly what you just said. The fact that they are somehow contributing in a subtomiate way is like experimentally or can be proven, or that is a mathematically? Mathematically, but no experimental observation of this, to my knowledge. I just had a question. You're talking about hyperbolic block theory. So, I guess, like, did you leave? So I guess, like, did you leave out a Hamiltonian that you can write down? Yeah, I didn't show it, but it's just a plastic. Hamiltonian would be like minus the Laplacian plus, let me see, some, and this, this has to be invariant with respect to the group. So you showed us only the case. So you showed us only the case when V is 0, yeah? So numerically, we looked at, yes, V equals 0, but also V and Eisenstein series. So these kinds of series are nicely compatible with the group for number theoretic reasons. That's why that second paper is called automorphic Block theory. And this also is not the flat-space Laplacian. It's been adapted to the Poincaré metric. So I would call it the Laplacian. So, I would call it the Laplace Beltromi operator, strictly speaking. This is the Hamiltonian. There are any other questions? I don't see any others. Okay, so going backwards, you started from the Roman surface with the targets, and then you come to the Roman. So, in that case, so I understand what happens if you take the Riemann surf and you use the Cut it to a hyperbolic tessellation. But what happens if you have punctures? Like, are these mapped to, like, is like introducing boundaries to the hyperbolic tessellation? That's a good question. I didn't really mention that either, but you know, on the tessellation, I would choose the punctures to be on the, like, to be vertices. I could have eight vertices. I'll choose two of them, for instance, or some subset of them. I'm not choosing them on the interior. Choose them on the interior. If you use them on the interior, then things become more complicated. The devices that you were picturing, the first one by Andrews Hopes, Princeton, these were meant to realize this hyperbolic propagation. But it but is it is it ultimately the aim to like glue these things together and implement some sort of Together and implement some sort of set of gait synonyms, topological quantum scheme. That's a good question. Not in their original paper. I mean, their original paper, they're just focusing on one of these and saying that this is kind of like an experimental setup for looking at physics in curved space or looking at certain kinds of quantum computation, maybe topological quantum computation. But this idea of composing them, connecting them together in some series, was not there. Was not there. That was sort of, I think, more narrower. That's ultimately your goal. Yes, yeah, exactly. And are the devices high enough quality that this actually works, or are we very far away from? I think that what they did was very good. It was an incredibly good proof of concept for some of these features. And we're trying to take it further. But I think that in terms of technological readiness level, I think it's. Technological readiness level, I think it's still quite low. I wouldn't make any claims. I wouldn't bet a week's salary on that. Yeah, yeah. Say five to ten years. I don't see any other questions. So yeah, let's thank Steve again. So next up is the lunch break. And we're Lunch break, and we'll be back here at 1 o'clock. And the lunch break is in the same room that we also have breakfast in the school. Yeah, what the life is.
