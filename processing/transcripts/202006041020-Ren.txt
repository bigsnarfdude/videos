Sorry, I think you couldn't hear me. No. Yeah, trouble hearing and listening to me. Let me just do it like this. Can you hear me now? Yes. Okay, good. Sorry. Okay, so thanks for the introduction and thanks for the invitation for this workshop on model theory. I've been learning a lot of things in the last four days. Last four days, and I wanted to use this opportunity to talk a little bit about tropical algebraic geometry. Are we supposed to see you? Ah, yep. Okay. Can you see me now? Yeah. Yeah, sorry. You were supposed to see me on the other laptop, but somehow that microphone didn't pick me up. So that didn't work as planned. Okay. Good. Good. Let me just hide this video panel. Wait, hide floating beating controls. Okay. So I want to use this opportunity to talk a little bit about tropical algebraic geometry. And I had to shuffle my initial plans around a little bit after seeing the outcome of the poll, of the spreadsheet poll that everybody sent around. So apparently, according to the poll, basically a lot of the audience is quite polarized. So there are a lot of extra. Polarized. So there are a lot of experts in tropical geometry, but there are even more people who don't know a lot of tropical geometry at all. So instead of trying to give you an in-depth talk about a certain topic and certain computational aspects of tropical algebraic geometry, I just decided to give you a shallow overview of what tropical algebraic geometry is. Yes, and basically maybe where the analogs are to model theory and things like this. And differential equations. Differential equations. So let's start. So tropical algebraic geometry essentially around basically the interaction of four things. And two of them you can find already on the screen. So one type of objects is piecewise linear convex functions on Rn, such as the function that's written on the top right and the graph is illustrated here. And on the other hand, also they relate to piecewise linear structures in Rn. Linear structures in Rn by looking at their bent locus. So, bent locus is basically the set of all points where the piecewise linear convex function is not differentiable. So, in the case above, it would just be two points here, here and here. And one reason why people want to are interested in these kind of objects is not from algebraic geometry, but some people were also interested in real-world applications. So, let me talk a little bit about economics. So, in economics, there exists So, in economics, there exists this notion of a product mix auction. And this is a type of auction basically where bundles of goods are up for sale at the same time. And what you do is basically every agent, so these are the buyers in your auction, they will have an evaluation of the goods. And let's say this is the amount of money they think they can sell it for. So, this is here displayed in red. And basically, if you have an agent evaluation, You have an agent evaluation, then you can calculate the maximal profit the agent can make depending on the price. So, x is the price for the first type of bundle, y is the price for the second type of bundle. And in particular, if you have this agent evaluation, you can, for every price, you can identify, or for most prices, for almost every price, you can identify uniquely a bundle that will maximize his or her profit, so maximize their profit. In particular, there will be a codiment. In particular, there will be a co-dimension one set, which is economists call the locus of indifference. In tropical geometry, we refer it to as a tropical hypersurface. And this is the set of all price vectors for which there does not exist a unique bundle that maximizes the profit. So in a way, this is like the interesting part because this is the part where you can't predict how the buyer in your auction will behave. So this is what makes this interesting. interesting and one common um one common goal in these product mix auctions is to decide whether uh something called a competitive equilibrium exists so what let me just briefly explain what a competitive equilibrium is so basically the idea is you as the person running the auction you have a certain number of goods that you want to sell now there are people in the audience who basically can bid on every type of good they want and what you're trying to do is you're trying to find a price vector Do is you're trying to find a price vector such that, first of all, you sell everything that you have in stock, and second of all, every single buyer in the auction goes home with a unique bundle that maximizes their profits. So they also go home happy. So in a way, this is commonly in economics, this is called the everybody is happy auction type of auction. And this is something that is, for example, where I come from from the UK. So this is something more currently based. The UK. So, this is something where I'm currently based. This is where which the Bank of England is using to distribute loans to the other smaller banks. And according to the works of Baldwin and Clemberer, this is basically, this can be the question whether competitive equilibrium exists and how to check when it exists. This is essentially a question in tropical geometry where you have to look at how these different tropical hypersurfaces intersect. So, for every So, for every buyer in your auction, you have one of these black sets. And by looking at how these black sets intersect each other, in which pattern you can decide the existence of, or even guarantee the existence of a competitive equilibrium. So this is one, I guess, real-world application for that. Another thing where tropical geometry comes into play are polynomial structures in Kn. And now, this is where, for me, it gets mathematically more interesting. So, basically, More interesting. So basically, if you have a K that's a valued field, wait, let me. So if you have K that's a valued field, then you can apply, so you can map Z to minus the valuation of Z, and this is meant to be coordinate-wise. So for every of these n coordinates, I apply this. And if I have essentially an algebraic variety here, what I get out of it is this piecewise linear structure that you see on the right side. Oh, yeah. Side. Oh, yeah, sorry, I forgot. So, you also need to take the Euclidean closure because if you don't take the Euclidean closure, well, the value group might not be an entirety of R. So, you might have holes here on the right side if you don't take the Euclidean closure. But we always generally assume that k is algebraically closed. So, our value group is always q, so the rational numbers at the very least. Okay, and so why one aspect, one application where this is important is the following. Important is the following. So, this is called a linear optimization. Oh, yeah, by the way, in case you didn't notice, so I will mainly talk about works of other people. So, yeah. So, this is also works by other people. And this is basically involved Smales 9th problem. And it's also also referred to as a continuous Hirsch conjecture. So, basically, Smales 9th problem is linear programming, whether this can be solved in a strongly polynomial time. So, just in case you don't know, linear programming is basically. Don't know, linear programming is basically trying to minimize or maximize a linear function on a set that is cut out by linear equations and inequalities. So everything is linear. I have constraints that my points need to satisfy. These are linear. And the function that I try to maximize over it, that's also linear. And one open question is actually whether this can be solved in what's commonly referred to as a strongly polynomial time. And for a very And for a very long time, people believed that the interior point method is the way to go to do this. So, the interior point method is as follows. You start with some kind of a random point in the interior that you just compute by random. And then basically you try to change it so that the function becomes more and more optimal, so that the value of this point under the function becomes more and more optimal. Let's say it becomes smaller and smaller, and you want to minimize it. And you want to minimize it. And what people realized very quickly is that this, if you do this in a certain fashion, these points will actually follow something that's referred to as a central path. And so they will follow a certain central path to the optimal solution. And basically, yes, one way is so basically then this curvature of the central path is very important for the complexity of this interior point method. The other method that exists is X. The other method that exists is exterior point methods. So, there you would go on the outside, but here you go on the inside. So, where tropical geometry comes into play is the following. So, this is a work by a couple of Paris mathematicians, so Xavier Alamigion, Pascal Benchimont, Stéphane Gobert, and Michel Joswick from Berlin. And what they did is actually: so, in a way, I mean, we were talking about linear programming, and normally you always think about Normally, you always think about R. So, what you could look at on the bottom right, so this R and this double curly bracket T, this is supposed to represent the space of formal power series in T that are basically convergent in a small neighborhood around zero. So, these are power series that are convergent in a small neighborhood around zero. So, you can show this is a field. If you add two, it's still convergent. If you multiply two, it stays convergent as well. It stays convergent as well. Well, it's actually a pursue series. Sorry, not power series. You also allow negative exponents. Okay, and what this actually is as well is actually this is a valued field. So every pursue series has a valuation, which is just the lowest exponent appearing in it. And if I have to simplify their work by a lot, and I guess I don't do it a lot of justice by doing so, what they showed is they constructed they showed is they constructed an example where um so they constructed an example of a linear program over this field and a linear program over this field is basically a family of linear programs over r right because i can if i specialize t to some very very small number so it it converges i get something in r and they constructed a linear program basically where the central path has um basically um let's see i think an exponential number of turns and they showed basically then And they showed basically then that the curvature cannot be exponential. And this basically solved, well, answered negatively, one of the prominent approaches to the continuous Hirsch conjecture. Okay, so this is one of them. So we have three of them. Last one that I want to talk about is obviously polynomials over k. And basically, what tropical algebraic geometry is, is the interaction between these four types of objects. These four types of objects. So, on the one hand, I have polynomials, I can look at the algebraic varieties, and then I can look at the algebraic varieties under the piecewise component-wise evaluation to get piecewise linear structures. On the other hand, I can assign these polynomials over k also so-called tropical polynomials. And this goes as follows. I would have to replace every coefficient in my polynomial with the negative of its evaluation. I replace addition by maximum, and I replace multiplication by addition. Please multiplication by addition. So in this case, I guess this would be maximum of 2x. X times X is becomes X plus X, which is 2x. So this would be maximum of 2x comma X comma 0, which is what's written there. Okay. And yeah, so let me just, so one thing that you can show if you have these things, and let me just skip the next few slides. I apologize, I'm a little bit behind in time. Apologize, I'm a little bit behind in time. So, this is what phylogenetics. So, one thing you can show if you do these kinds of definitions is that if you have a prime ideal, and now I assume it's prime over the ring of Laurent series, or alternatively, if you have an irreducible F-N variety in the torus, so if you tropicalize it, so you basically go to the lower right side, then this is the support of a balanced polyhedral complex of the same dimension as your original ideal or your FI. ideal or your affine variety and also it's pure and connected in co-dimension one. So this what I just read out is basically referred to as the structure theorem of tropical geometry. It tells you how the tropical variety looks like, the support of a balanced body drew complex. The fundamental theorem tells you that there are multiple ways to define it. So as you said, if you remember this pseudo-commutative diagram that I drew was a square, so you could go like first down and then to the right or first to the right. The and then to the right, or first to the right and then down. And the fundamental theorem tells you basically this commutes, so it doesn't matter in which way you go. So the tropical variety of i can either, so if i is an ideal, this can either be defined as the image of the zero set under the negative of the valuation, or on the other hand, so if you go on the top side, this would you would need to introduce initial ideals. So it would be a set of all weight vectors where the initial ideal is Where the initial ideal is monomial-free. And obviously, the tropical variety of i is also the intersection of all tropical varieties of f, where f is an element in i. And the initial ideal, so what the initial ideal is basically, so the initial ideal is an ideal generated by all initial forms, and an initial form of a polynomial is just the sum of all monomials of lowest degree. So, for example, in the bottom, I've drawn you the tropical tropical. I've drawn you the tropical tropical line in two ways. So, this is a zero set of x plus y plus one, such that, yeah, so this is a zero set there. And if you tropicalize it, so you will find the point one one on there. So, this is either oh, this is either the image of this point here under the negative valuation, or it's also in the you can it's also here on the right side because if you look at x plus y plus one and you look at the minimal terms. terms, sorry, the maximal terms and terms of maximal weighted degree, this is with x plus y, and it's not a monomial. And so what makes this fundamental theorem very nice is because for me at least is if you have a computational problem that you want to solve in tropical geometry, you can do it actually in one or two ways. So either you can use techniques from polynomial system solving, or you can use techniques from classical, let's say, computative algebra of polynomial rings. Computative algebra of polynomial rings, such as Grubner bases or anything else. So there are basically two ways to tackle one problem in tropical geometry. And usually the best way is actually to use a combination of both, because every way has its distinct advantages and drawbacks. Okay. Oh, yeah. Sorry. And this is basically how one could look like in a higher dimension. So let me just go back quickly. So basically, so yeah, so a balance. Yeah, so a balanced polyhedral complex is basically a finite union of polyhedra as such. Balanced means that if you look at the codimension one facet and you add up all the outgoing directions, they sum up to zero. So in this case, you look at the zero point here, then you add this direction, this direction, and this direction, and this zero sum. And connected in co-dimension one means I can go from one cell to the other by only passing through cells of co-dimension one. In this case, Of co-dimension one. In this case, it's trivial because I'm only looking at a one-dimensional tropical variety, but in this more complicated one, you can also see. Oh, wait, sorry. This is also connected in co-dimension one. Basically, I can go from any one cell to any other cell without crossing, by only crossing edges of dimension two or one. Okay, so this is how tropical varieties look like, how they're defined. Let's continue. Let's continue on. Sorry, let me click here. So, one nice application of this algebraic description, now using basically all four pillars of tropical algebraic geometry, is the following, one which I like a lot. This is basically an application in celestial mechanics, a computational application. And here, basically, people in celestial mechanics people are interested, amongst other things. Are interested amongst other things in certain structures called central configurations, and these central configurations are basically a configuration of n points in space with masses, such that if you apply Newton's law of gravity, they will all immediately collapse to zero. Sorry, they will always, they will basically directly scale down to the center of gravity. So they won't like circle around or do whatever. And one conjecture that people had for a long time is basically that there are. Had for a long time is basically that there are only finitely many of them up to symmetry. So, obviously, there are symmetries here because I could take a central configuration, I could twist it around. It would so if I rotate it, it will still be a central configuration. And this was unsolved for a long time for n equal, yeah, for higher ends. And what these three authors did in 2006 and 2011 is basically they used tropical geometry to show that there are really only finitely many. And they did it quite cleverly. Basically, they have this big idea. Basically, they have this big ideal. So, a lot of people spend a lot of work coming up with polynomial equations that these centric configurations need to satisfy. This will give you an enormous ideal of which you cannot compute any Kruppner basis. But somehow these authors were capable of isolating individual polynomials and show that if you look at their tropical varieties and intersect them, it's zero-dimensional. Consequently, the tropicalization of the entire ideal is a The entire ideal is a subset of that and thus also needs to be zero-dimensional. And if the tropicalization is zero-dimensional, then the original affine variety also is zero-dimensional. And that's what they did in a very simplified way, just saying it. In algebraic geometry, more importantly, there exists this very nice theory of commov-Witten invariants. So, one thing that people are interested in numerative geometry is counting these invariants. So, for example, Counting these invariants. So, for example, how many plane algebraic curves there exists of a certain degree and a genus. Now, this degree G and oh yeah, of degree G and genus G that go through this amount of points. And this number of points is exactly chosen, is exactly the right number. So there are only finitely many and not only no zero. There's a non-trivial amount, but only finitely many. And one important work in tropical geometry, I think one of the things that gave tropical geometry a really big push, in my opinion, Big push, in my opinion, is Mikhalkin's work that basically says: okay, if you're interested in these algebraic curves of degree D and genus G, you can, instead of looking at algebraic curves, you can also just look at these tropical curves in parentheses counted with multiplicity, and the numbers would basically be the same. So in a way, the tropical curves, the set of tropical curves, behaves exactly like a set of algebraic curves. And basically, the degree of a tropical curve is the, and the genus of a tropical curve. Curve is the and the genus of a tropical curve is similar to the definition of the algebraic curves. So, in a classically, degree is basically you intersect it with a linear space of complementary dimension, and then you look how many points there are. Well, this red line on the bottom right, this was our tropical line, so it's complementary dimension, and you dissect it, you get three red points. And genus also just means, well, you see a circle here and a circle here that's both genus one. Okay, so basically. So basically, what this means is instead of computing Gromov-Witten invariants using your classical equivariant, let's say, intersection theory, this is one very nice way of computing them, there's also a way to just draw all the possible pictures in tropical geometry. So basically here I have degree 3, genus 0, going through 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 points in general position. So these red points are the fixed, and then I basically draw every tropical curve that goes through them. Tropical curve that goes through them of genus zero of degree three. I just want to mention that this is indeed genus, so even though there has a circle here, cycle here, it's still genus zero because you can find a tree, so like in the sense of abstract graph theory, you can find a tree that maps nicely onto this as opposed to the other previous pictures. So this is quite nice. So and then the final number you get here is the one that you probably know where. That you probably know when this theory is 12. Okay, so this is innervative geometry. So, what makes tropical algebraic geometry for me very interesting, and I guess I have my personal stake, why I'm interesting, is that the following, it's kind of a contradiction. So, on the one hand, algebraic varieties and tropical varieties, they are really, really similar. It's like strikingly similar. This is not a coincidence. So, we talked about the Gromov-Witten invariance that were the same. There are also existing. Same. There also exists invariants, enumerative invariants of real algebraic geometry called Welsh Anger invariants. They are also exactly the same. And in fact, some of the, I guess, tropical geometry is the only way actually currently known, or was the first way known to compute these type of invariants for classical algebraic geometry as well. I've shown you two slides before a picture of an elliptic curve. You know, the genus 1 curve, and elliptic curves have G invariance. What it turns out. invariance well it turns out that tropical curves tropical elliptic curves also have j invariance sorry j invariance not g invariance j invariance and they are essentially uh the same um there also exists this concept of igusa invariance which is also uh the same for both type of theory and even like some classical known results in algebraic geometry such as smooth non-hyperliptic curve of genus three that they can be canonically embedded as a plane quartic Has a plane quartic. This also holds in tropical geometry. I mean, if it's smooth and non-hyper elliptic, if and it's an if and only if, essentially. Okay, so even though like these are tropical varieties and algebraic varieties are so very similar, there are like a lot of striking differences. And I guess here I'm mainly mentioning theta characteristics. So, for example, if you look at a tropical cubic surface that I've drawn here and you look at lines on it, you will see easily that See easily that they contain infinitely many. With contain infinitely many, I mean they may contain infinitely many. So, in this example, so this is the two-dimensional surface is a tropical cubic surface. And these fat lines on this, these are basically tropical lines. And for example, sorry, the controls here are a little bit weird. So, for example, there's a tropical line that goes like this, like this, like this. So, there's no doubt that this is a tropical line because it's a tropical zone. Is a tropical line because it's a tropicalization of a line. However, in this case, I can move the node further back and it would still be a tropical line on this surface, which shows that this tropical surface here has infinitely many of them. Similarly, the same holds true for other theta characteristics. So, for example, for quartic curves, so quartic plane curves, the theta characteristic are so-called bitangents. Are so-called bitangents, and tropical quadric curves have infinitely many bitangents, and tropical sextic curves have infinitely many tritangents, even though classically there are only 27 lines, there are only 28 bitangents, and there are only 120 tritangents. So, this is something where tropical geometry and classical algebraic geometry is very different. And in a way, there is no way of fixing this by twerking with the definition of what is a tropical surface or what is a tropical line. Tropical surface, or what is a tropical line? Because this is just it. So, yeah, so basically, a very interesting question in tropical geometry is to characterize what are the similarities, but also what are the differences. And oftentimes, personally, I think differences are even more interesting than the similarities. So, why these differences exist. Okay, I have five more minutes. So, a little bit about computer. So, a little bit about computing tropical variety. So, a lot of these results that I've shown you, they actually rely on explicit computations, either to computations to prove a theorem or computations for basic experimentation. So to get an idea basically how these things behave. And one topic that comes up frequently for that is how to compute a tropical variety. So I give you this I, a finite generating set of it, and I want to know how this tropical variety. And I want to know how this tropical variety looks like. And I don't have a lot of time left, so I would just do this in two quick steps. So, computing tropical varieties is working in two steps. So, first of all, you need to construct a starting point. And second of all, you need to compute the rest. And how this goes is basically, as I mentioned, this tropical variety is a support of a balanced polyhedral complex. So, basically, what you do is you do a traversal of this complex. Traversal of this complex. It's almost, it's exactly like a graph traversal, basically, where the vertices are your maximal cells and the edges are the cells of co-dimension one. Think of it like that. And they're only finitely many, so at some point you're done. And so this is a topic that people have spent a lot of work on, and I've personally spent a lot of work on to do this very fast. And so one thing that I want to point out is just that this relies theoretically. It's just that this relies theoretically heavily on the fundamental theorem and the structure theorem. So, without either of those theorems, it's not possible at all. Structure theorem tells you that this is supported by Danny's Predictual Fan that enables that. And what plays a role in these algorithms is basically convex hull algorithms. So, you need to know how these cells look like if you have a point in there. Then you need to compute Gruppner basis or even something called tropical Gruppner basis, which is an analog to that, but that's a little. Analog to that, but let's leave that at rest. And you also need to use polynomial system solving in order to speed up certain computations. Or you can use that to speed up certain computations. Okay, so I have two slides left. I'm also running out of time. So this is how tropical algebraic geometry looks like. So this was the interaction between these four areas. So let's go a little. Oh, sorry. I forgot about that. So let's About that. So let's look a little bit about how tropical differential geometry looks like. And this is basically the same picture as here as previously. So instead of polynomials, I now have differential polynomials. And instead of solutions to polynomial equations, I have solution sets to my differential equations. I can get these differential polynomials can give me tropical differential polynomials by the same pattern. I replace z with a negative of the valuation of z. So in this case, actually, I'm working over differentially valuable. Actually, I'm working over differentially valued fields, so it's still have evaluation. I replace addition with the maximum, I replace multiplication with addition, and I get a tropical differential polynomial. So one difference, key difference, is that instead of looking at valuations, so let me just go back and previously I had the negative of the valuation in the bottom, and instead of that, in tropical differential geometry, you consider the support of the solutions. So, for example, if one plus Solutions. So, for example, if 1 plus t to the power of 4 is a solution, so suppose we're working in this ring here of complex power series, then the support would just be the set 0, 4. So, what you get is basically subsets of z to the power n that are greater than 0 for this ring here. And four years ago now, basically, people have proven that the fundamental theorem also exists for tropical differential geometry. So, basically, in short, that this time. So, basically, in short, that this diagram commutes, which is basically very nice because, as I said, in classical tropical algebraic geometry, this is really, I mean, it's called fundamental theorem because it's a fundamental foundation of everything. So, this is like the very important to have. Without that, nothing works. And this is my final slide. I'm running out of time. So, why tropical differential geometry? So, I'm not a tropical differential geometer myself, but Geometer, myself, but I've talked to a lot of people in the community, and one thing they're really excited about is that this might give them a combinatorial approach to periodic differential equations. So, I'm not sure how many of you are familiar with periodic differential equations, but they are like really, really complicated to work with because everything that works classically over the wheels won't work periodically because of the topology of your field. And some of them are also interested in looking at global solutions of these. interested in looking at global solutions of these chemical reaction networks. So in hopes that they will tell you a little bit, it's a commentarial approach to get global solutions. What I said before is so we know the fundamental theorem. So this was this work in 2016 by Ahrocha, Garay and Fogani. Recently they managed to generalize it actually to PDEs. So this means you don't only have a single derivative but you have multiple derivatives which commute with each other in a certain pattern. So if you're doing classical So, if you're doing classical tropical geometry or classical fields of valuation, this could basically correspond to something we call higher-order valuations for valued fields. And also, differential Grubner bases exist in a tropical world. So this was shown by these two mathematicians from the Chinese Academy. However, what remains unknown and what I have spent a lot of time thinking about, I admit unsuccessfully, is so basically, well, first of all, a structure theorem, but mainly what I thought about is a function. Theorem, but mainly what I thought about is the finiteness of tropical differential basis. So, some kind of finiteness result would be really, really nice to have for these tropical varieties. Now, I know that basically the differential algebra and the tropical differential algebra, these are not Netherian rings. However, in the classical case, the tropical semi-ring is also not, sorry, the polynomial ring over the tropical semi-ring is also not Netherian, but you still have finiteness results. And the question is, could we do this the same for tropical differential geometry? For tropical differential geometry. And if you're interested in tropical differential geometry, so Christian Garré, I'm not sure whether he's in the audience here right now, he has posted a very nice survey paper about using tropical differential geometry, in particular the motivations of some of the definitions that people had. Okay, I think I'm out of time, so thank you very much for your attention. Okay, so thank you very much. We have a chance now to ask questions. Uh ask questions. So anyone who'd like to ask a question, you can just unmute yourself and uh and and raise it. So, okay, let me okay, some people are asking questions. Uh, yeah, actually, so uh I have some linked discussion. Okay, let me let me fed even to via email. So, Gleb at some point asked me uh yesterday why we defined these things in tropical geometry. Um Geometry like they are. So he also mentioned that a lot of the definitions in tropical geometry that we have don't make sense, well, make little sense or let's say look unnatural from the motivic from that point of view. So the reason why we do these things in tropical geometry, I mean, beyond what he also admitted to prove like interesting results, but beyond proving. Results. But beyond proving interesting results, the reason why we do this, this is a little bit of a philosophical question now. So I personally think this is the really, this is a very natural object to look at. So the tropical variety, let me just go back to the definition. So here. So this tropical variety of eye for me is a very, very natural object to look at because for me, so again, think, recall that we're working over a value field. So for me, the Value field. So for me, the tropical variety is nothing more than a zeroth-order approximation of your classical algebraic variety. Right? So basically, I mean, let's say k would be like field of complex pursuit series, and a point on the tropical variety will basically tell you, okay, there exists a solution to your original polynomial whose pursue series begins at that order. So it's really like a zeroth order approximation. You don't even know the term, the coefficient in front of it. The coefficient in front of it, you only really know the power of your pursuit variable to it. And tropical geometry, in a way, so in a way, is the question on how much you can infer of your classical algebraic variety just from this zeroth order approximation, this very most crucial approximation you can get. Yeah. So I hope this makes a little bit of sense. Yes, yes, it does. Thank you. Will, if you'd like to just raise your question out loud, go ahead. Well, I also had different questions. So, you mentioned explicit computation of tropical varieties. Where do you do it? Oh, I'm doing it for polymake or? No, no, I'm doing it mainly in singular. So, because as I said here, so because in linear, well, in linear. Because in linear, well, in linear optimization, all you need is convex hull algorithms, so not a lot there is involved, but it involves some very, very complicated commutative algebra, which is why singular was the clear choice instead of polymage. But at which point do you use commutative algebra? I mean, it looks very like discrete geometrically what you have described. Yes, very good question. Thank you. So, for example, if you have a red, so if you want to, if you know the red point. If you, if you know the red point, or let's say, okay, let's say I want to, let's say, the first one, I want to compute this, construct a starting point. So, how do I construct a starting point on my tropical variety of I? Well, basically, all I need is to approximate a solution of my polynomial ideal, like a very, very easy solution. And this is also how we do it. So, we could just approximate a solution of my ideal. Then, the next question is: okay, if I have my red point, how does How does the cell around this red point look like? So, where does this end? Does it go on to infinity, or does it stop? And in order to solve this, you need to compute a Grubner basis. So, you need to compute a lot of Grupner bases, and you basically do a Grupner wall. So, yeah. So, you can also consider this drop I to be covered by a subfan of the so-called Grupner fan, if you want. Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Thank you. So, there's another question that was raised in the chats. Another question that was raised in the chats. What sort of valued differential fields come up in tropical differential geometry? Are the valuation and differential independent or related in some way? I don't want to wake people up. It's 1 a.m. here. Okay, good. I'll be very silent. Okay, so in the current works right now, what people are using is mainly this field that I've This field that I've written in the bottom. So, actually, most theorems are currently only stated for this field that I have here right now. So, I don't know whether these results actually generalize to arbitrary differential-valued fields, in particular ones, for example, which have a finite characteristic. So, where the coefficients are basically the algebraic closure. Efficients are basically the algebraic closure of a finite field. So, this I don't actually know. So, I don't know whether they generalize. I know that the results that are stated in these papers, well, in the ones that I looked at, they only consider this field specifically. So, I don't know whether finite characteristics would make any difference. And can you say a little something about why you use the supports map, which seems, I think, from the point of view of somebody who works in IAP? Works in unvalued fields, that seems to be a less natural map to take because it's well, it'll be much less tame than the valuation map. Why is it that you use supports as opposed to as valuations or some kind of prolongation space? So I can't answer this question fully. So I think I assume it's written in this nice preprint where he goes on the motivations, but I guess currently. But I guess currently, all I mean, I agree that valuation is also the more natural definition to use, even coming if you're looking back at classical tropical geometry. But I assume that they use support maps because it's like it's a map that works basically. And I assume that if you only look at valuation, something goes wrong because I agree that this would be the natural solution, a natural choice. Let's end with one last question here. So, Joris van der Hoven. Was asking whether this can be done using homotopy methods instead of Krugman basics. Okay, yes. Let me just read out the answer by Vincenzo. So he just said that he has looked at the paper and the action of the derivation shifts the support by one and you lose information if you only use the valuation. So this is the so you will this is the thing that goes wrong. Thank you, Vincent. Okay, and could this be done using home? And could this be done using homotopy continuation? You could use it. Okay, you could use it. Okay, so could this be done using homotopy continuation? I was talking about these polynomial system solving, and the problem with using homotopic continuation right now is that we are working over a field. So we're working over a valued field. And this means that the topology that we have is very, very bad for homotopy continuation. It's actually not possible. Continuation. It's actually not possible to do. So it's, yeah, it's so I forgot actually the term. It's locally disconnected the field. So and because of that, classical homotopy continuation methods don't work. You might be able to cook up something that, I don't know, goes through, instead of like working on the field, you like extend the field and you start homotopy on the Berkowitz anonymification, which has a nicer topology, but obviously. Has a nicer topology, but it's obviously much harder to work with. The classical answer is classical continuation algorithms don't work because the field is being disconnected. Okay, so this is, I mean, we certainly have more discussion to do, and I think that we'll take it into the coffee sessions. Gleb just posted the links to the coffee sessions, which will start soon. Before we go to those, let's thank the speaker one last time for. One last time for
