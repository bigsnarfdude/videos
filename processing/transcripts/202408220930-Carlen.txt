Morning session of today, second to last day. And it's a pleasure to, well, you don't need any introduction, so I'll give the stage to Erica that will present a recent work on boundary-driven quantum systems. So okay, thank you, Rodrigo. Okay, well, thank you very much. And at this point, I'd like to thank the real organizer who did all that. The real organizer who did all the whole work for putting this great event together. And it's a pleasure to be here once again. This is joint work with David Hughes and Joel Liebowitz. And I'm going to explain more about the ideas and how things fit together and what one would like to do. But there's, as Federico said, it's a very recent work. And so there's a pre-archive preprint. And you don't need to get the number. And you don't need to get the number. You can search under my name, it's most recent one, so you'll find it right at the top. Okay, this is joint work by David Hughes and Joel Leibowitz. Both of them are physicists, Joel at Rutgers University, Ryam, David Hughes at Princeton. And for those of you who don't know, Joel, he's 94 years old, and he's not retired from Rutgers. There's no mandatory retirement age in the US. Retirement age in the U.S. He made a very clever contract when he came in, so he never has to teach calculus, which helped to keep going to 92. Okay, and he's very active. So this came up looking, he's reading lots of papers and sends me all the time, look at this paper, it's very interesting. And so this grew out of discussions about a work, which I will just describe later on, okay, as we get to it. So the setting is this. I'm going to be talking about boundary-driven. Talking about boundary-driven systems. And here's a picture to get some idea. The Hilbert space that we're going to be studying the quantum Markov semi-group on is a tensor product of two parts. There's a part A, which is the boundary part, and there's a B, HB, which is the bulk part in the interior. And to just get the picture, this is two possible scenarios. So this would be a one-dimensional array of 10 spins or atoms. 10 spins or atoms, okay? And they're in two colors because at the left, the things in red are the boundary part that's going to be coupled to this system. There'd be two kinds of evolution, and there's coupling at the boundary. The boundary need not be exactly the boundary. So here would be something coupled in two parts. Okay, and this is the boundary set. I've drawn things in a line because it was simpler to fit everything onto the ticks diagram, but you, there's no the ticks diagram but you there's no dimensionality in this nothing one-dimensional you could have arbitrary arbitrary geometry there's a partition so there's two parts one part is the boundary to think about it and the other part is is the bulk and the interior okay so this is there's a problem about these kinds of systems you should think of each one of these dots as representing an atom and the atoms are interacting and the ones in red are connected to some sort of Red are connected to some sort of thermal reservoir or a heat bath, which is putting energy in or taking it out. Okay, in the top row, there's just one heat bath on the left, and in the bottom, there are on the left and the right. In the situation on the bottom, where these atoms are coupled to a heat bath, say at a high temperature, and this one at a low temperature, one would expect to have heat flowing through the system from this side to that side. To that side, okay? And this is a subject that's been investigated by various people in the room in the quantum setting. This is a paper by Franco Damiano and Emmanuel on models in this topic, which will come up here. But this is still a fairly wide open problem, classically and quantum mechanically. There are a large group of people I know who work on trying to derive Fourier's law. Fourier's law says that there should be a heat flow going from right to left in this picture, and that the temperature, there should be a small. And that the temperature, there should be a smooth linear profile to the temperature going across with the heat flowing steadily from left to right. And Fourier's law is supposed to be fairly universal. So this is something that shouldn't depend too much on the details of the system, like the heat bath. So therefore, one would expect physically that one should be able to model it. And there would be a lot of freedom in the model to come up with then a model that would display the Fourier's law. Fourier's law. Of course, it's a many-body system, so it's very hard to actually calculate anything explicitly. So, the model that was discussed by Franco Damiano and Emmanuela to calculate things explicitly, then the interaction is such that there was no heat flow. But this is typically the case. The problem of driving Fourier's law is wide open, and I'm not going to solve it here, but I'm going to talk about some related things. I mean, it's also very interesting. I mean, it's also a very interesting problem classically, not just quantum mechanically. Okay, so, right. So, there are going to be two parts of the dynamics. There's going to be a Hamiltonian flow, which would be the atoms interacting among themselves without any coupling to the heat bath. So, this is just classical Hamiltonian, nothing dissipative. Then there's another part which comes from the coupling to the system, okay? And when you couple to the system to just one heat bath, The system to just one heat bath. There are various ways one can model this. So, we're looking for a model in which we can investigate what goes on in this thing. And classically, what people typically, well, what they often do, typically, what something you can often do is connect the atom at the left, say, up to a driving longitudin equation. So some Ernstein-Ullenbeck process that shakes the atom with some particular variance, which is putting energy in or taking out of a system of vibrating springs. Of vibrating springs, and this should equilibrate the thing to a temperature. And this is what happens classically. So it's very easy to show. You can find the references in the paper online. It goes back to some old work of Leibowitz and Lieb, that you can, if you pick the driving Lagrangian equation, the steady state of the system is a Gibbs state. That means e to the minus beta times the Hamiltonian at the temperature which is specified by the heat path. Okay, and does this happen quantum mechanically? Okay, so this is something that's been looked at a lot in the physics literature. And the thing to do we'd like to investigate here is replacing this driving Langevin equation, that is a classical stochastic process, by a driving Lindblad equation. Okay, so we're going to put in Lindbladian noise and investigate what happens to this. Okay, so. Okay, so by the theorem which is well known to everyone here and it's been up, let me warn you there are going to be daggers and stars used somewhat interchangeably. I usually use the dagger on what physicists would call super operators for the Hilbert Schmidt inner product adjoint and stars for the usual adjoint. And the physicists like to use daggers everywhere. But okay, so there this is so the Lindblad operators are called L, and there's Called L, and there's a K in here. This is not the system Hamiltonian, this K. This is just the general form of a Lindbladian. So even if you hook up a system to some sort of reservoir in the work of Davies for driving things through the weak coupling limit, then the Lin-Bladian equation comes up with this form. It has some K in it, but this comes, this is an effect. This is an effect of the heat bath. In the physics literature, this is sometimes called the Lambschiff Hamiltonian. Okay, and it's important to emphasize at this level of generality, there is no firm distinction between what is the commutator part and what's this other part here. So there's this D here because the whole thing is a dissipator coming from the connection with the heat bath, right? One should not think of this K as the conservative part of this generator. Conservative part of this generator. Okay, and that's because, as everyone here will know, but is if you can take these L's and you can define some L tildes by adding and subtracting multiples of the identity, and then you'll get a new Lindblad representation with a different K. I mean, the K is just not so unique. So there are going to be two things in the problem that we're considering. There's going to be a dissipator and there's going to be a Hamiltonian. Okay? So the equation that we... So, the equation that we will look at has the following form. It's going to be a dissipator acting on the operators on the A Hilbert space, tensor product, the identity on the B. So then we have a generator of the previous form, but all of the Lindblad operators again have this product. There's some L hat alpha acting on the space H A tensor with the identity on B. And same way with this Lambship thing. Okay, so this is. Okay, so this is the this models the heat bath, which is acting on the parts in coming in on the A. And for the moment, I want to assume that this DA is ergodic. I'll come back and talk about the non-ergodic state a little later, but this is something we're choosing. Usually, when one drives the system, one is interested in heat baths that really mix things up and have ergodicity. So, I mean, physically, it with an ergodic thing. Having it with an areotic thing is the reasonable thing to do. We're going to be asking: is there any Limbladian you can put in that takes the system to thermal equilibrium? So you would want to put something ergodic in. Nonetheless, it's a mathematically interesting question. What happens if DA is not ergodic? And we can answer that too. But the problem to think of is we're trying to drive the system to equilibrium on the whole space by just putting noise in on one part. Just putting noise in on one part, and an ergodic noise would be the natural thing to try. Okay, good. So, anyway, so it's ergodic, so it's got this unique state, which is going to be the row A hat. So the A for acting on A and hat on it. Okay, now the system Hamiltonian can always be written in this way. Okay, you take the H, which is the whole thing, and we can assume that this interacting part, which acts on the whole spaces. Part which acts on the whole spaces has zero partial trace. So you would just take the H, right, and you would trace, you take the partial, subtract off the partial trace of A and the partial trace of B and call those things H A and H B and you can always do that. So this is not an assumption on the structure. It's just convenient in what's being done later to keep track of who is acting on what. Okay? And then the final equation we're studying is this one. So it's this evolution equation. This one. So it's this evolution equation, right? And so the system Hamiltonian is doing something conservative on the whole space. And then the D is this driving Lindbladian, which includes another Hamiltonian part, but that's an effect of the connection to the reservoir. Okay, so that's the general setup here. Okay, so we're not going to discuss the derivation of K and these jump operations. Of K and these jump operators. There are two approaches for generally for deriving from some physical model in a Markovian limit, right? These Markovian generators, the QMS semi-groups, describe some idealized limit coming from Hamiltonian interaction connected with the bath. There's the weak coupling limit, which was originally due to Davies. And if you derive things from the weak coupling limit, one gets a generator that has a special structure. Generator that has a special structure. They are self-adjoint with respect to the GNS inner product, okay, and have a number of other properties. The singular coupling limit studied by Garini and Kosakowski can yield almost anything. So that's the way these, so I won't describe what these things are, but they come up in various physical models. And we're going to ask questions about what can happen. How can we choose D to mix things up as much as possible? Up as much as possible. So we will not restrict to having it come from the weak coupling limit, which would impose extra conditions on the structure. We'll allow things coming from a singular coupling limit. And so there's no restriction on the structure of D for us. Then we're interested in the steady states, which will be these row bars. And we want to know what is the structure of these things, when are they unique? And how fast the general inter How fast does general inter data in this kind of setting relax to equilibrium? Okay, so this last section, the last question I'll say something about. It's not addressed in the part on the preprint, but it will come out in a preprint that's coming up soon. The first two you can find on the archive. Nonetheless, I'll say something about this because I think it's probably of interest here. It relates to some other talks. Okay, so the starting point of this, there was a paper by this. There was a paper by this group of four people. The second person here is Abhi Shakdar, who was a former student of Joel's, working, I think, in Bangalore. Anyway, he's a former student of Joel's and a postdoc. And they wrote this paper, which appeared in Visrev. And Jobal brought it to David's and my attention with a lot of questions. And so this is the origin of the paper. So what they were considering this type of model. So, what they were considering this type of model, and the question they asked was: Can we choose this DA, this Lynn Bladion that's acting on the boundary? No restriction, you pick anyone you like. Can you find anyone, any boundary that puts on the boundary, so that the steady, you get a unique steady state from the system, and that unique steady state is a Gibbs state at a temperature. I should have had a Gibbs state here. This is a Gibbs state with two parameters in it: there's a temperature and a chemical potential. Temperature and the chemical potential for this would be for dynamics that conserves particle number. So if you set the mu equal to zero, there's just a beta in it that's a Gibbs state. Okay, this is something you can easily do classically. You can take a classical system of springs, you connect up the momentum, because forces act on the momentum directly, you connect up the momentum to a driving Brownian motion, and it will relax to a Gibbs state. Okay? And what No, okay. Figured this out, maybe? Good. Okay, good. Okay. So, what these people did in the numerical investigation, again, these problems, these equations are tricky to solve. Okay. The ones you can solve, you have to generally be able to diagonalize the underlying system Hamiltonian. If you can completely diagonalize the system Hamiltonian, then you can get a close. Hamiltonian, then you can get a closed form expression for the generator and steady state. Okay, and this is what was done in the paper of Franco, Demiano, and Emmanuella. Unfortunately, the systems one can solve directly. The eigenstates of such systems tend to have a simple product structure or something. And because of this product structure, one doesn't see the heat flow and things don't equilibriate. Okay, so one, so a lot of the work that's done in the work that's done in the in this area is done by physicists who are doing doing things numerically okay on a computer and these people looked at certain models and they look at the parameters that were just available to them and they could not make things arrive at equilibrium okay so there seems to be some kind of obstacle in the quantum setting to doing what you can easily do in the classical setting you could not The classical setting, you cannot make the thing arrive at the Gibbs state. Okay, so now let's, I could flip back to the picture. So we're backing up here now from this problem of the heat flow from the Fourier's law a little bit, because before one should try to do Fourier's law for this, I mean, the thing in the bottom, there is already a press issue going up on the top. I mean, is this type of model in Is this type of model in which you drive things with a Linbladian on one side? Is that a good starting point for the physics that we're trying to study? So if you connect to just one reservoir and you do not go to the thermal equilibrium, then it's not clear what you should be doing with the two reservoirs and trying to get to the Fourier's law. So do we need to rethink what kind of model we're looking at at Looking at this thing sorted out yet. Okay, okay. Well, so here's the first theorem. So this is the setup described at the top. So we've got this kind of equation. And now we're going to assume, so let's look at rho commuting with H. Okay, now let me go back one page once more. So this is what the rho bar would be for the Gibbs state. And this is the Gibbs state also with an extra construction. Is the Gibbs state also with an extra conserved quantity for particle number? So, if you have other conserved quantities, the equilibrium need not just be a Gibbs state with a one parameter beta. It can have this extra parameter in it, but that's only if the Hamiltonian commutes with the n, which is, I'm thinking of a number operator example here. In any case, for this kind of row bar, since it's a function of h and something which commutes with h, right, this commutes with h. Okay, so we're going to relax a little bit. Okay, so we're going to relax a little bit. Instead of asking, can we converge to a Gibbs state or a generalized Gibbs state like this? We're going to just ask, can we converge to some steady state that commutes with H? That would include all Gibbs states and anything else. Okay? So that's where the assume that we have a A steady state that commutes with the Hamiltonian for this system under our conditions on the noise that we're pumping in. And then in this case, the steady state necessarily has a product structure. So the steady state is a product of the steady state on the A system for the driving stuff there and something else on the bulk. Okay? Okay, so right, okay, and if it doesn't commute with H, then it won't have this product structure. So the product structure is an if and only if. And if you assume further that rho bar is positive definite, there's no assumption on positive definiteness as for the rho bar here, then this further implies some separate commutivity. The rho hat A has to commute with the H of A. This rho B here commutes with the Hamiltonian on B, and the whole Hamiltonian commutes with H. And the whole Hamiltonian commutes with H A B. So what's the consequence of this for the question? I keep getting this backwards now. Okay. What's the consequence of this for the problem we are asking? So under the assumptions made in this theorem, okay, suppose that the Gibbs state is a steady state, okay, then this Gibbs state has to have a product structure. And the only way the Gibbs state has a product structure is if this A product structure is if this HAB term, which does the interaction, is zero. So the only way the Gibbs state is going to be a steady state for the system, no matter what noise you put in, is if there's no coupling, if the Hamiltonian doesn't couple the part of the system on which the heat path acts to the rest of the system. So this is the kind of no-go theorem. And in this case, there's never a unique steady state. Case, there's never a unique steady state. Okay, so if the Gibbs state is a steady state, then it's never unique. So this question is completely consistent with and gives an analytical proof of the issue that was raised by Abhi Shakdar and his colleagues. Bears out what they were observing numerically. Now, notice also that this D is just completely general. So in particular, Completely general. So, in particular, I can put an epsilon in front of the dissipator, a small coupling constant, if you like, that's describing the coupling to the bath. And we can let the epsilon go to zero. Another question that was asked in this paper. They observed that as epsilon goes to zero, then things were maybe looking a little bit more like the Gibbs state, but it wasn't quite getting there. Okay, but then you can't ever take anything all the way to zero and limit. Way to zero and limit. So you can wait a long time. You can couple your system very weakly to the heat path and then let time go off and infinity. Finally, you reach your steady state. And so, sort of the classical intuition is that this noise is jiggling things around, putting energy in and out, and then you would go to the Gibbs state. Okay? But this doesn't happen because this theorem that we looked at before, you get this product structure, and the product structure is independent of anything in D, including putting... Of anything in D, including putting a coupling constant in front of it. So you take the epsilon to zero, no matter how small the coupling is, the steady state that you eventually arrive at is always a product, which is just not what the Gibbs state looks like. So you can't ever converge to the Gibbs state, even as the noise is going to zero. So that analyzes, that does that. Okay? Okay. Okay. So Right. I didn't get any figure this out a bit. Okay. So, right. So, now let me say a little bit about uniqueness on this thing. So, the next theorem is we have a Lind-Bladian operator of this form. We're again assuming the ergodicity. So, the DA, the part acting on the boundary, is ergodic with a unique positive definite steady state. And then we suppose that we have a rho bar, which is a steady state that commutes with H. Okay? with H. Okay, so we're not assuming that rho bar is non-degenerate, just that it's a steady state which commutes with H. Okay, then rho bar is the unique steady state if and only if the only traceless self-adjoint operator acting on the B base here is the zero operator. Okay, so as long as the H does some sort of mixing here, right? So as long as the H doesn't It doesn't isolate things as long as there's no operator of this form that commutes with H. So anything in B gets mixed into the A part where it feels the dissipation, then this rho bar will be unique, okay? And the rho bar is positive definite. Okay, so let me just tell you a few words about this to put this in context, doing this again. Okay, we recall a theorem. Recall a theorem of Frigiero, which is familiar to probably most of the people here, if not everyone. We consider a Lingladian of this type, our standard form, and suppose it has at least one strictly positive steady state. Okay, so then there's a unique, if it has at least one positive steady state, then there's an if and only if condition for uniqueness. And the if and only if condition for the uniqueness is that if you take the von Neumann algebra generated by the von Neumann algebra generated by the k, the l's, and the l daggers, this should be a one I see, obviously, if that's just the complex multiples of the identity, so the only thing commuting with all those is the identity, then that's an if and only if for a unique steady state. But this is true if and only if you already have at least one steady state. Okay, this is something, I mean, usually physicists get things right, they don't prove things exactly, but the state. They don't prove things exactly, but the statements are correct. There are actually quite a number, a lot of errors in the literature about this. People apply the theorem saying that this is a condition for uniqueness without checking that one has a strictly positive steady state, which lead to errors. So in the theorem which I just proved, you don't need to do this. The point of the theorem is that this theorem somehow, if this is positive, This theorem, somehow, if this is positive, we have partial positive definiteness of this guy. And this is enough, if this algebraic condition holds, which is a simple form of the commutator and just involving the H, if this condition holds, then you get uniqueness and the rho bar is positive definite. Okay? So right. So the way this works, just to remind you, if we, this should be a D here. This should be a D here. If you take the Lin Vladien and take, we go to the Heisenberg picture from the Schrödinger, so I'll use an L for the generator there. That's the adjoint to the D. And there's just a simple identity. You can write this as the sum of squares. Now, if the D, this should be a D, if the D A is 0, then D of A star is also 0 because, sorry, if D, no, no, sorry, this is D L. If the L is 0, then the L star is 0 because these are her. Then the L star is zero because these are Hermitian operators. And so if you stick in something that if this is zero, then both of these terms are gone. And then this is just equal to that. And then if we take the trace against the steady state, this should be a D. If you take the trace against D of rho, you've got zero. And then all of these terms have to vanish. But if the rho is faithful, that means the L is a commutator. And then it's easy to check. You also have to commute with the K. Have to commute with decay. But if the positive definiteness is not there, then this is just simply not true. Then the eigenspace with eigenvalue 0 for L can have a multiplicity which is bigger than 1. And then there's no uniqueness. Okay? So I'm not going to go through the proof of the main theorem, but this is where it's interesting. So the theme of how all of these things. Theme of how all of these things work is: we're transferring positivity and uniqueness from the action on the boundary into the bulk. Okay, the proofs are simple, and one can find them there, but this is what is going on in this theorem. Okay, now you might even be wondering at this stage, are there even examples where the theorem is satisfied? I mean, can we write down an H which has the unique steady states and has a steady state which commutes with the rho? state which commutes with the rho and here's a simple model which comes up in a number of yeah this is a simple model that comes up in a number of physical applications that's a what's called a Gaussian model in discrete space so the A here we're working on a spin chain with C2 okay and so this is a lowering operator right annihilation operator and the raising operator is the a dagger of course and so this is Of course, and so this is a simple spin chain. It's sometimes called this would this H is a hopping Hamiltonian, it's like a Hubbard model, so you can think of these are sometimes called Jordan-Webner fermions or hardcore bosons, but it's a quadratic Hamiltonian. And this is the number operator. Okay, so if you look at this operator, this would tell the eigenfunctions of this are tensor products of the up and the down, and the eigen, so if you take. And the eigen, so if you take a tensor product of ups and downs and apply this operator to it, it tells you how many are up. Okay, and so that's something that commutes with H. It's easy to check with the commutation relations. The commutation relations are exactly the ones you would expect for annihilation and creation operators. So, this is probably, yeah. It's only the first part, but not the first and the last part. Sorry, H A capital H A capital. It's a J to J plus one. Oh, A H A is the first factor, right? Only the first factor. Right. It's the first factor. Just the first, right. So we're not investigating. So yeah, I should make this clear. So there's the before. Right. So, so before investigating the Fourier's law, so I have nothing more to say about Fourier's law here. So, the issue of proving Fourier's law in this context is a difficult one. I mean, you've investigated these models. We are actually backing up here. This is something Joel has thought about for a while. So, now the question is a simpler one. Can you connect up to a heat bath at one side only? So, at the first particle, can I connect? The first particle. Can I connect to a heat bath? Can I choose any driving Lindbladian so that what the system relaxes to is the Gibbs state or even a generalized Gibbs state? Now, that seems to be impossible. That's the point of these theorems. It was shown to be unlikely or unworkable through the natural couplings of this in numerical investigation, but this is an analytical proof of that. And so, if you don't go to the expected Gibbs state coupling, Expected Gibbs state coupling to one heat bath, then one probably needs to think a little bit more about going back what goes on when you couple the two ends physically. Okay, so let's see what we can get here. Okay, so I mean the no-go theorem says that you can't go to the Gibbs state, because you get this product state to do that. But you might wonder, can I ever get something with a unique state that commutes with the Hamiltonian, a generalized Gibbs state? Of the Hamiltonian, the generalized Gibbs state in this setting, and the answer is yes. And so, this simple example where we've got the hopping Hamiltonian, which conserves number, it describes a quantum system of things jumping to the left and the right, conserving the number, then that does it. So that this is what the this is what the let's define rho A to be this, which is something which ascribes energy one to the excited state and energy. To the excited state, and energy zero to the ground state. So, this would be a Gibbs state for one particle. Okay, and then we'll look at this very simple Hamiltonian for the example. Okay, this is a simple replacement. This is Joel Leibowitz's favorite example of Lindbladian. You can write it in the Lind-Bladian, but what we're doing is you take the row, you trace out, you trace out the A, right? So, that's this part. You take the partial trace. So, this is the part. So, this is the marginal on the B, the bulk we trace out A, and then you replace it with the equilibrium density, just tensor that on and subtract this off. It's a simple exercise because, you know, the partial trace, you can, this has a Lindblad representation. And so you can easily write this in Lindblad form. Okay, so exercise, you can find the exercise is done in an appendix to the paper, but you can write this guy in Lindbladian form. guy in in Lindbladian form. So this is a, it may not look like it as I've written it here, but this is a this does generate a completely positive quantum Markov semigroup. Okay, now define rho bar to be this guy. So take e to the minus beta as the number operator. So this is a simple product state, right? Because the number operator is the sum of these single particle number operators and this acting on that space, okay? So then. So then since H commutes with the number operator, H commutes with row bar. Let's go back and look at this city. Now I'm completely. Ah, we're getting close to the end here. Good. Okay. Good. Here we are. Right. So this is the H. So the H commutes with the N, which buttons I push. The H commutes with the N, so the H commutes with row bar. So this is something. H commutes with rho bar. So, this is something that this satisfies the theorem. And you see that since it's a simple product structure, okay, because the n is just the sum of things opting on single sites, then this is just a product. And so it does have the product. It's row A times row B. Row B happens to just be a bunch of other copies of row A, okay, tensored up, but then it does indeed have the product that's described here. That's described here. Then, if you look in the paper, one can check with the existence of the uniqueness condition. One doesn't need to, of course, check the existence for this particular very simple example. For this very simple example, you can see that the rho bar, since it's written as an exponential, is a faithful state. So, since we have, this is an example of why Fregiero's theorem is often useful in practice. We've got some rho bar. So you can, since it is faithful, So, you can, since it is faithful, it is the unique steady state. Okay, however, you can also check in this example this other criterion. You don't have to check all of the commutators to do that. You just need to do the H. And so you can find that there as this example. Now, the other thing that one can do in this example, because it's a simple quadratic Hamiltonian, the states of this type, there's a, I mean, this is probably familiar to everyone here, there's an analog of the There's an analog of the Gaussian channels in this discrete setting. So, there are this Markov semi-group preserves what you would call Gaussian states in the discrete setting, these things which have the exponential of a quadratic structure. And therefore, to understand how the time evolution goes, you just need to understand the time evolution of a covariance matrix, at least for the Gaussian state. So you can get a lot of information for this system out of solving things explicitly. out of solving things explicitly. Okay? However, one would like to have methods where one doesn't need to do that. So I'm going to use some of the final minutes to say a little bit about what happens. Right, okay, this is what we've talked about this already. So this commutes with the h and so you don't get a Gibbs state and you can let the epsilon go to zero and it's a no-go theorem. It's an example of a no-go theorem. Okay, now what I would like to use the final Now, what I would like to use the final minutes on is to say something about what's not in this present preprint, but which is coming up next. We would also like to understand how quickly one approaches equilibrium in these steady states. And let me start with an analogy. There's a close analogy with something involving classical Gaussian processes and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type equations and problems coming up in kinetic theory. So let's consider functions on the plane with variables. Functions on the plane with variables x and v, meaning position, velocity, or momentum, if you like. And let's look at this operator here. So the first part is a Ernstein-Luhlenbeck type thing, which has this steady state, this Gaussian steady state. You see, if you apply this to it, the first stuff in parentheses kills this steady state. And we're thinking of this, T means the unit torus or the circle. So this is the unit circle. Unit circle, okay, and R is the real line. So the X's live on the torus and the V's live in R. And then there's a density on this phase space, which is, okay, because we normalized that measure on the unit torus to be, it's got a three halves down here. The part of one over two pi comes from the normalization of the torus, and the other one half comes from the Gaussian. Okay, so this is the density on the so-called phase space. And now the way to Space. And now, the way to do this, there are several ways to Hilbert spaces in which to work, but one of the two themes that's most common in kinetic theory is to take the invariant measure to be one over the steady state. So see, if you take this as your invariant measure, then the L2 norm squared of rho is going to be rho squared, integral of rho squared divided by rho, which is integral of rho, which is one. Which is integral of rho, which is one. So, in this L2 space with this norm, the steady state is a unit vector. Okay, so there are other various schemes involving square roots that are sometimes useful, but for many purposes, this is the most useful, and we'll work in the analog of this. Okay, so now, if you take this operator here and look at what goes on on the diagonal, you see that you get minus this thing, the dv dv, and And so the as a function of v, it has to be a Gaussian if this is going to be zero, but there's no restriction on x, right? So this has a large null space. It has what are called local Maxwellians. At each point x, the distribution of v velocities has to be this Gaussian, but anything can be happening in the x. Okay? So there's no spectral gap for this thing. It has an infinite dimensional, infinite. has an infinite dimensional infinite dimensional null space. Okay, so what to do? So take a probability density f of v and let h be this thing we subtract off the density. So h is the difference from the steady state. And notice that in this product, the h automatically is orthogonal to rho, right? Because you divide this thing out, that this comes out, you take in and put out the rho. Okay? This should be an h. So suppose Okay, this should be an h. So, suppose h sub t is the solution to this equation, and then you integrate by part, you find out that this h, giving the difference, is has a negative derivative. It's going down. So this is negative, but you don't get any rate because it can be equal to zero when you're not at equilibrium. Okay, so this is something that Cedric Belani called hypocoercivity, and then one would like method. And then one would like methods to show that actually you do converge. Because you see, what's going on if you look in this A, let me go back. I have to do this right. If you look in this A, there's this term over here. So if you are at a local Maxwellian, okay, Pazian. So if you are at a local, something that depends on, if you have some X dependence, f of X, times this local Maxwellian, when you apply this operator to it, it's going to stick these into the spatial dependence. You'll no longer be. To the spatial dependence, you'll no longer be Maxwellian, and then the other dissipation kicks in. So, this push, so this part here pushes you off of the manifold of local Maxwellians, and the dissipation kicks back in. And so, you do eventually converge to equilibrium. The only steady state of this equation is the Gaussian, and you converge to it and exponentially fast. But how fast is that? Okay, yeah, how fast is that? So, there's a way to do this using type of Lyapunov. To do this using the type of Lyapunov functions. So let's introduce an energy E, which is of this type. So you take the H and you take a positive, strictly positive bounded operator M and introduce a new inner product. And if you compute how this quantity evolves in time, you get the A on both sides of the M. And so if you can choose an M so that this is satisfied, then this quantity will decay exponentially fast. decay exponentially fast. And then using the upper and lower bounds on M, you can get a rate on how quickly you converge to equilibrium. Now this goes, this is ancient stuff goes back to Lyapunov and our finite system here, finite dimensional system, we really have an ODE at our hands and there's a method of computing what the M should be if you can solve explicitly for what all the eigenvectors and eigenvalues are. Of course, this is not something you can do, but okay, in general, the M exists. Can do, but okay, in general, the M exists. We know the M is there. How do you find one? And so, this has been a huge industry in kinetic theory things. And there was an approach done by some colleagues of mine in Vienna, Anton Arnold and Franz Ackleitner. We've written a couple of papers, and if you're into it, you can find the details there. But what we would like to do is do an analog of this in our case. Okay, so what we're doing is we're, here's our equation, and I'm going to let. our equation and I'm going to let h be rho minus the steady state as before so that evolves like that because I just shifted it under our conditions sorry let me back up this is under our conditions right under our condition that the H convolves with the steady state this is true okay that's what we're looking at in these things I'm gonna use up my time clicking around okay use up my time clicking around. Okay, so what Hilbert space do we use? The Hilbert space that's natural to look at is this dual version of the KMS. Notice these are minus one half to minus one half. Why is minus one half? This is for dividing by rho. That's what we did in the classical kinetic theory case. This is what makes the steady state a unit vector in the in the Hilbert space. So this is sort of the natural, this is the natural space to look at. And if you look at the commutator, you just use simplicity of the You just use simplicity of the trace. Don't try to read through these things now, but if you do the simplicity of the trace, this turns out to be zero. So this is this guy here, this commutator with H, is Q adjoint with respect to this inner product. If you did the same thing for the dual GNS inner product, you put a minus one over here and put the rows all bar all together, this doesn't happen. Okay, so this is the right one. Ah, doing this again. Okay, and then you differentiate this thing. And then you differentiate this thing, and you get exactly the same business coming up here. So you've got the hypocoerciity. And so we have a differential equation, which is then hypocoercive. And how to get good rate information? Well, what we have to do is choose the M. And I'm not going to give you the recipe for the M, but what you need to do is do something which mixes in. You need to choose the M so that it picks up the commutation. It picks up the commutator with H. See, that's what's mixing, which is distributing everything across. This is what gave us the uniqueness in the uniqueness theorem. And now, in this theorem, we would like to choose the M. So we have some ways to do it. In the model, which I described, we can also solve things analytically so we can get a good comparison of our methods. Okay, so this is something which is being completed at this stage. But there is an M and we have a rest. There is an M, and we have a recipe for it. And using that, you get some kind of rate information and how good it is at this stage. We don't yet know, but this is the scheme. And there's a powerful analogy here. And I think this might be of interest to look at also in some of the, for the relaxation of Gaussian quantum Markov semi-groups, because actually the classical model we're starting from here in kinetic theory is a classical Gaussian process. So this type of approach might be useful. So, this type of approach might be useful in these other types of problems too. But let me end on time because I think this is exactly it. So, thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much. Very nice talk. Are there any questions or comments? Okay, thanks for the result. I just wanted to ask because I'm not aware of the theory. To ask because I'm not aware of the theory you presented, uh, when you choose the m, is there a unique choice of m? Uh, the constants of the rate does depend on the m you choose. I'm not aware of how things work here. Okay, so if you, so that this, you can write the whole equation we're looking at as an ODE, because we're in a finite dimensional Hilbert space. And then there's ancient theory that goes back. If you can completely diagonalize your operator. If you can diagonalize your operator, okay, it'll in general, because we're not talking about anything self-adjoint, so it's not guaranteed to be diagonalizable, but generically it is. If you can diagonalize it and have complete spectral information, then there's a recipe for the M. Okay? Now, in practice, this is not useful. I mean, it's useful in low-dimensional systems, but these things have exponentially large Hilbert spaces, as you know well. And so you can't use that. You can't use that, and hence there's work to do for how do you get these methods to work. Okay, so there's some simple Ansatzes that you can use. And Anton Arnold and Franz Ackleitner and I have developed one of them. Jean-Delbeau and Christian Schmeisser have some others. There are a whole bunch of things. In the kinetic theory example, all of these things are closely connected with conservation laws. So in the kinetic, like the Boltzmann equation, you conserve mass. like the Boltzmann equation you conserve mass energy momentum so this gives you some zeros in your dissipator and corresponds to what goes on in our in our model and you have to put in some sort of coupling that mixes the conserved modes in with dissipative modes and what you can do in all of these kinetic cases and what seems to work in this case too is you can just do some sort of simple off-diagonal coupling so you've seen the Gaussians here and you remember this V. Gaussians here, and you remember this v d by dx. So you go to Fourier space, this came up in several talks. When you multiply a Hermite polynomial by V, you get the thing above and the thing below. So there's a coupled system which splits into two pieces. And because of this mechanism, you can write everything in a tridiagonal basis. And in this tri-diagonal basis, you can, it's easy to cook up what the self-adjoint thing should be that fits along where the zeros are and mixes things up. And we can do long chains of Okay, and we can do long chains of zeros in these papers over here. And this is sort of an extreme case of that, where you have dissipation just at one end and then a whole long chain of zero modes. But you can write it in a tri-diagonal type basis, and then you mix things in. So there's a recipe which we're fine-tuning, but right. In theory, there's an optimal choice of the M, but it's not something you can write down or how to write down exactly. And many people have looked at various onsatzes for doing this. For doing this, but there's an idea, there's a picture of what's going on. I mean, you've got dissipation over here, you've got this conserved mode in, and you just need to mix something in so that you push the stuff over into where it's being dissipated. Okay, uh well, feel free to ask from uh uh home. I uh actually I have some possible comments. Uh Possible comments. There are papers by Trufishkin and Valovich which discuss a perturbative part of the local Linda equations, meaning they are trying to derive it from weak coupling limits. And the main result is that you can do it, but you can assume, you should. Assume you should assume that the interaction is really small, and this leads to erroneous calculations for heat flows and so on. It is because previous works by physicists like Ronikazlov, which have shown that local Lindlerians leads to erroneous leads to a violation of the second law. So I mean. So, I mean, well, I'm just commenting that there are some works, perturbative works, which also on this theme that the local Limbladians are pathological from the thermodynamic point of view due to several reasons. Right, yeah. Yeah, that's a good comment. Right. So, there's work in the physics literature, mathematical physics, one finds, I should have mentioned perturbative along with the numeric. Along with the numerical, right? But this is what one finds in the literature. Well, I think in the interest of time, maybe we postpone the or if it's a big question, we can definitely thank you very much. So, in the collective setting, you are given this operator or matrix A and you go for this M satisfying this inequality. In the quantum setting, This inequality. In the quantum setting, is it true that this is replaced by the super operator, and you find this m right? The m is a super operator, right? Right. So in this case, finding the eigenvector and eigenvector or diagonalization stuff become more complicated. Right. This is why it really. Right, because the thing that you have to diagonalize is the Limbladian. Right. And so that's a super operator. And so that you construct the ML. Okay. Thank you. Thank you again. Okay, thank you. Thank you again, Ms. We can move to the next one. Oh, I'll ask, yeah.
