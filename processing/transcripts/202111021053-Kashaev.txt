A restricted duals of algebra with opposite product. So this i and j without dots will denote for me the inclusion of those two. And then the algebraic structure is fixed by specifying the mixed commutation relations between two. Between two subalgebra. So as a vector space, it is so let me put here mainly the d of h as a vector space. Vector space is just h tensor h restricted du. And then we if we try to multiply from the left by element of each dual with element With element in H. Then, here is in the Soul Denotation result which expresses it as a linear combination of elements in the order corresponding to this identification. And so, and the important point here is that we don't work with the quantum double itself, but as for using this. For using this functor, we go to its restricted dual, which is not as explicit as the d of h, where we have explicit presentation like with relations. So this is implicitly the story of all finite dimensional representations of d of h as I told already, the meaning of the restricted during. But it is well defined for algebra, and so if on the level of dual. So, if on the level of D we would have a quasi-triangular structure with the formal universal R matrix, here we will have a dual quasi-triangular structure with dual universal R matrix, which is perfectly well defined by linear form on the restricted dual of D of H. And here is the definition of this bilinear form. So, what we have, we pick up two elements in here, which are linear forms. Here, which are linear forms on D of H. Then we have an inclusion here of H in D of H, which by functorial property induces a Hof algebra map like this. So we apply, so y is the element in here, so we apply this I0 to this Y. I0 to this y we get in here and we will include it with j in d of h. We will get an element in d of h and we apply a linear linear form x on this element and we get a scalar. Okay, so this is a and we have of course the young well the properties in the new picture in particular the young mass equation that he holds in the Holds in the convolution algebra of the triple tensor power of the sticky cube of KFH. And now if we pick up a linear basis in H with dual, which is not basis in general, which is just associated set of canonical linear forms. Then we have a formal universal armatrix. With two inclusions. But one can still work with this formal object, but its meaning is just a formal conjugate of the dual universal armatrix, which is well defined here in that sense. So we can just exchange somehow to arguments to think of this bracket as the evaluation of. Bretted as the evaluation of linear forms on something called capital R. Okay, so it is a useful calculational object, but its meaning always should be thought acute. Okay, now I'm able now to define the universal quantum invariance. So what we do is the following. So we pick up any finite So we pick up any finite dimensional right co-module over the restricted d of h. So, which means that we have a linear map from v to here, given by this extended Swidler notation. But here, V sub 0 will be element of V, while V sub 1 will be element in here. And then we will get a concrete rigid armatrix. defined like this. In principle, one can think of RV also pictorially like this. So these two lines correspond to vector space V. This is co-action, this is another co-action, and we evaluate this element in the vector space by the elements in the vector space by the bilinear form rho so this is a pictorial definition of the for for this formula okay and then the universal quantum invariance is something called the gh of r of k which is the element in here so so you see what there is some double operation on the on the quantum double so we pick up quantum double we take its restricted Quantum double, we take its restricted due and we take its algebraic due, and up to here we have a Hof algebra, but then we forget the co-product at this level. And no, no, we forget the algebra structure in here. We think of it as a co-algebra. And then the convolution algebra, the algebraic dual space of that, is an algebra with convolution product. So the universal inventory. So, the universal invariant is an element of that convolution algebra. And in a sense, so you can think of it, so this is a kind of taking into account only finite dimensional representations of this algebra and then putting them into an algebra again. So, this is why I think of it as a kind of profound completion of geophysics. And here is a definition of the universal. Is a definition of the unit Leiden. So, if you have a concrete aromatics, you define the linear map from V to V the way I explained previously. And then it always factorizes through coaction on the V, this coaction, and some linear form on the quantum group part, or the feature U part. And so the unit is invariant, so this rigorously defined as an element in C. But of course, if you have a finite dimensional algebra, this is double dual, canonically isomorphic to D of H. So it will be just an element of D of H, and even more it is in the center of D of H. But here, in the infinite neural case, we really need this double open. This double operations to make sense of moving value. And here is a description of my example, so B1, which is a commutative algebra of polynomials, which are Laurent polynomials in one indeterminate and the usual polynomials in another one, but with a co-algebra structure. And you can think of it as also as a regular algebra of regular functions. Of algebra of irregular functions on a triangular group like this. And as I mentioned already, so the AB commute, but if you impose, you keep the same coproducts, but AB Q commute, so AB equals QBA implies BQ. Okay, so this is the reason why I did not disb one. And we then just step by step realize the scheme of constructing the universal invariant. We pick up the restricted dual of B1 with opposite product. And here is the result of this construction. So it is composed of two Hof subalgebras. One is the group algebra of the affine group of AP triangular matrices. So it's MR. So it's an uncountable linear combination of uncountably many basis elements. So each group element is linearly independent of all others. So these are just this element indexed by a complex number, non-zero complex number, with this product. So this is the prototype matrix group. Matrix group. So, this is one Hoxha of in here, and another one is the universal invariant algebra of the Lie algebra of that group, which is a Lie group, simplest non-cummulative Lie group of the men two. But these two HOP subalgebras interact between themselves in the following way. So the group element commutes with one of the generators in the Lie. With one of the generators in the Lie algebra like this. And another Lie algebra element phi commutes with group elements like this. So they interact. And but as you remember, the restricted dual is a set of subset of linear forms on B1. And since elements of B1 are polynomials like this, so So is it psi in the first formula in the interaction formula? The first commuter is yeah, I think so. Yeah, thank you. Yeah. And the pairing, so a pairing with polynomial size is like this. And as I indicated by Indicated by since fibs are Lie algebra elements, so they obtain by certain derivatives around unit element of those polynomials. Okay, and then we construct the quantum bundle, which contains B1 and B1 restricted dual with opposite product, and then they interact between themselves. And here is the Interact between themselves, and here is the relations between them. And there are three important remarks. So, first of all, it's relatively easy to describe the center of this double. So, the center is generated by element A, so A is central. And certain elements C obtain with this. And the second remark that there is one relation of Heisenberg. The one relation of Heisenberg type because the A is central, so you can think of this as a scalar, and this is the usual commutative phi B minus B phi. So, and the fact that A is central implies that if we, but remember that to talk about the restricted dual of this, we should take into account only finite dimensional representations. And if we pick up a finite dimensional representation, Finite representation of this element and they impose the condition of irreducibility, then central element should be realized by scalar. And it is necessarily equal to one because we cannot afford here non-zero scalar. Because in the left-hand side, we have a commutative. And in fine-dimensional vector space, we can take traces without problem, and the trace of commodity is zero. Commodity is zero, and this thing has to be zero as well because it is a multiple of the identity. But if we don't insist on irreducibility, then A minus one should be nipotent. So we can have an important A minus one in the context of finite representation. So in this sense, so the interesting part of the representation theory of Theory of D1 is really non-semic because if we put simple representations, then this on the level of universal aromatics is trivial because so this thing should be thought as this double sum and then if a equal one we end up just by this part and these two commute because a equal to These two commute because A equals one. So there is nothing interesting from the viewpoint of parametrics, so the invariance will be necessarily trivial. But we want non-trivial invariance, so we cannot afford only a semi-simple part of the representation theory. So A should not be one, but necessarily A minus one should be Nipoten. But the index of Newport. But the index of importance can be, of course, arbitrary. And here is the main result. So the universal quantum invariant of a long naught associated to this Hoff algebra is a reciprocal of the Alexander polynomial, which is thought to be a formal power series in A minus one. So again, so I repeat that it is defined by evaluation on finite dimensional representations. dimensional representations. So in any finite dimensional representation, a minus one is Newport. So we just truncate the necessary part of this formula power series to get the evaluation of this universal invariant. But as an element in here, it is really this formal power series as a whole. And you see that this formal power series This form of power series can be thought as a completion of the polynomial algebra, but all these things come just automatically from our purely algebraic construction. Okay, so here is a few steps of the proof. So the first thing is that we can define Can define Alexander polynomial as a determinant coming from matrix in the Burau representation. So we take a Burau matrix in here, and then we throw away last column and the nth row. Then we take the determinant of what we obtain and normalize it by some power of Some power of t where this g is the rise of the brain group element given by the, yeah, formally it is the gender group homomorphism which sends arching generators to one, but effectively we count by one the positive crossings and by minus one the negative crossings. And we just correct the determinant by this and then the count once our And then the second part of the proof uses the coherent space and the Gaussian integration formula. So we have a Hilbert space of score integral of holomorphic functions with this Gaussian truncating exponential. So this is the scalar product. So, this is the scalar product it is here space. And then we have a short linear coherent state given by just the linear exponential cell of Z variable in here. And they have this reproducing property in the sense that the value of this holomorphic function at u is actually a scalar product of this vector corresponding. Corresponding vector in the Hilbert space with a Schrodinger-Holcoherent state. And then we have a subspace, reactor subspace generated by coherent states multiplied by polynomials. And the second ingredient is a Gaussian integration formula, which is analytical version of the MacBook. of the Markbahon Mark Mahon combinatorial formula in the theory of symmetric powers of the upper species. And then we consider representation of GP1 in the form of power series, but as I mentioned, in reality we are interested only in finite linear representations. And since A is represented And since A is represented as one plus H bar, so H bar should be an important matrix which commutes with everything else. But since we try to take into account any index of milipotency, so we just formally proceed by pretending that this is just formal power series. But in reality, everything should be truncated at some, for example, this sum should be truncated as an index of. Be truncated as an index of new potency of H bar. So really one should think of H bar as a concrete matrix of the Jordan form of certain size. But since it is central, so we can pretend that it is just a scalar. And then the evaluation of the R matrix in this gives us Burau representation matrix. matrix, but where enters this h bar and then we can just calculate the matrix integral kernels of the R matrices in this Schrodinger coherent states. So they are just some quadratic exponentials for those building blocks. Building blocks: we have just the kernel of the identity operator in this representation, and then we can calculate this one-crossing fragments which used to subsequently. So, you see that they become dependent on key. T is just this. So, if H bar is important, then bar is important then so t is a one plus something which a series in H bar which truncates so when one can think of T here in that sense so it is always a certain matrix which depends on the H bar and then the final calculation we we pick up a braid which is represented by some diagram and then we close it like this and there is This and the result is a lone naught. We have this rise, and then we just calculate and end up with using the Gaussian integral formula, we see that this determined the essential part of the Alexander polynomial due to the theorem of Kaufmann-Salor shows up in the denominator. Shows up in the denominator. But it is interesting for this is a Bora matrix. And for Borau matrix for any not, so one way we use this identity. And this is interesting identity, which I never was able to prove it explicitly by using matrix. But this quantum calculation can be used as a proof that this relation is satisfied. This relation is satisfied for any Boron metric representing a not. I mean, for links, this is not, this should not be necessarily true, but for the claim is that this is always true if data represents a note. Okay, and to finish, let me make a few concluding remarks. So, as I said already, B1. B1 is a special case of BQ, where A and B become Q commutative. And then we can distinguish between Q generic and Q root of unity. And what I have just described corresponds to the simplest root of unity case where Q equals one, which is kind of completely not semi-simple. Completely non-semi-simple invariant. And then, of course, by general construction, we do have a universal invariant for generic Q, which specifies to color Jones polynomials if we evaluate this Z on irreducible modules, which are indexed by diversion. By dimension. But apart from this, I can't say much about this universal invariant, but I would say that the Hibera completion is kind of approaching this universal invariant. And in principle, it is an interesting problem to understand from the discussion. From this perspective, which lives in the G of Bq, restricted dual and algebraic dual vector states. It's a well-defined energy. But of course, having understood the simplest root of unity q equal one, we can try to see what happens when q is a root of unity of different order. Unity of different order. Then in this case, one important remark is that B1 sits in Bq as a sub of algebra given by nth powers of the generating elements, because this relation at roots of unity implies that equal b to n a to n. And then by a q binomial formula, delta of b formula delta of b n will be a to n tensor b to n plus b to n tensor one right and but a is a group like anyway so it's n's powers group like so we have a we have a hope subalgebra b1 realized by those n powers and we we can one can describe the all the steps of a universal construction but Of a universal construction, but calculation of the universal invariant is a really complicated problem. And this is actually the work in progress with Shamil Shakirov. And what we expect from the Unislim variant in this case, that it is a ratio of Ado polynomial species corresponding to this choice of root of unity, depending on some. Depending on some central element in the algebra, divided by Alexandra polynomial evaluated at this central element. So remember that this a n will be central element. A is not central anymore in this case, but its nth power will be central. And this nth power enters the argument, which actually reproduces the case n equals one, right? n equals one, right? If n equals one, we a duo invariant is known to be trivial and we get back to reciprocal of the Alexander polynomial. And finally, so the reciprocal of Alexander polynomials first appear in the Melvin-Morton Rozhansky conjecture as a specific limit of the Carrot-John's polynomials where Q goes to infinity. goes to infinity and simultaneously the dimension of the representations goes to q2 goes to one and the dimension goes to to not this dimension the color in the color transform goes to infinity which corresponds to taking a limit of infinite dimensional representations but here i my message is that from b1 we take it obtain it without any limiting profit and we don't have q for And we don't have Q from the very beginning. So we just, it is not a limit, it is an evaluation Q equal. Okay, thank you for your attention. Thank the speaker. Are there any questions? Can you say a little bit where all this is written up? Is there other papers about this? Yes. us about this? Yeah, so I have archive preprint with the same title as my talk. And there is also in the first part of my talk is another archive paper. So both of them are available in the archive. You just look for my name and pick up the titles which relate to not invariant. To uh not impacts. And these are recent. Oscar. These are recent, yes. Sergei, you have a question? I actually have two questions. Is it okay? So one question is: you mentioned that it doesn't work for links, and I'm sure you've thought hard about it. So maybe you can share some thoughts on. No, no, actually, I didn't sort hard about it, but my point is that long knots are equivalent to usual knots. That's the only thing I'm using here. And it is some kind of, I never seen it in textbooks on node theory. So it's a faultlord result. And to be honest, I don't know what is a formal argument. But intuitively, it is evident property. Is a evident property, but I wonder if somebody can give some reference on the formal proof of that. But also, what I also know is that for links, this equivalence is not valid. And the reason is that you can, for links, you can open like a one-one-tangle different components of the link. And the result will be not the same, but of course, there are traces or modified traces. Or modified traces which allow to make sense or make humans of this kind. But here I don't use any traces and then so I just open up and I don't care of the rest. But the price I pay that I can handle only not this way. So you would expect that using modified traces we can get links as well. Yeah, but then with modified traces we With modified traces, we lose some universal nature, or algebraic nature of the environment. That's the price on that side you pay. So I don't know, but string links would be an answer. You open every component, but then it is not link invariant. It is something different which gives a link invariant on closing components. But probably the this is the right answer. You you should think of string link invariant. Should think of string link invariant. Okay, so it is not linking variant, but something, right? So you have a readymeister moves, all that, but the object you are working with is different, not any. Why do you say you lose the nature of the universal invariant if you use modified traces? Because they give scalars, right? Here, I need a linear map, and then I realize this linear map, I factorize it through universal collection. And with scalars, I'm not sure, but maybe this scalar should be thought as an evaluation of a linear form. Maybe. No, I don't say that it is impossible. Probably there is a way of getting. Anna, did you have something? So, I wanted to ask a question. Is it okay? Go ahead, yes. So, so you are saying here that the main advantage, so I'm trying to understand what is the advantage with respect to the standard Rosansky proof of the Merdwin-Morton conjecture. Yes, so the usual Mervyn-Morton conjecture is a statement about Is a statement about the asymptotic behavior of the colored trans polynomial. So you define colored transcendent of colored trans polynomial at each dimension, and then you take a limit when dimension goes to infinity. And simultaneously, you send Q to one, and then the so it's a theorem now proved by Garofo-Elias and Barnatan. The result is the epicypical of the Alexander Pulinon. The oracle of the Alexander polynomial where the indeterminate t is defined as a fixed value of q to n, right? n goes to infinity, q to goes to one, and this power is kept fixed. While here, I don't have anything like this. So from the very beginning, B1 is connotative algebra, cubicle one, just from the start. And then I just apply standard machinery, which I described. Machinery, which I described, restricted dual quantum double, which is kind of maximal quantum double, because you have to use the functorial property of the restricted dual to be able to define the bilinear form as a dual unit matrix. But you still have a limiting procedure. Yeah, you still have a limiting procedure because your H, which was a matrix, some important matrix, you are still considering this important slide. Because I define it through finite dimensions. Because I define it through finite-dimensional modules, right? So this is why I. It is in the end, of course, universal invariant finds itself in some completion. But this completion is algebraic complete. If you want, it is just given by just by this convolution algebra. You don't need to input anything from the beginning. Completion in power series in one minus so in one minus q. in one minute so in one minus q it's also an algebraic completion so so what is what is yeah yeah yeah so you uh so for example uh village uh describes so hydro has one kind of completion village has some other kind of completion completion right so you need to define a specific hop algebra with h the algebra element but all these things show up But all these things show up automatically in the restricted due, as you have seen in this example. So this is a restricted dual. You see, it contains the group algebra, which is not of use, actually. But what is more important in my mind, this universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra. algebra of the Lie algebra of the group. And this comes in by construction. I mean, you don't have any option to choose in the research. It is the canonical thing. It's a functor. So my point may be where you are repeating. So the input is a Hof algebra, that's it. The rest is the algorithmic. But of course, it is difficult to make. It is difficult maybe to accomplish certain steps of the calculation because we are dealing with some huge representation theory. But on the level of existence, everything is defined without any ambiguity whatsoever. Okay, Rinat, last question. So why do you think that Melbourne-Morton conjecture was proven by Bernard Tran and Garofalidis? So I think Rosanski was the first to prove this. Rushansky was the first to prove this conjecture. But I wasn't, no, Razansky, I'm not 100% sure, but my impression is that Razansky extended Melian Morton to a whole expansion in the powers of each bar. So there are sub-leading terms in this, but the leading term is Meldenmorta. Terms is made in mortal. Which was, but I don't know if the proof, if Razovsky had complete proof. This I'm not sure. But of course, he used some Gaussian integrals, but my impression is that he referred to some unproven facts, like I don't know. I think but maybe you're right. Maybe, maybe it's but Maybe, maybe it's but usually I learned from regarding the literature that the first proof through finite type invariant theory is attributed to Bernatan Garoufinis. But if you don't think so, then you can be right. I'm not pretending that what do I think is right. Well, I'm sorry, we're gonna have to, there's so many questions, but uh. There's so many questions, but uh, it's time to start the next talk. So, we do have a discussion session this afternoon, and maybe uh we can bring some of these things up during the discussion. So, thank you very much for a nice talk, Renat. I really appreciate it. Great work. So, I guess let's just take a three-minute break, just to take a few seconds, a few minutes. We'll start at 1135. Renat, if you're still there, can I ask you a quick question? Yes. Do you think that's a good question? Did you think about applications to topology, for example? Can we hope to make a clever choice of Hopped algebra to find some new concordance invariants or something like that? So what would be the best way to... Yeah, this is a very general question, right? So my claim that you can start from any hope, ah, fine, whatever. And so it's very difficult to predict what will be the outcome. And currently, Outcome. And currently, we are trying to understand just this BQ with different quotients in the beginning. So, for example, you can quotient BQ to a small quantum group which is finite dimension by killing the nth powers of B and equating n power of A to 1. Then you get Tuft algebra. And then so universally invariant will be just the central element in the quantum double of that, which is. Double of that, which is well defined, you don't need any completion. And already this thing could be interesting. And as far as I understand, Murakami and Nagatoma extract logarithmic invariants already from that. But how can we use that for classical topology? Like, I don't know, new invariants of concordance types or something that we haven't done before? No, no, but this is the same, you know, you are asking most difficult questions. Asking a most difficult question for quantum invariance. What the geometrical topological meaning is? Usually, there are no answers to those questions. Even Jones polynomial, we don't know what it is. So at special roots of unity, extremely special roots, we get our invariant and simple concordance invariant. So do you think that this will be the case here too? Or nobody. No, but of course, in my mind, so if you truncate now BQ to not to find the dimension
