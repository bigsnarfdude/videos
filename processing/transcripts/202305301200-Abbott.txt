Great. So, thank you very much. Thank you to the organizers for the invitation to speak. I'm really happy to be here. I'm loving it. Okay, so today, well, first, everything I say today is going to be joint work with Merlin and Sergio Medici. And I want to talk about boundaries today. So, I'm going to talk about a couple different types of boundaries of metric spaces. And the first one I want to talk about is the visual boundary. So, let's say I'm going to assume. I'm going to assume for the purposes of this talk that the spaces I talk about are geodesic metric spaces. There are definitions that don't require it to be a geodesic metric space, but they're more complicated. So I'm just going to kind of ignore that complication for today. So the visual boundary of a geodesic metric space. X is, okay, so as a set, we denote it boundary sub infinity of X. And as a set, it's the set of geodesic rays in X based at a fixed point. I'll call it some X naught. So we're going to look at the set of geodesic rates. So, we're going to look at the set of geodesic rays, and then we're going to look at it up to some equivalence. And the equivalence is that we consider two geodesic rays to be equivalent if they're at finite Hausdorff distance from each other. So gamma is equivalent to gamma prime if the Hausdorff distance from gamma to gamma prime is finite. Okay, so this is just a set. You can make this a topological space. So you put a visual topological. Topological space, so you put a visual topology on it. So, how would you define the possible? So, the Hausdorff distance is finite if gamma is contained in a finite neighborhood of gamma prime and vice versa. So, to apologize this, we can put the visual topology, which I'm not going to define precisely, but intuitively, what this visual topology is, is that the equivalence class of gamma. The equivalence class of gamma and the equivalence class of, say, alpha are close in the boundary. If geodesic representatives gamma and alpha stay uniformly close for a long time. So, I fix some uniform closeness ahead of time, and then how close they are in the boundary depends on how long the two rays fellow travel. So, if they fellow travel for a long time, then those points in the boundary are very close. So, just a couple of quick examples. We can look at, for example, the hyperbolic plane. I'll look at the Euclidean plane, and then I'll look at a finite valence tree. So if I look at the disk model of H2, I can fix some point. Here's X naught. Some point here's x naught, and then I'm going to look at geodesic rays starting at x naught. So here's one, here's another, here's some third, a third one. Each of those defines a point in the boundary. And for example, these first two ones that I drew are closer than the first and the third, because these two geodesics sort of stay close for longer than the first and the third one do. Okay, in R squared, I can draw the same picture. Maybe I'll take my base point. The same picture. Maybe I'll take my base point to be the origin here. And I can look at rays going out to infinity, geodesics. And, you know, again, I get points in the boundary for each of them, the boundary at infinity. These two rays sort of stay close for longer than rays going in the opposite direction. So these two points are closer in the boundary. In both of these cases, for H2 and R squared, you can maybe see from the picture that the boundary That the boundary of H2 is going to be homeomorphic to the boundary of R squared, and both of those are going to be homeomorphic to a circle. If you fix this point, then each direction that you choose out of this point, you're going to have an S1's worth of directions, and each of them is going to define a distinct point on the boundary. For a tree, I'm going to draw my favorite tree, which is the Cayley graph of F2, but it doesn't matter which tree you draw. If you fix a point, If you fix a point and you look at geodesic rays in the tree, well, I mean, I have one over here, there's maybe one there, there's one going off to infinity here. Those are all going to be points in the boundary. These two are going to be somewhat close because they share an edge at the beginning, so they fellow travel for sort of distance one. You know, this next one, if it fellow travels for distance two and then goes out to infinity, that's going to be a little bit closer. And what you're going to see here in the boundary of the tree. Here in the boundary of the tree is that you're going to get a canter set. And so the way to think about it is that if I'm at a vertex in the tree, in this tree, I have four directions of where I can choose to go. So I sort of make one choice. And now I have three choices of where to go. I can't go back because I'm a geodesic. I make a choice. Now I have three choices of where to go. I make a choice. And that gives me a canter set that matches with this topology. This topology. Okay, so when you have, if you're a geometric group theorist and you define something like this, a boundary associated to a metric space, you might want to know if that's a well-defined object in the sense of coarse geometry. So the question you can ask is if x and x prime are two quasi-isometric metric spaces, is it the case that the visual boundary of x has to boundary of x has to be homeomorphic to the visual boundary of x prime. So that would what would what that's what it could mean for a boundary to be well defined in geometric requirement, right? Okay, so there are some answers to this question. So Gromoff showed that if x is hyperbolic, so if it's a delta hyperbolic metric space, And the answer is yes. So, if we start with a hyperbolic metric space like H squared, and we take another space that's quasi-isometric to it, that other space is also hyperbolic, and the visual boundaries of those two spaces are going to be homeomorphic. On the other hand, so if you move from the world of negative curvature, so hyperbolic metric spaces, and you move to the world of non-positive curvature in the sense of cat zero metric spaces, then this no longer is not a very different method. Metric spaces, then this no longer holds. So, Kroke and Kleiner in 2000 show that, well, if X and X prime are quasi-isometric cat zero spaces, well, there exist examples of X and X prime that are quasi-isometric cat zero spaces whose visual boundaries are not homeomorphic. And he actually gives something a little bit stronger than that. They're not just arbitrary, his examples aren't just too. Arbitrary. His examples aren't just two arbitrary quasi-isymmetric cut zero spaces. They admit a geometric action of the same group. So there exists geometric actions of a group G on cat zero spaces X and X prime such. Such that the visual boundary of x is not homeomorphic to the visual boundary of x prime. Okay, so again, if you're a geometric group theorist, this is disappointing because what you'd really like to do is when you have a quasi-isometry invariant like this, you would like to associate it to a group that acts geometrically on this space, right? So, for example, if I have a hyperbolic group, I can take x to be the Cayley graph of that hyperbolic group, and I can take the visual boundary of that. And I can take the visual boundary of that Cayley graph and declare that to be the visual boundary of the group, right? And any other Cayley graph is going to be quasi-isometric to the one I, the first one that I chose. So this will be well defined. But that doesn't work for cat zero groups. So you can have geometric actions on two different cat zero spaces with non-homeomorphic visual boundaries. So you can't associate the visual boundary of a cat zero space on which a group acts geometrically to the group itself. Strictly to the group itself. Okay, so what's the problem? Well, there's sort of several problems, but one way to think about this is that maybe the visual boundary is just too big, right? Maybe I'm just looking at too, maybe the idea of looking at all geodesic rays is not the right one. And here's the intuition for that. So here's like a nice example of a cat zero space that is not hyperbolic. It's the tree of flats. So it's the Cayley graph, for example, of z squared, free product z. So I've got a copy of the Euclidean plane that's quasi-isometric to the Cayley graph of z squared. And at every integral point in z squared, every lattice point, there's going to be an edge of length one going up and an edge of length one going down. Now, at the end of each of those edges that I added, I'm going to add another copy of the Euclidean plane for the z squared. Euclidean plane for the z squared. And I'm going to add these poppies disjointly. And then I'm going to keep going. Each new plane that I've added, I'm going to add an edge going up and an edge going down at every lattice point. And I'm going to continue. I find this picture like the Cayley graph of F2. I just can't stop drawing it. Like I just want to make it bigger and bigger. But I will stop there. So you have this like tree-like pattern of flats and geodesics. Pattern of flats and geodesics in here. So, this is not a hyperbolic space because it has these big flats inside of it, right? And triangles are fat in this space. And there's sort of two types of geodesics that happen here. There's geodesics that stay completely in a flat, right? And these look like geodesics in Euclidean space. They look nothing like geodesics in hyperbolic space. And then there's also geodesics that stay only in the tree-like direction. So maybe they spend like bounded amount of time, uniformly bounded amount of time. Uniformly bounded amount of time in any flat. And these are essentially geodesics in a tree. So the idea, which was originally due to Charney and Sultan, is that what if we just look at the directions in the cat zero space that look like directions in hyperbolic space? So we define a subset of the visual boundary that just consists of geodesics, like so not all of them, but only the geodesics that look like they live in hyperbolic space. They live in hyperbolic space. So, what does it mean to look like you live in hyperbolic space? It means that that geodesic is Morse. So, a geodesic is Morse, a geodesic gamma, is Mars. If every quasi-geodesic with endpoints on Gamma. With endpoints on gamma stays in a uniform neighborhood of gamma. So the picture is that here's my geodesic gamma, and then I'm going to choose some quasi-geodesic that starts and ends on gamma. So this is my quasi-geodesic. And that quasi-geodesic is going to be continuous. And that quasi-geodesic is going to be contained in some uniform neighborhood of the geodesic I started with. So here's my M neighborhood, and that quasi-geodesic is completely contained in there. Now, I'm sweeping some constants under the rug here. The neighborhood, like what the uniform neighborhood is, depends on how quasi the geodesic is, right? So there are some constants associated to the quasi-geodesic, and the neighborhood, what this M that I've written. What this M that I've written here depends on the quasi-constants, but not on the choice of quasi-geodesic with those constants. So, like any mu C quasi-geodesic with endpoints on gamma is going to be contained in the M of mu, C neighborhood of gamma. So there's no dependency on gamma. No. That's right. No dependency on gamma, just on the quasi-constants. Constants. And so the key facts about these Morse geodesics is that in a hyperbolic space, all geodesics are uniformly Morse. Which means that this M can be taken to be the same for every geodesic in the space. So they're all Morse and they're all So they're all Morse, and they're all Morse with the same Morse gauge M. Okay. So when we define the visual boundary and we look at it for a hyperbolic space like Gromov did, we were actually only looking at Morse geodesic rays, uniformly Morse geodesic rays, just because every ray, every ray in a hyperbolic space is Morse. And it's actually true that this property completely characterizes hyperbolic space. Completely characterizes hyperbolic spaces. So, if you leave the world of a hyperbolic space, say to negatively curved spaces or any space that's not hyperbolic, all geodesics will not be uniformly Morse, right? So either there'll be a geodesic that's not Morse, or there'll be a sequence of geodesics where the Morse gauges have to increase. So in cat zero spaces, for example. Some are more slow, but typically not all. I'm going to say typically. And in this tree of flats example, the ones that are most are the ones that sort of stay in the tree direction. They're exactly the ones that spend a uniformly bounded amount of time in any of the flats. The flats are really what's giving you the non-hyperbolic behavior. So if you avoid the flats or coarsely avoid the flats, Avoid the flats or coarsely avoid the flats, then you look hyperbolic. Does that make sense? Feel free to interrupt me with questions. Okay, so instead of looking at the visual boundary of a cat zero space, or of any space really, you could consider looking at what's called the Morse boundary. So, the Morse boundary of a geodesic space X is, so this is going to be denoted boundary sub M of X, and it's going to be the set of Morse geodesic rays in X, based at X naught. So again, you fix the base point first, and then you look at it up to exactly the same equivalence. Okay, so you're just picking out the hyperbolic-like directions in your space. And this is a subset as a set, it's a subset of the visual boundary. Okay, so why did I say as a set? Well, it's because you can put lots Because you can put lots of topologies on the Morse boundary, right? One of them is the subspace topology. You could give it the vision of topology. That's actually not the topology that was originally used when this Morse boundary was defined. So the Morse boundary was defined. So the original one is it's defined by Charny and Sultan in the context of cat zero spaces, where they call Cat zero spaces, where they called it the contracting boundary, because in cat zero spaces, Morse and contracting are equivalent, they're exactly the same thing. And then it was generalized to geodesic metric spaces by Chinese student Cordes, where it actually matters that you're looking at Morse elements and not contracting elements, because in general, they're different. And the topology that they put on it is the direct limit topology. Okay, so this is not the topology I want to talk about today, so I'm not going to define it. But what I want to say is that with the direct limit topology, the Morse boundary is a QI invariant. So if you have quasi-isometric spaces X and X prime, their Morse boundaries with the direct limit topology are homeomorphic. So that's a nice property. A less nice property. Property. A less nice property is that it's not matrizable. So, this is in contrast to the visual boundary of a hyperbolic space, which has a metric on it. So, with the direct limit topology, this Morse boundary is not metrizable. There is another topology that's put on this, actually two additional topologies that you can put on this boundary. And those boundaries are also quasi-isometric invariants, and they're matrizable. Variants and they're matrizable. These are due to Cashin and McKay, but they're incredibly difficult to work with. So they have a very complicated definition, and it's hard to like, it's hard to get your hands dirty with those topologies. The direct limit topology is pretty easy to work with, actually, because you just need to show things like for, you have this direct limit of spaces. And if you show things hold at each finite step, then it holds in the direct limit. So this is an easy topology work to work with, but it's not metrizable. So, why did Charni Sultan and Cordes decide to work with the direct limit topology instead of the visual topology, the subspace topology? Which is sort of the natural one. Like, if you define a subspace like this, the natural topology you'd want to put on it is the visual topology, right? The subspace topology. Well, it is not. Yeah, so I could have like planted you in the audience. The reason that Charney and Sultan did not use the visual topology is that it's not. Use the visual topology is that it's not a quasi-isometry invariant for the Morse boundary here. And so this is due to Cashin. So Cashin showed in 2016 that there exist cat zero spaces, so quasi-isometric cat zero spaces. Quasi-isometric cat zero spaces such that the Morse boundary of X is not homeomorphic to the Morse boundary of X prime with the visual topology. Okay, so China and Sultan were defining the Morse Boundary at the same time as. Defining the Morse boundary at the same time as Cash and was coming up with this counterexample, which is why they use the direct limit topology. But this is okay, so it's not a QI invariant, but this is kind of like a weak no when you compare it to the strong no that Kroke and Kleiner gave for the visual boundary, the entire visual boundary, right? In Kroke-Kleiner examples, there was a single group that at geometric. There was a single group that acted geometrically on two ketzer spaces, right? And the boundaries were not homeomorphic. In Cashin's example, he just has two spaces. And in fact, these two spaces have trivial isometry group. So there cannot be a geometric group action of a single group on both spaces. So if you're interested as I am. Interested as I am in sorry, is there a question? Yeah. So if you're interested in understanding invariance of a group, then this isn't really a great counterexample, right? This doesn't show that if you have a group that acts geometrically on a cat zero space, that then at Space that then, like on two different cat zero spaces, then the Morse boundaries with the visual topologies are not homeomorphic, right? So, the question is: what happens if you require that there's a group action? So, you're really just focusing on the group? I have another question. Can you get it without the dependence of the base point? Yes, you can. Yeah, so it doesn't, it will not depend on the base point. Yeah, it's a good question. Okay, so the main result that I want to talk about. So, the main result that I want to talk about is with Merlin and Sertin Dicci from, I guess, last year, that says that if you require that there's a group action, then in a certain sense, it is a quasi-isometry invariant. So, if a group G acts geometrically, Acts geometrically on two, not just cat zero spaces, but two cat zero cube complexes with factor systems. Then the Morse boundary, it's all these cube complexes. Morse boundary, it's all these cube complexes x and x prime, then the Morse boundary of x is homeomorphic to the Morse boundary of x prime with respect to the visual topology. So this isn't for all cat zero spaces, but if you have cube complexes with vector systems, which I'll tell you what both of those things are, and you have a group acting geometrically on two different cat zero cube complexes, On two different cat zero cube complexes with factor systems, then they're going to have homeomorphic Morse boundaries with the visual topology, right? So, at least for certain classes of cat zero spaces, adding in the group examples gets rid of Cashin's kind of counteractions? Yeah, it will. It'll be an equivariant. Okay. So let me tell you what a cube complex is, and then I will, well, I will not tell you what a factor system is, but I'll give you some words about a factor system. So first, what's a cube complex? So a cube complex is a complex that is formed. By gluing cubes, so I'm thinking of like an end-pole product of the unit interval, gluing cubes together along faces. So, for example, I could take a square and I could glue to it an integral, and maybe to this I'll glue on a full three cube. glue on a full three cube maybe i can glue a square over here and i can keep going right so just gluing as many squares together as many cubes together as i want and a cube complex well i'm talking about cat zero cube complexes if you write down a cube complex there's a straightforward criterion to tell if the cube complex is cat zero or not you can check it there's a combinatorial condition that you can check just by looking at the lengths of the vertices Just by looking at the links of the vertices in the cube complex. If the links are flagged simplicial complexes, then it's cat zero. Another way to think about it is: if in the cube complex, if you see the outline of an n cube, then that n cube has to be filled in in order for it to be cat zero. How about this non-positively curved? Non-positively curved, and then you look at the universal cover, which is cat zero. You know, sweep that kind of detail under the rug. But this is locally cat zero. This one is, yeah. But if I removed if I removed if I removed button it would not be because here's a square that's not filled in right and the link it like this vertex for example would not be a flag simplicial complex okay so those are my cat zero cube complexes and then a factor system so this is a technical condition And it's usually ensured by a Co-Compact group action. And actually, until last year, so until 2022, it was conjectured that it's always ensured by a co-compact group action. So if you have a group action, Co-compact group action. So, if you have a group acting co-compactly on your cat0 cube complex, the conjecture was that that cube complex has a factor system. So, just in 2022, Sam Shepard showed that this is not always the case. So, there are now two examples of a group that acts co-compactly on a cat zero cube complex where the cube cat zero cube complex where the cube complex does not have a factor system. In one of the cases, you can change the cube complex. You can modify it so that it does have, so the group still acts co-compactly and there is a factor system. In the other case, it's not known if you can modify the factor system to modify the cube complex to ensure a factor system. So we have these sort of two counterexamples. Yep. To ensure yeah, there are To ensure, yeah, there are three. So, if any one three conditions are satisfied, then you will have a factor system. Um, and actually, what was really conjectured is that for every cube complex with a co-compact group action, one of those three conditions was satisfied. This is due to Sultan and Hagan, Ark Hagen, and Sultan. Salton showed that any of those three conditions, they're all fairly technical conditions, they're not so easy to describe. But just for an example of a Q complex that does not have a factor system and doesn't have a co-compact group action, but for something that doesn't have a factor system, you can look at like an infinite staircase. This just keeps going. Keeps going forever. So, this does not have a factor system. And the problem with this, so this doesn't really tell you exactly what a factor system is, but it sort of indicates the issues, is that, well, okay, so if you look at horizontal mid-cubes in all of these different rows and you start projecting them down onto each other, so if I project this second one down onto the first one, it's going to cover. One, it's going to cover like this whole area, right? Everything but one cube. And if I do the next one and project it down, it's going to cover this whole tail, and et cetera, as I continue going up. So if I go far enough out over here, there's going to be arbitrarily many other mid-cubes, these are hyperplanes, arbitrarily many other hyperplanes projecting to that one hyperplane. So that is, that violates having a factor system. This is sort of the prototypical. A factor system. This is sort of the prototypical counterexample. Now, of course, this doesn't have a co-compact group action, right? Wouldn't that also be true for just the infinite grid? Yes, it would be true for the infinite grid, except in the infinite grid, all of those different hyperplanes are considered equivalent because they're parallel, parallel forever. So they all cross the same set of other hyperplanes. Where here, this bottom one crosses this vertical hyperplane and this. One crosses this vertical hyperplane and the second one doesn't. So those are not considered parallel. So yeah, there's like, again, all kinds of technicalities that I'm sweeping under the rug with this, but that's a great question. Other questions? Yeah. Sorry, I maybe I missed something, but what does this have to do with quasi-isometric? So are the acts of the quasi-isometric? Yeah, if a group acts geometrically on two different spaces, then the spaces are quasi-isometric. Spaces are quasi-isometric. Yeah. And that's a Milner-Schwartz argument. Yeah. Good question. Other questions? Okay. So what I'd like to do is tell you a little bit about how we proved this theorem. So how we showed that if you act geometrically on two different cat-zero cube complexes with On two different cat-zero cube complexes with factor systems. They're Morse boundaries, they're homeomorphic with respect to the visual topology. And it's kind of a roundabout route that we took because this wasn't the theorem that we set out to prove. We actually were not interested in the visual topology on the Morse boundary. We were interested in Morse boundaries in general. And what we wanted to do was put a new topology on the Morse boundary of some metric space, some groups. The Morse boundary of groups is really what we were interested in. Really, what we were interested in. And we were inspired by the fact that if you have a group that is asylum hyperbolic, and it has a largest asylumrical action on a hyperbolic metric space, most of the time, it's fine if you don't know what that means. It's not going to be really important for the talk, but the key point is that in those types of actions, most of the time, or a lot of the time at least, the Morse boundary of the group injects into the visual boundary. Injects into the visual boundary of that hyperbolic space. So you can see all the Morceness in the group inside this one hyperbolic space on which the group acts. And so the idea is that, well, the boundary of that hyperbolic space has a visual boundary that's well-defined. So why don't we just pull that back to the Morse boundary of the group and see what happens? Maybe you can show that that's a well-defined topology. And you can show. And you can show that it's a well-defined topology, but it's actually the fact that this was the largest acylindrical action was the inspiration, but that actually plays no role in the argument. That's just sort of why we started thinking about this. So what's the setup? Okay, so the setup is that you want to start with a group that's acting geometrically on some metric space Y. So Y could be like the Cayley graph of the group, for example. Of the group, for example. And we also want to have another action of the group that is co-bounded on a hyperbolic space. Okay. And when you have this situation, when you have a geometric action on one metric space and a co-bounded action on another metric space, you get this equivariant Lipschitz map. So this Lipschitz map. So, this Lipschitz map exists. If you think of this as the Cayley graph of the group, this is just the orbit map that you're taking. And the orbit map is Lipschitz and equivariant. And so, we wanted this set up and we wanted that this map P extends to an injective map on the Morse boundary of Y to the visual boundary of X. So, P extends to To an injective map, which I'll call boundary P, from the Morse boundary of Y to the visual boundary of X. So nothing about topologies here, just as a set. Every point in the Morse boundary of Y defines a point in the visual boundary of X. And if you have distinct points in the Morse boundary of Y, you get distinct points in the visual boundary of X. Okay, so. Okay, so when you have this setup, what Merlin and I show is that when you pull back the topology, the visual topology from the boundary of X, you get something well defined. So we can define the pullback topology. Which is a topology that depends on G and Y and X and like that whole setup, really the map between them, right? And what I mean by pullback topology is I say that a sequence in the Morse boundary of Y converges if when I look at its image under boundary P, that converges in the visual topology on the hyperbolic space. And then this topology. This topology is well defined. So if you have GYX, which is just going to be my notation for that entire setup over there, and you have another triple G Y prime X prime, so also satisfying that setup, and Y is equivariantly Is equivariantly quasi-isometric to y prime, and x is equivariantly quasi-isometric to x prime. So these are both g equivariant. Then we get the same topology. So the topology of gyx is equivalent to the topology of g y prime x prime. Okay, so this is pretty technical. Like that, that's but so you get this sort of well-defined topology by pulling back the visual topology. So it's technical and it's also pretty abstract, right? So, what Merlin and I said was, okay, so we can define this topology. It doesn't depend on the choice of geometric action of the group, and it doesn't depend on the quasi-isometry class of the hyperbolic space as long as the Morse boundary injects into it. But what is this topology? Are there any cases where we can actually calculate it? And when do we have this? Calculate it and when do we have this, right? Like, I've sort of put these conditions that I put are exactly tailored to have a well-defined topology, but that only is useful if you can show that this is sometimes satisfied by some groups and spaces. So the Katzero Q complex with factor systems was the first example that we looked at because it is an example where we know that this setup is satisfied. So let's just. So if we have a cat zero cube complex, so I guess we have a group acting on a cat zero cube complex with a factor system. So here's the example you should keep in mind, and it's the tree of flats that we talked about earlier. So the tree of flats, it's a cat zero space, and it's also Cat zero space, and it's also a cube complex because each of these planes, the z-squared lattice, cubulates it, right? And then the edges themselves are cubes. And this cube complex does have a factor system. And it has a co-compact action of a group, the z-squared free product z. So this is my space Y. And my group G is the free product of Z squared with Z. Of z squared with z. So, what's the space x for which there's this holds? Well, what you can do is take this tree of flats and you can collapse every flat. So I'm going to say for technical reasons, every maximal flat to a point. So each one of these z squares, r squareds, is going to get collapsed to a point. And what you're going to have is an infinite valence tree. Veiling tree. So this is the space X, all right? So just crush every plane to a point. It's infinite valent because there's infinite, like countably, infinitely many edges going up and countably infinitely many edges going down. Like the question, so I think you might be different or like how do you see that you don't have this behavior going on that you said bad to have? On that instead of bad factor system? Right. So, I guess since I haven't told you what a factor system is, it's a little hard to see why this has one. But this kind of behavior doesn't happen because the hyperplanes come in three classes. You have like horizontal, essentially horizontal geodesics in Z squared, vertical geodesics in Z squared. And then there was this question earlier, right? Like all of those horizontal ones are considered to be the same. ones are considered to be the same. They're in the same parallelism class and similarly for the vertical ones. The only other hyperplanes are the midpoints of edges, right? And so you're not going to have this kind of, you just don't have this kind of stacking up behavior happening. Yeah. Yeah. I can tell you more about it afterwards if you'd like. That's sort of like the quick picture. Okay. So the key point here is what a result. What a result that I showed with Jason Berestock and Matt Durham is that this particular map P extends to a map that exactly satisfies this property. So if you just collapse the maximal flats, it extends to a boundary map from the Morse boundary of Y to the visual boundary of this infinite valent tree. And it's injective. Okay, so this involves quite a lot of technical work to show that this is injective, but intuitively what's going on is that the rays that spend a long time in one of these flats are not Morse, right? So when I collapse the flats, I haven't lost any of the Morse geodesic rays, right? I've only lost rays that spend long amounts. Lost rays that spent long amounts of time, infinitely much time, in these flats. So that's just like a rough intuition for why you should be able to see all the Morse rays over here. Okay, so this is a setup where we can do it. And then the question is, well, we have this well-defined topology by pulling back the visual boundary of this infinite valent tree. What is it? Right? Is it one of the familiar topologies that we have on the Morse boundary? And in this case, the answer is. Boundary. And in this case, the answer is yes. And this just uses previous work. So it uses two facts. So what is this topology in this case? So, first is Is work of Incerti Medici and Abdul Saloom. And what they do is they characterize the Morse boundary of a cat zero cube complex, which I'm just going to write CCC for cat0 cube complex via hyperplanes. Via hyperplanes. And this is with respect to the visual topology. So what they say is if you take two geodesic rays, two Morse geodesic rays in a cube complex, then those rays are close in the Morse boundary of the cube complex if they cross lots of the same hyperplanes. So it's a combinatorial characterization of the Morse boundary of a cube. Of the Morse boundary of a cat serial cube complex with the visual topology in terms of hyperplane. And then the second ingredient is that Genovois and separately, so combining Genovo with work of Petit Striano and Zuloum, they describe distances. In this hyperbolic space X associated to the cube complex, in terms of hyperplanes. And it's due to two people because Genevois defines a new space associated to a cat zero cube complex and describes the distances in that space in terms of hyperplanes in the cube complex. And then Petit Spriano and Zaloum prove that Then Petit Spriano and Zeloum prove that Genevois's space is equivariantly quasi-isymmetric to the space that Bairstock Durham and I construct. So everything, these two pieces together, describe this space and therefore its visual boundary in terms of hyperplanes and the Morse boundary of the original space with the visual topology in terms of hyperplanes. And so if you just translate everything into the world of hyperplanes into this language, you see that in fact, This language, you see that in fact, this topology is the visual topology. So, combining these facts, we see that this topology in this case is exactly the visual topology. Okay. So, this is nice. So, we have one example where this topology, actually, this sort of kind of strange technical topology that we define gets us right back to something that we're familiar with, which is actually the most straightforward. Which is actually the most straightforward and most natural topology to put on a Morse boundary, right? Like it's like the first one you would think of. So, what about other examples? Well, this capture is too complex with a factor system. It's a special case of a more general class of groups. So, another example where you can apply this construction of this pullback topology and understand it. Understand it. Another situation where we have these actions on spaces Y and X with these maps between them, P, is when G is a hierarchically hyperbolic group. So, this is abbreviated HHG, and this is a class of groups defined by Bersock, Hagen, and Sisto that. Bersock, Hagen, and Sisto that generalize the hierarchy structure of the mapping class group and also generalize the structure of catzero cube complexes. So it's a notion that's meant to axiomatize the hierarchy structure of mapping class groups and an analogous hierarchy structure in cat zero cube complexes. And then so you axiomatize it. And then it turns out that lots of groups have that same behavior. So you get this entire class. And cat-zero tube complexes. So the fact Cat-zero-cube complexes with a factor system are a particular case of hierarchically hyperbolic groups. And so, what Berstock, Durham, and I actually show is not if you have a cat zero cube complex with a factor system, then you have this setup. But if you have a hierarchically hyperbolic group, so the Cayley graph of a hierarchically hyperbolic group, then you have exactly this setup. So if you have G acting on the K. The Cayley graph of G, then there is a map. So this is my space Y. There is a map to a space X, which is hyperbolic. And this map is exactly that map. The map is lapsed all maximal. Okay, well, it's not quite maximal flaps, it's maximal product regions. Okay, so I put that in quotes because there's a huge amount of technicality that you need to describe to say precisely what we do. But the idea is exactly the same. The obstruction to hyperbolicity here is these flats. If you collapse them, you get something hyperbolic. In a hierarchically hyperbolic group, you have product regions with infinite factors, and those are the obstruction to hyperbolicity. If you collapse all the maximal ones, you get a hyperbolic space. ones, you get a hyperbolic space. And Fairstock Durham and I show that, so we construct this map, the particular hyperbolic space, this map, that it extends to the boundary, and that it's injected. So for any hierarchically hyperbolic group, you have this set up, and so you get this well-defined pullback topology. Pullback topology. And in fact, this space X, if you give me the hierarchically hyperbolic group, this hyperbolic space is unique up to equivariant quasi-isometry. So there's like a canonical hyperbolic space that you can put here. So if G is, for example, the mapping class group, then this space is the curve graph. If G is a right-angled Artin group, then this space is the contact. Then this space is the contact graph. If G is a right-angled Coxeter group, this space is not the contact graph, which is what you would expect it to be. It's a blow-up of the contact graph by certain stabilizers of hyperplanes. So you basically blow up the points corresponding to stabilizers of hyperplanes. If those are not products with infinite factors, you blow them up and you sort of keep doing that until all of the Until all of the vertex stabilizers in that blown up space split as infinite products. So it's a little bit complicated in that case, but it's a well-defined hyperbolic space that is unique up to equivariant quasi-isometry, and it satisfies this property. So we can have this well-defined topology on the Morse boundary of a hierarchically hyperbolic group. And so in that case, you can ask the same thing, like, okay, it's this weird pullback topology. What is it? And for H. What is it? And for HHGs, it turns out that this topology is what we call the coarse median topology. So this is actually not a topology that was really in the literature before, so we call it the coarse-median topology. It's a natural topology. Every hierarchically hyperbolic group has a coarse-median structure on it. That's part of. Structure on it. That's part of one of the things you get for being hierarchically hyperbolic. And you can, so this topology that we define that depends on this map and this space, you can actually define intrinsically on a hyperbolic, hierarchically hyperbolic group in terms just of the coarse median structure and not of these projections. So we, and so I'm not going to tell you exactly what this is just because I don't think it's worth the technicality. But the key point here. But the key point here is that this topology that involves a lot of technicality can be intrinsically defined for hierarchically hyperbolic groups. So these are the cases where we know for sure that this setup exists. So we get a pullback topology. And the real key point is you need to know that this Lipschitz map extends to an injective map of the Morse boundary. And that's not certainly not true whenever you have a map from the Cayley graph to a hyperbolic space. Cayley graph to a hyperbolic space, like you could kill Morse elements. So we know what happens in hierarchically hyperbolic groups. You could ask what happens in other groups. So for example, this construction that we have about cat zero cube complexes, what if you drop the condition that there's a cube complex? What if you want to try to do this just for cat zero spaces? So it turns out that Petit Spriano and Zuloum recently, just in the last like year and a half, two years, Half two years define the notion of a curtain in a cat zero space, which is an analog of a hyperplane in a cat zero cube complex. And they show that many of the properties and many things that you can prove about cat zero cube complexes using hyperplanes, you can prove for general cat zero spaces using curtains. There's like a sort of exact dictionary between the two. So one thing that might be true, and it's sort of like my next question, is if you have My next question is: If you have a cat zero space and its set of curtains has a factor system, so the same kind of like rule out this pathological behavior. What happens? Like, is this setup satisfied? You could try to do the exact same thing, collapse the maximal product regions in the cat zero space, try to get some understanding via curtains rather than hyperplanes of what these spaces are. There's sort of some hope that exactly. There's sort of some hope that exactly the same technology will work in this more general setting. So that's sort of one thing that's next. And then the other thing I want to mention is that everything I talked about today was about the Morse boundary. Everything works for this sublinearly Morse boundary, where you don't require that. So for Morse, quasi-geodesics with endpoints on that Morse geodesic have to stay in a uniform neighborhood. Sublinearly Morse, quasi-geodesics within the standards. Morse, quasi-geodesics with endpoints on the geodesic have to stay in a sublinear neighborhood, which is sort of a slightly more complicated definition. And for many applications, and so the sublinearly Morse boundary is bigger than the Morse boundary, and it actually seems like a more natural boundary to capture like the sort of hyperbolic directions. It's a little bit looser. It's a model for the Poisson boundary of the group, for example, which the more. Boundary of the group, for example, which the Morse boundary is not. So it's a bit more natural, but it's more complicated to define. But everything I said today works for that sublinearly Morse boundary as well, with kind of there are some like suitable modifications to make everything sublinear instead of uniform. Thank you. Um, for the mason folk, are there any questions? So, in the Kroe-Kleiner example, or the Morse bombs are in the Kroke-Kleiner example, are the Morse boundaries homeomorphic? I actually don't know, and I don't know if it is known. And that's kind of close to your theory. I think one of them is not quite, but almost yes, that's right. You just kind of change the angles, right? Right, you just kind of change the angles, right? Like you had the more the Krok-Kleiner example, you have a cube complex in one, and then you change the angles and keep it cat zero, so it's not no longer like a cube complex there. It's not really clear what happens to the Morse boundaries in that case. Yeah. And the other question is like, if it presumably, so the Kroot-Kleiner example takes three tori and glues them together along simple closed curves. Closed curves. And then you take the universal cover of that. And then you change the angle at which those simple closed curves are intersecting on the surface, which changes the angles in the cubes upstairs. So it sort of changes that structure. So it's actually kind of an interesting counterexample because it's a metric. Like it's a change in the metric that is actually changing the topology, which is kind of surprising. You might think that you'd still get homeomorphic. Surprising. You might think that you'd still get homeomorphic boundaries if you just change some angles downstairs. I don't know, it's a good question. Presumably, like since one of those cube complexes, the cube complex one has a factor system. If you defined the curtain model on the other one, presumably it would also have a factor system. But I don't know what happens to those Morse boundaries. Yeah. I think Ellie. I think Elliot Pioravati showed that regs don't have a unique post-median structure. Yeah. So how's that related to this? So yeah, it's an excellent question. So a hierarchically hyperbolic group comes with a hierarchy structure associated to it. And the group and that structure give you the coarse median structure, right? So the different coarse median structures on a rag are coming from like different structures here. Here. But this space is going to be the contact graph regardless. So the topology on the Morse boundary, even if you change the coarse median structure, is going to give you the same topology on the Morse boundary because of the uniqueness of this space. Yeah. And in general, it's also just for people who think about HHGs, it's an interesting question of like what. It's an interesting question of like what can you say about the structures in an HHG that give you the same course median structure versus structures that don't. HHGs actually also have their own boundary, not just the Morse boundary of the group, but the hierarchically hyperbolic boundary. And like there's some questions that you can ask about the course median structure coming from different structures and what it says about those boundaries as well. Yeah, that's a good question. We have another question. I have one. Do these different boundaries encode some properties of the groups? And if there is some property that is encoded by one boundary and not the other one? Right. So the like, I guess it depends on what kind of property you want. Algebraic properties. Algebraic properties. Algebraic properties. So, like, I mean, it includes, yes. In terms of exactly what, like, I don't, like, the thing is, like, the visual boundary can't, for a cat zero space, for example, a cat zero group, like it really can't completely encode algebraic information about the group because there. Information about the group because there's this Kroot-Kleiner example where a group acts geometrically on two different ones that have different boundaries, right? So, like, at least it can't completely encode like tons of algebraic information. So, I guess maybe the first one is the first thing about the point about these different boundaries is like, which one should you use that's most likely to be able to encode something algebraic? And that's having this well-definedness. So, like, well-defined up to homeomorphism when you change the Cayley graph of the group, for example. But, like, if you take But, like, if you take a yeah, maybe that's the best sort of answer that I can give. I'm sure there's like tons of them that I just don't, I'm not thinking of at the moment. Yeah. Are there any interesting measures the boundaries at zero space? So yes, there are. So you can look at like a, if you have a cat zero group, say with like a rank one element or something, you can look at. Rank one element, or something, you can look at the hitting measure on the Morse boundary or the visual boundary, I guess, but like typically the Morse boundary of the group. So that's like if you have, if you take a random walk on your group, you can get a measure based on like how likely it is you're going to hit that point in the boundary. So that's been a really useful, that's a nice measure on that boundary. That's the one that. That's the one that comes to mind because that's the one I'm most familiar with. There's probably others as well. Yeah. So, what about functoriality? Like, I'm used to a z square inside the group should give me something like a circle at infinity. Now, you're doing away with all the flats. Yeah. They are nasty. Yes. So, so what's a substitute for my beloved circles I didn't? For my beloved circuits that infinitely coming from flats, they just shouldn't be so beloved, I think, is the answer to that. Like, they're what cause problems. So, well, the thing is that those kinds of things just aren't going to be seen in the Morse boundary. They can be seen in other boundaries, for example. So, if you take a hierarchically hyperbolic group and you take its hierarchically hyperbolic boundary, then the maximal product regions show up as Product regions show up as simplices of simplices in the simplicial structure on the HHG boundary of the group. And there is even like this sort of rigidity type argument that you often use when you have flats and you like to see them in the boundary. Like if you have a quasi-isometry between spaces, you know, flats are going to go to within bounded distance of flats, for example. There is sort of an analogous statement for hierarchically hyperbolic groups that if you have a quasi-isometry, then flats are. Sometimes, then flats are maximal product regions are going to be mapped to within bounded neighborhood of a finite union of product regions. So, you get sort of some kind of nice analogous statements, and you can see that kind of structure in the hierarchically hyperbolic boundary. So, I think the point is that when you are, depending on what you're trying to do with your spaces, you might want to look at different boundaries. So, like the Morse boundary, it's going to do away. So, like the Morse boundary, it's going to do away with all the flats. So, all of those types of, you know, invariance things that you want to use flats for, the Morse boundary is just the wrong place to look. But there are other boundaries that are substitutes. So, here, the hierarchically hyperbolic boundary is a great substitute. More general point, if you have a good homomorphism from G to H, how does that shadow in the boundary? No idea. Yeah. I mean, I think you'd have to have. I mean, I think you'd have to have some kind of yeah, right. I think you'd have to put some kind of structure on the homomorphism to have to have hope of that, but I don't like, yeah, you would like to be able to say there's an embedding. Well, I mean, like, for the boundaries, you wouldn't want to be talking about quasi-isometric embeddings, right? Because like, they would just be an actual like top. Just be an actual like top one. So, if one group is quasi-isometrically embedded in the other, so then the visual boundary will be the visual boundary should be embedded in the visual boundary of the big one. So, there's some things you can say if you have quasi-convexity, but just for a general group homomorphism, it's less clear what yeah, some people might know. I don't know. Yeah. No, we don't for the mapping class group. So like we understand very well the boundary of the curve complex. And so that like so there, since we understand the boundary of this hyperbolic space well, maybe one way to say what, how do you understand the coarse median topology is you pull it back, right? And since this is something you understand, like you might be able to actually. Something you understand, like you might be able to actually see that in the mapping class group. But in general, it's not totally clear what the course median topology on the Morse boundary, the mapping class group should look like. Yeah. It's a good question. Like I think that the median structure on the mapping class group is concrete. So I think you probably can say something. I just don't know exactly how you would want to phrase it. Yeah. Is there a way to put the combinatorial structure of the catsero cube complex to the north boundary? Yeah, that's a good question. So for a catzero cube complex, if you want to see that combinatorial structure in a boundary, you can see it in the hierarchically hyperbolic boundary. Okay. So there is a close connection between the combinatorial structure. A close connection between the combinatorial structure there and the simplicial structure of the hierarchically hyperbolic boundary. For the Morse boundary, my instinct is no, because so much of the combinatorial structure of a cube complex happens inside flats, right? So I think you would lose a lot of combinatorial information when you pass from this to this. I think you might have a better chance of encoding the combinatorial structure in the visual boundary because then you see. The visual boundary because then you see you see the circles coming from the flats here, and I think that would be useful. Um, yeah, that's my first thought. But yeah, so again, for that type of question, there's other boundaries that you might want to use that see the whole group rather than just the hyperbolic parts. Okay, yeah. So are there no questions? Any other questions? No, you guys have no? Okay, so thank you very much again for our
