Good morning everyone. Thank you all for the organizers for this meeting. I am glad to be here and to have the opportunity to present my recent work on wave breaking in the near shore. And this is a work in collaboration with a big team. I would like to highlight in you the people that was in charge of the field work. Work. So these are the aims of this study. We want to have a better understanding of near-shore waves and breaking behavior using field data. And we want to validate a wave breaking criterion in shallow water by comparing theoretical prediction with field measurements. And finally, we want to develop a robust method. Want to develop a robust methodology to obtain accurate measurements near the wave crest using surface tracers. But before keep going with this presentation, I would like to advertise a PhD position in numerical wave modeling that has been challenging to fill so far. So this is a position accredited to the Department of Mathematics at the University of. Of Mathematics at the University of Berlin and is funded by the European Commission through the doctoral network, RESCORE, which brings together eight beneficiaries and nine associate partners across eight countries to train ten doctoral candidates. So I would appreciate if you can share this information with your academic network and if you find the people interested. To find the people interested in applying for this position, like Emeni, or Magnus, or Henrique Carrish. In fact, the supervisor is Magnus. So, well, we can come back to the presentation. And this is the outline of the presentation. I will start by talking about near-shore waves. And then I will introduce the Cloned-Higgins wave breaking criterion and the work that Work that we will move on to the theoretical part of the presentation, on the experimental part of the presentation, and I will talk about the field campaign and the experimental setup. Then I will present the strategy we follow to analyze the data that we collected from the field work. Then I will present the mayor's findings. Will present the major findings of this study and I will talk about like further research goals of this study. So let's start. So in this here we have a sequence of snapshots of a wave that is before it breaks. So I would like to pay your attention to the chart profile that That can be appreciated in the snapshot. This is in Cape Cove, Massachusetts, in a gentle sloping beach. So here, the same, we have a sequence of snapshots, and this is in France, in the region of Breton. This caption has been captured by Marc Bougley, one co-author of this. Man go out of this research page. So, as you may know, or you have appreciated, when waves undergo, when waves approach the shoreline, they experience some changes and waves become more phase coherent and quasi-to-dimensional. This is uh mainly by the interaction with the soaking sea floor and especially with uh uh Especially due to the two oceanic processes. One is the Scholaring process, and the other is the wave refraction. So the waves are affected by Scholen process by increasing in height and also the waves are affected by wave refraction by By a line parallel to the coastal line. So the combination of these two processes led us to the formation of this well-organized wave rest and aligned parallel to the coastal line. So the topography. Into the topography of the beach, you can find different kinds of wave ratings. One in a sloping beach, in particular, in the beach that the experiment has been conducted, we register spilling and plunging types of wave breaking. So with this information in your friends, now we will move to the long achieve wave breaking criterion. And this is the criterion that has been tested. That has been tested in this work and has been introduced by Longethiens in 1963, and is based on the Lagrangian acceleration of tracer particles near the wave presence. And so falls into the dynamic breaking equilateral category. And it was motivated from a close analysis of the limiting wave profile of stock waves launched by Stokes in 1847. So, as observed by So as observed by Stokes, the flow near the crease of a thick wave is similar to the flow in a corner and we can use potential theory, a complex potential theory to describe the velocity field. And in polar coordinates, this led us to this expression of the hydrodynamic potential. So in fact, stop show that the highest Highest, I'm not going to the details here because you have mentioned all of these results, but that the highest regular periodic wave in deep water has a sharp edge, and this edge must form an angle of 120 degrees. So combining the potential, complex potential theory, and in this framework of water wells, we can express the hydrodynamic potential by assuming. Potential by assuming that the free surface corresponds to this corner shape. And then we apply the, we should satisfy the water wave equation in order to obtain the values for NC, the parameters NC and theta. So from the Bernoulli equation in this framework, we obtain this last equation at the bottom. Last equation at the bottom, and in order to this equation to hold true for R small, n should be three halves. And using the kinematic condition and assuming the first address is this corner profile, the polar derivative with respect to the angle should be zero. And well, using the information that the angle of this corner. Of this corner wave is 120, we have the value of theta. So, in summary, we have a hydrodynamic potential, have this form, this expression, with these parameters already stated. So, then we it's just this this potential describes the flow. This potential describes the flow under the corner. And what we are interested in in how is the downward acceleration below the wave crest. So we should just apply substitute in the radial acceleration in polar coordinates evaluating in evaluating in the minus p half angle and we get this acceleration in this direction. And evaluating this and after doing the computation we get that the downward acceleration is minus g over 2. So this is the threshold that Longett-Higgins criterion, Longgett-Higgins used to establish the criterion. used to establish the criterion to determine when a wave will break or not. So we want to test this criterion in shallow water, because of course this has been derived or motivated in the deep for periodic ways in a specific and very special framework in deep waters. So we went to the island of Siege in Germany. Island of Siege in Germany and it's a sloping beach, a general sloping beach. And this is a capture of the beach from a drone and you can appreciate the income weather here, aligned parallel to the coastal line. Coastal line, and this is the experimental setting. And we have moulded a camera, a stereo system with two cameras, a sub-camera and north camera. And these cameras were overlooking incoming to the shore. And the field of view of the cameras overlooked. Of the cameras overlap this region, and these numbers determine the location of poles that have been located in a vertical array from the source to the portion. And well, the farthest point has. The farthest pole has been located at 80 meters far away and the closest one was located 20 meters far away from the shore under low tide conditions. So this is another perspective. And in this region, where deploy the surface tracer And basically, the data obtained for this study were pairs of images from the stereo camera system. And well, this is a video um created with the crop images in order to get a low low size video. Low files video. And well, here you can appreciate the oranges. Well, I already say the surface tracers. So the surface tracers were oranges because they are 95% buoyant. And well, next I'm Next, I will talk about the strategy that we follow to reconstruct the trajectories of the surface tracers from the row route data. So, first we need to obtain the external and the extrinsic and intrinsic parameters of the cameras in order to reconstruct the matrix. In order to reconstruct the matrix, that led us to obtain from the pixel coordinates of the surface tracers, the world point. So, for that, we use a software in MATLAB and we try very different sets of images until we get a very good one that could guarantee that we recover the Recover the real distance on the field, and we could with a very good accuracy. So once we obtain the trajectory reconstructed from the stereo camera system, that trajectory is in the stereo camera. In the stereo camera coordinate system. So, doesn't give you a flavor of what is going on in this trajectory because it doesn't have the physics of these payments, so where they come from and where they're going, etc. So we need to transform the trajectories to an appropriate coordinate system and locate this new coordinate system for considering the origin at the bottom of both. Origin at the bottom of pole two. From this beam, we get like trajectories that we can associate to waves. So we analyze tons of trajectories from different moments of the footage and in this presentation I will show you the case for one non-breaking case and Non-breaking, breaking case and one breaking case. So first, I will, this in the left, you have one trajectory, and from the image, you cannot distinguish if it's breaking or not breaking. But then, just from this information, we will obtain validated criterion following the diet. So, but these plots give you very good. These plots give you very good insight about the shapes and the features of the trajectories of the particles following the waves in the near shore. So in particular, we see that the larger variation in the trajectory occurs in the direction of the propagation of incoming waves, and the variation in the transfer direction is relatively small. So this guarantees that the waves are quality to the. This guarantees that the waves are quasi-two-dimensional and the amplitudes of the waves are regular and arising at the wave approach shown. So using this coordinate system, it's easy to recover the surface elevation of this quasi-two-dimensional wave. And this is for the one trajectory, and this is for the other. And this is for the other. So, according now, on this surface variation, we want to find the curve that best fits this curve in order to be able to compute the second derivative and obtain the Lagrangian acceleration and look at the value near the wave rest. But because it's there, where we're gonna get the information to distinguish if the wave. Information to distinguish if the gray is gonna break or not. So, well, if you track the oranges for a long period of time, you start distinguish this single phase coherent shape and well. But we after doing a lot of analysis After doing a lot of analysis on the different surface elevation cores, we arrived to the conclusion that the best fitting function was the polynomial and of order 10 or 11 was an appropriate order to describe the surface elevation of almost all the trajectories that we have during the field campaign. With less than below this. Below this number, you don't get an accurate description of the wave press, and above these numbers, you get an overfitting and you start adding artificial features to the wave crest. So, well, once you get the polynomial for each trajectory, you compute easily the second derivative to and you do that, huh? Do that, huh? And finally, you can look, like I was saying, before, near the white press to see if the second derivative has reached the threshold or not. When the threshold has not been reached, we say that it's not a non-breaking wave according to the theoretical prediction, and when it reaches the threshold, When it reaches the threshold, we say that the wave is breaking. But in order to validate this theoretical prediction, we compare the trajectory with the photas to be sure that the wave is breaking exactly at the moment when this is happening or like instants later. Well, the major findings of this was. The major findings of this study is that this criterion and the method demonstrate excellent accuracy correctly, occupying 98% of the non-breaking and breaking weak cases. And this is better than other approaches where the accuracy is like more poor. But the drawback of this approach is that the data set Was the data set we use relatively small, and this is because we are tracking wave by wave surface tracers, and we are not getting too many trajectories as we would like. Well, the further research goals would be to use now the information from the pressor sensors and Or sensors and recover the surface elevation from his series, but with the challenge that this surface elevation, in most of the case, doesn't have a good description of the wave press. It fits very good what happened in the wave profile in the tops and far away from the wave press, but they are not very... But they are not very all the methods that have been developed are not very good in describing the vapors. So this will be a challenge and the direction of this research in case we are interested in this. So I think this is everything. Thank you for your attention. I'm a bit confused about Lagrangian acceleration. You mean acceleration expressed as a function of Lagrangian coordinates? Yes, because we are tracking the traces. You are tracking origins, right? Yes, these are the stories. One question. Um it's one question. If you want to test the criterion, um is it more uh reasonable to test the criterion using your laboratory experiments, which you can control and so on? Why do you choose your field experiments to test your criteria? Well, we have this ground assumption that in the laboratory we have full control of everything and at the end my experience with laboratory experiments, especially with Laboratory experiments, especially with seaweed conditions, is awful. It has been very difficult to really say that you are in the CST conditions, that there are many things going on in the weight tanks and that are affecting the welds a lot. But this is my core vision of this core experience. How important is the How important is the uh uh the like shape of the floor? Like the so you how what? How important is it? So you talked about um that you need like a slight slope. Yes. But um presumably it might vary quite a lot on the slope. I'm not totally aware uh of the state of the art of these uh different categories of weight breaking, but uh But if you don't have, there is a threshold of the steep of the sloping beach in order to get more easily sloping or plunging or not at all this kind of way breaking. So for example, if you, well, it was here, no, but imagine. Those are, I don't know if there are better studies of this kind of categorization. So these are like Categorization. So these are like drawings of what they imagine will happen or that or probably they come or this information or these categories come also from field data. So for example, if you go to a couple of slides along, forward, forward in your data analysis stage two of your data analysis section, you had a plot where you You get a plot where you drew the solar yeah. So you have like a um a floor surface here where it's really bumpy. Right, so it's not like it's not like a monotone includes. No, but you see the shoreline is here. Okay, so um well and also this is some eschewatics. So, but the shoreline is here, and under high tide conditions, we have this distance. It's like can be five or kilometers. It's five sloping bits. Looks like not the sloping bit, just a infinite sloping bit. No, I don't think this talk was this way for this. I agree, I agree. So, but this number, the figure, 98%, I don't recall. So, what exactly could you also do? It's you know, the equation, the governing equation of inertia or not inertia particles are different. So, you can say that if you are working not with fluid particles and you are working with an orange, this will be in the framework of an inertial. Will be in the framework of an inertial particle. But in the CST conditions, the orange is in the framework of free particles because it's mostly covered and 90% of the orange is like covered. The main result. So that was 95 was with a picture. But you had 98% accuracy. So what exactly is 98%? Ah, you count the number of wave breakers. Count the number of wave breaking cases? You have after recovery of this surface elevation to identify the wave breaks. For example, here we have one, two, three, four, four, five, six, seven. Seven wave breaks. And you can say, okay, is this wave breaking or not? Is this wave breaking or not? So you measure the second derivative at each wave pressure. Can you compare them with the visual uh exactly if you say this is a great way according to the method, then you need to validate this prediction with the footage. No, but people follow the standard uh high quality standards. But for example, here you see you follow this, you follow this orange and you see this way on a break. You think you follow, you follow, what I hope. You see, it's breaking now. And aha, see? Yeah. Okay. Just one thing. The oranges, are they moving straight forward or? Moving straightforward or transversally as well? No, this is why we present these plots that tell just exactly what is the trajectory that the orange are following. Here, this is the direction of the x in the x-axis to the curve, of the propagation of the wave. This is the direction in the propagation of the The direction in the propagation of the waves, and the transversal, this one, is the versatile direction of the propagation of the waves. So, the main variation, of course, in the direction of the propagation, because you are in the neutral way set up.
