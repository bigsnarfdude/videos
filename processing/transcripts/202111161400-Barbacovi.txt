To this great place, and it's a pleasure to be here. So, the topic of the talk is a joint work with you, Meon Kim. And what I'm going to talk about is categorical dynamics. So, let me start by introducing the main player of this story, and I'll do so by recalling what's a dynamical system. So in the standard notion of a dynamical system is a couple x f where x is a topological space and f is a map from x to x which is continuous. And then the question you want to answer when you have a dynamical system is what is What is its complexity? Now, clearly, first of all, you should define what's the complex how do you define complexity, but this is the question you want to answer. And the way to do this is we introduce a measure for this complexity, so we measure the complexity by a a number. By a number, which I denote H top of F, and this is called the topological entropy of F. Now, starting from this story, Dimitro, Haydn, Katsarkov and Koncievich gave a categorification story. What they do is they say, Okay, so how we define a categorical dynamical system? Well, Dynamical system, well, we take, instead of a couple of topological space and a function, we take d phi, where d is actually a weird category and we work over some field K. And we assume that it has a split generator. I will define what this means in a moment. Moment, and then I take phi to be an excellent functor of d. So this is an endo functor. Now that you have a categorical dynamical system, the first thing we want to do is we want to define the notion of complexity. And to do so, we use the split generator. So what does it mean to be a split generator? Well, G in D is a split generator if If for every object F in D, you can find some F prime in D and a sequence of objects M map E0 E1 up to En which is F plus F prime such that the cones of these maps okay let me call it this T B are sheaves of G this G and This GM1 and then this is going to be G shifted by MP. And let me denote such a decomposition with this time. And the key point here is that we're going to use such decompositions to define the notion of complexity. So what we do is we take an object F in our category D. So this is the definition. We take F We take F in D and we define the complexity of F with respect to our fixed general gene as the following. Don't you need to say something about E 0? Sorry? Don't you need to say something about E 0? E 0 or 0. Oh, E 0 is 0, sorry. Yeah, E 0 is 0. Okay, sorry. No worries. So the complexity is going to be a function. So delta t of g f, we set it to be zero if f is zero. Otherwise, we set it to be the infimum of the sum for i that goes from one to p of p and i t, where this infimum is taken over sequences as in sequence. As in star. So we use all the possible decompositions of f with respect to g to measure the complexity. And once we add this, notice that this is a function. So delta t of gf is a function from the integral number to zero infinity. Once we have the notion of complexity, we can now define the notion of entropy. And this is going to be a function related to phi. So the definition Too far. So the definition, which is actually a definition/slash theorem due to DHKK, is that we define the entropy of phi is the sum of i is 1 to p, e to the n? E to the n n i t, it's an exponential, yeah. t is the real number. This is a function of t. So I define the entropy as a function h t of phi. So this is going to be a function from the real numbers to minus infinity, infinity. And h t of phi is defined as the limit over n of 1 over n the logarithm of delta t g. of delta t g phi n phi applied n times to g. So what is the meaning of this expression? Well what we're doing is we're taking g, we apply phi n times, and then we ask ourselves how much more complex is this new object with respect to the generator we started with? This is the complexity, then we take the logarithm and we divide by n and we go to infinity. So this is a measure of the average exponential growth of this complexity. Of this complexity. Okay? And this is a function. However, unfortunately, at this point, this function is very badly behaved. So let me give you some examples to explain what I mean. So the first example is that if you take the entropy as zero of the identity, then it is always going to be zero. then it is always going to be zero. And this is because delta zero of gg is one. However, this fails to be true if t is non-zero. So in general, h t of the identity is not necessarily zero if t is different from zero. And And the example you can take is you take R, the VGA over K generated by E minus and E plus, and you quotient by E minus times E plus minus 1, where the degree of E plus minus is equal to plus minus 2, and the differential is identically 0. I am assuming the degree that commute. And then you can see that if you multiply by e plus minus on the left, by E plus minus on the left, then this gives you an isomorphism of right R D G modules and therefore we get that the entropy of the identity functor for the category of compact objects of over R is equal to minus infinity for every t which is non-zero. So this function is very particular So this function is very badly behaved. It's not continuous, it can be basically constant d minus infinity and it's a very difficult notion to play with. So if I understand correctly, what this function is measuring for t naught equal to zero is it gives some weight to the shift. It says shift is complicated. Yeah, exactly. Why do you choose? I mean, generally shifts are thought of as, I mean, cones are expensive, but shifts are cheap. Okay, the point yes, the point I was going to make is basically the the reason why this is so badly behaved is that we push the notion too much. We're working with a general triangular category, we should restrict to a smaller set of categories, which is subgraded triangular category. Then everything works very well. You can control the entropy of the shift for every T, not only at zero. And this is exactly the theorem I'm going to state now, which is you State now, which is due partly to Julien Robay and Katzarkov-Koncevich and partly to Fan Philippe. So this is EMHK and Van Philippe. And it says that if D is isomorphic to the red category of compact objects over R, where R is at HDA which is smooth, so R is perfect as a bimodal over itself. As a bimodal over itself and proverb, which means that the dimension over k of the common model of R is finite. Then there's another formula in which you can compute the entropy. So the entropy at T of phi is now the limit over n of 1 over n in the logarithm of what I'm going to define now, epsilon t g phi n of g. And this is called the x. And this is called the x distance, and epsilon t E F for any two objects E and F is simply the sum for m and z of the dimension of home from E to F shifted by M and then you put a weight which is e to the minus mt and then what you also add is that the entropy is now continuous continuous convex and finite so if you restrict to this nicer subset of term of the categories everything works very well very very well and so we can now quantify these examples we have here so now what you get is that the entropy of the density is constantly zero The entropy of the composition of phi n times is n times the entropy of phi and the entropy of the shift is just t. So now this is a much more well-behaved notion. You can do many more things. It's still quite hard to compute entropies, entropy functions in general, but this tells you. In general, but this tells you that at least we'll work in a better setting. However, now what we have is a notion of a categorical dynamical system and a notion of entropy. So we might ask whether we can transport some of the theorems which are true in standard dynamics to the categorical world. But there's a striking difference. We have a function, whereas in the topological dynamical system world we have a number. So the first question we might ask is whether there is a specific value of this function Is a specific value of this function which plays the same role as the topological entry. And the answer is that yes, there is a number, and this is actually the value at zero. And to moderate this, I write down this example, which is actually a theorem by Kiputa and Pagashi, which says the following. So if f is the automorphism of a smooth projective variety X, then the end Variety x, then the entropy at zero of the pullback function in the derived cadmium is actually the topological entropy of zero. So this tells me that basically if I want to recover the topological entropy, probably I should look at the value at zero. So what I define is the categorical entropy of phi, so the categorical entropy of phi. of phi is the value at zero. So h s cart of phi is defined as h zero of phi. So now we have more or less completed our analogy. We have a categorical dynamical system and we have a number. And we want to understand whether theorems can be transported from one way to the other. And mainly we are interested in this theorem, which is due to Rodnov and Johndin. It tells you that That tells you that the topological entropy sometimes is actually recovered by linear algebraic information on the function. So the theorem by Gromov and Yamdin is the following. So say that X is a smooth projective variety and say that F is an holomorphic Is an holomorphic automorphism. So what I'm saying here is that the theorem works for those automorphism of X which are actually homomorphic. Okay? Then what you have is that the topological entropy of F So, sorry, what's the difference between this and being in a homomorphism of X? Um X is a holomorphic manifold, but you can also look at the topological You could also look at the topological structure, the differential structure, and all this kind of stuff. I'm saying that if you fix an automorphism in any structure, this theorem works for those which are holomorphic. But how is that different from that theorem? No, no, yeah, well, what I want to say is that the theory of topological dynamics works even for topological spaces, right? So what I'm saying here is that So, what I'm saying here is that among all the automorphisms, even the homomorphism is one, then this theorem works only for those which are homomorphic. This theorem came before that, and they proved that to recover what it was expected this value. So, what I wanted to say is that the topological entry is the logarithm of the spectral radius of the pullback on the algebraic part of the cohomology of x. Where the spectra is defi from D to V is a linear map between vector spaces, the spectral radius is the maximum of the modulus of the eigenvalues. So, among the automorphisms of X in the topological world, in every world, Topological word in every word, at the level of dynamics, the holomorphic ones have this special property with which you can compute the topological entropy. So we might ask whether something similar is true in the dynamical, in the categorical world, and we have a partial analog of this theorem, which is due to Iputa, Takashi and Shireishi, which says the following. So This is Kibuta, Shiraishi and Pagashi. So say that you take D, the umbrella category, and you consider the, and you assume it to be proper, so the home spaces are finite dimensional, and you take the numerical Guri group, so you quotient the Growing group by the radical of the Euler. Of the Euler pane and assume that the numerical drawing group is of finite rank as an inangle. Then, what is true is that the categorical Is that the categorical entropy of phi is always bigger or equal than the logarithm of the spectral radius of bracket phi, where bracket phi is the endomostem of the numerical Groupian group induced by phi. So in some sense, so basically this is analog of that one, right? Because you could take d to be dbx and phi to be the pullback. And phi to be the pullback. So this is a complete analog of a part of this theorem where we have the inequality. And based on this theorem, basically, like historically it went the other way, but Hikuto and Tagashi were led to conjecture that actually they acquired the odds, so that for every phi, and now I restrict to auto equivalences, it is true that It is true that h cat of phi is equal to the logarithm of the spectral radius of phi. This was their conjecture. And we know that it's actually true in some cases. So we know that this conjecture, maybe I want to put it this way anyway. So we know that this is true if If the canonical bundle of x, so for d equals to g dx, if the canonical bundle is either ample or anti-ample, and this is in the same paper by Kiputa and Shiresh and Tagashi. We know it is true if this depanded derived calendar of a curve, this and this is due to Kiputa. due to Kiputa. And we know it is true if uh D is the bounded terraf category of A, where A is an unbidden surface. And this could be a shock. So it is true in some cases. Unfortunately it's not true. So the conjecture is false and we have now some And we have now some examples. So the first one was constructed by Fann and he used hybrid surfaces of degree D plus 1 inside Pd, where D is odd here. Then the second contra example was constructed by Ochli, and this is for K3s. Then Matei gave counter examples for surfaces with a minus two curve in them. And most recently, in another joint work with Dr. Kim, we gave counter-examples using compositions of spherical. All spherical disks around spherical objects. And the nice thing about our contract sample is that it's the first systematic way. So the first three contract samples were had hop for the situation. Instead, what we do is we say take two straight objects, then depending on the home space between them, the composition will or will not satisfy Quaker the conjecture by Quadagash. So it's the first systematic way. So it's the first systematic way. Are there issues with functors which I think they were called ghosts at some point? Functors which are non-trivial but they act trivially on shape theory. What do you mean are there? Are there more cover examples related to that? Ours is not, because like ours is the comp you literally take choose fatal objects, you compose Two spherical objects, you compose the spherical twist, and the assumption is basically made in such a way that when you go to the K-theory, then the restriction of the order pairing to the plane spanned by the objects is non-trivial. So that in this way, what happens is that you can compute the logarithm of the spectral radius. So they do not act trivially, definitely. The other ones, I don't think they act trivially either, because they are basically all the first three examples. Basically, all the first three examples are the composition of a twist around a spherical object and a tensor product with a line bundle. That's how they compute them. No, I don't think that that creates any problem. Is it easy to see why it's true for the cases that you described? These ones? Yeah. Okay, like this is a good question. It's actually related to the talk itself. Because we'll see at some now we're going on and what we'll do. Now we're going on and what we'll do is I'll give you a sufficient condition to prove that the Kibuta Kakashi, or at least a weaker version, holds. And for example, here the point is that you know exactly what the autobiography's group is like, right? Because by Bonnie and Orlov we know that it's the standard auto-viralance group. And you can compute what they do. You can compute everything and you can see that the entropy is always zero. Okay? But it's not like the It's like these cases are case by case. You can sort this out because you know the auto-equivalence group. This is the same thing because the only case you have to be careful about is for elliptic curves. But basically, there's only one new auto-equivalence, which is the one-credit magnet. And this one is a case-by-case analysis again. But it's all strictly related to the fact that we know the drive categories very well in these cases. So, yeah, what I wanted to say is that there. So, yeah, what I wanted to say is that there are counterexamples. But if we think about Gromov-Joblin theorem, it said explicitly that we have to fix holomorphic automorphism. We cannot take any automorphism. So it's not completely absurd that the conjecture in general is false. And my point is that our point with Jean-Myan was, okay, but if Gramo-Yodmi holds for homomorphic homomorphism, then maybe what we should ask about. Then maybe what we should ask ourselves is how do we say holomorphic in the categorical way and this is the question we tried to answer in this, or at least like we partially tried to answer in this. Partially tried to answer in this paper because we can give a categorization of one of the properties of being holomorphic or not. So let me recall a little bit about stability conditions because this is going to be the key to partially answering that question. So what is a stability condition? A stability condition Sigma on B is a couple sigma equals z P of psi, where these psi are real numbers, where the psi are full added in subcategories, and then we have some conditions. So, first we So first we uh Z is a map from the k theory group of D to C then we want that for every Pi in P phi i sorry psi psi one bigger than psi two then the home space between E1 and E2 has to vanish The third condition is that p psi plus one must be the shift of p psi. And then there's another condition which is actually what is going to be interesting for us, which is the Hardernaz property. So what we want is that wherever you eat on zero object, so it's a four. So for every non-zero object E in D, there must exist phi 1 bigger than psi n real numbers and there must exist a sequence of maps and objects at 0, F1 up to Fm equal to E, such that the columns of these maps are objects AI. Ai with Ai in P phii. And finally, what we want is a compatibility between this piece, so the slicing, this is called a slicing, and Z, which is called the central charge. So we want that Z of E is equal to a number M of E, which is a posinibreal number, times the exponential of I. potential of i pi psi every time that E is an object in pip psi. So what we want is that if E is in pip psi, and psi takes the name of phase of E, then this is going to be on the line span by the exponential of E pi psi. This is a stability condition and the definition is due to Bridgebank and he proved that if you consider the space of Prove that if you consider the spatial stability condition which satisfies some property, then you can endow it with a structure of complex manifold. But that is not really what is going to be of interest for us here. What is interesting for us is that we have two group actions on the space of stability conditions. So we have the equivalence group of D that acts on the left on the group of stability on the space. The group of stability on the spatial stability condition, and then we have an action on the right by the universal colour of GL2 plus R. So how are these actions defined? Well, if phi is in the space of is an out equivalence, then we define phi on on psi, the action of phi on phi on sigma, as the stability condition whose chen central charge in it z. Central charge in Z recomposed with phi to the minus one, and whose p phi's are now the images by a phi of the psi we had before. Instead, the other action, so we fix g in gl2 plus r tilde, and then we remember that such a g is actually a couple m gf where n F, where mg is in GL2 plus R and F is a map from the real numbers to the real numbers, which is strictly increasing. And let's say it's five fx plus one is equal to fx plus one, so it's one periodic. And then we want a compatibility, which is that if you map with mg the line. With mg the line of phase psi, then you end up inside the line of phase F of psi. Then to such a couple, you make it act on sigma as follows. So this is mg minus 1 applied on z, and then the slide. and then the the slicing is P of F of psi. So we have these two group actions, they clearly commute, simply by definition, they commute with each other, and this is the key to try and answer the question I posed a little bit before, and to do so we will use the philosophy of we will try to do we will try to use the philosophy of neurosymmetry basically. So the philosophy of The the philosophy of mirror symmetry plus uh ideas of Ridgeland and Joyce say that basically we can use stability conditions to play between the symplectic side and the algebraic side. So how how do we do this? Well the point is the following. Say that we had x the smooth the complex manifold we had before. The complex manifold we had before, and see that we fix that automorphism of x, which is actually holomorphic. Then, what does this mean? Well, it means that there exists a holomorphic structure which is preserved by F. Then let's take Then, let's take omega, the volume form induced by this structure. What we have as f preserves the Lomorphic structure is that the pullback of omega via f must be the exponential of i lambda times omega, where lambda is a real number. So it must scale the homomorphic form by direct. Scale the holomorphic form by that exponential. X is Calabi R, when I just ask? We want it to be Cala Val. I mean the idea is that you take X omega symplectin manifold which is Cala V. Sorry. The idea would be to take X omega Cala B A symplectin manifold and take the mirror to be a complex Calabi R manifold. Yeah. Yeah, I think you're talking about the volume form or at least up to scale. Volume form, or at least have to scale it in the yeah, induced by the allomorphic structure. What do you mean by that? I mean, if f is a holomorphism of x, which is allomorphic, it means that I can find allomorphic structure on x for which f is homorphic. I'm saying take that holomorphic structure and take the volume form induced by that holomorphic structure. Are you talking about the oh, when you say volume form sorry, okay. Sorry, I didn't answer. Okay. So, yeah, what I was saying is, so we are here, right? Now, x was, sorry, this was also symplectic. Because I want to take, now what I want to do is I want to say, okay, take Henna Lagrangian in X, then what I do is I integrate over L, they pull back off omega. Then this is it. Back of omega. Then this is equal, by the equality there, to the integral over L of omega times the exponential of phi pi lambda. And here comes the trick of using these ideas of mirror symmetry in British-Angelis, because the idea that Britain and Joyce put forward is that this should be the central charge of a stability condition induced by the olomorphic form. Induced by the holomorphic form we fixed. So instead of this, I could write sigma omega. And this is exactly the action of C on the space of stability manifold using G L 2 plus R. So I can bet C there and I make it act on the space of stability condition. On the other hand, I could replace once again the integral over L of omega with the stability condition. And what am I doing here? Well, I'm acting Here? Well, I'm acting with a push forward of F. So this is the equation we're left with. We're saying that there's a stability condition such that when I apply the push forward along F, I'm rescaling the stability condition by the action of a real number. And this is where we start. So what we say is we generalize this is a party and we say that I A triple, so we fix three objects. We fix phi, which is going to be an alt equivalence, sigma, which is a stability condition, and g which is an element in the universal cover of GL2 plus. So this is a tribal in this space. Then we see that it is compatible. It is compatible if it satisfies this equation. So when you apply phi on sigma, this is sigma after you apply G. And the idea that we put forward that this is a categorification of one of the properties of being holomorphic. So if you are homomorphic, you satisfy this, then let's take this as a generalization. Now this is strictly stronger than be holomorphic. Strictly stronger than biomorphic, of course, because, like, if you go to ecliptic curves and you take a length twist, then such a thing will satisfy this equation for some stability condition. But our point was, well, let's look at all the equivalences that satisfy such a thing. Is that true that the analog of Kikuta Takashi holds, that Kikuta Takashi holds for those other equivalences? And this is where this is where we start. Now, we cannot get really to Kikuta Takashi, we can get something weak. We can get something weaker, but then we can get our way, we can get away with something else. So, before going to state the theorem, I need to introduce a couple more things. Or let me notice one more thing, that equations similar to these had already been studied in the literature by Dimitrov Heidel and Katsarkov-Konsevich, for example, or by Choda, but in a different setting and they were restricting G. So, G either was a complex number So G either was a complex number or it was a matrix of the form lambda 00 with plus minus 1. So it was far more restrictive and the idea was completely different. There was no point of looking at the entropy. Anyway, so what I want to talk about very quickly is another notion of growth, which is not the entropy. So when you have E and a So when you have E an object in D, and let me take it non-zero, then you can define the mass as a function of T of E as follows. You take the sum for i that goes from 1 to n of the modulus of the image by L z of Ei times E to the I pi psi i, where the EIs are the harder marazimal factor. Harder than maximum factor of V. And this is a function of t, it's called the mass. And then Ikeda proved that you can define another notion of growth using the mass, which is called the mass growth of analog equivalence phi, and it's defined as the su. Where could T enter in the sphere? Maybe I can. There's a T, sorry, yeah. Sorry, yeah. There's a t here and there's no pi. My bad. It's e to the pi psi i of t. We want this? Yeah. Sorry. This is the formula. You take the phase, you multiply it by t, and you take e here. And this is the mass. No i? No, no i, no, no, it's a number. It has to be a number. It has to be a real number. Oh, a real number. Real number. Oh, a real number. Yeah, sorry, my bad, yeah. Okay? And so what you define then is the math cross. You take the soup over the objects which are non-zero of the mean sup over n of the logarithm of the mass of phi applied n times to e and you divide by n. Now this is a very complicated formula. Now this is a very complicated formula, but in the case where T has a split generator, the soup is attained at the split generator. So it becomes much more easier to much easier to compute it. And what he proved is also that this is always more or equal than the entropy at T of phi. So this is a new function which is more or equal than the entropy of phi. And this is what we call the mass growth. And as we'll see in a moment, this is the output. And as we'll see in a moment, this is the object for which we can prove Kikuta Takashi under the compatibility assumption. Now, I need one last definition and then we can go on to state the theorem. So, I would say that sigma has a stability condition as a spanning image if the span over R. Over R of the image of Z is the whole argument. So I want the image of Z to span everything. I don't want it to be contained in a line. Okay? So there's equality here for pullback. What? Equality here for pullback? This one? Yes. No, I don't think so. I mean, that's equality is not known unless you know that the space of stability. The space of stability condition has an algebraic stability condition, so such that the heart has a fine number of symbols. It's not only in that case. Is that equality in general, for general auto equivalents, or is it just? Yeah, yes. If you have an algebraic stability condition, then every stability condition in the same connected component will satisfy the equality for every auto equivalence. But if you just take the auto pull that's given by pullback, yeah, that's what I'm thinking about that. About that. Is that true? I don't know. Yeah, no, no, I'm thinking about it. I cannot answer on the nones. I yeah, I don't have a anyway. I know I want to take more time because you can marinate and perhaps answer later. Yeah, I can. Yeah, I can give some insight later on on what I think it might go. Anyway, so now that we have all the definitions, I can state the theorem. So the main theorem that we have is the following. So say that phi sigma g is a compatible triple and assume that sigma has spanning even. Assume that sigma has spanning image, then what we know is that the entropy, the mass growth L0 of phi is equal to the logarithm of the spectral radius of mg, which is equal to the logarithm of the spectral radius of phi brackets. Of five brackets. So the weaker version of Kibo Datagachi holds for mass growth, which was one of the aims of this whole business. To see that actually, this is a sensible definition. And the next thing is that, so this part works over albitra angular categories. You don't need to be in the subgraded case. You can say this for every tangular category. Now if I restrict it doesn't have to be the derivative. It doesn't have to be the derived category of a smooth and property GA. It can be anything. Then, and you'll see in a moment why. So, if D is now the direct category of compact objects over R, where R is News and proper, then you get control over the whole function. Then, what is true is that the entropy, the mass growth with respect to sigma of phi is equal to the logarithm. Phi is equal to the logarithm, it's a linear function. So it's the logarithm of the spectral radius plus what's called the upper shifting number times t. And this upper shifting number is defined as the limit over n of E plus G by n of g, so g is still our generator divided by n and e plus E plus EF, what we want to measure is the maximum shift such that there's still anomomorphism. So this is the max j such that home E shift of F by J is non-zero. So it's actually a linear function. This is actually what is interesting. We can compute it. And then, using this last part, we can say when is it true that this inequality is true? Is it true that this inequality is actually an equality? So the last part of the theorem is that, furthermore, we have that the mass growth of phi is equal to the entropy at T of phi as a function, if and only if the categorical entropy of phi is equal to the logarithm of the spectral radius. Of the spectral radius. So the functions coincide if and only if Q does Tagashi holds. And this fulfills partly our aim, right? Of saying, okay, what's a categorical way to say homomorphic? Because we get really near to a grammar type statement. We only get the weaker quality, not the quality for the Quality, not the quality for the categorical entropy, but then we know when it's true that this holds. It holds if and only if the functions agree everywhere. And let me give you a couple of examples where we can apply this and we get something new. So curves. Then we know that Kibuda Lagash yields for every of the equivalence here. For every other equivalence here. This is the work of Kikuta who was citing before. Now, what we also know is that the stability manifold of DBC is isomorphic to C2 if the genus of C is zero, and this is the work of Okada. And this is isomorphic to sigma zero times, sorry, G L 2 plus R, so it's a single orbit if the genus is. If the genus is bigger than zero, and this is work of Gridland and Macree, where sigma zero is the standard stability condition, so it's slope stability, minus d V plus I the run, and the heart is given by coefficients. Then the notice the stability manifolds. Notice the stability manifolds are connected. So, by what I was saying before, that the mass growth is stable on connected components, we can check it for even a single stability condition if you want. Anyway, what it is true is that you can check that for every stability condition sigma, there xi and for every out equivalence actually there x is that g actually there exists a G in G L two plus R such that the action of phi on sigma is the same thing as acting by G. This is obviously true in all these cases, you just have to do the computation here. It's nothing too hard. But anyway, what we get then is that, as a corollary to the theorem I have written there, is that for everyone? For every out equivalence, so for every sigma and for every phi, what you get is that the mass growth with respect to phi, to sigma phi is equal to the entropy and is actually equal to the logarithm of the spectral radius plus a linear term. Now that's that you put that and the trick here is that you use that you know The trick here is that you use that, you know, that actually holds, and so you get everything. The new part here is this equality. So, as I was saying, this was known for P1 because it has a full exceptional collection, so it has an algebraic heart, but it wasn't known for the other curves. And the other application you have of this theorem is in another case, which is actually very similar. In another case which is actually very similar to this, and it's the case of uh db one. So this is uh the category is called db one of x and this was introduced by main heart and par sorry, I don't want to spell it in the wrong way. And how is it defined? Well, you take dx and you pause by complexes whose support has good dimensional things true. Then they can describe very explicitly what are the stability conditions on this on this category. On this category. And they also show that if you have an out equivalence of this category, then there exists f a birational automorphism of x, which is actually an isomorphism in coordination 1, and there exists a line bundle on x such that phi such that phi is actually the pullback of the intensor problem and you shift. So they are all standard except that now you are allowed to take the pullback for birational morphisms which are isomorphism in condimension one. And then based on this we can prove the following. So say that L is a line bundle numerically trivial make ideal then for every sigma case of stability condition for this category dB1 x what is true is that the mass growth at zero of pullback tensor product shifted by n is actually okay sorry Is actually, okay, sorry, I forgot to say one thing. Let's say that x has pica at one, then the mass growth at zero is actually the logarithm of the spectral radius of the pullback on one cycle's modular numerical equivalents. And what is making everything work here is basically this figure-rank one assumption, because one can see that this derived category really behaves as the derived category of a curve, more or less. As the derived calibrate of a curve, more or less. And so the only thing that you're left to control is the k-theory. So the k-theory is going to be a copy of the rank plus the determinant. So when I assume the typical rank is one, I'm basically back to the case of curves. And we can control all the things. But notice that I'm claiming only the value at zero here. And the trick here is that this category is not the direct category of a smooth and property GA. The homes here are infinite dimensional. You don't even have a self-punctor. So it's really hard to control. So, it's really hard to control. But you can control the variants. These are the two examples that we have at the moment. But the point I want to make is that it's really interesting to understand whether there are tribals which are compatible. And there are people who are doing this in various different directions. For example, a lot of people are interested to understand whether there are stability conditions which are invariant for the cell functor, for example for connected for cousins of components. And recently there have been papers proving that for many components there aren't such. For many components, there aren't such stability conditions, and papers that prove that for some others, there are stability conditions which are semi-mayant. But, yeah, this is all I wanted to say. Questions? So you've defined all these notions of entropy for an automorphism. Notions of entropy for an automorphism of the derived category by mirror symmetry, that corresponds to some kind of automorphism of the higher category. Do those have some geometric interpretation and does the entropy of such an automorphism of the Foucault category have some geometric meaning? That's a good question, because like the way to measure all this stuff is that actually you start with things which are defined for homogeneous. Which are defined for homeomorphism of X on the symplectic side. So you have a volume growth for morphisms, you have an entropy for morphisms, and then you mirror everything on the categorical side here. And this is somehow standard, right? Like what it's very derived on one side, generally it's fairly easy to understand of the geometric level, and it goes the other way around. So I don't know any notion which mirrors the categorical entropy on the Foucault level. All the notions that I know come from the geometric level and that you mirror Come from the geometric level, and then you mirror them at the categorical level on the algebraic side. Other questions? Should we be going to the other workshop that's here? But I mean this is a very serious way. I mean, like, I don't know what algebraic dynamics are. Or arithmetic dynamics. But... But can entropy in some sense give us information, arithmetic information, about a variety that you choose from? That's a good question. I don't know. I mean, actually, the very good question that one might ask is, can you use entropy in some way which is not strictly related to the calendar dynamical system? So, like, can you use the entropy function to do something? For example, recently there has been a paper by Kikuta in which she computes the Paper by Kikuta, in which he computes the centers of the direct category for K3s. At some point, he runs an argument in which he says, Okay, I compose these out equivalences, then the only thing it can be it's a shift. But I know that the entropy on the left is zero, so the shift must be zero. There cannot be, or something similar, isn't it? Sorry, I know that the entropy on the left is identically zero, so the shift must not exist. But that's the only example I know of uses of entropy which goes beyond the categorical dynamical system examples. System examples. But it would be interesting if you could say something. The problem is that it's really, really hard to compute entropy. For example, when we do the other paper in which we compute the entropy of the composition, we can compute the value at zero. The value beyond zero, it's basically impossible to compute. We can do it in some cases if the two objects have dimension, the home between the two objects has dimension two, so there are just two morphisms, but otherwise it becomes very But otherwise, it becomes very wide and super complicated. Any other questions? Let's thank that good. So that's the end for today. It's possible we wouldn't know what period wrong is over now for talk. But for right now, let's schedule it for third time. Okay? Great. James opened 26. James Open 26. I'm both going to have a question for the callback. I forgot what the other idea is. But here's a reason why I think it might. So this whole business, right? I mean your talk is good, but I think the original evasion, like, what's going to happen? Yeah, it's not tough, and then he's like, oh, that's great. This gives us what we want in the case where we have a sorry continue. Yeah, what we may write was that.
