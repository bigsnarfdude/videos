I guess before I start I want to thank the the organizers for having me here. It's been great to meet everybody. Oh sound is out. Cool. Alright well I guess I'll thank the organizers again then. It's been great to meet everybody who's here in person and it's a great opportunity to be able to present my work to everybody here and online. So today I'm going to be telling you about some work I've done looking at a potential new mechanism for kinetic proofreading step in T cell signaling. Signaling. So, this slide is maybe a little bit off from what we heard from Omer this morning, but the general idea is the same, that T cells can detect antigens over a wide dynamic range and show incredible sort of selectivity in that detection as well as sensitivity. So, just to sort of highlight those properties on this plot, we have this wide space. Wide space between the response to a non-agonist versus an agonist peptide, and that this response starts even at a single molecule at a level, a single molecule that the T cell encounters. And sometimes these responses are very digital in that the cell activates completely in response to a single molecule, but at the same time, other responses sort of have this wide range of signal. Signal, input signals that they can respond to differently over that range. And so there's been a good bit of biochemical work to sort of characterize the pieces of this pathway that actually can achieve those signaling properties. Just to go over a few of the key players here, when the TCR binds to a peptide MHC, it recruits this co-receptor, either CD4 or CD8, which brings in the kinase LCK to phosphorylate the ITAMs on the The ITAMs on the CD3 chains, which recruit this another kinase, ZAP70, which is then activated and can phosphorylate this sort of scaffold protein, LAT. And those phosphotyrosine sites on LAT recruit a variety of other signaling molecules, which kick off the sort of downstream pathways that people often think about in terms of gene expression and cytoskeletal reorganization. And so, sort of, based on these biochemical interactions, a lot of people who are here today have. A lot of people who are here today have built models of how the T cell receptor can use these biochemical steps to achieve a high degree of selectivity. And the essential idea in this process is that there are these relatively slow steps, all of which can only occur when the T cell receptor is bound to its ligand and which are quickly reversed when it's unbound. And only when you go through all of these steps do you get productive signal. And so this sort of mechanism. And so, this sort of mechanism introduces essentially a proofreading time or a delay where the MHC has to be bound to the TCR for a long period of time before signaling can occur. And so, this allows a relatively high degree of selectivity when you look at the sort of lifetime of the interactions of the different ligands. So in this sort of toy example here, you can see a relatively small difference in the average lifetime of these bonds results in a very large difference in the number of binding events that are long enough to produce productive signaling. Are long enough to produce productive signaling. And so, but one, yeah. So, one thing that these models all kind of don't take into account is this idea of phase separation, which occurs with this molecule lap once it's phosphorylated. And so, there's been a bunch of relatively recent work characterizing how this phase separation occurs and demonstrating that it, in fact, is a Is a phenomenon that occurs in T cell signaling. So you have basically these molecules GRB2 and SOS and a couple others that bind in this kind of loose polyvalent manner to the phosphotyrosine sites on LAP and allow to form these sort of phase-separated droplets that you see here in this sort of in vitro reconstitution on an artificial lipid membrane. So this raises the question, what does this phase separation mean for What does this phase separation mean for signaling? What kind of signaling properties come out of this that might not come out of sort of normal solution phase dynamics? And so, one sort of potential answer that I think is very interesting to this question is that maybe the sort of delay that's involved in nucleating these clusters could present a kinetic proofreading step here. And so, this sort of illustration shows that when you have this dilute phase, it takes a while for the first cluster to form, but once it's there, First cluster to form, but once it's there, the rest can kind of grow around it relatively easily. And so I've done a combination of imaging experiments and mathematical modeling to sort of explore these questions. Using, in imaging experiments, I use kind of a system that I've developed to precisely control the presentation of antigens to T cells. And then this model uses a kind of reaction diffusion framework to model the clustering of lat molecules. Clustering of lat molecules. So I'll get into the experimental methods first. So I want to thank Ariel Van Sassen in the Baker lab at UW, who developed this pair of proteins, the A and B shown up here, which when mixed form this sort of semi-infinite hexagonal grid that's this nice flat sheet which I can use to present peptide MHCs through this spycatcher spy tag fusion and then I just have a GFP tag And then I just have a GFP tag on the other component so that I can see the arrays under the microscope. And so, what this allows me to do is essentially independently vary the number and density of antigen presentation. Basically, the natural variation in the size of these arrays changes the number of antigens presented, and the stoichiometry of the spycatcher-spytag conjugation controls the density of antigen presentation. And so, the actual sort of experimental procedure. And so the actual sort of experimental procedure, I use the GP33 peptide, make these arrays to present that, plate them down on the glass at the bottom of a well, and then seed P14 drip cats on top of them so that they can interact with these arrays in a well-defined plane that's easy to image. And so then I fix the cells at various time points and image them, standing for phosphorylation of the CD3 zeta chains, those ITAMs that I mentioned earlier, and the Items that I mentioned earlier, and the lat molecule that's doing its phase separation. And so I get images that look a lot like these, where you can see these sort of small green dots are the arrays underneath the cells which have sort of spread out over the glass. And you get in response, when you have sort of reasonably high densities of MHC on these arrays, you can see there are these small responses of CD3 and LAT in the region where the cell over. And lap in the region where the cell overlaps the array. And it's really not coming through on this slide, but there's segmentation outlines drawn around all of these, and so I can use those segmentations to quantify the amount of phosphorylation signal that I see in the regions where the cells overlap with the arrays. And so when I do that, I get plots that look something like this. So I can generate the background curves here in black by placing the arrays randomly in the cell, and then the real curves in red. And then the real curves in red show the distribution of the median signal in each array under these conditions. And so, what's interesting to notice about these plots is that the CD3 zeta phosphorylation seems to be just a uniform shift of the population away from the background, whereas the lat phosphorylation seems to have this long tail, which suggests that maybe only a fraction of these interactions are inducing lat phosphorylation. And so, just as a sort of So, just as sort of an example to highlight this, these are two different arrays under the same conditions, where you see they have sort of similar levels of GFP, which would indicate a similar number of MHCs being presented here, but one of them obviously has no lap phosphorylation in it, while the other has a significant amount. And so, this kind of raises the question: is this sort of kinetic delay that I proposed earlier responsible for these? Responsible for this sort of long tail and the sort of fractional responses of these Lapos correlations. So, in order to kind of dig into this question a little more carefully, I built a mathematical model of this phase separation in response to TCR stimulation. So, the first piece of the model is pretty straightforward. You have peptide MHC binding and unbinding from the TCR, and then bound TCRs can create phosphorus. TCRs can create phosphorylated lat, which can then be dephosphorylated by sort of ambient phosphatases like CD45. And in this piece of the model, I specifically am ignoring earlier proofreading steps. So the TCR, as soon as it's bound, begins to produce phosphorylated lat, so that I can just focus on how much of this kinetic proofreading can be carried out at the step of the phase separation, which is accounted for by the rest of the model, where these molecules of phosphorylated lat can diffuse. Molecules of phosphorylated lat can diffuse around in the membrane, bind to each other, unbind from each other, and also undergo simple rearrangements within the clusters that they form. And so in order to sort of validate that this phase separation piece of the model actually works, I wanted to compare it to that experiment that I showed a few slides ago with the phase-separated droplets in the reconstituted system. So this slide shows data from This slide shows data from simulations that I ran with a constant number of lattin molecules in the membrane and just making sure that I can actually observe the phase separation that I want to see. So just to sort of set the tone, this video here is the actual experimental data. You can see kind of a short lag period and then a rapid formation of these phase-up-rated droplets. And what we see in these simulations is almost exactly the same thing. So here I'm representing The same thing. So here I'm representing molecules that are bonded to each other with these red lines, and you can see these clusters form pretty rapidly and then are stable for a long period of time under conditions that mimic the experimental conditions here. But if you reduce the concentration by only a factor of roughly three, you see essentially no clustering at all. And so this is a nice validation of the space separation phenomenon, which is known to have a very sharp sort of critical concentration. A very sharp sort of critical concentration that's below which you never form any separate phase and above which you robustly form that phase. So with this piece kind of validated, I then put back in the TCR signaling component to see if I could recapitulate a lot of the properties that I've already talked about. And so here I had to cheat a little bit and leave the TCR permanently bound to get this single molecule. Bound to get this single molecule of sensitivity. But what you see at the very end there is that a small cluster forms right around the center in the middle of this kind of gradient of lat that's forming as it's being produced and diffusing away from the TCR. And I also can get plots that are at least vaguely reminiscent of the ones that I showed before, where the amount of total clustered lat in these simulations follows this at least fractional results. At least fractional response that's maybe somewhat similar to what I saw with my imaging data. These are simulations now with a larger number of MHCs and a reasonable off-rate. And similarly here, I can sort of recapitulate this wide dynamic range as well as this almost single molecule sensitivity. So here I'm responding with a 10-second. With a 10-second half-life to four copies rather than just one. And then I still have an increase in the response, even up to 100 copies of the peptide MHC being presented. And so this sort of increase is a nice sort of recapitulation of these more analog responses that you see in some of the gene expression data from T cell stimulation. From T cell stimulation, and then maybe the sort of binariness of forming a cluster at all is more analogous to the more digital responses that you see with like ERC and calcium signals and things like that. And another nice property that I can recapitulate with this model is the selectivity of the TCR for these peptides. So, if I vary the off-rate of the TCR for the MHC, I see this nice sharp. To see, I see this nice sharp drop off where right around a 0.1 per second off rate, I get a very sharp decrease in the amount of clustering that I see in the simulations. And so, but these are sort of all properties that other models can generally recapitulate. And it's not anything particularly new or interesting. So, what does this model tell us that we can't get from anything else? And so, one thing that this model has as a concept in it that other models don't is the concept of space. So, this is kind of a silly toy plot here, but the sort of classical kinetic proofreading models, since they don't have a concept of space and them, really they're just sort of a well-mixed reaction chamber, they can't tell the difference between, say, in this little cartoon at the bottom, nine MHCs that are spaced far apart from each other versus nine that are very packed close together. Close together. In contrast to this, my model actually shows a very sharp dependence on the spacing between the MHCs that are presented to the cell when you keep a fixed number of them presented and vary the spacing between them. And this is probably because each TCR sort of establishes this gradient around itself. And when you put them next to each other, each one individually is not quite enough to form. Is not quite enough to form a cluster, but as you bring them closer together, they can start to significantly add to each other and form these, reach the critical concentration and start to form a cluster. But as you bring them even closer together, then those distributions overlap so much that you don't actually get any benefit from having an additional TCR or an additional MHC there. And so that's why you see this peak in the middle where you have sort of an optimal spacing. So this is an interesting prediction. So, this is an interesting prediction, but then obviously we need to test if it bears out in real life. And so, here I've sort of aggregated a large amount of the imaging data that I collected with these arrays. And I'm plotting on the x-axis essentially the GFP intensity of the array, which should be in proportion to the number of MHCs that are presented. And that for each individual density of antigen presentation, that's re-rescaled based on a stoichiometry. Scaled based on a stoichiometry. And so you can see here over a wide range of total copy numbers and also a wide range of antigen presentation densities, the CD3 phosphorylation essentially shows no response to the antigen presentation density. But if you look at lap phosphorylation, there's a much more dramatic change, sort of represented by the shift along the shift between these different curves. And so I can quantify. And so I can quantify essentially the distance of these curves along the axis that's perpendicular to them as a measure of essentially how efficient the MHCs are at activating the cells. And so if I do that, I get plots like these, where the CD3 phosphorylation is essentially independent of the antigen spacing, but LAT shows this nice peak, which is similar to what we see with the models. So, just to summarize, I can measure these TCR responses pretty precisely using this array platform that was developed in the Baker lab, and that these experiments, along with this model, kind of point to the delay in nucleation of these clusters as an important kinetic proofreading step. And that this phenomenon is potentially a mechanism that allows the T cell to have. And that allows the T cell to have sort of all these important signaling properties like the sensitivity, selectivity, and dynamic range that I've been talking about throughout the presentation. So I want to thank both the Quay and Baker labs, my two advisors, and all the other students in those labs, but especially Michael Yerda, he's an undergraduate in our lab who helped a lot with these imaging experiments, and Arielle Bunsassen, the one who developed the array proteins. The array of proteins. So, yeah, thank you. Thanks a lot. Any questions over Zoom? Let's do Zoom first. I think we have actually time. So Olmar, go ahead. Oli, yeah, thank you very much. Very nice talk. Thank you very much. Very nice talk. We've also played a little bit with LAT as being part of kinetic proofreading. And one thing that we find is that it tends to destroy proofreading if you allow multiple TCRs to activate LAT. And so I wondered, in that plot you showed a selectivity, you know, you showed that it has really nice selectivity. I wondered, I mean, my guess, I guess, is that you did that at low antigen density, right? It's at, I think, a relatively intermediate density, but a low number. Intermediate density, but a low number of MHCs. I think I had a 4x4 grid in those simulations. I wondered if you could, you can seem to repeat this at high concentration. And I'd be curious to know if you lose selectivity, because what happens is that multiple weak affinities can cooperate to activate a lap cluster. Yeah, that might soften this curve a little bit. Yeah, so it can be interesting to see that. Yeah, very cool, thanks. Yeah, very cool. Thanks. Thanks. Alex? Thanks for this talk. It's really great. I was wondering, how do you distinguish or what are the differences between, this is a more general question, but then also related to modeling. How do you distinguish between oligomerization, forming an oligomer and and this kind of phase separated assembly? Assembly? That is a good question. I think the idea of phase separation is sort of inherently like a bulk property. So when you start to think about oligomers with only a handful of molecules in them, that idea doesn't really necessarily apply. So I guess it's maybe that doesn't quite answer your question, but the distinction is sort of blurred. Like at some point, you have enough. Is sort of blurred. At some point, you have enough of them there that it really counts as a separate phase, and there's some line that you have to draw, but it's not entirely clear to me what that line would be. But in terms of modeling, so the model that you employed looks to me like sort of an oligomerization model, right? Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think in the model, there's not really a distinction between those two things. The difference in real life is these sort of properties of like exchange with the. Of, like, exchange with the dilute phase and sort of internal rearrangements, which I've kind of accounted for with that, the rearrangement piece of the model. And I haven't looked at it carefully, but I do think that in the model there is significant exchange with the dilute phase, so it does kind of recapitulate those properties. So it is reversible? Yes, yes. The off-rate that I have for these in the model is relatively high, so it should be in a. So, it should be in a relatively dynamic equilibrium. Okay, great. Thanks. Hi, William, very enjoyable. And I wanted to really ask a question for you and Omer both. There's a well-known old phenomenon of T4 receptor partial agonism, where you actually don't have a perfect trade-off between affinity and valency. And in fact, the high valency needed to get a signal can actually be antagonistic to something. Can actually be antagonistic to some TCR responses. I'm wondering if your model actually accounts for that and some of the constraints that you were seeing in terms of phosphorolap clustering. And maybe Omar could also comment on this with respect to the specificity plots that he was showing as well. Yeah, I don't think that that is really accounted for by by this model. Um as as far as I know, the the way that that's generally done is That's generally done is by negative feedback that comes from intermediate kinetic proofreading steps, which are not present in this model. There's only the one step, which is the clustering. I don't know whether Omar has got comments on this as well, if he's still on. Yeah, I'm sorry, I couldn't actually hear the question. Oh, I was just asking about partial agonism. And I was thinking about this because the OT1 spe uh sorry. Varvarian peptides were actually some of them famous for partial agonism, and I wasn't certain whether there was a signature, for example, the inability to get to a 100% plateau, whether that was actually a signature of partial agonism in your models. Well, because there is this, that's an aspect of kinetic proofreading, I think, of generating negative feedbacks without positive significance. Feedbacks without positive signal? Well, I think my understanding is that the kinetic proofreading can give you that. So it can have sort of differences in the maximal response. If you completely saturate the TCR with antigen, that the maximum response will depend on the off-rate. So that as the off-rate increases, the maximum decreases. And so I think that model, like alone, I think, can explain differences in the maximum. Can explain differences in the maximum response. I don't want to pass even more, but maybe Gregor could comment on that. But I'm pretty sure that's the case. Anyway, it's a simple scaling where you have a concentration times the half-life to a power number of steps. So indeed you can concentrate when the other, but you can't explain antagonism. No, yeah. Like if you I was going to ask you, uh William, if you have tried mixed mixture of heptax, right? Try mixture of heptax, right? Like we see very strong antagonism when you mix big quantity. And then going back to Omer's problem, the issue in the first talk, maybe you could reach this very high density of E1 peptide to really push the system beyond what we can do in a very clean manner. Yeah, I have not run simulations with a mixture of peptides, but yeah, that's definitely something that I'm thinking about doing. Just to add to that point, this is quite hi everybody. Yes, I think our simple model would not account for the antagonism primarily because of the lack of feedback on the upstream steps, but I think the more kind of realistic model would involve upstream kinetic proofing at the T and the negative feedback at the receptor level, in addition to that. And from optogenetic studies, there's evidence. There's some evidence, like people can tune the half-life using light, and they can basically have evidence that there's proofreading both upstream and downstream, and then there's separate quantitative contributions to both of them, to the overall selectivity. So I think that will be followed up on Alex's question. So if you could we go back to the slide with the model just to understand it. Understandable that so what are the ingredients of the model? They just bind any any two which are next to each other the lightest can bind there is uh each one can be bound to several or only two so it's not like a photograph. No, each one can be bound to up to uh all eight neighbors in the grid. Um and I purposely didn't limit that except by the sort of spatial constraints of a 2D grid because all of these interactions are actually mediated through All of these interactions are actually mediated through several layers of other proteins, which all are polyvalent interactions. And so it seemed reasonable that you wouldn't have sort of a cap on the number of interactions, even though there's only, I think, three phosphotyrosine sites on lap. Each one of those could bind to one molecule, which then has two binding sites on it, which binds to another one that has four binding sites on it, and so then you get a lot of potential interactions. But then in time size, there is no difference between clusters or I mean it's the same model which we were both I mean it's the same model which we would both what we would call clusters and what we would call directly the phase. So the low phase below at the critical interaction strength and critical density, you will have the floating clusters of some various sizes. And then above the transition you will have an infinite phase of it. Yes. So this model doesn't make a huge distinction I guess between like a polygomerization and a separate liquid phase, but I think for the And a separate liquid phase. But I think for the purposes of measuring the output, it's sufficient to ignore that piece of it. And it's not completely ignored, because you see in these movies, the clusters are sort of fluid and they do rearrange. But that's not, I think, critical for the behavior of the model. But do the emergencies? Well, these ones, the simulation stuff before they could, but they could, in theory, They could, in theory, merge with each other. They just move very slowly once they get that big. Okay. I think it's a good time to stop. I'm taking over. If we move to the next stop. Yeah, well, it's like any other name that smells. I think there would make sense. I'll wait for the next speaker. Which is coding generative tasks in person. After the talk, please stay around and take a zoom photo of all the busy posts. So she's a Zoom people. Stay around and and you know take turn on the camera or something else. The camera or something else. Pretty setup. Get a nice zoom down. I mean, there are layers in the signal. We do that right after generating some tool. We're not interacting with too much of a PC. So I'm not sure if you're actually looking at the space. In terms of space of atmospheric, what density it's here? In the ambulation instruments, it was I think 1200 meters per square, which is, I think, about three or four times more than the pointer work on normal IPC. The spacing here, right? Oh, yeah, the the limit of the spacing on the
