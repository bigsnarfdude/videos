Okay, thank you very much for the introduction, for the invitation. It is a great pleasure to be here sharing these ideas with you. So I will start with a quick slide if you want to know. If you want to know what's going on in this talk, just give me six minutes and I will try to squeeze it in six minutes. So here are some fundamental questions about this talk. What is going to be done is to explore inflection of some particular linear series on some families of marked superelliptic curves. Marked superelliptic curves and how what is the process which we are going to use. Basically, we are going to use the combinatorics of this kind of curves. Basically, you choose a degree here and thereafter is going to be marked by n. n is a natural number which is bigger than two. And we are going to fix a map which is into one to the projective line. To the projective line, such that you have a special point on the curve which lands on the infinity with respect to this coordinate system. And sorry, so I have to, yes, so the inflection polynomial is by definition, associated to this linear series is by definition to take all the inflection polynomials. All the inflection points associated to this linear series, which I am going to introduce later, you project them onto the projective line. So they become parameters on a field, on a base field F, and then you take the product of all the linear factors having these as roots. This is by definition what we call the inflection polynomial of the linear series. So the definition. So the definition is very simple, but the game is that I will give you a definition for the left-hand side of the previous equation. The game is to try to keep the factors of this polynomial. So what is the so this conference on real polynomials? So you may ask what is the real part? uh what is the real part in this process so you may either suppose that your base field is the real number but you don't know you are not allowed to think about the base field as a complex number so usually you specify that you may think about complex numbers but not here and if you are interested in in other worlds you can declare Declare for the rest of the talk that the characteristic of the base field is going to be prime relative to the degree of the branching branched cover. And so the word families on my title. What are the families? Then after that, introducing these single polynomials, we may do variations of the families by introducing some modular parameters. and by introducing some modular parameters and then looking at the evolution or are the zero sets of these parametric polynomials. And finally, this is joint work with Ethan Cottri, Ignacio Darago, Chiang Gohan, and Tony Shaska. And the paper is a newborn baby. It appeared last week. So if you're interested in these kinds of histories, you may. Histories, you may check it out. Okay, I finished in five minutes, 40 seconds. So, the rest of the talk is going to be about the details of what I just said. I have three sections. The first one is to introduce the concept of inflection. Although, Professor Boris has already talked about this concept in the previous talk. The second one is The second one is definition, the actual definition of inflection polynomials and some of the remarkable properties. And the third one, I'm going to discuss the behavior of these guys under parametrizations of flat families of curves. Okay, the first one is if you know what inflection is, then you may skip it. Otherwise, I will try to define it as To define it and say why do we care about it. So I will try to mix some algebraic geometry here. Sometimes when we start our study of algebraic curves, we look at maps from smooth and proper complex algebraic curves to the projective space. And these maps are described by the Described by the concept of linear series. A linear series is just a pair of a line bundle of some degree D and a subspace of the space of global sections of the line bundle on the curve. So you fix the dimension to be r plus one and this is called GDR for historical reasons. You may swap the number, the name linear series or GDR. So once you have a vector space, you may look for a basis, for a basis as a vector space, and you may construct a Gronskian. The Gronskian is some section, which is on some particular line bundle, which you can construct from your line bundle, which your starting line bundle and the canonical bundle of the curve. And of course you can always do this locally and locally is this what you are thinking. You take local coordinates and to take the derivations, the K-loll derivatives of the basis with respect to a local parameter. And this is the local form of your stock. So, what is the inflection device? Or the inflection device is an effective device around your curve such that the associated weight of a point records a fundamental local invariant of the linear series, namely the total deviation of the p vanishing orders of all the elements of the vector space from the generic sequence. So, this is a hardcore definition. So this is a hardcore definition which works for any linear series on any smooth complex proper curve. Of course, particular cases of inflection have been already seen in the talk of Professor Boris and also other geometric phenomena arise as inflection. Okay, so let me switch from complex numbers to a general field. Now imagine that. Now, imagine that I erased the complex numbers from the previous slide and I want to carry the previous story to a new world where the field is no longer the complex numbers. So we may wonder how many information do we lost from this process, right? Because complex numbers are very rich and usually over other fields, we don't have this geometric richness. Richness. So we are going to present here some progress. The ingredients, as I said, are some kind of algebraic curves over any field. We have the particularity of having a cyclic cover, being a cyclic cover of the projective line and such that they are ramified over infinity. So if you land on the point at infinity of the At the infinity of the projective line, and you look above your eyes, you are going to find a point. We are going to mark that point from now on. And the linear series, the particular linear series which is going to interest me, are some multiples of this. The line bundle is the line bundle induced by some device or supported on this smart point and some subspaces of the total. subspaces of the total of the space of sections. So of course if your field is algebraically closed the inflection device in this particular situation brokes down into what we can see say this is a horizontal component and then some And then some fibers. This is the vertical component. And the relevance of the inflection polynomial is that the vertical component of the inflection of these guys is parametrized precisely by the roots of the inflection polynomial, right? So the inflection polynomial parametrizes the projection of the fibers where there is the inflection. There is the inflection and the whole fiber under the elliptic, the hyperelliptic projection is inflectionary. All the points, all the members of the fiber are inflection points. But this is when the situation is easy. Of course, easy here means that the field is algebraically closed. So otherwise, you may wonder about questions of rationality, right? So this is the main use of the inflection polynomials. The inflection polynomials, we study rationality questions associated to the inflection devices of these guys. Okay. So already here I have a simple example. The simplest case is an elliptic curve. When you take the degree of ramification equal to two, and your curve has genus one, then this guy is an elliptic curve over F. Now you choose a multiple of the infinity of the point at infinity, which is a marked point, and you choose the whole set of sections, right? The complete linear series associated to a multiple of the marked point. And in this case, you recover the inflection points of degree I'm sorry, and you recover the torsion points of your elliptic curve as the inflection of this complete linear series. This completely near series. And already here, you start looking at the phenomena that I said. You have here like your donut. It has the traditional picture. Here is your projection. This is P1. And then you may have some, I'm sorry, you may have some the ramification. The ramification divisor is located here. There are four points which cover which this cover ramifies. And sometimes these guys are inflection points or torsion points. And sometimes you have some points away from the ramification locus. And if you have one point here, then under the elliptic involution, you will have another point here. And this is Another point here, and this is the green ones are the vertical inflection, and the red one is the horizontal one. So, this phenomena extends for superelliptic curves. Now, you have more layers and more holes, but this is basically the standard picture that you will see later. Okay, so this is for the first part, just an introduction. Just an introduction and some like difficulties that you may encounter when you go from the complex numbers where inflection or the real numbers where inflection have a geometry has a geometric meaning and you try to generalize the concept of inflection to arbitrary curves on arbitrary fields for arbitrary series, right? Okay, so now let me go to the main to the main subject of my talk. Main subject of my talk, which is the actual definition of the inflection polynomials and some of the properties. Okay, so as I said, the particularity of high of superelliptic curves is that we can look at them as combinatorial objects. I won't stop on this remark, but you may take this home. Take this home. This idea, so they are specified by a pair, which is a number greater than or equal to two, and some collection of different points on the projective line. This map is totally ramified over these specified points, and it is a tally elsewhere. So you have either, if you look above your projection, you either have one point or you have Either have one point or you have n different points on the algebraic cluster. So, here there are some technicalities under which you may place yourself in order to do what I'm going to do. So, basically, you need the degree of your polynomial or the number of points that you choose to be relatively prime. Be relatively prime with the degree of the cover, then you need that the points to be different. You need also a marked point. I mean, if you do not have marked points over, I mean, if you do not have rational points on your curve, then maybe it is not useful to look for rational inflection points since you will have none. And also, under these circumstances, you may, if when you take away the If when you take away the point at infinity, this is well defined since the map is ramified at infinity. So if you take away that point, you may find an affine presentation of that affine open set. And this is just a functional equation when you add an n-ruth of a variable y. And then you may qualify, you may think about. Think about your root as a separable polynomial, right? As a product of linear factors, all of them different over the algebraic cluster. So this is what makes things work. It is not easy at all to study inflection over fields which are not the complex numbers or the real numbers. I mean, for the complex numbers, this is not a great deal. A great deal since you always have the number of inflection points that you need. This is the chair class of some jet bundle associated to your starting bundle, but line bundle, but over other fields, this may not be accessible. So looking for suitable linear sections over which you can do this, it is not easy. Is not easy. And then a second subsidiary question is that once you have a suitable basis, it may not be possible to compute to devise the rational points or how many inflection points are on the base field and how many escape from them. So already in the talk of Professor Boris, we have this question about how many real inflection points may a real algebraic plane curve. A real algebraic plane curve hub, right? And some classical questions for it. So, anyways, what makes this machine works is that actually the basis for global sections of this linear series on this particular type of curve is combinatorial, meaning that it is completely monomial with no coefficients in front of them. In front of them. So you may, if you allow me this sentence, one can say that these guys are defined over F1. Since it is combinatorial, it is not algebraic. There are not coefficients here. Anyways, sorry about that. This says that this machine works everywhere because Everywhere because the element one is available in every field, so this element belongs to any field or even any ring, right? So the basis is combinatorial since you only need to define some boundaries of the indexes y, i, and j, depending on your parameters n and d, and you are all done, right? Um, so So remember that I told you that Gronskian was in some sense involving some differentials or some derivatives, derivations like the Hessian for the plain case. And here, since these guys are defined everywhere and you want to work in arbitrary characteristic, you may change your classical derivations by some hash derivatives, which are well behaved over positive characteristic. positive characteristic. So you only copy the previous statement that I gave you like two or three slides before and you change your derivative by the hash derivative and you specify this as a stock of your new section for your Bronze Ken, right? With respect to this combinatorial basis. This combinatorial basis. And you are done. Here, so one small remark is that I am allowing Maris myself to take away some of these elements of this vast basis. So in principle, you take the whole space of monomials between these limits, but then But then we may even consider some incomplete series. And the incomplete series is taking away some of these monomials. And then you play the same game and you try to compute the inflection for this uncomplete series. So the setting is very general. It works for some incomplete series on very general curves. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And um, yes, so uh let me um let me give you the actual definition for the simplest case, which is n equal to so from now on I will denote by d the hazard derivative with respect to Hazard derivative with respect to local variable x. So I will set n equal to and I will set so this is a hyper elliptic curve of some genus. I fix some some number higher than the genus and then I take the g21 which is the linear series belonging to the projection to the hyper elliptic projection and then To the hyper elliptic projection, and I take multiples of that, right? So I take the complete linear series, and I am giving here you a basis of regular sections for this linear series, right? So as you see, it is very easy to say, to state, right? They are just monomials on X going from 0 to L. And then you repeat these monomials. Repeat these monomials up to some degree with y in front of them. And when n goes above 2, you add a second and a third layer of y square, y4, etc. Always respecting the limits that I stated before. Anyways, the inflection polynomial is just a guy. It's just a polynomial with coefficients on F that satisfied. With coefficients on f that satisfies a functional equation. On the left-hand side, I give you the traditional definition of the Bronskian. But since I'm working away from the ramification locus, then y becomes an invertible function. So I have the right to take negative powers of it. And also f, since f is an nth root of y, I have also the right to take negative. The right to take negative powers of it. So, if you look at this equation five, this equation five defines the equation polynomials as a functional equation. And this is associated to this particular case, but the option is that you may have this for all the situations that I described. So, among these cases, the simplest one that you may imagine. That you may imagine. So, for example, this is the determinant of a matrix, of a square matrix of this dimension, right? Of 2L. This is the dimension is here, 2L minus G. And when G is equal to L is equal to G plus 1, then this statement reduces to... The statement reduces to this simple functional equation, which links the g times 2 for the derivative of y. Remember here, the only relation that you have to record on your brain is this one. Of course, here the characteristic cannot be two. And we all always have this kind of restrictions, but. Restrictions, but this is the inflection polynomial, right? It fits into this equation, and this is called atomic since all the other inflection polynomials that I have introduced here are also determinants on these guys. So, if you are looking for a more complicated inflection linear series, you may compute these guys, which are the atomic, and then come up with some. And then come up with some determinant with coefficients in the integers, such that if you plug these guys in and you compute the determinant, you get the corresponding inflectionary polynomial. So everything depends on these guys, on the atomic inflection polynomials. Okay. So far, so good. I'm sorry. I'm trying to change the page. Anyways. Okay. So atomic inflection. So atomic inflection polynomials for the supernelectic case hold a similar definition. Now you allow n to be plus than 2 and for any l between 1 and n minus 1 and some m also ranging from some convenient set of parameters. You may define the LM atomic inflection polynomials also by a function. Also, by a functional equation, which is very simple, right? So it says that the m has the derivative of your variable y to the l has to be some multiple of your polynomial times this m guy. And the factor that completes the equation is your inflection, your atomic inflection polynomial. I am sorry if I cannot give you a conclusion. If I cannot give you concrete examples of inflection polynomials, so if you want to think about them, they are some generalization of the division polynomials which are used to compute torsion points on elliptic curves. So here you are allowing yourself to take some incomplete series and some other you variable number of holes of your curve, no longer one, but it may be more. It may be more, and the number of layers of your cover, not only two, but more. So, these guys generalize those polynomials and in arbitrary characteristics. So, it is not easy to describe concretely examples of them. Okay, sorry. Now, so why do we care about atomic inflection polynomials? Is that they satisfy a recursive. They satisfy a recursion relation, which is also a very simple functional equation. So, if you start with your inflection polynomial here, yes, here, and then you want to compute the next one. Then, this equation tells you that you only need to perform this simple operation. You compute the half derivative with respect to x of your inflection polynomial times the factor that defines the curve plus some number minus the index that you are working on, your current polynomial times the half-derivative polynomial. And then you divide everything by one over m plus one, and there you go. This is your next. And there you go, this is your next one. And you can iterate this process to get all the atomic inflection polynomials. But again, it is not easy once you are in such a general case to come up with general properties of these guys. So your first inflection polynomial is this just has a derivative with respect to x of your defining equation times this parameter and then. Parameter and then you start with this seat, you start moving in the time discrete time to compute all of these guys. Now that we have access to these one parametric polynomials, which may be real or may be defined over another field, you may also make these polynomials parametric by introducing some introducing some modular parameters, which gives you some flat bar of some flat families of superelliptic curves. So this is the remark below here. Inflectionary varieties are defined once you start varying your polynomial and you can do this in a modular fashion. Okay. So the last part of the talk. So the upshot is that the inflection The option is that the inflection polynomials, the atomic ones, are very simple. It is just the solution of a functional equation and they satisfy a recursion formula. And once you have them, you may compute the other ones by using determinantal techniques on these atomic ones. So now let me go to the last part of my talk. It's talking about It's talking about the behavior of these polynomials under modular families or one-parameter families of marked curves. And here I will focus on the real case and also on the elliptic curve case. Okay. So here already we have an application due to Ethan, Ignacio and Chango. So you choose a parameter, a real parameter, and you compute the nth atomic inflection polynomial with respect to this polynomial f, right? So now to put things concretely, this is your f okay. So the equation is y squared. So the equation is y squared equal to f, and when you want to do computations, you unpack the information that f contains and start doing computations. But in principle, you may consider this just as a functional equation, bearing in mind that f is a polynomial with different groups. Anyways, once you start looking at this Bayerstra's elliptic curve, it is a pencil of elliptic curve, which depends only on the parameter. depends on the on on the parameter lambda the other two the other parameter is fixed to be two and uh here are some uh this is a conjecture about the number of real inflection points of of the complete linear series on real algebraic curves depending on this on this particular pencil of elliptic curves so our curves so already we see that here we exclude the number lambda equal to minus three because over minus three this curve is singular but anyways this is better understood with a picture here this is also beautiful picture provided by them to me here you have the plane you have two coordinates the first one this one is One is the X coordinate, this one. And then here you have the modular parameter. So if you fix a value of lambda zero and you look at the line x equals lambda zero, then anytime you cross the blue line, this is supposed to be a real inflection point. To be a real inflection point. Well, not a real inflection point. This is a root of the each point here is a root of the inflection polynomial belonging to this particular parameter. So if you change your parameter for some other, you are going to find other roots. And if you go below to the negatives, you are also going to find another behavior. So the conjecture. So, the conjecture that I just showed tries to specify how many real inflection points on this particular pencil of real elliptic curves you're going to have by analyzing the roots of the inflection polynomials and the positivity behavior of the polynomial that defines the biological cubic. So, over the orange. The orange shaded region, the polynomial f is positive. So it says that, for example, this point is going to lift to a real inflection point because the value of f at this particular x0 here is x0 is positive. So it says that it's going to give you a positive square root of this equation, right? So in order. Right, so in order for the point to be real, I need that this equation has two real solutions, right? So I need this to be positive. And similar condition applies for the general case. So here we are discussing like the case, this is the case M equals 9 and this is the case M equals 10. The case m equals 10. So there is a strange dichotomy between the pair, the even and the odd case. But anyways, the upshot of this discussion is that the singular point here, the singularity of the inflectionary curve, seems to control the topology of the distribution of the real inflection points in this pension. So that's the next remark. That's the next remark. This is the remark that I just made. The geometry of the inflectionary variety, which codifies the inflection of these families, is controlled by the singularities. And to further apply this technology to the computation of real inflection points, we need to understand the singularities of the inflectionary varieties. So for this particular case, So, for this particular case, I present you some result which says that these inflectionary varieties, I mean, the previous curve that I showed you, are non-singular away from three points. And these three points are permuted by the triple roots of the unity. So, anyways, I am showing you here. The local Newton polygons of each one of these singularities. So the conjecture says that these singularities are topologically equivalent, or that they are basically the same. And from the Newton polygon of the inflectionary curve, you may extract the local Newton polygon of the singularity. So here they are. This is. This is for the odd case and this is for the event case. So as you go above the number of inflection points or the degree of the linear series, you start finding some integral points inside this segment. Inside this segment. And the best you can hope for, I mean, from the topological classification of singularities, the best that you can, yeah, the worst case scenario would be that these guys are Newton non-degenerate. And that's also part of the conjecture. We believe that not only this is Only this is the local Newton polygon of each one of the three singularities of the inflectionary curve in this case, but also that the restriction of the polynomial to these segments, which have additional inner points, is separable. That's to say that it consists of the number of quasi-lines that you get when you restrict the polynomial to this. Restrict the polynomial to this segment is the same as the integer length of the segment. So if that's the case, you will have access to toric singularity resolution just by looking at the normal fun of the of the local Newton polygon. So here again, the local Newton polygon, the Newton fan is specified. Farm is specified for the this is the odd case and this is the even case. But the option is that they have a common refinement to just have all the rays. So here the last ray is one, two, is this guy. Here the last ray is one. I know this here you have an additional ray, which is one, one. And in order to get a smooth Toric surface, you add all the rays. To add all the rays with, I mean, the first coordinate is always one. And you go from zero up to m plus one when m is the number that you care about. So it seems to be the case that since these linear series are defined over every field, the resolution of the The resolution of the singularities should also be defined over any field, and this is what we mean by conjecturing that they have to be neutral non-degenerate. And that's all from my part. Thank you very much. Okay, so thank you very much, Christian, for your talk. Thank you for having established several connections to the talk of Baudel Shapiro before. Of Polish Shapiro before. Are there questions? Christian, I probably missed something, but why did you stress that this cannot be over C? Because C is algebraically closed. So basically, I mean, The behavior, the rational behavior is you all have all the points, all the inflection points that you have are specified by the degree of some jet bundle. And perhaps the only things to be known in the algebraically closed case is this inflectionary weight. Of course, this is a meaningful problem if you care about. If you care about non-generic curves, which may be inflected or highly inflected at some points, but from the numerical point of view or the rational point of view, the complex case is not interesting. Is it so difficult to produce examples? One example? Well, basically, I can give you here. I can give you here, for example, if I retake the example of the elliptic curve here, the complete linear series, for example, we have tried to compute these polynomials, but we are not very good at computations. But for example, here, if you take the complete linear series of the elliptic curve, the basis is going to be x0 up to x. zero up to x l x yes and then y x zero up to y x l minus one so if you compute the inflection polynomial for this for this set you get the division polynomial and there are algorithms this is from from elliptic curves Elliptic curves. And we are aware that there are algorithms and implementations for doing this effectively. But as long as you start taking away your series, for example, here you may say, okay, what happens if I take away the last one? So I take the subspace, which is the whole space. Minus the last one. Then already this problem, this, I mean, the inflection of this subspace is something new, but it's closely related to torsion. But we haven't been able to produce meaningful procedures to compute this kind of polynomials, of inflection. Of polynomials, of inflection polynomials. So, this is the most down-to-earth example that I can give you right now. It's about some sub-series of the complete series given by multiples of the marked point on an elliptic curve. And then you may go further and start taking away functions. And what I said here is that if you look at Is that if you look at the particular case in which you take away everything but y so you take away yx square, yx up to l plus l minus one. This is the atomic inflection polynomial. And in some sense, for particular or for practical reasons, if you compute the atomic, then the division is going to be The division is going to be a determinantal equation in the atomic one. So, this could be useful, but we haven't been able to produce some meaningful procedures to push these computations towards the theoretical realm. Yes. Thank you. Thank you.
