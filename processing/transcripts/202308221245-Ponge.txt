No, I don't mind. Okay. Thank you. Okay, so I guess should start. You can start, yes, please. All right, so I thank the organizers for giving me opportunity to speak in this workshop. So my talk will be Uh okay, sorry, this is I think okay, so what are the links between two fields of quantum theory? So namely a semi-classical analysis of Schrodinger operators and non-metival adjunct. So semi-classical analysis aims to look classical analysis aims to look at the behavior of quantum system when you let the constant Planck h goes to zero and automative geometry aims to formulate the main tools of differential geometry in the language of quantum mechanics so the so there may seems to be these two fields may seem to be far apart but recently Far apart, but recently there are bridges that have emerged from the work of Rosenblum, Sukhochev, Zanin, and others. And the routes between this between the links, the region of the links between semiconductor analysis and non-financial geometry comes from. Okay. Okay, comes from operator theory. So, for one thing, there is this operator theory approach to some analysis that was pioneered by Bjerman, Solomiak, and Simons and others in the 70s. And the other thing is that operator ideals play a key role in the framework of alternative geometry, in particular in the conception. particular in the conception of the notion of integral so our main uh results uh so the main so the main result will be a so first will be a semi-classical vice law for spectral triple so this improves uh previous result of mcdonald's for chef zenin and the second result which is in fact uh in sense a byproduct of the approach to get the first result is an extension of Is an extension of the spectral triple of connotation formula. So I'll explain later in the talk what is the constant evolution formula. So what connectivation formula by DP shows that we can recover the Riemannian measure by using the non-commutative antique. So we get an analog of this result. So this has been generalized in various mostly a commutative setting, also non-commutative, for instance from Also, non-commutative, for instance, from non-commutative draw. And we see an extension of this result to a spectral tree. So there are actually many examples. So first, when you specialize the result to the remaining case, we actually get a simple proof of the semi-classical value for manifold or opinion domains. We'll get a semi-classical value for a non-committee trial, which corresponds to. For a non-metative toilet, which was conjectured by McDonald and myself in a previous paper. Yes, we get so another example is semi-classical Valor and activation formula for sub-Riemannian manifold. So I don't think I have time to speak about this, but examples of sub-ramian manifold include the compact manifold and mean manifold. And you also get a semi-classical value as well as an integration formula on open manifold. For some open manifold, it For some open uniform, more specifically for a direct Schrodinger operator, as well as for a magnetic Schrodinger. So, I won't have, I think. Uh, today I will speak about only the remaining case, it's just a matter of one couple of slides, and I will speak about the result for an open T vector. So, what's a semi-classical vice law? So, consider the suppose that you have a self-defense. We have a self-adjoint operator which has discrete negative spectrum, so typically a Schroinger operator, and denoted by n minus one h, the number of negative eigenvalues continued with multiplicity. So for Schroinger operator on Rn, this is a correspond to the number of bond states, which is why physicists are tested in this. And the semi-classical batch flows were stated for a closed Riemannian. Closed the Riemannian manifold. So, and that's, I think, the first appearance I know of. So, I mean, maybe a semi-classical voice loop for Klivian domain as well as for Klivian space. But I think the first appearance of the result on a manifold is from a paper of Colonel Levantier from the 70s. And you can also give credit to German to Mark since they got results that imply this result. That implies this result. So, anyway, so what results so far closed grammarian manifold, so m g of dimension n, if you have any continuous function with field values, we can look at Schwinger's semi-classical Schroinger operator, square of delta G of V, where delta G is a Laplacian acidity to the metric gene. So, look at the number of negative eigenvalues. So, you multiply by H. eigenvalue so we multiply by h n is this as an immediate h goes to zero which is given by the integral of the negative part of e to some power so in n over two and that is with respect to the Riemannian motion so we can also consider a fractional Schrodinger parameter we replace delta G by delta G replace H square delta G plus V by H delta 2 Q delta G Q plus V Q, delta G Q possi, and you have a similar flow, where except that here you get different powers. So I would like to work in the general setup of spectral triple. So spectral triple were mentioned in a previous talk, in particular, a talk by Friedrich and So consider spectral tripod HD. So again, A is an algebra of operator. So this algebra, A is in the star algebra opposite as bounded operator on the space H. And D is a self-regulant operator which commutes with the low boundary operator. We assume it is a P-summable, which means that the reservoir is in some weak shattered class, LP infinity. Some weak shuttle class LP infinity. So I'll explain what is, I will recall what is the definition of LP infinity. I started out by Ebar, the sister in Elich. And so we have the result of McDonald's to Cauchy's semi-classical batch flow for a spectral trip, but under several conditions. So the first condition is that we assume that p is greater than 2. Assume that p is greater than two. So, the piece, the degree of similarity, um, uh, it's kind of an error with the notion of dimension. So, if you assume p is greater than two, you somehow exclude uh dimension two and dimension one, dimension one examples. Another condition, which is um it's called H is regularity. So, we acquire the so for spectral triple require the accumulator of parallel D with an amount of A to B. Of D with an amount of A to be bound in. The piece of VRT requires a sample T when it takes the absolute value of T. In addition, they add two variant conditions, namely that for all A in the for every positive element of the closure A bar, if you look at the sister function, trace of AZ absolva of D to the minus D Z require to have like a residue. Like a residue, a simple pull in fact, at actually both is a shortcut to say that you have a simple pool here. And under these conditions, we get a semi-classical vice law, where so for the analog of the software for Schrodinger, semi-classical Schrodinger operator as relative to the spectrotuple, so the h square d square across v. We look at the number of negative eigenvalues, multiply by Hd and let H goes to zero. This is as a limit, which is given by the functional that corresponds to the which gives the goals. So there are several questions. And so there are several questions about this. Is that because of this conditions? Um, conditions. So, the first condition is: can we remove the condition p greater than two and peace regularity? So, in fact, in their paper, the McDonald's, Koch, Janine, they conjecture that it's possible to do it, so the results continue to hold for P utters and record two. And the second question is: if you look at the Tobian conditions, it has more power of actual D, so that's natural in a context of. So that's natural in the context of nuclear geometry, but it also involves power. So, but innovative geometry, you consider, in fact, you consider, you often don't consider a power of A, just consider a function, which is A times absolute D to the minus. So, the first question asked by Kohn in an online talk is: can you relate the Tobian condition of Of magnetized cost learning to more standard tobacco emission. So, in fact, a question, the answers to both questions is yes. And so, to state the main results, I need to, so we can prove the result and get to the microscope by row for p-summar respect for triple, where p is can be any positive number. Number and without assuming any whatsoever. So that has this play role is not necessarily the Turbanian condition, but more like spectral conditions for what was mentioned in the talk of Elik Dabowski. It will consider Dabowski is when you consider the conformal deformation of this square. So look at this square, it's kind of a La Passion of Lack of the whole triple. And sorry, make a conformal deformation by mutating by a positive invertible function. So the operator still has a positive and discrete spectrum. So you can enumerate the eigenvalues. So you can generate the eigenvalues as a non-decreasing sequence. So it's not the eigenvalue, lambda 0, lambda 1, etc. And the condition applies is this spectral condition you require to have, if you like, a value for this operator A D square A. So instance, you want to have a Valo for conformally deformed equations. And the value of And Vilo takes following form. So look at lambda j. So since it's psymable, lambda j will be like a big of j to the one over p. So look at j to the minus one over p, lambda j to the a d square a. And this has a limit. And in fact, a limit requires a limit to take the form tau of x minus p to the minus two, where tau is a given positive number. given positive number in fact in fact uh if you have any limit you can show that the um limit is always if you have any limit for all a like that you can show the limit is or must be of this form so the point is that you have a in singular root a positive linear map a positive linear form on either so if you have that then you get semi-classical value slow so that's what show fraction So, so that's for showing fractional triangular operators. So, you look at h to the two q absolute d to the two q plus v, where v is a self-fragment in the amount of system algebra, so you take negative f and valu, multiplied by hp, and this converts to tau of some power of the negative part of length. Obviously, so I should have Okay, so we also have a very low for, so I will go back to this later. So we also get a very low for German Schringer operator, which operator from absolute d to minus d over qa. Also have a value of d to the minus d over q. Anyway, well, and in fact, I also get an integration formula that is for all a That is for all A in a bar. When you look at autoparato alpha d minus q r2, a epsilon d minus q r 2. This is actually measurable in sense of non-committee geometry. So I'll explain what it is. So it means that you can define the non-premiative integral and the non-premiative integral is equal to for this operator. So German operator is actually up to Is actually a tool. So the coordinator formula gives a formula for this when d is the square root of the Laplace. And in this case, the toe is given by the Riemannian measure of line decision against the Riemannian measure. So I will show the formula later. So you see that this. So you see that this gives an extension of constant dimension formula to a script multiple, and which you have a semi-classical value without any restriction on the degree of similarity or in and without so without any Lipschitz regularity assumptions. So that gives settle the first question. That was the first question. The second question was to relate to the related total condition of Magdonal super shape Zenu to more natural total condition. And furthermore, we also would like to give conditions that going to imply this to have this vice versa. So this is provided by the Tobarian, well, Tobarian. Following is that, so for any, so this work. So, for any uh, so this works with an amount of um attributes. So, a is uh positive, so it means here positive and with effects one and inductability. So, we have a value. So, okay, so we can say this way. So, let's say so if maybe you should go from bottom to top. So, if you have a so you get going to get limit. So you're going to get a limit for j lambda j x d square ax minus q 2 if any of these two any of these three conditions are satisfied. The first condition, rotal condition means that you have some kind of it kernel asymptotics, for it trace asymptotics. So you only need to have a leading term with a reminder term. The second The second, the middle conditions mean that you have a residue for the zeta functions. So, look at the zeta function of the form A times for S X minus P absolute d to the minus Z. And this implies, and the third conditions is when you look at the instead of having a trace of A minus P determined Z, look at trace of P d to z look at trace of h minus z d minus and require to a residue. So this the extent of the residue is basically the terminal condition of m and z and what we show is that so first that it is implied by the this condition and also implied by this condition. So this so this yeah so um right and uh the work is Right, and the work is actually to show that the MSZ condition implies the various law for the conformal definition of the square. So in fact, the fact that the last two, this condition and these conditions imply the condition here is not very difficult. So the most difficult path is to prove the first equity. Now, if you combine this. But now if you combine this theorem with the previous so the okay so I should say that the last two mentioned so last two auto variant conditions are natural conditions for spectral people for instance they appear in framework of the local index formula of Coimbus Michi as well as in a collection and they are actually satisfied in numerous examples. So if you combine the last one So last one, if I comparing this result with the previous result, you get the following collaring. That if you have a short time asymptotic for the retrace, so that is for trace of A e to minus B square, then you have a semi-classical voice loop of action also in your parameter, and you have ratification formula. So the second part is actually known already, so was put by Sukho Chef Denny. This was cool by Super Chef Rennie. So, here we'll cover, if you like, this one or this revolve in a sample. So, let me briefly explain the background. So, which P consists of parameters that are p assumable, that the traits of absolute value of t to the p is finite. And each shit class corresponds to, so the lambda j or to value of t is. So the lambda j axial value of t lambda j so that's the eigenvalues of axial value of t with intensity and listed in non-increasing order and p affinity corresponds to the operator such that lambda j of actually of t is the bigger of j to the minus one over t okay and uh so And so the this so at P infinity is a banner find actually quasi-banner ideal so it's a banner ideal for p greater than one and it's a banner ideal for p quasi-banner for p less than or equal to one and you get this uh sequence of inclusion so i p infinity so you don't really need the definition of my talk but l p infinity this is uh zero this is not uh so lp infinity not this is uh the closure This is the closure of L-Con cooperator L P infinity. And in fact, L P infinity node is steply contained in L P infinity. L P is steply contained in L P infinity nodes and L P infinity is stately contained in Q for Q doors and L P So that's the basics of weak chat and classes. And this swift chat and classes play an important role in underlying for that One for data theoretic approach to using calculus by German Smoenek and Simons and also play important roles in the framework of the countries calculus of currents as well as also in for instance in local index. So spectral triple, so that's what's defined in the Pebble stroke. So I recall the definitions. I mentioned it beginning of the stroke. So spectral triple AHD, so it was space for H is. So H is a space. A is a star initial star sub algebra fonted by boundary operator on H. D is an operator with self-advantage operator with compact reservant bush commute with an element of A mobile bounded operator. And we say that the spectral keeper is piecemeal if the reservoir is in P F T. So the fact that it is piecemeal implies that trace of absolute d to minus Q is fine. Of absolute d to minus q is finite for all q and t. And as I mentioned before, the degree of summarity corresponds to the dimension of the spectral t-pack. So for instance, when you look at the closed hominid manifold, so you have two examples. So the first example, which is only interesting from the point of view of multimeter. Interesting from the point of view of multiplicative geometry, but it is actually interesting for the when you look at similar classical very slow. It consists of the spectral triple associated with square root of the La Passions. So algebra A is algebra of smooth function on M. So Liberal space of spectral functions ok square root of delta G. So that's a spectral triple. So a more interesting spectral triple of course is a GRX spectral triple. Of course, is the Dirac spectral triple with the square root of the La Passion by the Dirac operator. And both spectral triple are n semi-balls. So you see here on this example that the degree of semi-ability corresponds to very much. Right, so okay, so the approach to get the microphone by slow is based on the Diamond Schminger. Diermann Schwinger principle. So, which can be stated as follows. So, again, suppose that H can be stated for, yeah, well, self-agent operator, which are bounded from below, we have a discrete negative spectrum. So, divide by n minus 1h, again, the motion before the number of negative eigenvalues is multiplicity. And if n is a self-adjoint operator, you can You can list its positive and negative eigenvalues. So lambda j plus a, that would be the negative. Okay, so that so lambda j. So if you like, it takes the positive. Well, boom. Okay, so lambda j plus a that would be the positive even value of a lambda j minus of a that would be the negative even values with a conversion that lambda j and plus minus are both That J and plus minus are both on fragment. So if I hope that's clear. And so, or if you like, we take the lambda J plus or minus more formal, more regular definitions to say that lambda J plus of A is actually the eigenvalues of positive part of A, and lambda A minus are the eigenvalues of the negative part of A. So German. So the German Schinger principle can state in an abstract setting for operator on Liege space as follows. Pospose that H0 is positive, a final non-negative, and V self-adjoint operator with a property that requires to be a school form compact. So more precisely, it requires that H watt minus one Rv, H watts minus Minus one Rv Azure minus what Alf is in AP infinity. In this case, you can relate the like you can relate the semi-classical by slow for the for Friger operator still with H0 to a classical visual for a Berman stringer or Berman Schringer operator. So HO minus one al v H O minus one. More precisely, so if you consider the semi-classical abstract semiclassical Schringer operator, h square zero plus v, take this number of negative eigenvalues, multiply by h to the to p. Okay, then the limit as h goes to zero is equal to the limit of j to the lambda j minus of h 0 minus one now. Of h root minus one l v h root minus one l f look in other words uh so here's an equivalent assignment that if you have one limit and the other limit is in other words um semi-classical uh value's law for h square zero presenting is equivalent to a value slow for the negative eigenvalues of h0 to the minus one i v h zero to the minus one okay why it's important why it's interesting is because uh this uh Uh, this uh quantity can be shown that, um, when you look at vice law for comparing collaborators, there is some notion of uh, for now, we look at this limit, uh, this limit, for instance, is environed by uh by perturbations. And it's it's uh yeah, so I mean, because for you can for compact operator, you can apply a French variation of spiral minimax, etc. And so there's actually a whole theory for vice-profit operators as actually established by Germain Schwinnak. So I think. And furthermore, one specialized previous result to La Passion on a Riemannian manifold. So you look at the German Schwinger operator, which is delta G minus Q over 2 F delta G to the minus Q over 2. Detail g to the minus q over two. So that's g again is a Laplacian. F is a real valued functions. F consider the positive and negative eigenvalues of the separator multiplied by j to the q to the n, this has an image, which is given by integral of a positive or negative part of f to some power against the Riemannian measure, and you have to take some power. So if you compare this result, German Sony from the 70s, actually it's a special case of a more general result for Case of a more general result for very slow for probability or eigenvalues of self-padup differential character on closed. Okay, so if you combine the result here of Bjermann Schmungach with the Bjermann-Schringer principles, so from Bjermann-Schringer principle, we know that the limit of Hn n minus H over this Schrödinger operator, fractional Schroinger operator, HQQ. delta jq per z is equal to the limit of j under j minor delta j to the minus q2 f delta j to the minus q2 to the n over q and uh this limit is known by uh your delta german semi mark here and uh so if you apply this result uh you get integral of v minus n to the to q against the human motion so you cover all the semi-core by slow for h to the to q delta v q plus so we can by slow for Q plus so care about so for a functional triangular point. So I'm going to close it again. All right, so now I would like to explain the relationship between the Diamond well between this approach to semi-classical analysis and the context calculus of the context, but as mentioned before, the one goal of nuclear geometry to translate the main tool of NC. Main tool of NCG of sorry, main tool of Hiemannian geometry in the framework of quantum mechanics. That is an translate tool in a birth space setting. So the first two lines, notional compact variable and variable correspond to operators on the space and self-advantage operators, specifically. Notional fintech malariable correspond to compact operator. correspond to compact operator. And now, if you look at compact operators, you can get a notion of order by looking at the decay of order of decay of eigenvalues of absolute values of the parameters. So an epidemic of order of alpha means that lambda j to absolutely of t is we go of j to the minus alpha. So that exactly means that so lambda j absolutely That so lambda j at t is big of j to minus alpha exactly means that t is in lp as an image at a class lp f in t where p is alpha index. And now notional integral corresponds to notion of non-metal integral, just so known as the Dixon trace. So there are different ways to define it. So I will give a short definition, which is equivalent to the fuel definitions. So suppose that the non-precedent. Suppose that the non-pretty anti-bole is defined on amphetismal of order one. You want to vanish on affetismal of higher orders. And you also want to vanish on commutators because the commutator gives correspond to the quantized differential. So in other words, looking for you also want the work to be at the work to be positive. So what you look is for a flag a positive trace on the weak trace plus L1FT. On the retrospect, so everyone can check. Something going on in the room. Okay, so you can use trace or you can also do it more directly by looking at the so that was mentioned in the talks of Walter. So we look at the, I can consider eigenvalue six. I can consider eigenvalue sequence of t, which means that we arrange the eigenvalues of t in such a way that the take the absolute value, we get a non-resini sequence. So the sequence will not be unique, but it's not going to affect the result here. So since it is an it means that lambda j of t would be like a big of one over Would be like a big o of one over j. So when you take a partial sum of the first n eigenvalues on the actual, this will be a big o of log n. So if you divide by log n, you get something bound. And we get, we say that t is measurable if you actually, not only its sequence here is bounding, but it's actually isolated. And this limit is called the non-pretty particle of t. So it can be shown that the measurable characters have defined Measurable characters, as defined in the previous box, form a vector space which is variant by conjugation by invertible characters. And the map sent T to its non-continuous interval is a linear map which vanishes on a computer, actually you can show the computer or triangle, and also vanishes on a fixed mode operator or for the meters. So, a parent interaction formula states that the non-functional integral allows us to recover the Riemannian measure. So, consider our closed Riemannian manifold, let delta G be the Laplacians, and let mu G be the Riemannian measure. So, as mentioned before, C infinity M L two M square root of delta G is a spectral triples. And you have a results of Kan from the L T's. From the LTs, states that for every smooth function, if you look at the tasit minus n over 4, f, the tasit minus n over 4, this is a measurable operator, and its non-committee integral is equal to the integral of f against the Riemannian. Okay, so you show that, as mentioned before, we show that the non-committee integrals allow us to cover the Riemannian mesh. All right, so what's the relationship? So what's the relationship with Valislow? Sorry to interrupt. You have five minutes. Please plus questions because I see 8-19 and you have 43 slides. So just to let you know. Is it talk 40 minutes or 45 minutes? 45 minutes includes questions. So it's 40 plus 5. Apart from the 2020. I don't know your timer. According to my timer, you have a bit less than five minutes plus questions. Five minutes plus questions. No, I have 10 minutes. Well, no, you don't have 10 minutes. Anyway, continue and then we will see. We're not good. If we debate now, then the 10 minutes will disappear. No, sorry, I started timer at 45. Okay, can you please continue? No, I was not planning on covering all the slides. So, okay, so if A is self-adjoint, is near one infinity, so you mean the lambda J of zero A is a bigger J. lambda j of zero a is the go j to minus one, not by lambda j plus or minus the positive or negative eigenvalue of a. So it happens that you have a value slow for the positive or negative eigenvalues, namely if the limit of j lambda j plus or minus of a exists, both exist, then can be shown age multi variable, hence non-committee variable is equal to the difference of the limit. But now if you go back to the result of Jermansoniac I mentioned before, if f is a smooth functions, smooth functions. Then the limit we saw that limit of you have vice law for German finger up German finger operator minus Q over four F detached minus Q over four. Okay so the limit is okay is equal to some power of positive only get square to F and so for Q then you get a limit for lambda j For lambda j for j lambda j theta jx minus n over four f detail j minus n over four so this is equal to the in this case we get an integral of f okay and uh by the previous slide you know that this is equal to the normal integral of delta g minus f of rho f delta g minus n of rh so this is for quality functions and by the idea you get result for all functions so this allows us to recover a constant event formula from the vice log Formula from the Weisslow for compact operator. So, the bottom line I want to mention here is that Weisslow for compact operator yields a semi-classical Weisslov, that is the German Schringer principle, as well as a stronger form of connotation formula, because not only you get at your can compute the logic at all, we actually have a limit for the positive and negative eigenvalue. So, that's the result, main result. So, just to explain. So, just to explain how we get the main result. So, first, what you get, so first we established a voice law for the Vanish Finger operator. So, that's going to apply a semi-classical Weiss law for semi-classical, that's going to apply a semi-classical slow. And it's also going to apply an expression from. So, we have this. So, if you combine with Obama and SRM, we get that if you have a semi-short time. You have a short time asymptotic for the trace of the heat single move, then you have a simple by slow, and you have anti-show and formula. So, for Riemannian manifold, the trace for the short time asymptotic for the eat semigroup is well known since the late 40s due to result of Inak Shi, Sonderan, and Kede. Very easy to prove a classical by slow. So if you combine the results of Minak Schiff and Davand Kell with our result, we recover the semi-classical by slow. So you get, you see that the recovery semi-classical by slow, which has proved in the 60s and 70s, from result from the focus. So we also get, so we are dealing with framework towards talks. We also get a semi-classical vice-look. Forget the semi-classical vice loop for the normative torus. So, this was actually a conjecture by Ed McDonald's and myself. That is, for any Q positive, for all separate amount of the smooth negative torus, 0.5 cannot be smooth by the continuous negative torrents, we have a semicolon by slow for fractures, qq, the type q protein. So, that's for q equals 1 and greater than. So let's prove for 3 equals 1 and greater than or equal to 3 by my denial of shape than consequence of the result. But we have approached analysis allowed to get a simple score by slow from nonplative torus. So if you take the square root of Laplacian or noncreative torus, you get spectral temples. And it's takes forward to get when you take the Laplacian, a flat Laplacian, it's takes forward to get short time asymptotic for the it symbol. The it single okay, it's a consequence of question formula. So leading terms given by two of A, two is a standard trace and the negative to us. So as a result, the conjecture with egg magnet is actually a seven. All right, so I stop here. Thank you for your attention. Thank you. Any questions? Yeah, I have one comment either for us. This is my student. Can you hear me? Yeah. Yeah. So some of the better estimates classically were found using wave trace totics rather than heat rays. Wave trace are more powerful. Yeah, I guess so. So I think now it's time to apply wave trace to these non-commutative models rather than heat trace. than heat trace this is kind of wild idea but it might be it might give us better i mean i'm pretty sure will give us better results i mean classically it has been so i mean yeah i agree but i mean as you know i mean they come closely related to geodesics i mean the support of the wave trace in for homogeneous spaces is on geodesics and as a distribution its support is on lengths of geodesics and this sort of thing. Lengths of geodesics and this sort of thing. So we may see some non-commutative geodesics even in this case. Yeah, it's very interesting. Yeah, yeah. This is, yeah. But I mean, the interest of the German Schringer principle like this is that the extension of the result to, for instance, LP potential. So I didn't mention this at all in the yeah. But in this case, you don't really get better asymptotics. Some critiques, I think, yeah, but yeah, I mean, yeah, we've traced it overall. Yeah, is there any other question or comment from people either here in the room or via Zoom? I have some simple questions. It's Ludwig. Can I? Yes, please go ahead. Yeah, briefly though. Very briefly, Rafael. So just to understand that this is the same thing, same conformal transformation. Same conformal transformation. So, if D transforms by this dressing, then D square should have some conformal factor between the two operators. It doesn't matter in your computations. No, well. No, actually, that won't matter, but yeah, thanks. I don't think. Okay, another question is about this tau function. Can you Tau, tau function. Can you just so it was a positive function? What is the role of this? I tau, yeah. So this is a positive function. No, okay. If you look at the result, yeah. Positive linear map. I'm a little bit afraid. What is positive linear map, first of all? No, this is something which comes from the data of the split pool triple. From the data of the spectral triple, okay. But if it's linear, then it on negative goes and uh okay, on positive, it's positive. Okay, I understand. Yeah, no, I mean positive on positive amount, yeah. Okay, I mean, yeah, okay. And I mean, so what is this? Yeah, what is this term? What is this role? So you have to fix it from the beginning? No, no, I mean, you can show that you have if you have this, if if your limit exists, then it will be automatic clear of this form. Automatically of this form, so okay. In fact, the reason is because you can then show that you have this equality. So you see that the left, if you look at this equality, the left-hand side is positive and linear. Okay, I see. Okay, thanks. But in general, it it should come from the data, for instance. Should should be a like I mean the Riemannian measure or should be the chemical trace on the magnetic uh toys? Okay, okay, understand. Okay, thanks. Okay, let us thank the speaker and move to the next in-person talk by Paolo Asqueri. Thank you.
