is in algebraic geometry. So this seems to be a pattern with other speakers, but please excuse this public display of my ignorance with respect to the subject matter. I hope to be disabused of some of my naivety over the course of this week, and it's already starting to have an effect. So I've been teaching at an undergraduate institution for long enough that I can't resist the temptation to start at what feels like the beginning to me. And I suppose To me. And I suppose if I consider what mathematical reasoning is, the beginning for me is to consider what reasoning is. And I guess my personal perspective is to start with an Aristotelian model of knowledge acquisition. And in Aristotle's models of knowledge acquisition, there are three parts: analysis, synthesis, and heuristics. So, of course, analysis. So, of course, analysis is taking something big and breaking it into smaller parts that we can understand. Synthesis is creating new knowledge from taking different bits and combining them into something new. And heuristics is a nominalization in English of what in ancient Greek was a verb, the first person singular of which is eureka. So in this model, we learn new stuff by taking something big and making it into small. By taking something big and making it into small pieces, taking small pieces and making them into something big, or moments of spontaneous discovery, which feels a little bit like a Kabba. Sorry, Aristotle, not to criticize you. And I find this interesting because it's similar in some ways, from what I gather, our various models of mathematical reasoning. So, thank you, Shang Tao, for this beautiful introduction. I'm going to go over some of the key points. I'm going to go over some of the key points that were mentioned this morning already. So it seems like many classical approaches to characterizing mathematical reasoning include induction, deduction, abduction. And it seems as though a step past that, due to the work of Stacey and others, is split along lines of generalizing, specializing, conjecturing, and convincing. Also, as Sean Carl told us, a much more Also, as Chantal told us in much more detail this morning. And again, to point to this paper of Shinan and Kieran, they further break things into structures and processes. And process is, I think, something that Terry talked about when he gave a working definition of mathematical reasoning as things that mathematicians do. So that to me is a process. So, that to me is a process. And these authors attempt to dig into that a little bit and talk about classifying, generalizing, proving, and exemplifying. They also talk about a discursive nature of mathematical reasoning, which is something I'll talk about maybe in a little bit. Okay, so we're moving from Aristotle with similarities, I would say, similarities from these ancient models of knowledge. These ancient models of knowledge and acquisition. And from somebody who's not an expert in this field, I think, how can I get to know this subject? And I bring techniques from disciplinary mathematics research. And here are a couple big ideas I would say that I've learned from studying algebraic geometry over the years. One is that if I want to study something, I need to study how it relates to other things. What am I What am I unto myself? What is the number three? Is Raphael had us pondering, and Terry did as well. If I want to study an object, study maps to or from it, study it in its relations. If you want to know somebody, perhaps see how they relate to other people. So if I want to study mathematical reasoning, perhaps it would be in my interest to study how mathematical reasoning relates to other aspects of the profession. Another key idea is that if I want to study a particular thing, I should try to study all the things. To study an object, study its entire moduli space or a classifying space, study, put them all together in a basket and see how they play. So if I want to study mathematical reasoning again, instead of looking at a particular instance, I should study more broadly how it works in context. So I'm going to attempt to use these types of techniques or this philosophy of Techniques or this philosophy of inquiry to get to know mathematical reasoning. And perhaps, as again, Terry and Raphael mentioned, this is in some ways thinking about the internal structure. So using mathematical reasoning to study the subject of mathematical reasoning. These techniques feel, I don't know what mathematical reasoning is, but these smell like it to me. But these smell like it to me, if they're techniques from disciplinary research and mathematics. So let's see how they go. Let's take it for a test drive. So a first question that comes to mind, these come up in our working groups, is if we have mathematical reasoning, how do we measure it and in whom do we recognize mathematical reasoning? So here's an interesting So here's an interesting example. John Urshel is a professor of mathematics at MIT, so that seems like a mathematician to me. He was formerly a professional football player in the United States, American football, and early in his life, many people recognized his potential for athletics. They saw in him a physically gifted young man and thought, ah, let me encourage you to consider various ways in which you might excel in athletics. In which he might excel in athletics. It turns out he was equally, if not more, in possession of ability in mathematics, but that wasn't recognized as much of his dog. So if mathematics, mathematical reasoning is something that we will posit to exist and measure in other people, I hope that whatever we come up with, it would be something that we would recognize in somebody like Professor Urshel as much as others. As others. And so, this is an example. Maybe it's useful to look at something a little bit more broad. Gender inequity and underrepresentation are similar in Canada as they are to the US. So, for example, here are some information that stats Canada about gender equity in mathematics. So, if I think of mathematical reasoning as something which allows one to excel in the profession of mathematics, then I have to grab all. Mathematics, then I have to grapple with the fact that currently, for instance, women are underrepresented in the profession. So that means either we are not doing a good job of equipping those who identify as women with mathematical reasoning, we are not measuring it, or something else is going wrong with our system. So this is something I would like to continue to analyze. What is mathematical reasoning and how is it related? Related to the human activity of math analysis. Okay, so if I want to do that type of analysis, what tools are available to me? The tools from disciplinary mathematics research are not developed for this particular type of analysis. Instead, I look to the world of critical theory. So, this is a subject that was developed specifically for institutional analysis. For institutional analysis. That institution may be the institution of mathematics. What is it that mathematics does? How is mathematics constructed and consumed? This is a social thing. It involves humans. How are humans involved in its construction and its consumption? What's the structure and function of mathematics? And it's important to note that this is divided. And it's important to note that this is divorced from intention. So we may say, ah, we never intended for there to be gender inequity in mathematics, so therefore nothing is wrong. Critical theory might say, well, let's not look at the intention, let's look at the output of this system at all. In some ways, it reminds me of a systems engineering approach to design. Let's look at the entire body and see what the output is. And the tools here are these. Tools here are these types of subjects: intersectional feminism, psychoanalysis, career theory, post-colonial studies, post-structuralism. These are the types of things that one generally grapples with when attempting to use critical theory for institutional analysis. And so, let me give some points of entry. And it's rare that I can use the word sophomore literally, but I think that if one But I think that if one was a second year undergraduate in, say, urban geography or feminism and gender studies, these authors would already be read around that time. So this is very much, I would say, an entry point. So I apologize to Kelly and other experts in the room that are experts in this subject. This is my attempt to give an overview for an entryway into the subject. So these are people that. So, these are people that are not thinking specifically about mathematics, but there are, of course, many scholars that do use critical theory and critical pedagogy in mathematics. And these are some authors whose work I would like to highlight. So Freire is not related to mathematics per se, but in critical education theory. And then Frankenstein and Barton and Nicole Joseph, and so on. These are people that think about mathematics education in general. So let's talk in a little bit more detail. One of the authors I mentioned was Ben Yameen, and he was known for a really broad amount of scholarship, really compelling life story. He was being pursued by the Nazis for being Jewish and gay, and before he could be caught, he killed himself. But his body was. But his body of work has been extraordinarily influential. One of his most influential pieces is called Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, which has very far-reaching, I think, consequences. I think one related question that would be relevant for us is, what is math or mathematical reasoning in the age of artificial intelligence? So, of course, once upon a time, people thought that great art was realistic depiction. And then, when we started to be able to And then, when we started to be able to mechanically, when drawing a tree exactly like a tree was no longer so important after photography and so forth, this brought up an interesting question. Maybe art is supposed to do more than have a realistic And have a realistic depiction of our surroundings. So, if we can mechanically reproduce things, then what's the point of art? Luckily, art has continued. And the same, I think, questions face us if we end up with a notion of mathematical reasoning that is fairly maybe accessible to computation. What does that mean about What does that mean about mathematical reasoning? What's an element there? And maybe to give another, I think, relevant example for mathematics is Judith Butler. I'll tie this into mathematics, I swear. So she thinks, they think, significantly about gender and sexuality studies. Sexuality studies. Probably their most noted work is gender trouble from the 90s, and if there's a key phrase that I think is popularly known, it's probably the performative nature of gender. So let's, excuse me for this segue, but let's talk about sex for just a moment. I think it's an interesting illustration of mathematical reasoning and one with great social importance. So, sex is generally So, sex is generally assigned by physician examination of genitals at birth. Somebody takes a look and says, ah, we've got male, we've got female, stamp, and go forth. But of course, things are a little bit more complicated. One might say, well, that's a silly way to do it. We could do this by chromosomes, but sex is not determined by chromosomes. For instance, a single individual may be mosaic and have some XX and some XY. Some XX, some XY. A person, of course, may have genitals that differ from the standard sex assignment. This is a distribution as well. And sex is a bimodal distribution. This is something that mathematicians are very well equipped. I think if we were to give a data set for sex but have it named something else to introductory students in data science, they would immediately recognize not a moduli space that consists of two dots. That consists of two dots, but instead, anonymous to goodness bimodal distribution. And so this type of mathematical reasoning has significant social impact. And Butler goes beyond sex, something which is bimodal, to a performative nature of gender. So that asks, I think, a very rich mathematics question, which is, what are the types of genders? What are the types of genders that are out there? What space do they live in? Maybe it's not the Quintic Threefold, something that maybe a Vincent would recognize, but I don't know what it is. If I'm going to talk about gender and imagine a space of genders, is it connected? Is it equidimensional? Is it constant over time? So I think that increased exposure to geometry is in the To geometry is in the service of social justice. I think it's difficult to work towards social justice with inadequate geometric models of the social phenomenon that we are discussing. Yes, my friend, your question is. What does it mean gender to be performed? Oh, thank you. I did not pay him in advance for this question. Let me give you my mathematician's. You, my mathematician's explanation. If I were teaching discrete mathematics and talking about a complete graph of four vertices, maybe a student would present it this way. And maybe they would say, that's the nature of this graph. It's got boxy shoulders and crossed arms. That's the graph that we're talking about. But of course, that is not necessarily a canonical or in any way best for having. Maybe I like looking at the bottom, top down on the tetrahedron. At the bottom, top down on the tetrahedron. So, another way of drawing the same connective graph for bird scoops. So, this is my analogy, that we present genders in ways that are not canonical or necessarily natural, in some sense true. If I lived in a different point of the earth at a different place in time, then being masculine would be depicted in very different ways. So, there isn't one-to-one correspondence between. One-to-one correspondence between sex and gender. In that sense, we are performing as part of our culture. Does that help at all? Okay, I will take a little. Okay, so I want to explore this a little bit further with another application of mathematical reasoning in the service of social justice, and I want to talk about intersectional effects. Intersectional feminism. So here's my upshot of what intersectional feminism is. Individuals may occupy multiple intersecting identities. So this is a basic concept. We all have race, for instance. We all have gender. We have a country of birth, first language, these types of things. And we have those simultaneously. So a basic understanding is that each individual has multiple identity characteristics. But. But there's a higher view of intersectionality, which is that not only do individuals have multiple identities, but there are overarching systems of bias and privilege, and those are fundamentally intersecting. So there's racial bias and gender bias, and those can't be completely separated from each other. They're fundamentally intersecting, and that's at a level of system as opposed to individual identity characteristics. So, I think a quote from Audrey Lorde that sums this up is that in the U.S., racism, sexism, homophobia are inseparable. They're inseparable. So, I think that if this is not something that you've encountered before, it can be, I think, an interesting piece of mental gymnastics to think about statements like ways in which racism and sexism are inseparable. And so there is a And so there is a structure here, and that consists of our social, historical, economic, and political context. And above all of us, there is this structure which some authors would describe as cis-heteronormative white supremacist patriarchy, depending on how you describe these types of social structures. And these things are relevant for us as instructors of. Before going on with the mathematics of this, for instance, if you've ever done like an equity scorecard for one of your classes where you look to see if there are differences in performance along axes of identity, for instance, are students of color performing differently? Are women performing differently? If you do not look specifically also at women of color, then you might miss something. So, intersectional analysis, even at the basic level, can be important for us as instructors. For us as instructors. Okay, so these are, I think, what I would summarize as the upshots of intersectional feminism. Where's the mat? How do I think about this? Well, we've got to do a little bit of topology when I find this out. I honestly think about this as a fiber bundle. So what is a fiber bundle? This is a little bit too technical. Think about a circle and a cylinder living above it. Think about a circle and a cylinder living above it. About a circle and a cylinder living above it. At each point on a circle, I have a line that lives above that point on the circle. I can think of a cylinder as made up as a circle's worth of lines. And these are rich and important in many different sub-disciplines of mathematics. They have many nice properties that maybe I won't get into. But this is a tool to study. But this is a tool to study. If you're interested in a space, look at a bundle that lives above it. And the example I would say to keep in mind is a cylinder living over a circle. So, maybe one, to get one technical piece, above each point on the circle, I could cut out a little strip, and it looks just like a little strip of paper. And in order to specify what type of fiber bundle, I look at how the fibers. At how the fibers map from one to another. I have a line over here, a line over there, and I get a vector bundle if I have a linear space, and I get a complex vector bundle if the map respects the complex structure. And so we can apply a lot more adjectives to these cylinders living over circles. And I think about this model, I think about intersectional feminism as a bundle. So, what is upstairs? Well, it's Well, it's the social structure. And what is downstairs is society with individuals. So, as I look at an open set, as I look at an open set, maybe that's an identity characteristic. And I think even that is interesting. If we think of identity characteristics as closed, then we have dehumanizing conversations about what it means to be on the boundary of some identity characteristic. Identity characteristic. So I think even thinking about things like race, gender, and sex as an open condition is already somewhat powerful in its implications. So I have open intervals around points, intersecting identities, but upstairs, there is a structure to this fiber bundle, which is our social structure, as discussed before: legal, cultural, historic, economic. And the idea is that that structure. The idea is that that structure, the same structure, is above all points. All points have the same social structure. Of course, they don't impact us the same. That's somehow the entry point to this subject area. So even though we have multiple intersecting aspects of identity, the structure is preserved. So I hope. So, I hope that this is an example that might help folks that are interested in mathematics have a mathematical model for intersectional feminism and think about ways in which structures persevere even across individuals who may differ in their identity characteristics. Okay, so that was an example, and I want to now think about. And I want to now think about a little bit more specifically critical education theory. Here are two authors that I think are foundational in the subject, Freire and Bell Hooks. And they have, I think, rather beautiful and striking hypotheses for what the business of education is. So, first is a desire to replace the banking model of education. Banking model of education. So, the banking model of education is that our students are empty vessels waiting to be filled with content. Or, like a bank account, they are there to have deposits, and then we routinely check their balances with exams to see how much they've been able to absorb. So, instead of the banking model, Freire and those that follow him think about knowledge as something which does not live outside of individual. Knowledge is something which is. Knowledge is something which is co-created between individuals. Your understanding of calculus is probably different than my understanding of calculus. And there isn't something that's not in either of our brains. This knowledge is in each individual, and the business of education is to co-create knowledge together. And this, I think, ties in with one of the articles that was in our homework from Arneson and Rowe that talked about. That talked about an effort to change the locus of power in the classroom. So instead of the instructor making deposits and students, if rather we are collections of individuals co-creating knowledge, there's a specific shift from the locus of control from the instructor to the class. In fact, I think it also compares well with this notion of co-magnetism. With this notion of co-magnitive, which came up in the Janat and et al. paper. Again, this was a part of the framework that they used. This is community cognition, I think, is their portmanteau. And this is similar to Freire's co-creation of knowledge, and that which comes from critical education. And importantly, this is not seen, education is not seen as something which is neutral or should be neutral. The idea is that in all societies there are imbalances. Some are privileged and some are biased against. Education should be liberatory and transgressive. So, this gives a potential why of mathematical reasoning. Why would I be interested in studying? Why would I be interested in studying this? Can it be used in a way which is, does it help somebody in their struggle for greater personal freedom or societal freedom? Is this something which is potentially transgressive against biased systems? So, there's then a world of scholarship that takes critical education theory and brings it into mathematics. I listed some authors before, and to talk about Listed some authors before, and to talk about one in more detail. Here's Kumashiro. And his anti-oppressive education theory starts with the hypothesis that mathematics education, despite our best intentions, is currently biased towards some and privileges others. And that remaining neutral in such a system just reinforces the status quo. So if you're happy with gender inequity and underrepresentation, then keep doing what we're doing. But if we want to have an anti-oppressive framework, To have an anti-oppressive framework, then we better think about how to change things up. And mathematics education, in this Kumishira, challenges us to think, should specifically work against systems of oppression, not neutral, not divorced from intention, very intentional. So, how do I think about this? Okay, I'm trying to put these pieces together. Here's an example of how I theorize mathematics. Of how I theorize mathematics from my disciplinary research. One might start studying curves, and then you're led into higher-dimensional spaces, and then you get into these notions of moduli space, and depending on what your interests are, you might be interested in any one of these subjects. Tyke Mueller, by the way, was an avid Nazi. He got some of his colleagues exact in big trouble for daring to be Jewish and teaching mathematics. Teaching mathematics, people have different conventions. Some people are like, no, don't mention Type Mueller's name. My personal convention is to always mention Type Mueller, but also mention that he was not. So there are all many worlds, and depending on one's perspective, some people might think, oh, this is all part of the world of inordinate geometry. Or maybe somebody else would say, oh, no, really, this is really coming from neurosymmetry. Okay, so I bring that up. Okay, so I bring that up. Here's a model of theorizing mathematics again: entry points into critical education theory. I would say that many of us start with the notion of fairness. We would not want to have an assessment which is unfair, certainly. And usually a next step after that is equality. I want our students demand equality, they should be treated equally. But treating everyone equally is giving everybody a pair of size 10 shoes or Set size 10 shoes, or asking everyone to take the stairs, the quality seems really not in line with fair. We need to move towards equity. And then, when we're thinking about equity in mathematics education, there are many different ways in which we may go depending on our interests. Critical race theory, rehumanizing mathematics, queer theory, anti-oppressive education theories, and then thinking about how all these things piece together, some may say, ah, I really view this as under. Really, I view this as under the umbrella of critical education theory. Or others with a different perspective may look at the work of Rochelle Gutierrez in Mathématiche, which is such a beautiful subject and such a beautiful framework. It's related to some things that have already come up at this conference. So, this, from Rochelle Gutierrez, this framework of mathematische challenges us to include indigenous knowledges in our. In our framing of mathematics. And related to things that Raphael discussed earlier, we are asked to consider learning mathematics from other people, including non-human people. So they may be bees or other insects, or maybe even rocks and water. And I think it's very interesting to consider the amount of mathematics that we can learn. That we can learn from things that may be considered non-living or considered living. And to think about, you know, from one perspective, oh, this is silly, you know, certainly rocks aren't alive. Well, even the question of what is alive is very challenging from a biological perspective. And if I think about the impact on the world from people who do not think of the world itself as a living being, it seems like there is potential. It seems like there's potentially a significant amount of wisdom in this type of frame. Anyway, so there's lots of different ways of thinking about equity and equity-related things in mathematics education. And so one of them here, critical race theory, let's talk about two of them, CRT and queer theory. And critical race theory started in the legal world. In the legal world, there were questions about equity, legally speaking, and it was eventually brought into the world of mathematics education by a few different authors. Danny Martin and Andrico Gutstein are both at the University of Illinois in Chicago. Gutierrez, who I mentioned earlier, is at UIUC. There's a concentration of math education in that region. And if there's And if there's one notion I think is worth studying in critical education theory for me, this was revelatory. So from Danny Martin, here's a definition of a white institutional space, and I think it's so important I'm just going to read it with you. White institutional spaces are characterized by A, a numerical domination by whites and the exclusion of people of color from positions of power in institutional contexts, B, the development of Texts, B, the development of a white frame that organizes the logic of the institution basically. C, the historical construction of curricular models based on the thinking of white elites. And crucially, then D, the assertion of knowledge production is neutral, impartial, and unconnected to power relations. And when I first read that, I thought, ah, this really captures what I experienced in my disciplinary training in mathematics. I saw. I saw numerical domination by whites, development of a frame that felt very white to me, the construction of curricular models that clearly came from white folks, but all the time, all the time, a claim that this had nothing to do with race or gender or anything else. These are universal, maybe even biological aspects of humanity that lead towards mathematics. So, when I think about this in the context of mathematical reasoning, I I get nervous and I keep my fingers crossed that I shouldn't be. But what I would not want is for mathematical reasoning, for new definitions of MR to reinforce these types of white institutional spaces. There are scary worlds out there, like the science of math education and pseudo-scientific attempts to explain the best. To explain the best ways to teach mathematics, that specifically do not take into account aspects of identity, that say let the chips fall where they may. If there aren't many women in mathematics, it may be because there aren't many women that are either good enough or interested enough in mathematics. And it's scary to see pseudoscientific work attempting to push in that direction. I don't yet think that mathematical reasoning would be used for that, but I would hope that it wouldn't be something where I would say, ah, look. Something where I would say, ah, look, who has mathematical reasoning? Looks like a lot of white men do. And then at the end of the day, say, oh, but of course, this is not something that is related to aspects of identity. And I think that that is not something that happens by accident. So, if we don't want that to be the future of mathematical reasoning as a sub-discipline in mathematics education, then I think it takes action. Education, then I think it takes active will of scholars such as yourselves to push things in the right direction. Left to their own devices, scary things may happen. Okay, so that's a brief word on CRT, and maybe to say a quick word about queer theory. So, this was born, I think, in the 1990s, and it challenges different aspects of heteronormativity. So, we might ask ourselves, So, we might ask ourselves: how do cis how do normative assumptions impact mathematics policies and practices? And here's one really, I think, interesting example from Eve Kasovki Sedgwick. So, Sedgwick has this notion of reparative reading. And it's interesting to think about what happens when a paper crosses our desk. We're asked to review a paper, or what we might imagine when we submit papers. The way that this The way that this is described is in hermeneutics of suspicion. So we think, I'm sure I can find where the author went wrong. I'm sure I can find a way to display to the author of this paper that I'm reviewing that I am more intelligent than someone met. We regard things suspiciously, generally. Maintaining a critical distance. So I'm not going to think about how I personally am involved. To think about how I personally am involved, we want to outsmart others, refusing to be surprised. There's a caricature in mathematics classes of people nodding through proofs that they don't understand. And Sedgwick asks us to math value that. And one goal is reparative reading, which is imagine if instead of these, we read in ways that were restorative to the author. So when I read a paper, I didn't So when I read a paper, I didn't come back to them outsmarting them. I came back to them in ways that repaired their sense of self-worth. That I didn't read this with suspicion. That doesn't mean I'm not looking to do a good job or whatever that means or looking for potential errors, but it's not in a gotcha sense. It's that, oh, I understand the research program that you're working for. It could be improved potentially in the following ways. It asks for a cultural shift. For a cultural shift in the way that we interact with each other in the written work, I think it's very fun to imagine journals that embrace this. And I don't think we're there yet, even with the journal like La Mathematica from the Association for Women in Mathematics in the U.S., I don't think that we've yet achieved a level of reparative reading, even perhaps more progressive journals. Okay, so in conclusion, I'll wrap up here. In conclusion, I think that the world of critical theory is actually interesting, that there are rich problems, and I think it's useful for institutional analysis. I think that the tools of critical theory are well suited. People literally fought and died for the creation of gender and ethnic studies. Gender and ethnic studies departments in North America, we should avail ourselves of these bodies of knowledge that have been developed specifically for the types of problems that we face in mathematics. I think that mathematics and mathematical reasoning can be used to understand and add to the field of critical theory. I wrote a little paper about this fiber bundle stuff, and at least one person told me they read it. So now I can. Told me they read it, so not. And I think in general that it's been underutilized in post-secondary mathematics, so this is my pitch, that I hope that such may be used in our analysis of the future of mathematical reasoning as a discipline study in the future. And since there are now many protests going on, I wanted to leave. I wanted to leave with another protest from March 1979. Intersectional feminism was really started by a group called the Capahit River Collective. And they were a group of black lesbian feminists that put forward, really established these notions of intersectional feminism long before Black Lives Matter was a thing. They were using similar language, predated by decades. And so I just want to acknowledge. And so, I just want to acknowledge the important work that's been done, even in the form of protest, going back decades. So, thank you very much, Austan. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. We have time for questions. Can I ask one personal question? Personal question. Yes. So you thought about this, and I only have my own personal experience. So when I told my father, the time we would study, and in Europe we would go to math major, that was like the first day of you sign up for your major. And he told me, Me, I don't see much prospect there. You might be poor all your life. But I said, That's what I want to do. I don't want to do anything. He did not manipulate me, he did not pressure me, just let me go be poorly. And so with this society kind of putting pressure on whole groups of people to direct them in different Of people to direct them in different ways. From my personal experience, I have a problem with that. Because I've been so happy in this, what I've chosen, father put more pressure on me, you know, unhappy engineer. What's your take on that? Because you thought I think a takeaway is not. Is not that we should be prescriptive in the future studies of individuals based on their aspects of identity. Rather, we should focus ourselves on removing obstructions to academic success. So positing the existence of obstacles that are there currently. So if there really were some world where there were no obstructions to academic success based on identity, then we let chips find. Then we let chips fall where they may, but I think that we are so far from such a universe that we need to focus our attention on removing barriers. Does that make sense? I just, somehow there is, I'm afraid of manipulation. That's what I'm I I don't want somebody I don't want some future me to be manipulated not to do now. Be manipulated, not to do that because there is no life, there is no future. Because like being a lawyer, might be math or a doctor. For me, this makes engaging with critical theory makes me more excited about mathematics, even in disciplinary. So when I think of, and especially in the classroom, I'm already at this elite private school in the U.S. At this elite private school in the U.S. And when I think about having a job which is to enrich the already enriched, I lose enthusiasm. But when I think that I can play some small part in removing a barrier to mathematics for people, that's something which is excitement to me. So my excitement for mathematics comes from its relationship to other people. And so this is something which actually personally encourages me in mathematics rather than. Encourages me in mathematics rather than discourages me. Thank you. So I've got, I don't know, what I think is a hard question, or at least it's a hard question for me because I have never solved. One of the, I guess, things as relates to what you're talking about is the problem we are all asked to consider, which is, you know, decolonization and indigenization of our courses and our teaching, which is something that I. And which is which is something that I support. But we often are grappling with trying to figure out how to do this while at the same time reconciling the expectations of teaching, let's say, one course in this sequence, fulfilling prerequisites, needing to make sure that certain material is taught. And my worry, and I think I've mentioned this at past few years, is that I just tried to kind of choose a little bit of material because I said, oh, look, this has some indigenous angle on it. I'm going to put it in here because now it's. On it, and I'm going to put it in here because now as I look, I put an indigenous meaning in my course, but this ends up just being tokenism. You know, and I wonder, like, how do I indigenize my courses while covering the content and not tokenizing? And the best answer I've come up with is to just make sure that the indigenous students in the classes have a chance to succeed. I can indigenize half by killing people, perhaps, but I don't know. I also don't have a good strategy. I also don't have good strategies for how to reach that balance. Thank you for this really important question. I have no answers there either, unfortunately, no silver bullet. I think a lot of what I can do in that regard is move out of the way. So I don't think that I should be the one theorizing about what a decolonial mathematics future looks like. And I think that to the extent that I can move out of the way and raise the voices, as you said. Way and raise the voices, as you said, of indigenous mathematicians. That's something that I would do and listen to them and take their advice and try and move forward in an inclusive way. And I think that you also point Moose to a larger question that I think frequently comes up in discussions of equity in mathematics, which is there's a perceived tension between content and discussions of any other aspects of the proposal. Of any other aspects of the profession. And I perceive that as well. And I unfortunately don't have any silver bullets there either, although there is a lot of literature on the subject. I think from what I've studied over the years, as much as I've learned, from what I can tell, even though there's a tremendous amount of research. Though there's a tremendous amount of research and many different paradigms, it seems like instructors who have sufficient content knowledge and actually care about the students in the room as people, that's what it takes. So just caring about your students, whether you employ a flipped classroom or a student-centered inquiry-based model, whether you employ strategy. Whether you employ strategies coming from ethnomathematics, I think all of these are important, but I think at the end of the day, caring about your students, if we do as humans and we have sufficient content knowledge, I think that that already goes a very long way. Thank you. So I would like actually to add something to the actually to add something to your presentation. Maybe to Sean. On one of your slides you mentioned the name D'Ambrosia. Yes. But you didn't give a so if you don't mind me saying something. Please do such an important scholar. So the name is Viratan Diambrosio. He was a math educator from Brazil. Math educator from Brazil. And in 1985, he published an important, brilliant game-changing article about atomathematics. And the Kevinian relationship with this is that at that point of time, he was visiting Canada and he published this in for the learning of mathematics. So, Sean, if you want me to send you that reference, if you want to look for that. So, if you want to hope for that, that is a good read that maybe. But Ambrosio spent his life actually promoting this idea about data mathematics and but also adjusting it in a way, I suppose. One of the examples that he used uh later in this paper. Leaders, this is his paper from 2006, was how colonist colonizers imposed the time measuring to the civilization wherever they're back. And he used that as an example how time measuring, and one of these important components of any culture, was completely Was completely dismissed because of the time of the way how people in what he called Mediterranean measure the time. So if you have a chance, look up for Berata and Diegros. Thank you so much for highlighting that important scholarship. I think it relates to, as Rafael was telling us, sometimes the historical dismissal of non-Western non-Western and global southern individuals in terms of the mid-development. Visuals in terms of the mathematics related to the work of Rochelle Catieres as well. And it reminds me of a paper, I'm forgetting the author now, and it's called Western Mathematics, The Secret Weapon of Cultural Materials, where the author there also discusses similar ways of using mathematical concepts that are culturally imperializing in their spread. Yeah, thank you. A quick comment and a question. The comment, if you have all those names and you said good things and bad things about bosses, because of the topic, maybe it would be relevant to mention that we should age sexually with boys 6 to 13 in Tunisia, paying them because the sexual issue is part of paying women with men. And that was part of the show for calls. Of the show from Cole's life scholar work. And my question is: the model that you presented, is that meant to be tested, or is it, say, when you run regression analysis or linear or logic or whatever, you kind of test whether the model is actually fit in the data or something. Oh, you mean bimodal sex distribution? No, no, no, I meant the the uh the uh oh this fiber bubble the the fiber bubble that you had you had a model oh the fiber bubble right so this is that meant to be tested or is it typical i would say purely conceptual a total metaphorical metaphor yeah i thought in the same way that we say oh are you to the left or the right which seems like an oversimplified asinine way of viewing political spectrum where the we aside grades Were the we assign grades in these discrete boxes, whereas mathematical learning, knowledge, reasoning, absorption, growth seems like something which is not canonically well-ordered, linear, equidimensional, certainly not a discrete set. But we engage in that type of analysis as well. So, this is, I think, a conceptual model that hopefully will help us understand social. So, in order to understand into saying, which is relevant, I in Set which is relevant. In what way, let's say, conceptually now, would that be better than, let's say, a multiple regression model, in which you've got something and then explained by many other things, contributions of weights, something like that. What way that metaphor this would be better metaphor than the other. So luckily, our universe is so interesting and there's so many people that we have lots of ways of understanding the port of that one. Understanding important for that one. And I certainly wouldn't want to engage in a who's better than who. If it's useful, then it will be used. And if not, then people will have other conceptualizations that would become more useful. But I wouldn't want to engage in a quantitative analysis of how awesome. Yeah, I just actually wanted to offer something for that because something I think about when I see a model like this, which is something I think I think about a lot, is there's something that I can hold on to there. When I see these diagrams, I can envision an object and I can see things. So there's some kind of spatial imaginary happening here that you're offering, but I think I don't see in a linear regression as much. So even with how this is interesting or applicable, one thing is that you can see it, you can hold on to it. And I think that's a really interesting way to use. Really interesting. We use mathematics that we don't usually see in, I don't know, like a marketable work. Really interesting way to introduce it to folks. Here's a different model that isn't a graph, right? That isn't a Venn diagram. That isn't just a dot here and a dot here. So I really appreciate that. Yes? Uh after doing all this study, has any changed any of your instructional practices developed any Instructional practices, developed any new instructional practices? I would say significantly. I think that these inform my practices. I have all of the usual human limitations. I teach sections of multi-part courses and there are prerequisites and so forth. But yes, so maybe to give one example is that it's changed the way that I teach my discipline. Change the way that I teach my disciplinary subspecialty, which is algebraic geometry. So this course is notoriously prerequisite-heavy and scary and not usually taught at the undergraduate level. And I have taught the course in seminar format, like a humanities seminar. I've taught the course where the students usually do as much talking as I do. We took time, as you were saying, Sean, we took a As you were saying, Sean, we took half of a week this semester out of our course to look at the human side of algebraic geometry. For instance, as Terry was mentioning, we're in this beautiful time to study mathematics. In previous courses that I had taught, the students might know some properties of algebraic variety, but they wouldn't know, for instance, who is studying. So I gave them questions like: find three historical. Find three historically celebrated algebraic geometers, find three currently working algebraic geometers, and see if you can describe why they are known, what their work is known for. And those types of questions were very challenging for students. They had a hard time googling around and finding any working algebraic geometers and figuring out which ones are kind of well known in the subject and what they're known for. And we further then talked about. And so that is something which is perhaps standard. Okay, so well, thank you, everyone, and thank you again, David. So I think we now have half an hour for the coffee break, which is to go back in our working group and do something. So let's go to the working group. So let's start. Let's go and do it. I know there's two. I just I don't think so. I just thought I should have seen stuff with the thing. So I'm not sure how many times we didn't look at it very much. So the things that you think are reasoning, but is assumptions. So be critical about the assumptions that you make. But you seem not to be defined. So I think not a lot of questions. And not allow us to question the assumption that there shouldn't be because that's misogynistic about this. And the question is whether this technology of mathematics or it's a project. But you should That's what I did too. But after the video, I discussed more recreate the discussion about how to be positions of wealth and power certainly more than everything. Then you see this. Inequities that we see in that mechanics. It's not the case that there are, like, for instance, in biology, or in general, but if we look at positions of CEOs of large companies, big tech companies, and so that would be. It is a correlation and not causation, but I think it doesn't take great powers of observation to say, okay, there are all the positions of wealth and power, and we seem to have white men over-occupying positions of wealth and power. Some white men. Yes. Somewhat white men. No, no, I mean, there are lots of them, but some, because many white men in jails, suffering, all kinds of things. So this is talking about white men in jail. I'm talking about quite many generalizations, operationalization. So there are names there. If you all think that whiteness doesn't exist because there is no nuance understanding, then you lose a really important part how the world is almost immediate in a separate conditional plan. Of course. And I don't want to be called a colonizer because no that's. No, no, yeah, then you need to make one. This is, I think, what I think is one mouse or some other mouse. This has nothing to do with you as an individual whatsoever. You could exist or not, or have other identity characteristics. It's nothing to do with the way that our society is mainly structured. It's structured to teleport. Of course, there are holes. Of course, there are people in colorful links. But it cannot be a coincidence. When you look at your distribution of wealth and power, this is not a coincidence. I think it's stretches the limits of the conceptual that. That are similar to computer science and engineering and all these other professions that are switching together. And so the idea is that we take ourselves that we should work. There are various structural variables why is it the case that 50% of undergraduate vaccinations are. So at the HP level, very important. And then at the level that's got anything to do with anything else, there seems to be a structure in the transition states where there's a drop-down. And so I think why this is the case. And so no longer anything to disturb. Because that's the way the struggles and the challenges need to talk about. So I think there's a lot of using questions and maybe when I walk in the middle of the forest, don't look like I'd like to put on the white person, but I might be able to better understand. Yes, yes, it does make sense. It's just see it's kind of it's very broad. And I mean I like the model pilot button, but I just don't know how well it's not. But the other possible structure is a little dangerous because I don't mean it's a vision to know. No, but even what is the structure of So, what is the structure of the evidence type? What do you call it? Yeah, I don't know if I'm going to be able to do it. That's a lot of good chances. All of your mouth is not a total. Total three. So we have to mass that. So, are we talking now? So we have to. Where are we on? Yes. We are actually at 5 minus 5 volts. Oh, yeah, yeah. Here we are. We're talking. We're talking. It's half an hour and then a half volt. Oh, can it be nice? They just having a nap here. I'm just waiting. I'm just waiting for everyone. Sorry, that was so much. Can we not move chairs to this night? I think they are restored to have a computer look at a Google level. But you can like looking up our Google Docs. Judge metrics work judge you so yeah we can assemble elsewhere if you want to where do you want to assemble okay uh then just because we just need to arrange for this We're still figuring things out. We have a report to give today. A progress report? Is that what we're doing today? Yes. I think so. Do we still have two more reports? We are coffee break and then we're back, right? Yeah. Yes. So we can still kind of throw things around, but at one point we'll have to create some kind of And we'll create some kind of focus. So, hi, Victor, we are going to be in a slightly different configuration. Patrick, you sent this to us somehow, yeah? There's a you need the note? In an email? Yeah. No, he sent a link yesterday. So it's the same link. I see it, it's just your name wasn't first. I couldn't see it. Couldn't you see it? But now I see it. Doesn't mean that everyone needs to sit next to me. Well, then just if we're gonna do this, it's gonna be closed if we're just spread out. Hi, Victor. So we will start in about, I guess, two, three minutes. But we are only until about 22 minutes, and then we have a coffee break, and then we'll come back. Patrick, it's so nice to be late.
