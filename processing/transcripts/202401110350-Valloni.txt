Okay, welcome back. This afternoon's next speaker is Dominico Valoni, who's going to tell us about reduction mode P of the NASA problem. Thank you, Martin, for the introduction. Thank you for the invitation. I'm having a lot of fruitful fun. And I'm going to talk about this work with Ambrosi. Okay. So, I will do like an introduction at the beginning about another problem: what is known and what it's important. It's a very classical problem in modern mathematics. And then I will explain our idea, result, and I will try to do the proof at least of one part of the theorem. So, the setup is: I take K, a field, I take a finite group G into some P G L. Into some pgl n k and then I define x as the quotient of dnk divided by g it's a normal variety over k and the question of node ami around 1915 is whether or not is x a rational variety. So it means that X is birational to P and K. And the motivation of Noder to ask this question was the inverse Galois problem because if k is a number field, A number field, and if x is rational, then you get a g covering over k, and then you can use Hilbert reducibility to obtain many Galois extension of K with Galois group G. Well, there were some results contemporary to the question. There was a theorem of Fisher roughly the same time. Roughly the same time, which says that if g is abelian of exponent e and if mu e is in k then x is rational. And to and the first counter example, the another problem came in nineteen sixty nine, so quite a long uh time. So, quite a long time, and it was given by Swan using classic theory that if g is z47 and k is q, then x cannot be rational. So, this already shows you that the problem is sensible to the field because by the term above, if I enlarge. By the theorem above, if I enlarge k and I added the 47th primitive root of unity, I obtain rationality. So there was some arithmetic obstruction. And just a remark for the sake of the inverse Gala problem, one does not need x to be rational, one just needs the x to satisfy the Hilbert property. And I think it's a question of could tell whether every unirational variety satisfies the Hilbert property. And I think DiMayo's first paper, you told me yesterday, showed that some unirational variety satisfies. Show that the summary rational variety satisfy the property, so it's uh, yeah, for the inverse problem, you need something less than rational, but equally difficult to prove. And another remark that gives us some flexibility is that, well, you see, once a fix, if g and k are fixed, the geometry of x still depends on the representation that you choose. The representation that you choose, but not that much because you can see that if g is another representation on pgl and prime k yielding another quotient x prime, and it's kind of easy to show that, then x and x prime are stably birational over k, which means that there exists a and b. There exists a and b integers such that x times pa k is birational to x prime times pbk. And also for the sake of the Hilbert property, stably rational is enough. So one can ask whether or not, so the question of whether or not x is stably rational depends only. On A and G. Okay, so it's really, yeah. And to obtain the first geometric counter examples of an algebraic closed field of characteristic zero, we have to wait for Saltman 1984, which constructed there exists a p-group. G such that ENC, the complex number divided by G, it's not stably rational. Satman paper is quite involved to read, but then later was simplified by Bogomolov, which also gave a formal. I mean, I will explain later. But the way Satman proved this. The ways Atman prove this is, well, he proved that the unramified Braber group of this quotient is not zero. You can think of the unramified Braber group as the Braber group of a resolution of the singularity of this, which I would write just simply like field on top. It's a resolution. And well, the Bravo group, we know that it's a stably borrowational environment. That it's a stably borrational invariant. So this is non-zero. Sorry. Oh, each prime, maybe not even, but each prime produces a group. It's not about the prime. Once you have a prime, you can do a construction. Maybe not two, though. I don't remember. But for each prime, you can find a group which is constructed through extension of cyclic. Yeah, it's constructed through multiple extensions, but the procedure works for every prime. Okay, and a remark, maybe I put it here, is that in this case it's a unirational variety, so the Braver group is a unirational variety and it's dominated from by Pian with a mouse. By the end, with a map of degree of power of P, so this group is actually equal to H3 M over C. So I can use singular commodity, and then I take the P infinity torsion or the P primary part. And Bogomora, I was saying before, simplify Satan arguments and give actually an explicit formula for this group, which depends on. Implicit formula for this group, which depends only on G. And yes. So the main fact that started our work is that the opposite of this is true in positive characteristic. So if the characteristic of K is P, then G is a P group. And G is a pre-group, then x is always rational. And the proof, I leave it as an exercise, but use only the fact that in this case, G, it always can be always thought as a subgroup of upper triangular matrices, plus one does an induction on. On n. N is the same n in PG in Pn. So you see P groups here is always rational quotient mode in characteristic positive and not necessarily zero characteristic. And the construction that we want to study is what happens over DVR because what one can do, I choose R. I choose R, a complete evaluation ring of mixed characteristic 0 MP. And then I choose G in P, G, L, and R. And I want it such that the reduction map to, oh, sorry, maybe I should add some more notation. More notation, and we put f the fraction field and small k the residue field. And I'm also assuming that f is algebraically closed. So also k is algebraically closed. And then we can choose a representation of g faithful in pg ln r such that the reduction map is still injective. It's injective, and then we can do the quotient directly over R. No, so I can do curly X E N R divided by G. Now you have to choose the representation. If you choose the representation carefully, you also have that the special fiber of this scheme over R is equal to the quotient for the induced action. This is, for instance, true. Action. This is, for instance, true when you have, when you choose, you can choose the permutation representation on the variables. This is true. Otherwise, you have to check that certain homology groups vanish, but you can assume this because we are free to choose the representation as we want in order to study rationality into characteristic zero. F is algebraically close, but then also K is algebraically close. No? No, it's not a D V R, it's a complete evaluation ring, yes. Complete value sharing, yes. Yes, so we can assume this, and then the question that we wanted to answer or that we wanted to study, I denote it by star, and it is can we? Can we, when or can we make X over R smooth? Or for instance, this means can we solve the singularities of curliex relatively to R. To R. If you try to do some blobs, you get messy, very, very, I mean, also, even quotient singularity characteristic zero over field are difficult. You don't have a recipe to resolve them. But okay, yeah. I think also concerned to this question, I think there is a paper of Alexei and Lasda recently where they study similar problem where you take the question of an abelian surface over the mixed over the mixed characteristics zero and two. Of mixed characteristics zero and two, and then you want to study a camera construction. Then, in this case, you can understand by blow-ups, and you can resolve singularities or not, and you get something which has the same flavor to what I'm going to explain now. And why this question, why we are interested in this question, because while I write it, quote, a conjecture says that that uh in characteristic zero, this is rational. This is rational. I quote it because I don't believe it, but it's the direction we want to go. It's rational if and only if there exists Y over R smooth projective. It's rational, and G is always a P group, but from now on, G will always be a P group. So moot projective such that the special function. The special generic fiber is borrowed to the quotient and the special fiber is rational. This is the conjecture. Yes, simply rational, rational, yes, yes, one of yes. So, we want that this, there is a resolution of this, and then a smooth projective model with reduced rational variety. So, remark about this is that this is there exists YR in general, smooth projective, such that the special fiber is stably irrational, but stably irrational. They be irrational, but the special fiber is rational. We constructed the example thanks to the suggestion of Colliotelen, and you can use us and shink example and then reduce mod P. So this question is not empty. And another remark is that the implication rational implies this is obvious because It's obvious because, well, you can take Y to be simply P and R itself. And the idea was that instead of studying rationality in characteristic zero, you can maybe perhaps for some reason it would be easier to study whether or not one can resolve the singularities of this relationality. One can resolve the singularities of this relatively two r okay. Now I can state the main theorem, which is I said it as follow. So if y over R, so always the same notation, it's moot projective such that the special fiber is rational. Such that the special fiber is rational, then you have this vanishing in adult cohomology now of the special of the generic fiber. There is no torsion in the terdital cohomology of the generic fiber. So, in particular questions. Question Dark has a negative answer for G as found by Sastman or later Bogomorrow for G as found by Sastman or Bogomorrow. So this is kind of or Bogomoro. So, this is kind of some support for this conjecture on if and only if. And so, this conjecture I said that I don't believe, but there is some conjecture that I might believe more, and I'm gonna write it here, is that if you have this mood projective model, if you have such a y, it's not only the vanishing of this torsion, but it's actually the vanishing of all the higher ramified comology group you should have. So, in the state here, the Here, the conjecture is that if f y smooth projective areas such that the special fiber is rational, then it might be true that all the higher non-ramified homology group of the generic fiber with torsion coefficients, I mean, I'm over algebraically close fields of inputs, Z divided by P, those are C, those are zero. So, this I kind of believe that this can be true, although even if you Even if you so two is the Brower Tree is already very complicated, and there is a paper of Pere when he studies the non-romified homology of H3. It doesn't get the full answer, but you get a big part of it up to torsion, I think. But we weren't able to say something or hire the Gloramified Commodore group. Okay. Okay. Okay. So this is the setup. And now I'm going to say something about the proof. If I can find, yes. So the proof we use, we check as a black box some recent results of Batmore Schultz. Results and then thanks to them, we need to prove some concrete statements, and that's what I'm going to explain. Yeah, proof. Okay, we use Batmaro Schultz, which says the following: again, y over R, always the same notations, mood projective, R evaluation ring with a Evaluation ring with algebraically closed fraction field. Then the dimension of K. I do H3 now because it's what I'm interested for, but it works in every degree. So this is the crystalline homology of the special fiber. This is a finitely generated module over the ring of bit vectors of K. This is the P-torsion, it's a K-vector field. P torsion is a k vector field, so I can talk about dimension. Since that this dimension dominates bigger than the dimension over fp of the torsion, I put et al y of the special of the generic fiber, zp p torsion. So, in our case, thanks to this, the only thing that we need to prove, what do we need? What do we need? We need that in this situation. No, we need that if char, if k is a field of positive characteristic algebraically closed, and if x over k is multiprojective, projective plus irrational plus rational, then we want that this as distortion-free. It's torsion free. This is torsion free. There is no torsion in the tachomology. There is no browser, so we are done. So this is what we want to prove, and that's what we will prove in the paper. Yes, remarks about this statement? Okay, if you have resolution of singularities, it's like if you have weak. Of singularities is like if you have weak factorization in positive characteristic, it's easy to show that this is torsion-free because it's easy to see that the torsion here is a stable by rush and if you multiply by Pn, you just use CUNET and then you get that the torsion does not depend on stability. And then if you have weak factorization and if you have X and X prime brush on to each other and you can connect them by a chain of blow-up on the smooth center, and you know all crystalline homology changes once once. Crystalline homology changes once once you blow up a smooth center, it will be like in characteristic zero: the third crystalline homology plus the first crystalline homology of what you blow up, and that's a due to the module of the smooth variety torsion free. So, the torsion will be automatically escaped by rational invariant. So, if we had resolution of singularities, this would be proved and another. And another, but we don't. And another problem in proving such a statement is that, okay, this is an integral statement. The crystalline homology is a bulk homology theory once you tensor with f with the function field of w of the with vectors. But we need to talk about torsion, so we need to work integrally. And integrally, this is not well behaved for open variety. So if x is not projective proper, this group. These groups are not well-behaved. What does it mean? Well-behaved means that the torsion might be not finitely generated. So we have to prove the statement without leaving the smooth projective word. And I will show you, I will reduce the statement to two substatements, and I will show you the proof of one. And I will show you the proof of one of the two. Something more I want to say? No. Okay, so the statement that we're going to prove is the following. As before, K algebraically close philoposic characteristic X over K is mood projective such that the following holds. So I have H i 0. So I have h i zero, the odd numbers, because h you don't have odd symmetry, but yeah, the zero for i equal one, two, three. And then the brow of x is zero. Then the statement is that h3 is torsion free. Yeah, so this is stable by the So, this is stabilization invariant. It's Artog's lemma. Those are global I-forms. This is a recent result of ruling and Chatstimation that this is also stable Barrashi invariant. It's not obvious. This is a Barrashi invariant. So this condition of stable Barushan invariants are therefore in particular satisfied by rational varieties. So you get the main theorem, that theorem. The main theorem, the theorem from this. But you only need rationalities are more general than being just being rational. And yes. Okay, so now I can start to do the proof. I mean, actually, it would be better if we were able to. It would be better if we were able to show that the the torsion the t the torsion in the third crystalline comologic group were a stable Brush and invariant, but we are not we weren't able to do this. The only thing that we can would prove is this vanishing here. But again, I stress the fact that if we add resolution of singularities, then the torsion here is a stably by rational invariant. So, proof already written proof now. So, the first thing to understand the torsion is that you have what is called the universal coefficient theorem, which is an exact sequence that describes the torsion as follows. Start the second crystalline homology group, mod P, so tensor F P. This will inject into the second DRAM homology group of X. Homology group of X and the co-kernel is exactly the torsion of H3. Okay, this is true for every degree and n plus one and um sorry what ah uh look, Ah, look Ilusi. Ilusi, yes, yes, yes. I think with also with the drama with convex, the proof of this is easier than, but I think also Bertolot gives the proof directly on the crystalline side without using the, but it's more elegant with the language complex in the in the language. Yeah, we yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Um okay, okay, so now from this now I write a diagram, so a tensor with the width vectors, then a tensor K. I have two cycle class map the Ramen crystalline, this goes to H2. This goes to h2. This goes to h2, the RAM, and then here I have surjection into this part here mod V. And then here, this injection due to this here. Okay, so we want to prove two statements. First is one that this is an isomorphism. That this is an isomorphism and two. We want that the dimension of this, I mean, those are two independent statements, so we prove that the dimension of this SK vector space is greater or equal than the dimension of H2, the RAM. Clearly, if one holds, then you have to. Clearly, if one holds, then you have to have equality here. And then if this is an isomorphism, then these two things are isomorphic. Then, since it's injective and you have this inequality of dimension, they're equal, and then you have this equality here, and then you finish the proof. So, the proof of one, we use a lot of obilusi-derambit complex, but we use short exact sequences. Yeah, short excite sequences. This, the proof of one, what I want to say is that it uses a lot of crystalline homology. And the proof of two, it doesn't use crystalline homology. And that's the one that I want to show you today. It only uses the study of differential forms in positive characteristics. Yes. So we want dimension radar equal h to the r when h i zero, h zero i equals zero and browser. Brow is zero. Okay, so now I'm going to show you some reductions. Okay, the first thing is that we have a spectral sequence such as the RAM to compute the RAM cohort. So this starts at the first page and converges to the round X over K. X towards k. Now we have this vanishing here, and therefore, due to this vanishing, you get that the set on the RAM group is actually a subgroup of H1 X omega 1x. This is what I was saying before: that these conditions are these two, we know that they are stably rational invariant. This one is a recent result, but this condition was stably, yes, that this is a, I think, four years ago. So we have this, and for our purposes, enough to show that we have this. We have this, right? Because then it is smaller and then we are done. Smaller or equal. Okay, so now also the following that you're gonna see you can find in Illusi. So, okay, so that's what we want to prove. Actually, I want to prove maybe this is better just to write. Better just to write actually equal to yes so now we have to do some reductions. Okay, first I consider this following short sequence of shifts on the flat. On the flat side with the flat topology X, and then I take homology and I see what happens. If I take homology, I get Picard, which is neuron severity due to our vanishings of out numbers. So I get zero, neuron severity of X, mod P H2 mod P P F mu p and then here we get. Peak and then here I would get the torsion of the Brouwer, but the Brower is zero, so I get zero, and then I get an equality of these two. Okay, now we look at this more closely. This is a result of growth index. So you have the map that the map that changed topology from the flat to the et al. To the etal, and it's a result of growth and dick that the following happens. So, first of all, the push forward of mu p is zero because, well, mu p is an infinitesimal shift. So, on the tall top on the tall topology on x, you don't get this is zero, and the result of glutening is that g m Gm is gm and the higher the right functor are zero for p greater than zero because now I want to explain this I want to start to unpack this comology group until I get something that we understand better and it's related to differential forms yeah sorry sorry Yeah, sorry. Sorry, yes. For I greater than zero. Okay, okay, okay. So now I do, I do apply the functor, the push forward to this short exact sequence plus this result, and what I get on X. And what I get on x is OX star. So this is on the tall topology elevation by P O X star R1 mu p zero and therefore this tells me that on and therefore this tells me that O X star divided by O  star to the P is isomorphic as a shield. The p is isomorphic as a shift to the first derived functor of the push forward or the change of topology. Now I take a tar cohomology of this and I get h1 etal x this is equal to h1 x eta l1 star mu p But then we have, so what is this? We use Luray spectral sequence for the map epsilon. So we have the spectral sequence at the second page, HP etcetera are Q new P converging to H P plus Q F. P plus Q F P P S X mu p and then we use the results of growth indic these vanishings here which once I mean thanks to this vanishing this is actually equal to h2 the thing that we wanted to understand new things no it's a secrets paper of grotend that's how it looks That's how Illusi writes. Yes. I don't know where it is. I didn't read the proof of that actually, but I know this is because this. No, this is because this is because it's this yeah, yeah. I rather give the real explanation for me is that it's an infinitesimal shift when you consider on the tale topic on the type zeros, so you think that's yeah, but maybe it's more intuitive. But yeah, it follows when the result of code and decryptive. Okay, so okay, so now we are yes we arrive to this to this equality. This equality. And now to understand this, we use logarithmic forms. So, what do you do? I want to find the logarithmic forms as a an abelian subshift of all the differential forms. All the differential forms. So, this is not a K linear subsheaf, it's just a billion. And it's generated by DF1, F1, wedge, wedge, DFI, FI, this is our local section, Fi, our local section of OX star. And you take this ambulane shift generated by this local section. So and in case I equal one, you have an exact extrajection from OX by definition d log and the kernel turns out to be exactly the free power at least one axis regular. At least when x is regular. So you have this short exhaust sequence in degree one. And therefore, what you get is that as sheaves, the one that we want to compute is actually isomorphic to the sheaves or logarithmic forms. So now you see we're getting from flat cohomology, we did a lot of reduction and we arrived at something that looks like differential forms. Looks like differential forms, which is still on the aim now, the final aim. So, we are clearly an inclusion, and we want to compare it to homologous show. And we want to compare the two homologies and show that they are equal. We want, to finish the proof, we want that h1x by all the reduction, we want, sorry, we want distance root k equal to h1 x by x. Why? Because I mean, I can take k out and I know that the homology of this by what I said before is the run several remote p. Said before is the run seventh remote P. So, tensor of P, tensor with K, it's exactly the equality that I wanted to prove. So, this is and by this and by that, this is just Nehru Sever tensor K. So, this is the quality that I wanted to begin. Okay, and to compare these two cohomologies, I mean, this was the hardest part for us to do, but the solution is to use the Cartier operator, which I'm going to briefly explain what it is. So I take K as before. I take A over K in algebra. And then one can consider the complex, the RAM complex I A D I African A and so on. And you see the problem with the RAM COMOLG imposing characteristic that you have many forms which are closed, but which are maybe it's not time yet, which are closed, but which are not exact. For instance, you have for the local section. This is the one form which is closed, but which is not exact because the integral would be Fp divided by P. And similarly, you have even worse P to the end. This would be Fp to the N divided by P to the N. End you are per peak to the end, so you don't have all these integrals, so they don't come out. You tend to be huge, and the cartilage operator will it's basically the way to explain and to put order in this situation, which might look very messy otherwise. So, how can I show I wanted to explain it? Okay, I do what do I do? I define. I define we have BI that I, the co-boundaries, the cycles in here and the theorem of Cartier that there exists a unique Unique operator, which is the inverse of the curved operator, which starts from delta A to H i of the RAM complex. And it is uniquely determined by the following properties. You have sends a local section to its pre-power for S then it sends um An exact differential to what I said before it was hard to integrate, impossible to integrate, is a homology class in H1. A and then you want that disrespects the cap product is it unique. This behaves well with respect to localization for the tale topology, so you can globalize its construction to schemes. And if A is regular, then T minus one is an isomorphism. So, for instance, it tells you that if what I said before. It tells you that if what I said before here, that the kernel of the log was the p-power, it follows actually from the Cartier theorem. Because now, for instance, if you try to play around and you play i equals zero, it tells you that a form, since it's an isomorphism, that zero comology is the kernel differential. And this touches that the image of this is exactly the kernel differential. So it tells you that the kernel difference are exactly the p powers. And the way you can think about this also. Think about this also that if you can lift the ring of big vectors in a smooth fashion, then you can think of the inverse cooperator as you do the pullback, and you can also lift the Frobenius away, and it's like pullback of Frobenius divided by P. This is what is going on here, right? If you can lift everything, it's a pullback of the Frobenius by the P map divided by P, but you have. But you have it in general without needing lifts. Okay. And another thing that it's important to notice that this behaves, let's see what happens to logarithmic forms. Well, by the third property, I can bring f out as a p power, and this will be. The F and this will be the commodity class of F minus one df. And I bring F inside, and this is the F mod F. So somehow as maybe apparently later, logarithmic forms are fixed by the Cartier operator. And the way we use it, the way people use it, you can use the You can use the cartuprette, and I will explain to give a filtration of differential form symposic characteristic in the following way. Now, I am assuming that I have already globalized it to X and X is moot projective. And since I is regular, this is an isomorphism, so I can do the inverse. So, what I get in the end, I put already degree one, but I don't need to. But I don't need to. So the question of this is the schissification of this homology. And by the curtain operator is isomorphic to. So you get this weird exact sequence of sheaves on X, on X actually at all. Now, you see, like I get closed forms and the cartilage operator make them not close somehow. Make them not close somehow, and then you can define a filtration. So, B1 is B11, inside B12, inside B13, and so on. And then here I put B1 infinity, which is the union of this. So, we'll define everything in a second. Z1 infinity, Z1N. Z1n Z11, which is the closed form inside omega 1x. So you define this inductively. So for instance, okay, a level one is just the closed form and the exot form. Second level, I want to consider all the closed form that are mapped using the Gartier operator to the closed form. And B1, B2 will be all the closed form which are mapped to the form which are mapped to the using the cartilage operator to the two exact forms so the formula are b one m plus one sorry that one x such that the operator belongs to b one n or and And those are field close forms, such that the forms which are, you have to have to be close in order to apply the curve operator. Those are the closed forms that if I have predicate operator n times, I get exact forms. And these are closed forms. If I predict the operator and times, they remain closed. Because in general, they don't have to be closed because the current operator has in. Operator as image the whole differential forms. And then you define this to be. So, with respect to this filtration, you know that the carto operator has this as kernel, and you can check that it will act like this here. So it will send the B to a smaller index, and it will send the Z to a higher index, okay? We'll kind of separate this. will kind of separate this. And it will send this to itself and this to itself. And the logarithmic forms, where do okay, so for instance, what I explained to you before. So for instance, here we have, okay, close form df. What are the two closed forms? You can take f p minus one df. You can check by definition. If I predict two operator, I get df because the inverse. I get df because the inverse would send you the d theory. We have p n p 2 minus 1 df. So the ones that are more complicated to integrate because you get p to the n that are moved by the cartoon operator until they become exact. I'm not telling you what are here, but I'm telling you that by the formula that we wrote before on logarithmic differentials, you have that log is inside that one infinity because. That one infinity because cartoon operator will leave them invariant. So they will stay close every time apply, they will stay the same and they are closed. They will still remain close every time you apply cartilage operator. And so the theorem that we use Renault by also Ser and Cartier is that you actually have the composition as the closed form are Are there some log tensor k. So I told you that those are always inside here, so also in tensor with k. And the cartoon operator will act nilpotently here. You see, at some point, you reach zero, and here as the identity in higher degree, semi-simply. So now we're almost done. I'm two minutes late, but I'm going to finish. I'm going to finish. So, what we to finish the proof, we want, so remember that we want h1x omega 1x equals to h1x omega log tensor k. And then we prove we need to prove one that this is h1. prove one that this is h1 hexz1 the closed form two two we want to prove that this is h1 hexz1 infinity and three we want to prove that these are actually the same yes so for instance one is easy because we get now which one is easy Which one is easy? I don't remember now. Yes, one is easy. Deplication by P sorry, just D, not the invertible, just function P into B one, because we know that the Z one. The Z ones. We know that the closed form are the B ones. I'm getting confused now. We know that the kernel of the differential are the p powers, and by definition, this one is the image of the differential. And then, if you take homology, thanks to our vanishing assumption, the vanishing our assumption, you get that HI. H i x b 1 x is 0 for i equal 1 and 2 because this vanishing for i equal 1 2 3 so Okay, we get this it's zero I'm doing something wrong no maybe just show you three now yeah I show you three and then I finish and then if you want I can show you the rest And then, if you want, I can show you the rest later with this. Okay, H1. This is by the decomposition before, this is D1 infinity plus H1x1 log tensor k. So to prove the quality tree, we need to show that this is zero. This is zero at the first level, so we want to use. So this is H1X union. H1x union b1n. This is a direct limit. We can bring it outside h1x bn1. So it's enough to show that this is zero for every n. We have it for n equal one. And then you use that. The Cartier operator gives you an isomorphism like this. An isomorphism like this, and then you act by induction. But maybe I want to stop now, and then if you want, I can finish this just literally two lines. Okay, thanks. Thank you. Questions? Yes, yeah. Yes, yes, yes, I used for instance. I know for the brow only, no, sorry, no, the brow, no, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, no, brow group here doesn't play a role anymore.
