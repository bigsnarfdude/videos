Thank you very much. Thank you for including me in this workshop. It's a pleasure to present something that's probably not very directly related to collective dynamics. I'm going to talk about think fumes and jockey dynamics and hopefully we can convince you there are some connections that we can get out of problems at these liters. So this is a joint work with Dr. Tomikowski from the University of. With Dr. Chomikowski from Duke University. This is actually a project that I started when I was a grad student at Duke, and we recently got some new results. So I thought it might be interesting to discuss at this workshop. So we are interested in the dynamics of thin liquid films over some kind of substrate. And if you look at this picture over here, it's basically the dynamics of some one-dimensional droplets, and they would interact with each other. And they would interact with each other, and then some of them are going to die out, and some of them are going to experience this condensation effect. So, there's some non-mass conserving dynamics that I'm going to mention during the talk. So, this whole business started with the formation of droplets in dividing thin fields. So, if you imagine that there are some like viscous fluids on a Like viscous fluids on a hydrophobic substrate, then there are these intermolecular forces or the hydrophobic property of the substrate that's going to promote the formation of droplets. And then starting from an almost uniformly flat layer of liquid, you will start seeing these interfacial instabilities causing the rupture or near-rupture dynamics to form, and then you get these holes. Some of these holes are going to open up. Some of these holes are going to open up and then they eventually would give you interesting pattern formation, the ridges. In the end, you're going to get a system of droplets. And those drop plates are going to interact with each other. So these dynamics are seen in many engineering applications. Unfortunately, they are not so desirable for painting and coating, where you want a uniform layer of the liquid. But then, if you think about the heat. And then, if you think about the heat transfer, so for example, if you want to use these dynamics in the cooling system or some heat mass transfer dynamics, then it's actually a pretty nice feature because the condensation has been shown to be more effective if you are condensing through droplets rather than a uniform film. So, if you can promote the droplets and you condense through the droplets phase, then it's actually going to be more effective. More effective. So, in terms of the challenges in the math community, we wanted to study the interface dynamics and some neural rupture solutions and also like the drop-down dynamics and how they interact with each other. So, in terms of the causing dynamics, this is kind of the long-term behavior of these droplet systems. So, imagine that you've got this hydrophobic substrate with a lot of droplets forming. With a lot of droplets forming on this 2D plane already. And then all these droplets are connected by a thin layer of ultra-thin liquid, so they can actually interact with each other through the fluxes. And then they're going to gradually evolving into a system of fewer but larger ductics. Imagine that you have some kind of cost, so eventually you get a large. You get a large droplet, a single large droplet leaving at the system. So, this dynamics is what we refer to as the coarsening dynamics. And there are some interests in studying what is the rate of the coarsening. If you, let's say, simulate the dynamics of these droplets for a long enough time, how does the number of droplets stay in time? So, the questions that we would like to address today. The questions that we would like to address today is: okay, so what if I do not have the mass conservation? What if my system is actually feeling some weak condensation effects due to the cooling of the substrate? I actually add some mass to my system. So how does these weak non-conservative effects affect the coarsening dynamics that people have studied? And also, if so, like what's gonna change in If so, what's going to change in terms of the course of the rate as the drop-based system evolves? So, let me just give a brief overview of the general lubrication theory that I believe many people here are very familiar with. So, essentially, it's a theory that, let's say, would simulate, would approximate the 2D Stokes equation in the assumption that I am dealing with a Am dealing with an inertialness limit, and I get this thin film approximation where you have the characteristic thickness of the liquid becoming much, much smaller than the characteristic length scale of the domain. So you have a thin layer of liquid. And then with that, you can actually apply the boundary conditions at the liquid-solid substrate and incorporate the dynamic pressure at the free surface. Pressure at the free surface, and then you end up with a classical Reynolds Location equation for the thickness of the liquid, which is the edge for a field. So it's a free surface problem, and when you study these problems, you try to figure out what's going to happen when your free surface evolves in space and in time. So, this is a simplified setting in the one-dimensional case. And then, over here, we get this more. And then over here, we get this mobility function, which is what we use to incorporate the substrate property, or what's happening at the boundary condition. So this is going to incorporate, let's say, the slip or no-slip boundary condition at the liquid solid interface. In general, we just take like H cubed as the mobility function. And then you get this pressure term. This pressure term, this dynamic pressure term, which is what we use to incorporate the important physics that we would like to study in this problem. So in general, this is a dynamic pressure that's going to incorporate the surface section, which is approximated by this linearized curvature of H. So it's just the second-order derivative of the free surface H. And then you can also incorporate the viability of the subscript. Incredibility of the substrate. So, what you saw earlier, like all these hydrophobic properties of the substrate, which promotes the formation of droplets, you can encode that instability into this pie term, which is what we use as the destructive pressure that describes intermolecular forces. So, this type of model has been studied quite often, but if we just want to describe a little bit more the destroying pressure, Destroying pressure. So, this is the first-order parabolic type PVE that you're going to end up with when you incorporate the surface tension term. So, previously, I wrote the equation separately, and you get the mobility, you get the pressure, but then if you put in the surface tension term back in here, you get a fourth-order contribution due to the surface tension. So, the surface tension is going to drive the dynamics that's always going to be there in our application type. There in our application type models. And then this pi term over here, this is the term where you can use to approximate the intermolecular forces. A possible form to use for hydrophilic or hydrophobic material is something like pi roughly given by this A over H cubed, and then you can have different signs for this term. So when you have a positive A with a negative sign over here, then With a nectar sign over here, then you get the wetting behavior. So, this is usually what happens when you get a chocolate that's kind of flattened on the substrate. And if you get a hydrophobic material and you want to use the plus sign over here, then that's the destabilizing destructive pressure that's going to give you a finite contact angle where your jugglery is going to be that. So, that's what we want to study in this setting. So, one issue of So, one issue people figure out when you just use this hydrophobic material kind of disrupting pressure representation is that the model is actually going to develop finite time singularity. So you are not going to be able to get going existence of the solution if you just use this A over HQ. So, this is a very strong instability that's going to cause those finite time. To cause those finite time like self-similar kind of rupture in time. So, as a result, we introduce a balanced so-called conjoining and disjoining effects. So, you can regularize this disjointing pressure a little bit. So, with that, you introduce this epsilon, which is a small parameter that sets up a lower bound on your solution so that your solution is never going to get below this order epsilon thing. Order epsilon thickness of a liquid solution, and then you can actually get global sizes of the solution. So that's a trick that people use in this community. Now, we know that the dividing or the hydrophobic property of these single liquid films can give us droplets and many different complex dynamics, things like this. And we know that it's going to actually promote the heat and heat transfer and the current. And heat transfer and the cooling dynamics. Now, let's move on to some examples that we can see in these kinds of duplication equations. So, the first one is the... Can you actually write down stationary solutions? Yes, we can. So if I'm actually going to talk about that in a bit, but if you look at just like this pressure part, this pi minus HXX, and you set that. Check sets, and you set that thing to be a constant, and there you get a stationary solution, which looks like a jobnet. So that's actually the set of jobnet solutions that we want to study, even in the course main stage. Does the study still have a compact support, or it's like a very, very similar? Very good question. So, technically, we do not really have a compact support because if you look at the balance, like hysterical pressure over here, we know. Like historiotic pressure over here, we know that the solution is going to be of order epsilon when it's away from the droplet region. But then you can still approximate that droplet, although it's not technically complex supported, but you can approximate the core of the droplet using a parabolic shape. So that's some technical thing that we need to deal with when we do asymptotics. Thank you very much for the question. Thank you very much for the question. Any other comments? Thank you. Okay, so this is the kind of finite time singularity you can see if your disruptive pressure is not set up properly. You can actually have the thickness of the liquid getting down to zero in finite time, and you have these structures. So we don't like that, and we don't want that to be part of our system. To be part of our system. But people do use that to model things in some biological system where you have, for example, in human tear film, some people suffer from dry eye syndrome, and that's usually due to the fact that there's a thin layer of tear film in your eye that has these kinds of ruptures. So, this kind of structure can actually be seen in some systems. And then you can also have some on the compressive shaft. On the compressive shock dynamics, this is a recent work we did to model the tiers of droplets. This is our work with Dr. Educ group at UCLA. And we can also have all these droplet dynamics and transient patterns if you get the condensation or evaporation going on. So I would say this is a droplet condensation situation, and this is kind of what happens when you have a thin layer of liquid and it's evaporating. Layer of liquid and it's evaporating. But then, when it starts evaporating, you can actually see some intermediate transient pattern form out of that. Okay, so let's get to the modeling part. Just talk about the problem a little bit more. So, previously, this is our model without the JTRAM. So, the JTRAM is the non-mass conserving flux that we introduced to model the evaporation. To model the evaporation or condensation that we want to include in this volatile film dynamics. And this is a term that incorporates some kind of jump condition at the liquid air interface. And we also need to incorporate a P star, which is a pressure offset that tells you whether or not you are in the cooling regime or you're in the condensation. The condensation or the evaporation regime. And with that, over here you can use this P-star parameter to model either cold substrate or hot substrate. And the assumption was that you get a uniformly set up temperature at the bottom of your substrate relative to the ambient temperature outside of your liquid. Of your liquid. And the other system, TN, gets you, let's say the beta is going to be positive, that's a beta over here, that's a scaling parameter, and the k, which is modeling the jump condition, is also going to be a positive parameter. Some interesting observation is that if you get the run sign of beta, you can actually get self-similar solutions that raptures in time, which is the alpha physical region. So, some connection to the other fourth-order PDE models people have studied. So, in this community, most of the efforts have been spent on the mass conserving regime because you have the nice structure of your droplets and things are easier to control. And even if you have a large system of droplets, you kind of know how the mass will be distributed in the system. But when you get this known mass called You get this non-mass consuming flux, things can get much more complicated, and there are some analytical and modeling efforts that have been devoted to this study. And there are also some connection to like a solid films and mass biology assumption where you have some of the liquids growing up or decaying, and there's some external fields that's causing changes to the dynamics. So, one thing that we So, one thing that we want to highlight here is what's going to happen if your condensation effects is weak. So, if your condensation effects is strong, then intuitively, what's going to happen is you just get a lot of liquid piling up and growing indefinitely in time. So that's what we refer to as the flooding regime. But we want to have some interaction between the non-mass conserving dynamics and these destroyed. And these destruction pressure induce like hydrophobic and droplet dynamics. So we want to tune down the condensation effects so that they are actually at the same scale. So this is why we're looking into this separation of time scales induced by just like weak condensation. So having this J but making that very weak. So this model with the additional non-mass conserving Non-mass conserving flux has some energy and changing mass properties. So, this energy for this, this is a physical system, so we get a distribution of energy very nicely. So, you get the substantial term over here, and also this mu is the destruction potential. If you take the derivative of that, you get the original destruction pressure minus the pressure offset. And for the equilibrium states, this is when things get a little bit trickier. So, previously, as Roma mentioned, we get a very nice set of steady state solutions for the system. That is, when you just set your pressure, that pressure to be a constant, and you can pick pretty much any constant, and you're fine. But then, when you are in the non-mass conserving region with a positive beta, then you also need to. Beta, then you also need to take care of this additional term in the system. So this is the regime when you would only have an equilibrium state when this P is exactly zero. So you have a smaller family of steady states in that region. And in terms of the fluid mass, so previously if you have the beta being zero, the mass is conserved and you are fine. But then if you are incorporating the additional The additional flux term over here is actually not guaranteed to always have a monotonically increasing or decreasing mass. Because this thing actually depends on the local value of this dynamic pressure. And it can be positive or negative locally. And this would capture some interaction between the surface tension and also the disjointing pressure as well as the non-mass conserving dynamics. So let's study this model a little bit and let's start from the simplest kind of case. Let's just have a uniformly spatially uniform constant state for my solution. So let's assume there is no interfacial instability at all. But let's just try to understand how the non-mass constant flux is changing the model. So in this case, the model reduces to a simple OD. To a simple ODE, and you get the uniform steady states that's governed by this simple edge-break equation, where this p-star is that p parameter in the system. Now, depending on which regime you are at, you may get to this super-saturated case, which corresponds to a case when your solution is always going to condense. So, whatever you start with, you're gonna start condensing your droplets from ground up. Drop it from ground up. And then you have the under-saturated case, which is the case when you always have evaporation. So this is the case when, well, there's no double dynamics whatsoever. It's just like a uniform film that's gradually condensing to this only steady state, which is the Hm over here. So we're going to spend our effort talking about this quival case, where you get two equilibrium trivial steady steps. Equilibrium trivial steady state, the HM and the HC. One of them is stable, the other one unstable. But the system is actually unstable because you can either go from HC to this HM solution through evaporation, or you can go through this condensation route and then get to this infinite time flooding situation. So you just get a solution that's You just get a solution that's growing up indefinitely. And then something slightly more interesting would be this single jugglery solution. So since this T star is so important, and I do not want to carry that over too much, so I decided to define this shifted pressure so that I can just talk about: okay, when this P is given by this P star, then I get this. P star, then I get this original P being zero, and I end up with an equilibrium job. So this is a few diagrams showing how this equilibrium solution looks like. So this is the dystronic pressure balance with the pressure, and then you get this P V and P star set up over here. And then if you look at the phase plane of HX versus H, this homoclinic steady state would correspond to this steady state single job. Steady-state single-job solution, which is technically not compactly supported. But as you can see, it's probably not too bad if you want to approximate this thing by a parabolic shape. And then at the two end, the solution is going to approach to this order epsilon flat state. So the next thing we want to do is to actually study the coarsening dynamics. The coarsening dynamics. But the original PDE is too complicated. Even if you do long-time simulation using a PDE, it's not going to help us much. So the first thing we want to do is to actually develop a simplified drop-down dynamic system to investigate what's going to happen when you have this weakly affecting system, like when you have this weak condensation and you have slowly varying droplets that are not too far. Droplets that are not too far away from the equilibrium state. So let's assume that you have a droplet that's right at the center of your finite domain and it's not really at the equilibrium state. So it's actually going to either slowly condense or slowly evaporate. And its dynamics is going to be like defined by what's the initial pressure of this droplet. Initial pressure of this droplet, and also how its flux at the boundary of these droplets are affecting this droplet. So, this P0 is our initial pressure, and then we get these J flux imposed at the boundary. Now, we assume that this sigma is much, much smaller than one constant, so that we can model the weak fluxes. And we can assume the slow evolution of droplets so that the posi-static. Droplets so that the positive soption doesn't get violated. So, with that, we perturb our original solution into this leading water quasi-static droplet with some leading water approximations. So, this big X is going to represent the location of the droplet at the time tau. And at that point, you're going to have a pressure P at the time, which also changes in time tau. Changes in time tel. And then instead of tracing the entire profile of H, you just need to trace the big X and big P. And then over here, this is what the droplet profile is going to satisfy. So this is not exactly a steady state droplet. It's slightly above or below the critical pressure P. That's why you can actually make it grow. That's why you can actually make it grow or decay properly with the flux. And after that, we plug in this answer spectral PDE, and then we have the leading water order beta equation. So we assume that this beta is very small, it's like a big condensation effect. And then we end up with this leading water equation that would capture the dynamics in space and also in pressure of this juncture. Pressure of this junk. And this L, so okay, so over here you get the dx d tau and dp d tau, so those are the targets. And then this term over here accounts for the non-mass conserving flux. And the L0 is a leading water mass conserving operator that incorporates the influence of the mass conservation term, the zero term over here, and also the combination of the strong impression and the Of the stronium pressure and the substantial. So that's from the dynamic pressure. So from that, you can take inner products of this leading order equation with proper functions and you end up with a coupled ODE system for the dPDT and the DXDT. So over here we use the CP and DCF to represent the kind of the mobility of the dynamical system and the J plus and J minus, those are the fluxes. And J minus, those are the fluxes that the droplet is feeling at the edges. And the key thing that we wanted to incorporate for the condensation is this J and C, so that's a non-mass conserving flux that's going to change the dynamics a little bit. Now, the next thing is, how do I know this is an appropriate system? So, in order to make this work, I need to evaluate all those flux terms, mobilities, and the non-mass conservation. And the non-mass conserving flux that I introduced earlier. So, to make that work, we look at the core approximation of the joclet. So, let's assume that I get two big joclets. They are each other's neighbors. And then I get different constant pressure for the joclets. And then each one of them, I'm going to get a parabolic approximation. Parabolic approximation. I'm using two separate parabolas to approximate these droplets. And by looking at the leading order equation, you can actually get the width of the droplets and the height of the droplets and how they are related to the pressure pretty nicely. And the mass fluxes between the droplets are approximated over here near the contact line. So we assume that over here, That over here, the height of the intra-droplet film thickness is roughly hm. So that's the equilibrium, like uniformly, spatially uniform steady state that we described earlier. So that's why I could look at the quasi-static state with the H replaced by this HM, and then you can impose the boundary condition that's coming from the two droplets at the neighbor. The two droplets at the neighbor, and then we can do asymptotics to figure out an approximated form for this pressure P by solving this boundary value problem. So after all those asymptotics and some technical calculations, we end up with a simplified dynamical model for the set of droplets that I'm interested in. So the big takeaway on this page is that Big takeaway on this page is that previously I'm tracing the free liquid surface over time, but now since I am dealing with just the droplet system, and I only need to trace the height or the pressure of the droplets and where they are, so that I can model the interactions between the droplets pretty nicely. So, assuming that we get like K, sorry, we get like N slowly varying droplets, and then Job clips, and then their dynamics are going to be modeled by this DPKDT and DXKDT system. And we have the JR and JL modeling the flux contribution from its right neighbor or left neighbor. And the beta term over here, that's how much condensation or evaporation the droplet is experiencing over time. And so this is like a prototype of what's going to happen if it's like multiple. Like, of them having multiple jugglers. You just need to trace: okay, all these these, these are the separation of the juplets, so how far away they are from each other. And also, like the pressures and the position, and the distances are going to be kind of related to the position. We're just writing it as a separate variable to simplify the derivation. Okay, so so far, things are So far, things are kind of nice. We have a system of droplets that seems to follow my dynamical system. It looks like we're almost done. But the thing is, this system is not going to be valid all the time. There are two big assumptions that we made earlier. The first one is the job fit is always going to be at the quasi-static stage, which is not going to be true if you have a very small job fit. Small jumplet. So if we look at the quasi-static juvenites, if we are somewhere in between the zero and the p max, where p max is a constant that depends on epsilon, then we get a quasi static assumption fairly nicely. But then if we get this pressure approaching to this upper limit, which corresponds to a fairly small droplet, then when that happens, the droplet is going to Happens, the droplet is going to kind of collapse, just like what we show over here. It's not going to maintain that parabolic shape, and all of our analysis that we use to build our dynamic system is going to fail. So this is the first situation for the so-called droplet collapse. So if we get a very small droplet, it's not going to follow my dimensional system. So what we do in practice is that In practice, is that if I see one of the droplets that's going to get too large a pressure or too small a size, then I'm gonna stop the simulation and say, okay, this is the end of the lifetime of this particular droplet. Another situation is, what if I get this D, which is the separation distance of the droplets, getting too small? So if you remember from the previous slides, From the previous slides, the D shows up in the denominator in your right-hand side flux terms. So when D gets to zero, you get a similarity. So you cannot really handle the droplet coalescence when two droplets merge into a big droplet. So that's another situation when you end up with two droplets merging or colliding into each other. And this is another criteria that. Criteria that we need to handle when you use this dynamical system to approximate a real PVE system. Okay, so next I'm going to show a little bit dynamical simulations and discussion of the what's going to happen if we use the proposed droplet dynamical system to simulate these droplets. So the first business is what's going to happen if Business is what's going to happen if I only have one single droplet. So, in that case, I'm going to place my droplet at the center of the domain, and for simplicity, I'm going to always assume like a periodic boundary condition so that I don't need to deal with situations when you have a droplet condensing at the end. And then with that, my original system reduces to listing, which indicates that my droplet is not going to move, so that's easy. And then I will only Easy. And then I will only see the condensation effects through this dPDT equation. So then if you do the PDE simulation of a one single droplet condensing weekly condensation effects, you get these single parabolic shaped droplets growing, growing until it hits the boundary. So when it hits the boundary, then you run out of space and then you start doing these kind of flooding dynamics when things get... Dynamics when things get flat all the way up as H goes to infinity. And we get pretty nice comparison for the PDE versus ODE when we trace the pressure or the mass of this job over time. As you can see, the mass is going to be almost like flat at the initial stage, but then it quickly catches up when the condensation starts making more contradictions over time. Over time. And then this change of scaling was due to the fact that we get this droplet touching the edge of your domain. And then you have this jump in the pressure because your droplet pressure is going to now follow the flat film dynamic for the droplet dynamics. Okay, so now what if I have two droplets? What if I have two droplets? So now things would get a little bit more complicated because it needs to deal with both the position of the droplet and the pressure of the joclet. So we want to study two simplified cases. For the first one, let's look at a case when you have two equally sized jockeys with unequal space and let's see what they're going to do. So this is the simplified dynamical system for this case. Dynamical system for this case when you get those two droplets starting somewhere over here. So the size of these small droplets are the same, but then if you look at the spacing, they are quite close to each other over here, but then on the other end, they have a fairly large spacing. Now, if we look at the delta D, which represents the difference between the inter-droplet spacing, so in this system, we have So, the inner system, we have two different interbeed spaces: the one in between, and the one to the left of this droplet and to the right of this droplet. It's looking at the periodic value condition situation. So, we can actually show that this difference between internal beat spacing is actually always going to decay, which means that the droplets is going to approach this equal spacing situation. So, they're going to gradually move away. To gradually move away from each other and become more equally spaced together with the condensation that they are feeling over here. So, if you look at this figure over here, which traces the position of the droplets, the solid dot over here represents the position of the two droplets. And you can see that the spacing between these two droplets gets wider, and that's approaching to that equal spacing limit. And so we can actually. And so we can actually show that this is a fairly good approximation to the original PVE situation. And another situation is what happens if we have equal spacing droplets but different pressure. So this is a situation when your droplets are not going to move at all, but the pressure can get a lot of pairwise dynamics. Pairwise dynamics, including this pairwise growing, where you get two droplets growing at the same time, or you can get this growing droplet together with this shrinking small droplet. So the big one is actually getting some of the mass through the flux of the ultra-thin film thickness region. And then you can also have this set region where you have all the small droplets dying out eventually. So none of these droplets are going to survive the cost of a dynamics. Survive the coarse A dynamics. So, here are some dynamical system studies understanding how these regimes actually depend on the pairwise pressure. So, there are three phases, like the pairwise going, growing shrinking, and pairwise shrinking over here. And this A region is where your droplets are going to undergo this pairwise growing dynamics, and you also get. Dynamics, and you also get this B region for the growing shrinking, and for the C region, that's when your droplets are both of them are going to die out and shrink to the ultra-thin film thickness. So, we have like different sub-regions between the AB and VC regimes, and they're actually dependent on the collision and collapse conditions that we set earlier to make our system like. System valid global intelligence by including this technicality condition on our end. So another thing that we noticed was that the pairwise condensation effects that we observe in this region A, this region is actually dependent on the domain size. So if you initially had two droplets that are more separated from each other, then it's More separated from each other, then it's going to be more likely to grow for both of them in time. And that's when you see a larger region A, this region A is going to expand when that happens. Okay, so next, let's look at what's going to happen if you have more than two droplets. So let's jump to the case when you have six. Okay, so in this case, I'm not going to worry with like the dynamical system. Going to worry you with the dynamical system. Let's just see what the PVE looks like and how it follows the dynamical system over here. So, two cases. In the first case, you get two droplets that are all growing in time, but then since they are with different pressure, so technically the analysis that we did earlier for the pairwise droplet analysis is not really going to work. But if we look at the comparison of the PDE. Comparison of the PDE versus the dynamical system comparison, the original analysis seems to still work fairly nicely, and you have all these dots going to this critical point, showing that all the drop-downs are going to condense in time. And over here, if you start from studying a different initial condition, then you can get one of the job beds collapse, and that corresponds to these trajectories that go into the B region when one of the jump bits When one of the jumpers would evaporate to the ultra-thing region. Okay, so previously I said that's like a many droplets situation. Now in the business of the coursing dynamics, we want to study a very large system of droplets. So in this case, let's say if I get 10,000 droplets in a system with In the system with equally spaced droplets sitting in a very large domain, and then I pick some uniformly distributed pressure for each of the droplets. And then we want to study what's going to happen if you run these dynamical simulations for a long enough time, how does the number of droplets change in time? And how does the total mass of the droplets change? The total mass of the droplets change in time. So, the first thing is we know that the number of droplets is going to decay because of the coarsening. So, some of the droplets are going to run into each other, some of the droplets are going to collapse. So, this is the result of that N curve where you get the number of droplets decaying in time. So, this is the case when you have a very small beta, very small, very weak condensation. So, initially, So initially, you see this order T to the 2 Neptune 2 fifths dynamics, and that's going to transition into order T to the Neptune 1 half scaling region. And then if you look at the mass, initially you get an order 1 mass, that's not going to change a lot. But then later on, you get this order like T three one half scaling effects for the amount of mass added to your system. Added to your system. And our simulation also indicates that the transition from the first region to the second actually depends on your beta or how strong your evaporation is. So if you get a stronger, slightly stronger condensation effects, say going from 10 to negative 9 to 10 to negative 7, then you're going to see that the transition from the first scaling law to the The first scaling law to the second scaling law would appear slightly earlier. So you see less of a transition or less of a first stage dynamics. And there are some very nice analysis for the mass consuming case in terms of the causing dynamics. So this is what happens when your beta is actually zero. We have nice heuristic scaling arguments. Heuristic scaling arguments that discuss how that T to the nephew has scaling law for the number of droplets actually can be derived from the conservation of mass and also the droplet collapse situation. So the basic idea here is that the coarse moon dynamics, when you have the mass conservation, is actually dominated by the individual droplets collapse. And we assume that the And we assume that the droplet collapses are kind of independent on each other, so that you can get a time scale for that finite time collapse. And as a result, the pressure itself is going to get a finite time blow-up, and then you get a theoretical critical collapse time, which is the Tc over here. In the end, you get a power law causing rate, but N is given by this order T to the negative 2 half. This order T to the negative two-halves is getting off. So this has been derived heuristically by these authors, and then there are also some rigorous analysis for the upper bound of these causal arrays in both 1D and the 2D situation. So I've been mostly talking about the 1D situation, but some of the analysis can also be extended to the two-dimensional situation. We have droplets situated at the a two-dimensional substrate. A two-dimensional subscription. Now, if we look at the regimes that I described earlier, our claim is that in the first stage, it's actually pretty much just what we saw in the mass conserving dynamics. The main reason for that is in a very early stage, the condensation is so weak, and we are not seeing much of an effect on the overall dynamics. On the overall dynamics. So, the original argument that the whole dynamics was governed by the droplet collapses can be translated to this growing and shrinking dynamics that also have been seen over here that can be occur for a wider range of jotted pairs. So, that's the first region. And then, if we move on to the second region, which is the boxed region over. Is the boxed region over here, where you get a modified order t to the negative one-half scaling law? So the situation over here is that now that your droplets are larger and their separate distances are also getting slightly smaller, so the droplets are actually going to start running into each other. So you no longer have the collapse dominating dynamics. In this case, the collision between those droplets are actually Between those droplets are actually dominating the overall dynamics of the droplets. And another constraint we have is this finite domain. So although our domain is extremely large, it's still a finite domain. So when your droplets are getting significantly large, they're going to run out of space eventually. So this is another evidence we get in terms of how the dynamics transition from the collapse dominated to the collision dominated. To the collision dot situation. So, with that, we traced in a simulation how the droplet separation and the peak-to-peak distances of the droplets actually change in time. So this is a plot, it's kind of a complicated plot, but it's a distribution of the peak-to-peak distances and the contact line distances of the droplets. We can see that. Droplets. We can see that in the early stage, the two separation distances are kind of close to each other. That's mainly because the droplets are small. But then in a later stage, your droplets get larger. That indicates that your peak-to-peak distances, the position from one peak to the other, is going to get much larger compared to the distribution for the D, which is the contact line distances over here. Because the droplets are really large. Here, because the droplets are pretty large. And with that, we can actually look at the leading water evolution equation for just the pK and by replacing some of the distances by their averages. So, we only have a very heuristic argument for how this works so far. So, we're assuming that we get one typical droplet with both of its neighboring droplets at the average pressure. At the average pressure, and then its dynamics is going to be determined by how its neighbors are moving. And then we get this evolution equation for this particular pressure droplet with the original D replaced by the harmonic average distance and the average distance of your system of droplets. And then looking at the stage two, we can actually look at how the scaling. Look at how the scalings pop up. For the first case, when you have large, relatively large distances, the leading order gives us the n being roughly order t to the negative 1 half. And then in the later stage, over here, this is the case where you only have a few droplets left. And they are extremely large droplets. So your D is actually getting much smaller than the log of P, which is the contribution from the non-conservative funds. Conservative funds. And the final stage is kind of a boring stage when you're running out of space and you get the flooding situation when you get no droplets at all. So the end is going to be zero in this region. But then the flooding situation shows up similarly to what we saw earlier, where you only have one droplet for the flat lines over here, and that's going to finish up the entire control. Up the entire condensation dynamics in the very late stage. Okay, so as a summary, so we presented a model for lubrication systems with very weak condensation. And the derived simplified droplet dynamical system that we got can be used to trace individual droplets just by its position and the pressures. And the coarsing dynamics shows a transition from a Shows a transition from a collapse-dominated state to a more collision-dominated state. So far, we only have a heuristic argument for why that happened, but it would be nice if you can get more rigorous justification on the costing rate of these droplet systems. And also, there are more realistic two-dimensional situations that I would want to study. We can expand this whole thing to a 2D situation. A 2D situation, the flux is a little bit more complicated. But as we saw earlier in the mass-conserving case, we believe some observations that we saw in this simplified system can also be extended to the 2B cases. Thank you very much. Questions? Look at for the mass conserved case. What can we say? Conserved case, what can we say about the long-time behavior for a general emission data? Because you mentioned that the steady state can be found by setting the flux equal to zero, right? And then is the steady state unique and is this the global? That's a very good question. So the mass concerning case is actually slightly different because you don't have the constraint set up by the non-conservative flux. So if you look at the So if you look at the steady states, you're free to choose this constant P bar, which is going to get you the constant, which is going to get you the steady state droplet profile. But then if you have a large system of droplets, if you only look at individual ones in a finite domain with a constant mass, then yes, it is going to be stable. Going to be stable. However, if you're looking at a large system, it's not guaranteed. So the spatial drift, the changing space, and the size and the mass exchange between the jump bits, that's not guaranteed. But we do know that in the very long time, at the very late stage, there is going to be a tractor that's going to be a huge droplet that accumulates all the mass in the system and that's going to be the only stable state. The only stable state in the system. Thank you. The same question. Can you tell a little bit about 2D situation? So, how similar these other qualitatively new things there is equation the same or the same thing of the question? Yeah, so uh the uh the setup of the equation for the 2D situation is still the same, uh but the uh the trickiest thing would be on The trickiest thing would be on how we model the fluxes and how the droplet collision actually happens. Because I think this is probably also something that we see in particle collisions. In the 2D situation, it's unclear when or how the droplets are going to run into each other very accurately. There are probably some numerical tricks we can play, but I think for the sake of analysis, that's going to be more complicated. Going to be more complicated. So, the analysis that people have done for the 2D situation, it's still, I think, the droplet collapse-dominated case. So, you don't really need to take into consideration how the droplets are running into each other or when or how the collision happens, but you only just look at how one droplet will collapse into the thin ultra-thin film based on how the contribution from the flux is from the. How the contribution from the fluxes from the neighborhood droplets are getting into this, like grabbing the mass from this central droplet. So I believe the collision would be quite difficult to model in a two-beak case. There's some natural loss i stationary states which are disconnected, clusters of carbons to be here. Yeah, it could be that. So the static state situation is the same. The static state situation is the same. So, in a 2D, you can still have these parabolic kind of droplet shapes situated on ultra-thin film. And the interaction between the center droplet and neighbor are still going to be the same. So, I think a lot of analysis can be done. And there are also some analysis on like what's going to happen if you get a different initial configuration, just like what Yara was talking about earlier. What I was talking about earlier. You can actually get some more droplet collision if you start with a very carefully designed initial configuration of the droplets. But then at the end, you would still expect the jumplet collapse to dominate the entire dynamics. Thank you very much.
