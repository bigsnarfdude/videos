Thank you all for having me. And I'm going to do my best here. And so while I was putting this talk together, oh, I should caveat this talk. Also, I have no door on my home office. So it's quite possible that my five-year-old will wander into the talk at some point. But when I was putting this talk together, I was thinking about the work I've done for, say, the last, well, most. For, say, the last, well, most of my career about putting human behavior in epidemiological models. And I was looking at who was going to be here. And I was thinking there's people like Lou who probably don't need to hear the talk, but he's heard, I don't know how many times I've given on this. And or Dave Finoff. So I really wanted to step back and say, what can I learn about modeling human environmental systems from the work I've done on epidemiological modeling and getting human behavior to epi models? So this is going to really. So, this is going to really, this is a talk sort of built on many years of work with lots of contributions from many others. And oddly enough, I think it was actually the same topic of the talk I gave for my job talk when I joined Yale. But I've learned more since then. Okay, so we've all seen this picture. We've seen it a couple times today. And this whole idea of having a human system and Having a human system and a natural system, and they're coupled through some processes. I really dislike this picture. And I think it's odd to start a talk with a picture you dislike, but I really dislike it because it obfuscates what I think is the core challenge of human environmental modeling. And basically, I think the problem is that people, individuals, respond to sort of overall risk in the system, some sort of aggregate level of risk or aggregate level of Aggregate level of risk or aggregate level of feedback. So, in EPI models and infectious disease models, this is infection risk, but aggregate states of the system. And then people's individual behavior gets aggregated up to affect the state of the system. And the problem with this conceptual figure is it obfuscates that, like the real challenge is actually in how do we do the aggregation. And we've already seen some of that today, building off some of the game theory work. It was really one way of approaching the aggregation problem. Aggregation problem. I think when we sit down to start building mathematical models, and again, I think the earlier talks we had today are good examples of this: we tend to start off with some model of the natural system with a state variable x. So we might have a model g of x. And I think one of the important pieces that we don't think, or I didn't historically, when I was starting, think enough about is that this is a, while the model is a function of the state variable x, we often also write it down as. We often also write it down as a function of some parameters that are stable over the dynamical span, over the time that we're interested in for the system. Okay, and then what we've often done to do sort of what I'll call coupled models is we have some human response function, which is also a function usually of just the state of the world and some stable parameters, often simplified to be just a linear or first-order approximation. So that's what this phi is doing here. That's what this phi is doing here. And then we glom it on in some sort of additively separable fashion to that growth function. And that's how we get our system dynamics. And then what we do is we have some sort of net benefits function. Again, often also basically a feedback rule that's a function of the state of the system. And again, some parameters that are assumed to be stable over the time scale that we're considering the system. And often that gets simplified down. And often that gets simplified down again just to a single coefficient multiplied either by the state of the system or by the amount of human action that's actually happening. Okay. So my training was in bioeconomic models, which sort of goes, it's really a special case of this coupled systems modeling. And there, the goal is to make this feedback rule, the F rule here, fundamentally connected to the better. Fundamentally connected to the benefits function to sort of tighten this loop bit down here. Often when we do that, we think about allowing decision makers to be potentially forward-looking, and we do this by summing through time and adding something like a discount rate parameter. But again, that's a time preference parameter. It boils down to a single parameter. Again, something's assumed to be stable over the course of the modeling period that we're considering, the decision period. Considering the decision period. So, what we really have here is a system with a single X and a whole bunch of stable parameters. At the end of the day, the key thing we're doing here is we're introducing some nonlinearities that when we often build these bioeconomic models, it's often through some sort of optimizing behavior. So, right as I was sort of finishing, while I was in graduate school and finishing, there was sort of this big Expansion of the literature led by people like Dave Finoff and John Shearhart and Simon's been involved with this as well, where it was really about building out the ecological realism of the system. So rather than having a single state variable x, we go to a vector of x's that are, so now we have a vector of growth functions and a vector of x's, and maybe we have multiple decisions people are making. And we were interested in how do the interactions among these different In how do the interactions among these different states of the system how does that fundamentally provide new insights? And so I've listed some papers here that I think do a reasonably good job, not just building in complexity to make something more realistic or to add in new wrinkles, but really trying to ask the question: if we add ecological complexity, does it actually fundamentally change our understanding of how people will respond to the system or of the kind of payoffs that will come out? Of payoffs that will come out of this system. But this is not what I want to talk about today. I just wanted to put this out there so I wasn't ignoring it because I want to talk about epidemiological models and infectious disease models, which is sort of the other side of the system. So we'll let X continue to be a vector just for the sake of it. But the reality is what happens when we build these models is we might have some sort of aggregate level of infection risk or something that's describing the state of the system. There's lots of individuals making their own assessments. Lots of individuals making their own assessments about the future, making their own decisions that have to get aggregated up, that only collectively really influence the way the system's changing. And all of these individuals are getting their own sets of benefits out of this system. And maybe there's some other benefits that are sort of social or community level benefits, and maybe those are feeding back into decisions as well. And so we've got to do some aggregation around these benefits as well. And so the crux here are these aggregation functions. Crux here are these aggregation functions. Is how do we think about taking individual behavior and aggregating it up or separating it out? And this is important because it has to do with not just this notion that we have strategic behavior that we capture in games, but the question, the fundamental question here is at what scale do we have a stable parameter set over the course of what we're trying to model? And I think this is the part that we often miss when we. I think this is the part that we often miss when we just dive right into game theory, which I think has some uses, but the challenge is fundamentally what's stable because we can fit really complicated human-coupled models ex post to data with some parameters, but those parameters are meaningless in the sense that we don't know how to change those parameters. And I think epidemiological modeling makes that really clear. We can take this one step further where Where now, not only do we have a bunch of people who are getting a bunch of benefits who might just be acting in a discoordinated fashion, but we could assume that they're all basically the same, they're just not able to cooperate. Now, we actually have people who are fundamentally different and getting different benefits, have different preferences, face different sets of trade-offs going through the same process. And we also have a whole set of policies and institutions that are filtering the constraints or the benefits that people are facing and how we. People are facing, and how we choose those policies and institutions may be a function of this aggregation, but that makes this aggregation fundamentally a normative challenge. And so Josh Abbott and I sort of started addressing this in a paper that we published in Resource and Energy Econ on recreational fishing. And one of the things that comes out of that paper, I mean, there's a lot of interesting things, but I think one of the things that came out of that paper that we should have known before we wrote it, and probably most people hear Wrote it, and probably most people here under know this already. Is that when you basically think of this distribution, the average, if you were to try and find the individual who relates to like, say, the average of all these feedback rules, it's a different individual than the individual who's getting the average level of benefits out of the system. Okay, and that's going to happen as soon as you have any nonlinearities in the system because of Jensen's inequality. Of Jensen's inequality. So that was, and that drives a lot of the results in that paper. But what this means, when we start thinking about infectious disease and how you model adaptive behavior and behavioral responses to things like the COVID-19 pandemic, there's really two places that behavior can contribute to the data generating process that we observe in aggregate. One is through selection, that is, selecting people. That is selecting people in and out of pieces of the system. And we can think of this as extensive margin behavior. And then there's adaptive. And so, in the extensive margin, if we have purely extensive margin, what we have is we have a bunch of individuals who we can model with a single, say, response function that is not necessarily very complicated or really responding to the state of the world, but there's just maybe a linear response function to the state of the world. State of the world, but different groups of people are getting sort of triggered at different times, or we can have one individual who's actually adapting to the state of the world, and we can think of that as intensive margin behavior. And the difference here matters when we start creating policies or using our models to think about policies that are meant to change behavior. And the question is: are we selecting on individuals who we can count on behaving a certain way, or are we fundamentally trying to provide incentives for individuals to change their behavior? Change their behavior. So, this brings me to thinking about infectious disease modeling, which, again, I've been thinking about for quite some time and pretty intensely the last year. Again. And so I'm going to use a really simple model. And I'm not going to say that this is the right model to use for anyone epidemic, but it captures the key pieces. And I think many people on the call are familiar with these SIR models, these compartmental models that are the workhorse of sort of epidemiology. The workhorse of sort of epidemiological modeling. And basically, we have a susceptible group, an infectious group, and I'm going to call this recovered with perfect immunity, unable to transmit pathogen, thinking about lots of current issues while I try and explain this model today, since all this work is suddenly no longer at all just sort of theoretic and academic. So the idea here is that, so we've got some people who can enter, we've got a rate at which people can enter susceptible classes. Got a rate at which people can enter susceptible classes. Everybody can sort of die and leave the model at a certain rate delta per capita rate delta. And then there's basically most of the epidemiological modeling focuses on this function here, this F function, which is a function of all the breakout of your classes of individuals. And really all you're doing is that's the rate at which people move from susceptible to infectious. And then we have these two other functions, which we can think of as a disease-induced. Disease-induced mortality function H and a recovery function G. And the key thing to understand about these, and there's variations on the way this F function gets written, but generally it looks something like this, which is something, some scaling of a susceptible population and an interaction between the susceptible population and the infectious population multiplied by a single coefficient beta. Okay, where n here is just the sum of your three classes. Here is just the sum of your three classes. There's a few variations on it, but they all have the same flavor. Then you go to these other functions, the g and h functions, and again, they're first-order approximations multiplied just by the I class. So we have, so I'm going to call this the beta GH formation. And what's important about the beta GH formation, it is still the workhorse formation. It's actually been used in with some tweaking, but not really fundamental tweaking to the. Not really fundamental tweaking to the formulation here for a lot of the work that's been done around COVID-19 modeling or SARS-CoV-2 modeling. And so why is this a concern? Well, first off, the BGH formation, if these are constant through time, if these are not, if these are the stable parameters of the model, right, and these are what epidemiologists tend to go out and estimate, but if these are meant to be stable, then there's no place for Then there's no place for interesting behavior in this model. This has two important implications. One is we can't use people's revealed preferences to help us evaluate alternative policies or even guide our normative aggregation decisions. Remember, especially when we talk about aggregating benefits, there's some normative layers there that need to be addressed. And we might want to look and see what kinds of decisions people actually make to help guide that. Even if you're not interested in that part, the model can't help evaluate behavioral-based Behavioral-based infectious disease interventions under these assumptions. And so, again, what's happened in the SARS-CoV-2 is a lot of ad hoc adjustments to various parameters, the various beta GH formulation parameters. So, my understanding of what's been done with things like the Imperial College model is we go in and we say, well, a lockdown would reduce beta. So, we'll reduce beta by, let's say, 50%. We'll simulate the model with. Um, we'll simulate the model with a smaller beta, and lo and behold, we get less transmission. Therefore, lockdowns will reduce transmission. And since we have this linear mapping of transmission to death, reducing that'll also reduce deaths. So, by assumption, we've set up a model that says we're gonna, if we lock, if we do a lockdown, we'll reduce cases and deaths. That doesn't mean that a lockdown won't reduce cases and deaths, but it's not at all explaining the mechanism by which it's doing it, which means we can't target it, which means Which means we can't target it, which means we can't deal with a lot of the other issues that emerge around these kinds of policies. Now, I don't want to be totally dismissive of the EPI literature. I think there's been a lot of great work modeling heterogeneity. And this is basically, if you take this SIR model, you can build out compartments for what I'll call at least presumed exogenous attributes like age. Like age, right? And so, presumably, the infectious disease doesn't really affect the age distribution of the population in most of these models. So, you might have like a chronicer product of age by SIR, and you have more compartments. And if you keep doing that enough and you add enough details to that, you get something that kind of looks like an ABM or a network model. But what that winds up doing is it creates this selection process. And everything is about selecting people who don't fundamentally have adaptive behavior in and out of. Have adaptive behavior in and out of different parts of the model. And that, I don't think, is actually that well supported by the data. And so we sort of learned about this and started talking about this for flu-like pathogens in 2011 and some work that came out of the NIMBUS Center that Lou invited us to do. But people like Kramer were talking about this in terms of HIV as early. This in terms of HIV as early as 1996. So, I want to give an example of what I mean by the selection-based empirical approach. And so, here's this paper that I'm not going to go into all the weeds of this paper. I will tell you a little story of this paper because I'm a bit, I don't know, bitter maybe is the right word. So, this is a paper that Jude Baym, Gerardo Chowell, and Nick Kumanoff and I started writing around 2015. And we were kind of fascinated by the fact that if you looked at the Epi modeling, Fascinated by the fact that if you looked at the Epi modeling literature, there are all these papers on school closures. But if you actually look carefully at what they do in most of those papers, the kids just sort of magically vanish from the population and the grown-ups go about their daily lives. And we, so what we decided to do is we decided to connect this to a lot of labor force data and family structure data and try and figure out what actually happened, if you, what happens to kids and what does that mean for an epidemic and what does that mean for labor. And so we wrote up the paper, we started submitting it probably. We wrote the paper, we started submitting it probably around 2016, 2017. And we got these reviews back: this is an interesting model, but it's a completely fantastic scenario that we're going to have an epidemic that's going to shut down schools nationwide. And so, like, why are you guys wasting your time with this? So now the paper is finally going to come out somewhere, and we learned a lot doing it. But what we do in that paper, and to sort of explain the selection-based approach to getting behavior in, is we add a bunch of compartments. So we, the final version. Add a bunch of compartments. So, we, the final version, we add an exposed class. We have a class that kind of looks like a cat, we have a way of sort of hacking our way into a hospital class. You could add sort of other classes. We also split transmission into two types of locations. We split transmission into transmission that happens outside the house and transmission that happens within the house. And people, and we sort of have to allocate shares to different mixing because then we break those compartments up by what we think of as exotic. Those compartments up by what we think of as exogenous sources of heterogeneity, at least exogenous in the model, which are age group, household size, and somewhat embarrassingly, income, right? And so I've put a star by income here because in our model, income is treated as exogenous. And so we look at different household income classes as well. In reality, what the data are now showing us from the coronavirus pandemic is income is endogenous for a lot of people. Income is endogenous for a lot of people to an epidemic. So we wind up calibrating this model using the American Time Use Survey based on some methods that Jude, Nick, and I published in 2015. And then what we do is we basically use all this. So the American Time Use Survey is this diary of what people do minute by minute every day. So we're able to sort of statistically juxtapose people by these different attributes together and develop. Different attributes together and develop a contact matrix. And then what do we do? We go in and basically change the, we go in and edit the diaries and recompute those probabilistic contacts. So that is qualitatively the same thing as arbitrarily changing beta by down to like 50%. Like I'm not going to, there's nothing fancy. It's a data-informed way of doing it. But that, again, all we're doing is we're really selecting on different people, not Different people, not actually, I mean, it's sort of a hacky way of letting people adapt behavior. The other work that we've done has really been thinking about how do people change behavior and developing models of how do people change behavior. The way we do this is we split, we basically, this beta is now something different. We basically factor out a component of beta that's adaptive, and we call this sort of the mixing or contact term. Beta is assumed to not be time. Beta is assumed to not be time-varying over the simulation in our published work. I've got some drafty, noty things that can't seem to get done right now where we think about wearing face masks as a separate factor in here that affects beta. You can also imagine an evolutionary model of virulence of the pathogen affecting beta through time. But what we've done so far is basically factor out this sort of mixing idea. Factor out this sort of mixing idea. And the idea is that people benefit from going out and having social interactions, mixing. They choose how much to contribute to a potential mixing pool to maximize their individual utilities where they get benefits from mixing, but they make a forecast about the risk of becoming infected and ultimately becoming infectious. And in the models, we don't really differentiate between the two. Two. And of course, that means people need a forecast to think about the future costs of taking on a risk today. The idea here is that the parameters of that utility function can be stable, even though the aggregate response function, if you were to fit it to a model, you might not be able to get stable parameters over the course of the epidemic. This provides two benefits. This provides two benefits doing things this way. One is it allows for an internally consistent approach to ranking outcomes. And, you know, where you might have, where there might actually be a wedge between things like cases and deaths. And it provides an internally consistent way to connect transmission and the GNH functions. And so this paper, and I'll talk more about this in a moment, that Jude and I wrote spinning off of the paper I just mentioned. Paper I just mentioned. This was published in March, where we basically show that there could be a connection between transmission and disease-induced mortality through behavior. And I'll talk more about that in a moment. The way these generally work is that in our theory of work, we've specified a utility function where people prefer to be recovered with immunity, think vaccinated. Maybe they weakly prefer that to being susceptible, but nobody wants to be infectious. But nobody wants to be infectious. So, this is actually sort of a really interesting question because it's actually hard in these behavioral epi models to separate infectious and sick. And so, we've always assumed that they go hand in hand, but I think there's a lot that can be done to try and separate these. And then individuals basically solve a dynamic optimization problem out to some period of time conditional on their health class of how many contacts to provide into a mixing function. To provide into a mixing function. Now, when we've done this, what we've done in the past quite often is economists kind of like this idea of rational choice, rational expectations. We've used what we call adaptive expectations, or sometimes we've played with this idea of scientific expectations. And there, what we do is we basically resolve the model every time step. So people solve the model for, say, 100 days or 200 days of an epidemic, but then they use their first. But then they use their first period solution. We plug those into the model. We simulate the model forward one step, and then we resolve the whole model. And again, people now have a new first period best response function, and we plug that in. Of course, what you're going to get is anything. If people respond to risk, it's going to reduce F and you're going to get fewer cases, but this happens voluntarily. And this happens automatically. And so we kind of want to know how does that separate from things like lockdown policies. Policy lockdown policies. So, in our early work, one of the things we did in our 2011 PNAS paper was we basically built a model with this adaptive behavior phenomenon as the data generating mechanism. And then we said, well, and that's this heavy black line. And then we said, well, what happens if you just turn that off, but keep the disease-induced parameter, like all the other EPE parameters are supposed to be stable, and you get a much Be stable, and you get a much worse epidemic. So, what this suggested was that voluntary behavior could substantially, quote unquote, flatten the curve, right? But then what we did is we said, well, can we fit a standard epi model to this? And I think we fit this for like the first 20 days of the data, and it fits quite well. And in a follow-up book chapter, we do a lot more with more sophisticated Epi models. And you can fit this heavy black line with a standard Epi model really easily. Line with a standard epi model really easily, and it looks like you have a stable beta parameter x post, but it's not telling you anything. And then, if you start reefing around with that beta parameter that you fit on the first 20 some odd days, you've already got some behavioral response mixed in, so you don't really know what you're doing. And this is why it's important to think about these aggregation problems, not just because the aggregation is interesting and challenging, but because we need to get down to something that's like a stable parameter. We did a little bit more work in a paper. We did a little bit more work in a paper in the Journal of Health Economics where one of the things that we find, again, is that if people in that model, we assume that people who are recovered with immunity can't transmit the pathogen. And what you find in that model is you actually don't want those people to social distance. That's not socially optimal because they basically run interference for everybody else and they provide someone for susceptible individuals and someone for infectious individuals to make. And someone for infectious individuals to make their contacts with at a higher probability, which lowers infection rates. And so, if you impose a uniform social distancing policy, you can actually do worse than letting everyone sort this out on their own. I'm not saying that's what we should do right now with COVID-19, but it's mathematically possible and it's something we should be thinking about. Again, this sort of targeting here on the actual behaviors, which means you need to get back to parameters, models of actual behavior. So, is all of this myth worth it? So, is all of this mess worth it and everything I've been talking about worth it? And so, what I will say is, in our H1N1 work, we were able to certainly find evidence of voluntary responses to H1N1. And we found that in response to flights. We found that in response to sort of general daily behaviors. We found this in response to Lyme disease. And then COVID-19 happened. And we realized that we needed more sophisticated models than what we were working with. So, this is a paper that was just finally accepted. Just finally accepted in scientific reports. And here, what we were interested in is not only can people stay home, they can wear a face mask. And back in March, early April, a certain person who should know better was like, well, I'm going to the store. And I'm like, you know, we can get that delivered. And he answers, well, I'll wear a mask. And I said, well, okay, this is this sound. And I said, Well, okay, this sounds like the old seatbelt story or the old HIV condom story to me. So we started looking at the data. And we were curious. We can't get good non-self-reported data on mask wearing. We have thought about trying to like do facial recognition stuff off surveillance cameras, but we decided not to go that route. Instead, we just look at when different counties and different states put in public mandates to wear a mask and business mandates to wear a mask. Mask and business mandates to wear a mask. And we look at the amount of time people spend at home. And what you're seeing here in the left-hand panel is basically an event study design where the blue is before the mask mandates go in, 14 days before the mask mandates go in, and the red is 14 days after a mask mandate goes in, sort of harmonized on when the masks go in. Through statistical controls, ideally, the blue should all be zero. Be zero. And what we see in the red is you people spend about 20 minutes less at home as soon as a mask mandate happens. And then we're able to actually look at using the cell phone data where people actually wind up allocating trips in these 20 minutes. And what we see is if you look at general public mandates, there's not a lot of signal one place or the other. But if you look at the business mandates, restaurants are a big culprit. Now, this could be people picking up taking. Um, now this could be people picking up takeout orders, and there's certainly heterogeneity in people that we could parse, but I think we kind of know in the U.S. what that heterogeneity was. Um, but we see other areas where there's very strong signal of people spending more time or at least taking more trips following these mass mandates. And I should say that the dark gray bars here are 95% confidence intervals, and the light gray are the Bonferroni confidence intervals, given that we do this for so many different sites. Given that we do this for so many different sites. So that's what you're looking at there. The other thing we wanted to know was: what about this idea of, well, there's voluntary behavior and there are these lockdown stay-at-home orders? And so if you follow the literature that's come out, which is impossible, but basically what's happened is there is one camp of people who've gone out and looked at, well, people use public transportation less, people stayed home, you know, like all of these things that sort of happened. Know, like all of these things that sort of happened in the very early days of the pandemic, they were seeing similar things to what we were seeing in H1 with N1, that people were already adapting their behavior. And then there's a handful of papers that have all come out in Science and Nature saying, like, it's all lockdown policies, and it attributes all of the behavioral response to these lockdown policies. And these are like saving the world, and that people wouldn't respond voluntarily at all. And so, we wanted to try and understand the interaction of the To try and understand the interaction of the two. So, again, using a smart device data, the SafeCraft smart device data set, what we do is we basically estimate the response, which is this dark blue line, sort of a counterfactual with no stay-at-home orders for counties in the U.S. And then what we do is we're actually able to say, well, okay, so what happens with stay-at-home orders? And I think one of these is the median, one of these is the mean county in the US, which are, they're all, those are gonna be small counties. They're all those are going to be small counties, and then what we want to do is we calculate the horizontal difference of when the face map, the state home order, goes into effect. And we think of this as the equivalent number of cases that people would have needed to be exposed to in their local county to elicit the same behavioral response as they had with their stay-at-home orders. And then we're able to map this across the U.S., taking account of all of the statistical controls and everything else that we throw into these models. Controls and everything else that we throw into these models. And what you can see is that large swaths of the U.S. actually do look like 30, 40 cases, probably what this is a log scale, would have kept, you know, elicited about the same response as stay-at-home orders in, this is like April, April, May. But there are some areas, and they tend to be correlated, though not perfectly with population centers, where the stay-at-home orders, you would have needed a much higher number of cases to get the same level. Higher number of cases to get the same level of response. And just to point that out, it's not everywhere. Like Buffalo, you don't see that. Milwaukee, you don't. I don't think you see that. You don't see that for Chicago, right? I mean, they're still relatively small here in Chicago. So I mean, I think that's interesting. Minneapolis is another one that doesn't like light up bright yellow. And so we thought this was kind of interesting. This has been in review for a very long time. Hopefully, it will be accepted one of these days. Be accepted one of these days. This is the other paper that I wanted to mention. And this is really what got me thinking about connecting transmission, using behavior to connect transmission and mortality. And so, because Jude and I had worked on all of the labor shares and who gets affected by school closures, we knew that the U.S. healthcare labor force just happens. Healthcare labor force just happens to have more like five to 12-year-old kids than sort of the average family. Like they just, or the average, sorry, the average industry. They have people working who have those kids. I mean, it works out that way. And we were curious if you close schools and that could reduce cases. Okay. And so we're still thinking about flu and a lot of flu models because we're writing this in February. And then And then, but you're going to lose your healthcare labor supply, okay, because a bunch of people are going to stay home. And so we figured somebody would have estimated like an elasticity of life saving by healthcare workers, and no one had. So what we decided to do is figure out what would that have to be to sort of flip the scales. And we went to the literature, and what we basically figured out in the literature, based on all the flu modeling, was maybe a school closure reduces cases by about 15%. It turns out that it's, I want to say it's. Turns out that it's, I want to say it's like 16% of healthcare workers have childcare obligations that can't be met by other household members. And we use the current population survey to sort of estimate that. And we were hoping that we would wind up with like a number that was absurd one way or the other. And we didn't. We wound up with a number that kind of seems like it could be credible somewhere in the middle. And what we were hoping was you'd be down here, which is that either we don't avoid any. Either we don't avoid any cases by doing this, and healthcare workers are super efficient at saving lives, which would basically mean you would never want to close schools because you wouldn't want to lose them, the childcare obligations. Or you wind up here, which is that you, by avoiding cases, healthcare workers aren't very good at saving lives. They don't really matter. Only respirators matter. And that was the story that sort of first came out, but I think it's sort of swung the other way now. And so, there, avoiding cases is all you cared about. So, closing schools was good. But I think the reality is we're somewhere in the middle. And what this does is it connects this behavioral response of social distancing and closing schools to the disease-induced mortality. So, the questions that I kind of come away with are: how do we actually deal with heterogeneity? And one of my favorite approaches to this that I haven't seen used very much. So, Josh and I used it. Very much. So, Josh and I used it in that recreational fishing model that I talked about. There's been some more, there's a paper by Zilberman and Hochman from 79 in Econometrica that looks at it. But there is one application to infectious disease modeling by Velov and JMB 2005 using what I've seen called distributed parameters models or microparameters models. And the idea is that basically you Idea is that basically you have a response function and a distribution of your heterogeneity. And so you're basically going to take an expectation over that distribution, but you can truncate it endogenously through functions of the state of the system. And so that allows you to both have a response and a selection process going on simultaneously. But again, this is how you get this insight that like who the average individual, the average response that The average response that the individual that sort of closely corresponds to the average response isn't the individual who closely corresponds to the average benefits. And I think this is something really important for us to be thinking about. Can we better connect sort of this notion of contacts to staying at home or shopping? And Osmogul and others have basically taken some work that kind of looks like our 2013 paper and tried to connect it to consumption. How do you have about four minutes left? About four minutes left. Perfect. Um, targeting key attributes. Um, what if we have different objectives? Do we need to argue over minimizing cases versus minimizing death versus maximizing welfare? How does that play out? When what assumptions do you need to make to flip things? Um, I think how do we connect this to other parameters that aren't truly exogenous, like employment status or income? Uh, I've been thinking a lot about discount rates, and there's some really interesting paper. There's a really interesting paper by Charlie Jones that basically points out that if age influences survival and survival influences private discount rates, the discount rates people use to make their own private decisions, then how do you think about healthcare investments that might actually affect survival? And I think these are really interesting questions to worry about. How do we model expectations? So the main takeaways that I kind of come away with right now is we need to think a lot less about fitting phenomena. About fitting phenomena and a lot more about what parameters are actually stable. We shouldn't be writing down differential equation models just to write down differential equation models, particularly when the processes in those models are aggregations. We need to think about what in there is actually stable that can be fit to data. I think this notion of adaptive behavior and selection can look very similar in aggregate, but perhaps can be separated out with micro-level data. And the data seem to point that adaptive behavior is at least at play, but At least at play, but selection probably is too. And so we need to think about how do we deal with those two different data generating processes that it's not either or when we think about policies or actions meant to direct behavior and people. I think behavior connects a lot of environmental processes. And so we might need models with behavior just to maintain internal consistency across different processes within an ecological or environmental model. Environmental model. I think one of the things that I know that it's, I already know this group doesn't really need to be told this, but I always find myself explaining this, which is that like optimization to an economist or to people working in these systems isn't about finding the best solution often. It's about just having a way of modeling trade-offs because that's what happens when you solve an optimization problem. And I think we need to focus more on how individuals are aggregated and focus less on aggregated patterns. And this is really about science-enabled questions. Science-enabled questions, often not scientific questions, especially when we're talking about aggregating benefits or aggregating payouts. So that's that's I see there's some questions. But that's that's what I got. I hope it was uh hope that I hope that was wow, I can't. Oh, hang on. My sharing, okay, there we go. Thank you. Thank you. Sorry, something is preventing me from sharing my video, but I know that Lou had a question early on. Is the challenge of aggregation made more difficult or less if we go to something like agent-based models? Yeah, so I've thought a lot about these. And I think there's certainly a role for agent-based models here. Certainly, a role for agent-based models here. I don't see a big difference between particularly between agent-based models and, I mean, I feel like the microparameter approaches or the distributed parameters approaches somewhere between sort of a mean field approach and an agent-based modeling approach. I think the crux is, again, it comes down to parameterizing an agent-based model and thinking about how. About how do we think about doing that? And maybe the parameterization is similar to these distributed parameters models. I think the key is, again, when we think about agent-based models, is the behavioral response coming from selecting agents within the agent-based model? And that is turning certain agents on and off or flipping the color of a given agent, or is it from the individual agents changing their behavior and some selecting being in and out? And some selecting being in and out. And I think that's kind of the area that's got me really interested in thinking about whether we can start differentiating those things. There is also a question in the chat from Chris. Maybe, Chris, you could say a little more about what your question is about the bottled epidemic curve early in the talk. Yeah. Hi, great talk, Elise. Thanks. So I was wondering about you, you showed that epidemic curve that you Curve that you, you know, in the first few slides. And what we've seen with a lot of the COVID epidemic curves is you had this very rapid initial attack, almost lenient year, followed by a very slow drop-off, like a fat-tail distribution. And I'm wondering, how easily does that come out of the academic, I believe you call it, bioeconomic models that you showed earlier? Yeah, so. Yeah. So I think there's two things driving that, right? So one is sort of some strange behavior. There is some strange, like what we use in this model, and some economists have said, why did you do this? We just assume that utility is quadratic and concave in contacts, as opposed to using something like a CE, a constant elasticity type specification. So I'm not sure that we have like the social mixing in there correctly, and there's different kinds of social mixing that could be driving part of that. Mixing that could be driving part of that. But the thing that has sort of struck me about the SARS-CoV-2 virus that seems different than flu is the lumpiness of it. And my wondering if this notion of using like exponential distributions and how things are getting transmitted is, there's also some biological bits of it that I wonder if this sort of standard, you know, we've thrown this behavior in there, but I wonder if. thrown this behavior in there but I wonder if there's something also going in on these other parts that we need to think about the mixing there and just how transmission and I have some colleagues who have who have shown me a model that I think I think Charles Sims and one of our grad students at Yale have been working on a model that basically uses Pareto distributions that seems to be able to produce that better than sort of exponential distributions implicit in the SE, the standard SEI startup. So I think both. Standard SEI shut up. So I think both things are at play there. I also think that with COVID, I also think that there's a locality issue and trying to model the epidemic, like what's the scale at which you're aggregating the epidemic. Because it seems looking at the data to me. So, Jude and I have this other paper that we basically can produce almost arbitrary curves. Almost arbitrary curves by adding different levels of compartments and different, like not just age, but like we've gone up to five or six different attributes. And all of a sudden, you get models that will produce something that goes up quickly and sort of plateaus and does this for a while. And all that's happening, as you know, Chris, is it's just working its way through different subsections of this population. And when you start adding space into that, I think we need to be careful to look at when we look at. To look at when we look at aggregated data from the COVID-19 pandemic, trying to infer what's going on there. Yeah, there is, I think there's time to handle one more question from Pauline. Are you using your ideas to model vaccination strategies? So, my concern. So, there is a am I using it to model vaccination strategies? Well, so. Strategies. Well, so we've done a couple things. We've looked at, we've used data from the American Time Use Survey and the Burfis survey, which is the Behavioral Health Risk Factor Surveillance Survey in the U.S. And a few years ago, looking at flu vaccine, we tried to figure out where you were likely to be able to target people who were not getting vaccinated. Where were they going? But I think what's But I think what's more concerning to me in the vaccination strategy is that if we learn that vaccination actually prevents you from transmitting the pathogen, which I guess is still an open question. If we learn that, so therefore we would want people who are vaccinated out working and doing things and helping produce things and teaching children and doing all. Things and teaching children and doing all the other things that are good from social interactions. And if the people who are likely to get, who are most likely to get vaccinated are also the most likely to comply with social distancing recommendations and behavior, we create this really interesting selection problem that all the vaccinated people aren't willing to go out and work or go, you know, that, and so this has been my thinking for a few years. And I've never, I mean, I've gotten notes down. I've never, I mean, I've gotten notes down, but we haven't written that paper. But I think there is this, again, thinking about where behavior selects on people who are willing to get vaccinated or willing to go to the front of the line to get vaccinated and willing to like stay home or engage in other social distancing or hygiene type behaviors. I think this is where we get some really interesting things that you could fit with any arbitrary parameters at the macro level. But if we want to think about policy and want to think about using. And we want to think about using these environmental, human environmental models to actually make the world a better place, we need to get down to the actual behavior. Do you know, Ila, if there is any data on whether vaccinated people can transmit what level? I mean, what I know is kind of in the popular media for the most part, and what my colleagues at Yale kind of defer. Colleagues at Yale kind of defer, like haven't told me much beyond that. But basically, the issue as I understand it with a vaccine is it primes your immune system to respond to the pathogen, right? And so the question is, how quickly can you start replicating pathogen before you show symptoms? I mean, so what we know is you don't get serious symptoms when you're vaccinated with the vaccines that are out right now. But we also know that people are likely able to spread asymptomatically before they show symptoms. Asymptomatically before they show symptoms. So there's sort of this horse race of whether or not the immune response or whether or not you're shedding virus fast enough, which one's sort of racing in that asymptomatic period that's like hard to observe. So I think that, and from what I've read is like, we actually don't seem to know that particularly well for flu or anything, but we seem to be more concerned about it with COVID-19 and this current SARS virus. SARS virus. Thanks. Mark, do you want to say anything before a quick break? No. Thanks for a great start for the afternoon talks and for whatever the time is where you are. Eli, are you going to be back for the general discussion? I'm going to do my best to be back for the general discussion, which is in like half an hour, right? Yes. All right. I will try and be back for that. I will try and be back for that. I might not be alone, though. Thanks, Eli. That's good. The more, the merrier. We just have two minutes before Rebecca's talk.
