So the talk will basically center about one set of results we obtain in quantum gravity, in a particular quantum gravity formalism, in which we extract cosmology from the fundamental theory and it turns out that it takes the form of an hydrodynamic equation on hydrodynamic. On nadrodynamic formulation on mini-superspace. And I will spend some time discussing these results, but then I will broaden a little bit the picture, arguing that this idea that cosmology should be seen as hydrodynamics on mini-superspace has further motivations that are not directly coming from quantum gravity. The first type of motivation, in fact, The first type of motivation, in fact, is already, in my opinion, coming from continuum classical relativistic physics and a proper understanding of diffomorphism invariants. Then I will mention other results obtained in mathematical physics, again without any direct connection to quantum gravity, where people found different maps from standard hydrodynamics and cosmological dynamics. And cosmological dynamics. And then I will finally suggest that this could have some implications concerning in the context of analog gravity simulations in condensed matter systems or realistic real quantum fluids. Okay, let me start from the general motivation coming from diffeomorphism variants in classical relativistic physics. I point here what is the main claim, and I will repeat it basically in every slide so that at least one key message is taken home from this part. So the claim is that diffeomorphism invariance should convince us that the domain of physics is a superspace, so the space of fields, rather than the differentiable manifold on which we define. Manifold on which we define fields, and that physics is relations among fields. So, normally, as we know, we model physics in terms of a differentiable manifold, with Lorentz metric, and a number of other tensor fields. And we have diffeomorphism invariance in a general relativistic context. So, in the case of GR, for example, the GR equation. The GR equations indeed are covariant under diffeomorphism, and we understand them as equations, constraint equations for dynamical fields on a given manifold. And the given differentiable manifold is the only global end if they morphism invariant background structure. So the invariance under diffuse implies, at least in one interpretation, but I think there is enough consensus, at least in the physics. Consensus, at least in the physics community, about this: that the implication is that the differentiable manifold, the points on the manifold, directions, atlases, coordinate systems, and so on are all unphysical tools that we use because they're useful, but they don't carry themselves any physical meaning. So, if one take this seriously, then space-time is not the manifold. Space-time events are not manifold points. Are not manifold points and so on. Time is not a time like direction on the manifold, and same for space. In fact, the implication is that fields themselves, taken as functions of manifold points, are as such unphysical objects. To put it simply, GR is in the usual formulation written in a very useful but highly redundant language. Language. So, physical notions of events, space, and time directions will have to be defined in terms of different variant observables that are constructed using dynamical fields and not directly read out of the manifold. This has nothing to do directly with coordinate in variance, of course. I'm really talking about active diffeomorphisms. So, the relational strategy for realizing this. Strategy for realizing these physical notions of time, space, and events is based on the idea that localization in space and time is relational. And relational observables would instantiate that this relational picture of space and time are then functions of reference fields. That is, in fact, different variant correlations on superspace, where superspace is indeed the space of fields of field configuration. Space of fields of field configurations. To give an intuition, you could have defined on your manifold the metric from which you compute the rich scalar. You can have a scalar field or a set of scalar fields defined at the point. And the idea would be that you invert the relation between the point on the manifold and the four scalar fields so that in fact you use the four scalar fields to define what you mean. To define what you mean by an event, and then you can express the rich scalar at that point, at that event, identified by the values of the four scalar fields. So in general, the idea is that the way we describe fields is in terms of dynamical reference systems. So we have to identify some dynamical fields as clock and rods and use their values to label. To label or define evolution and localization of other dynamical fields. So, the relevant reference frame, if you want to work in a different variant language, should be themselves physical fields. Of course, everything should reduce to the very effective language of just coordinate frames and and you know, directions on the manifolds and so on, and this is the limit in which uh you have idealized uh clock and rods. Clock and rods behaving like global test fields. This strategy has been implemented in very many contexts, from the simplest one of cosmology to the more involved ones. And we have, in fact, even deparametrized formulations of full GR by means of the introduction of can you hear us? Yep. Yep. Sorry, we don't see. Sorry, we don't see the translation of your chart. Can you shoot the screen again? Transparency. The transparency. Yeah, the transparency. It's always on the same page. Where are you? You don't see me changing slides? Yeah, okay. Then maybe I can do something else. Let me stop sharing. How do I stop sharing? Oh, I start sharing again. Okay. I see it now. You see the you see the slides? You see the slides? Yes, yes. You see the transitions? Yes, we can. Ah, fantastic. Okay, anyway, I was here and I hope that at least you could hear me. I hope that at least you could hear me. And now I keep going. Okay, so this relational study has been implemented in a number of cases from toy models to more realistic situations and even full GR can be deparameterized in terms of specially introduced matter reference frames. The obstacles to this full deparameterization of GR and the issues associated with these attempts is that in Attempts is that in general, global material frames are not physical, and realistic material frames are not so globally well-behaved to allow for the complete parametrization. So, in general, a relational formulation with realistic matter in terms of some realistic matter reference frame can only be local, approximate, and partial. In general, one should expect that just One should expect that just like we need several coordinate patches to cover the differentiable manifold, we need to use several physical frames to fully deparameterize and describe in physical terms the gravitational dynamics. Again, the point, anyway, abstracting a little bit more from the technical issue of achieving this construction, this relational construction of This relational construction of relational gravitational dynamics. The general point is that physics does not happen on a manifold, on the differentiable manifold, but it happens, it takes place on the space of fields, so super space, the space of fields up to diffuse for given topology. And this is itself a manifold. It's infinite dimensional and it's also a metric manifold, but it has a very complicated topological and metrical. Topological and metrical structures, which are only very partially understood. By the way, I just mentioned that this is not just a kinematical statement. The whole GR dynamics can be expressed as geodesic motions of a point particle on superspace. This is a formulation in full generality on superspace, it's extremely complicated for Extremely complicated for the reasons I just mentioned. And things are instead much simpler in a cosmological context. If we restrict our attention to global features of the universe, so approximately homogeneous field configurations, then we can indeed carry on the relational strategy to a much greater extent. And the superspace is in fact reduced to so-called mini superspace. To so-called mini-superspace, which is a finite-dimensional manifold, endowed again with the background non-dynamical metric, the super metric, which is well understood, and it has in general simple topological and metrical structures. One could even ask whether there is some relevant symmetry group, and I will mention this later on. An example of a relational dynamics. Of relational dynamics, so as formulational dynamics in this cosmological homogeneous context, that is simply in terms of relations on mini-superspace, can be seen on the slide. It's just a standard homogeneous isotropic reduction of GR to Friedman dynamics, to a flat Friedman universe. Mini superspace in this case is a two-dimensional flat manifold with directions identified with the scale factor. With the scale factor and some scalar field. And the dynamics can be fully deparametrized to obtain a relational evolution of the scale factor or the volume, which is a simple function in terms of the scalar field used as a clock. We are going to find again the same equation later on extracted from quantum gravity. Okay, so the summary of this very first motivating part is Uh, motivating part is that the immediate intuitive identification between space-time as a physical entity and the manifold of which we define GR and space-time physics with physics on a manifold should be actually understood as an approximation only, a special situation in which the four scalar fields that we use as a physical frame behave like a Frame behave like test fields covering the full manifold. So, we should not, in fact, expect to find the manifold at the fundamental quantum gravity level and probably not even at some effective description extracted from quantum gravity, unless we decide to introduce it for mathematical convenience. But it's not there as a necessary ingredient of the description of gravitational physics. So, physics, gravitational physics, instead. Gravitational physics instead should be understood as relational dynamics on superspace. Things are much simpler in the cosmological case, so when we deal with mini superspace, and such simplified setting can be intuitively seen to be some sort of highly cross-grained global approximation of the fundamental theory. And I would suggest already here and then realize in the following that this corresponds to an hydrodynamic regime of the fundamental theory. Regime of the fundamental theory, this highly cost-grained global regime of the full theory. Okay, now let's introduce the quantum gravity piece of the story. With the main message to take home is that indeed in some quantum gravity formalism, we can extract cosmology and in the form of hydrodynamics on mean superspace. So, the type of formalism I'm going to talk about is called group field theory. It is strongly and very strictly related to quantum gravity, spin-form models, and so on. So, in fact, I would claim that the results you obtained in this specific formalism have a more general validity. And they probably apply at least to some extent to all quantum gravity formalisms based on spin networks. Based on spin networks, simplicial structures, and so on, which are some key ingredients in group-free theory. So, one way to understand group-free theory is that it's a formalism to describe the kinematics and dynamics of something that can be pictorially seen as atoms of space-time, out of which space-time as we know it emerge, and therefore they cannot be pictured themselves as spatial temporal in any obvious way. In any obvious way. So, in particular, the universe is described as some sort of peculiar quantum animal system. So, the specific models within this tensoral group Fury formalism that I'm going to work with are those that contain enough quantum geometry data to be able to import intuition and results from lattice quantum gravity, canonical loop quantum gravity. Gravity, canonical loop quantum gravity, and so on. So, you can, in particular, you can see this atoms of space as quantized tetrahedra decorated with algebraic data encoding this pre-geometry. So, you have a Hilbert space for an individual tetrahedron, which is a space of L2 functions over several copies of the group. The interpretation is that these group elements. These group elements had to do with the discrete gravity connection on the lattice in which you have your tetrahedra. And you can compute out of these quantities or their conjugate variables all other geometric properties of a single tetrahedron, triangle areas, the volume of the tetrahedron, edge lengths, and so on. This is the kinematical Schilber space, but then you had to. Uh, Philbe space, but then you had to impose additional geometricity conditions on which we don't really enter because they're not so crucial for what I'm going to say in the following. I will just assume that you have an interpretation of the data on which your quantum states depend, which are algebraic in data, but allow this interpretation in terms of geometric properties of the single tetrahedron, of a single tetrahedron. Single Tetra. So if you have these representations in terms of functions on the group, then you can also have a conjugate representation in terms of irreducible representations of the same group. In this picture, instead of looking at a tetrahedron or a vertex with links labeled by group elements, you can think of picturing your fundamental atom as a vertex or a node with outgoing links. Or a node with outgoing links labeled by representations of SU2. This is a so-called spin network vertex, and again, it's a common ingredient to canonical loop quantum gravity and spin flow models. The encoding of discrete quantum geometry is, in fact, very practical, meaning you can define operators corresponding to such quantities, you can make them act on your quantities. You can make them act on your quantum states and you can compute their spectra. And again, here it works in a very, very similar way as in canonical loop quantum gravity or in simplicial quantum gravity. You can also consider states which correspond to extended structures. So several tetrahedra glue together. And this gluing is in fact entanglement across the degrees of freedom of the individual tetrahedra. The individual tetrahedra. And this is the way you also get generic spinetical states if you're familiar with them from canonical loop and gravity. However, starting from the single tetrahedron Hilbert space, you can instead go into a Fox space of tetrahedra and to a second quantized fixture in which you have operators in which corresponding to geometric quantities in terms of Geometric quantities in terms of field operators that allow you to move around, so as creation and relation operators to move around the Fox space. So, all this is, it becomes like in standard quantum memory systems, where now our single body or our bodies are collections of the Traidra, quantized the Traidra. Now, what is important is that, of course, you can impose the dynamics. It means you have to choose some action. It means you have to choose some action and write down a partition function for this system, for this quantum many body system. And you find the direct connection to discrete quantum gravity, lattice quantum gravity, as well as pinfo models by looking at the Feynman expansion of the dynamics and the Feynman amplitudes. I'm not going to use this connection in the following because our task would be to extract some effective continuum dynamics, some somehow bypass. Somehow bypassing or resuming all this sum over discrete lattices. Okay, the construction can in fact be extended to include what looks like discretized matter fields at the lattice level. And the extra degrees of freedom you have to add are just real variables in the domain of your field for this. Field for this tensor grouping theories, and there is a corresponding extension of field operators, quantum states, and so on. So, the type of models I'm going to work with have this type of actions for a field understood as creating or annihilating quantized the radar with additional data that we interpret as discretized matter, discretized scalar matter. We are interested, however, in the continuum. Whoever in the continuum description, and so that's what I turn on. Ideally, if we had infinite power and we were infinitely clever, then extracting continuum dynamics would mean just solving the theory, so just computing the full partition function. So controlling the entire collective dynamics, studying critical behavior, identifying continuum phases, and so on. So on. We need some simplifications and some guiding hypotheses to proceed because we are not so infinitely clever and infinitely powerful. And so the relevant hypothesis, one hypothesis is that we need to see a continuum as coming as by a fluid-like description of the quantum many body system. And in particular, we should look at condensate hydrodynamics to see general activity. Hydrodynamics to see general relativistic physics. The simplest approximation is that since we cannot compute the full quantum effective action, so the full continuum dynamics of the system, we approximate it in the simplest way with mean field hydrodynamics. So we approximate the full quantum effective action with the classical action of the same field theory. So from now on, I consider just the dynamics that we can extract from the classical action of such field theories. The general equation of motion that you extract for the condensate wave function, which is the density of your fluid, is some non-linear equation because the theory is an interrupting field theory. The cosmological interpretation of this follows because one can show that the because one can show that the domain of the condensate wave function, the domain of the mean field, which is by construction with such models the space of geometries of a single tetrahedron, can in fact be seen as diseomorphic, in fact, isomorphic to the mini superspace of homogeneous continuum geometries. So what we have in the end at this level, At this level, by just looking at the by just computing the classical equations of motion for this class of quantum gravity models, what we have is a non-linear equation for a wave function on mini superspace. In other words, we have a non-linear extension of quantum cosmology. So, in this sense, we have a cosmological interpretation for what is just the hydrodynamics of the quantum gravity system. System. Now let's go a bit more concrete. We can take a model in which we have the quantum geometric data and five scalar fields. Why five? Because we want to use four of them to define a reference frame and the remaining one would be the only matter content in the universe. So we compute our classical equations of motion, but we do it so in but we do it so in a class of wave functions condensative states that are very well peaked on the values of four of the scalar fields why because again we want some dependence on specific values of the four scalar fields we choose as clock rods because this dependence will be then interpreted as temporal and spatial localization We further simplify the story. We assume that the interactions are subdominant. So we first focus on just the free dynamics. Then we also restrict to isotropic configurations so that our wave functions would only depend on the scalar field values, but then on just one spin component. And we have a resulting hydrodynamic equation for our condensed state wave function. For our condensate wave function sigma. The details are really, really not important here. We just have an a priori non-linear equation for the condensity wave function sigma. We first focus on the free dynamics as a first approximation. And the condensative wave function depends on j, a single quantum geometric data, and the values of the scalar fields. We can rewrite everything in a more We can rewrite everything in a more standard hydrodynamic form in terms of the density and a phase. And we can do that by also separating, approximating the dynamics into a homogeneous background and some perturbations which carry the dependence on the spatial points defined relationally. So we have some background equations and we have equations for inhomogeneities. Homogeneities. So, components of our fluid that depend on the value of the routes scalar fields, of the scalar fields we use as routes, while the background is homogeneous, so it doesn't depend on those values. Now, these are just general hydrodynamic equations. They don't look anything like cosmology because we need to rewrite them in terms of physical observables of cosmological interest. So, we do that, we define. So we do that, we define in the full quantum gravity theory observables, in particular the volume for the whole universe, which has a cosmological interpretation. And then we express them in expectation values in the chosen class of states. As a result, we get relational definitions for the volume. In particular, we get the Particular we that we get the volume as a function of time and space, meaning the readings of the clock scalar field and the rods scalar fields. And the same for the other cosmological observables. And then we extract the equations for such volume and its evolution with respect to the clock scalar field. This comes directly from the background volume dynamics. The particular spectrum. The particular expression is not so important. We can do the same for the cosmological perturbations. And we have a bunch of general results, which is that at very early times, we have a bouncing scenario for the background. At intermediate times, we recover the Friedmann evolution, the Friedmann dynamics for the volume. And at later times, in fact, for specific subclass models, we even find some accelerated dispansion of dark energy type. While for cosmological perturbations, we find good matching for large wavelengths with the general relativistic prediction, with the general relativistic dynamics, but we have a different dynamics for other ranges of wavelengths. Ranges or wavelengths, and this could mean that the model is wrong or that there is something interesting to be understood there. My point is not so much about the specific results obtained, but the general conclusion that we seem to have to extract cosmology from the hydrodynamics of the quantum gravity theory in the form of a non-linear extension of quantum cosmology then turned into dynamics for Into dynamics for cosmological observables. And then I'm led to ask if this is somehow a coincidence, something very specific to quantum gravity, or some more general correspondence between hydrodynamic equations and cosmology can be found. So it turns out that standard hydrodynamics can also be mapped to relativistic cosmology. Relativistic cosmology, including its symmetries, and that there's been already some work on this independently of quantum gravity. So, let me spend the last few minutes, I guess, five minutes, maybe less. Five minutes. Okay, so the last five minutes, mentioning a little bit these results and then making some further comment in the end. Okay, so there are seven. Okay, so there are several such maps that have been found between standard hydrodynamics, which you can also interpret as hydrodynamics of mini superspace, but it's really the hydrodynamic equation of realistic fluids and cosmology. And this suggests a broader correspondence between hydrodynamics and generalativistic dynamics. So let me mention one example. Me mention one example taken from a paper by Lindsay in 2003. So consider the gross pit-esque equation for a BC, for a quantum fluid, a standard BC in a trapped potential. So it is in general very, very difficult to solve. You simplify considering a two-dimensional cylindrically symmetric BC with a specific type of trapping potential or parabolic type. Parabolic type, then you can show that the full dynamics is encoded in a set of equations satisfied by the integral moments of the distribution of your, you know, of your condensate wave function psi. So you can compute these integral moments. You show that they satisfy the relations report on the slide. And further, you can recast the same in terms of a single equation called Hermakoptini. called Hermakopini equation. Now this is the interesting mathematical fact about the dynamics of such condensate. And you can also consider however the Friedmann equations express in cosmic time in the presence of some matter content of the universe is some arbitrary well self-interacting minimally coupled scalar field with a rather arbitrary potential. Rather arbitrary potential. If you pass to laboratory time, then you can actually show that also the Friedman equations can be recursed as the Hermo-Ko-Pini equation. And in fact, you can understand this equivalence by simply mapping the integral moments of the condensed wave function into specific cosmological quantities. Quantities. And the same map applies to the conservation equations. So I find this already quite remarkable, but you can still think it's more or less just a coincidence, you know, many equations that somehow describe different systems. Well, that's true. This identification, however, is quite natural if you think of the hydrodynamics as defined on mini superspaces. So you identify the two directions. The two directions on the manifold in the hydrodynamic system with mini superspace. But maybe more relevant, you can find the same symmetries hidden in the same symmetries that you know are there for Schrodinger hydrodynamics in the case of flat FRW cosmology, where they are instead rather hidden. You can take the Friedman dynamics. Take the Friedman dynamics as a mechanical system, and then you can show that there is a specific set of field transformations. So, transformations from some field value to different field values, which in fact are symmetries of the mechanical system. And this set of symmetries are exactly the two-dimensional centrally standard Schrodinger algebra, which is also the symmetry group of Also, the symmetry group of the previously shown agrodynamic of the quantum fluid. So it's in fact the same symmetry of non-linear Schrodinger dynamics. Again, it could be a coincidence, you know, there could be a mapping of equations, but then also of symmetries in two systems that have otherwise nothing to do with each other. That's obviously possible. But there have been a number of generalizations. But there have been a number of generalizations of these maps to different type of cosmological dynamics and that map to different type of fluid dynamics. And also the symmetry analysis can be extended to Friedman cosmologies with different scalar field potentials, to Bianke cosmology, to the Schwarzschild black hole dynamics and so on. So the summary is that maybe there is some more general correspondence between hydrodynamic equations and Hydrodynamic equations and cosmological dynamics. And that symmetries can actually be found, usually hidden in the gravitational case, because there are few symmetries that you get on top of the feomorphism invariants, and they can help you guide this understanding of the map between cosmology and hydrodynamics. Okay, and then I'll close with a couple of comments on analog gravity. Analog gravity. Well, suppose we take seriously this possibility that cosmology can be extracted as some sort of hydrodynamics on mini superspace. We also take seriously the idea that it's exactly physics on superspace that we should at face value take as gravitational physics. So we have to look for a formulation which removed any dependence on the Remove any dependence on the manifold and manifold points and so on. Well, then we maybe can reassess a bit what is the situation in analog gravity models in condensed matter. Let me summarize you briefly. I only have two slides and then I'm done. So analog gravity systems are based on the fact that an effective curve geometry emerges naturally and very generically at the hydrodynamic level of the description. Hydrodynamic level of the description of condensed matter systems. Perturbations over background fluids behave, well, satisfy the equations of quantum field theory on curved space-times, with the background fluid providing a curved geometry on which perturbations couple. And this has been, you know, extensively studied. It was a very active and very interesting field of research, both the deterioration. Research both at the theoretical and more recently also at the experimental level in the last more or less 10 years. However, there is the big open issue that the gravitational dynamics cannot be reproduced. So the analogy stops at the kinematical level, at the level of quantum fields on a curved geometry. In fact, the consensus is in the community that the gravitational dynamics cannot be reproduced. Be reproduced. And the main arguments for this is that the dynamics of the emergent geometry in such analog systems is governed by the hydrodynamic equations, not by generativistic equations. So it's a background-dependent dynamics. There is some fixed background metric, which is the laboratory metric. It comes with preferred frames, which are the isometries, correspond to the isometries of the background metric, and it has special symmetry. And it has special symmetries, the Schrodinger symmetry that I mentioned earlier, rather than any general covariance or diffeomorphism symmetry. However, I leave it just as a suggestion that we are starting to investigate a little bit more in detail in these days. Well, maybe the results I mentioned from quantum gravity and mathematical physics, and more generally, the relational perspective on gravitational physics suggest otherwise. Otherwise, maybe they suggest that hydrodynamic equations can be mapped and then understood as encoding relativistic cosmological dynamics. The way to see this map in a most natural manner is to understand these hydrodynamic equations as hydrodynamics on minus superspace. So the symmetries, in fact, are the same or can be the same depending. The same or can be the same depending on the specific model you consider. And this symmetry is about field transformations, not coordinate or transformations acting on the manifold. So it's some symmetry that exists beyond the femorphism. So it's not something that you should compare with the feomorphism. It's a different level of symmetry. So we at least obtained from quantum gravity and from this mathematical From this mathematical physics results, a proof of principle that this idea is not plain wrong. At least there are some cases in which it may work, and we have to explore further if there is some more general implementation of this idea. If so, it may well be possible to have a tropical gravitational dynamics for both background and perturbations in quantum anybody system in the aerodynamic approximation and therefore go beyond. Approximation and therefore go beyond the supposed inbuilt limitation of analog gravity simulations in condensed matter. So these are again the four main messages. I hope you take them home and I'm happy to discuss more. Thank you. Thank you, Daniel. Any questions, please? I can hear, I can try to stop sharing. Hello, Daniel. This is Antonio. Can you hear me? Yep, yep, I can hear you. I just want to say that I like very much his view of cosmology and then I I wonder And then I wonder if there is any possible relation or maybe equivalence or not with the usual approach of most people that take it in. Wait, wait, wait. I hear very, very badly. I'm not sure I understood the question. Sorry, maybe you hear better now. The thing is, I like this view of cosmology. And thank you, I agree with these principles. of these principles. But my question is whether it's possible to, or do you think it's whether it's possible to find an equivalence or not with the usual view where people start thinking about homogeneous isotropic studies and then they want to add anisotropies and yeah so are you are you so you're talking about the quantum Are you are you? So, are you talking about the quantum gravity context, or in the case of realistic quantum cosmology? Let's say if people want to do quantum cosmology, you can take your point of view, or you can take the more standard point of view of the community of going slowly, trying to add complications and not seeing things as a collective microscope. Macroscopic homogeneity, but instead of macroscopic homogeneity, they start with complete homogeneity and then they try to add with complications. So I want to hear about the contrasting or whether it would be a possible evidence or not. Okay, so for sure, again, I hope I understood the question. So the point is that, of course, you can arrive at dynamical equations on Dynamical equations on mini-supress space simply as is normally done in quantum cosmology, which is to take GR, you know, you simitz are reduced to homogeneous configurations. So you get to mini superspace and then you quantize and so you have the Hilbert space of quantum states and wave functions defined on mini superspace. So we get that as a sort of a special approximation of the more general construction. Of the more general construction. So, from a pure quantum gravity point of view, of course, you can do that. And the question is: is this just the toy model? Is it enough to capture the relevant physics? How can we embed it in the full quantum gravity formalism? And what I'm saying is that if you go for, if you change perspective and look at the, you start from the fundamental quantum gravity formalism, in general, you should expect the cosmological dynamics to come. Expect the cosmological dynamics to come out of some form of cost-graining. If it comes out of some form of cost-graining, again, very generally, you expect the non-linear dynamics for the corresponding ordered parameter, which would be again some sort of global cosmological wave function. And this is what we get. Then it could well be that for all sorts of practical, you know, phenomenological reasons, these are just extra. These are just extra complications, and you don't really need to embark into that. But you can only find out by knowing what these extra ingredients are and checking if they give you some relevant new prediction or not. You see, the problem is usually the other round. You start with the toy model. As long as it works, everybody's happy. The moment it doesn't work, you're not really sure how you should complete it. You should complete it because it's not embedded into the food. You really don't know which approximations lead you there. And but at some point you mentioned also anisotropies. Yeah, of course you can extend the whole thing to anisotropies. In the full quantum gravity context, there's been very little work, but there's no obstruction in principle. You can write down things in the anisotropic case. I hope I answered. I think I answered the number of questions that you didn't pose. I hope I hit also the one you did pose. Right. We have time for one more question. Well, if there is nobody else, I want to ask you something. I'm Harris and Austopoulos. How sensitive are those results about the emergence of heterodynamics to the use of use of relational interpretation let's say i mean if you can you i mean it works on the minusup space so in principle you don't need this particular interpretation i mean any approach that works on mini super speech should recover it or is it not the case so you're asking if this construction works beyond minus superspace if it worked without the relation If it works without the relational interpretation, that's what I'm asking. Yes. So, yeah, so the relational interpretation, so as an interpretation, it applies more generally. The question is whether you can realize it and extract, you know, compute relational observables of interest and affect the dynamics for them beyond the municipal space. Space. So is this what you're asking? No, what I'm asking is: I mean, there are other interpretations of time, except for the relation of the observables. So how sensitive are your results on assuming the relational interpretation of the emergence of look, if the alternative interpretations rely on the existence or On the existence or and the physical significance of a differentiable manifold, and they assign physical meaning to manifold points, directions, and so on. Then I would say my results do not apply for the simple reason that any of the quantum gravity formalism that relate to this type of work I've done, so loop quantum gravity, GFT, spin forms and so on, do not use a space-time manifold. A space-time manifold in the fundamental definition of the theory. They may use it as an intermediate step in the construction, but at the end of the day, when you look at the quantum states and operators and so on that they use, manifold appears nowhere. So from this point of view, no, my results will not apply. If you're okay with the general idea that you have to work in the space of fields, In the space of fields, and the manifold in itself has no nothing more than a practical significance, the usefulness, but it doesn't have a physical significance. Then, yes, I mean, the relational construction is one way of computing different variant observables using fields, but I could imagine others, and in which case, I don't see why the results would not extend. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is a little bit more than a little bit of a diagnostic.
