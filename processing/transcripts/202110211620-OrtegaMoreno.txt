Yeah, maybe, you know, that's all right. Maybe we can start right now. And now the next speaker is Professor Otega Mono. And he will speak on iterations of Minkowski valuation. Please. Thank you very much. And thank you very much for the organizers. Thank you very much for the organizers for giving me the chance to speak here. So, yeah, as my title says, I'm going to be talking about iterations of Minkowski evolutions. So, first, let me just recall some very basic terminology. So, an n-dimensional convex body k is a convex and compact subset over n. There's a power function of a convex body k is defined. D k is defined by this equation. So the support function of k at some given direction x is equal to the supremum of this inner products when y belongs to k. So this just measures the distance of the supporter hyperplane orthogonal to x to the direction x. To the direction x. And well, support functions are convex and positively homogeneous. And the support function of k completely determines the convex body k. So now let me recall you what the projection body operator is. So the projection body operator plays a central role in the theory of convex bodies and is given. And it's given so its support function is given by this formula here. So the support function of the projection body of a convex body k in a given direction u is given by the n minus one dimensional volume of the projection of k onto the orthogonal onto the hyperplane orthogonal to this given direction. So, a major open problem in the theory of convex bodies in convex and integral geometry is Petty conjecture inequality for the volume of projection bodies. And this conjecture states that the volume of the projection body of k over the volume of k to the n minus one, this functional, is minimized. This functional is minimized when k is a unit pole. It was already observed by Petty that this quantity P, this quotient, is a fine invariant, and thus the conjecture actually states that the possible, the only minimizers of these potions are ellipsoids. So neither in So Schneider in 1970 pointed out that the minimizers of this quotient must satisfy the fixed point equation pi square k equal to alpha k, where alpha is a positive number. And those immediate matters must be the sonoids. So we know that the range of the projection body operator is a class of sonoids, and therefore this equation tells us that if a minimizer should Should be a sonoid. This is now known as the class reduction technique, as it reduces the search for minimizers to a smaller class of complex bodies. But it comes as a surprise that this fixed point problem has a variety of smooth and non-smooth solutions, with balls and cubes in the most basic examples. A complete characterization of polytopal solutions of the fit point problem was provided by Bile, who showed that they are actually the orthogonal sums of symmetric polygons and segments. And surprisingly, there is not much about the smooth solutions of the fixed point problem. And Ibaki in 2018 made a major step in this direction by Step in this direction by proving that locally around a neighborhood of a C2 neighborhood of the unit ball, the only solutions to this fixed point problem are in fact ellipsoids. So the conjecture says that the only minimizers are ellipsoids and if I can prove that locally around the unit bolt for smooth bodies these are the only possible solutions are ellipsoids Ivaki's result follows from a stronger result by Saroglo and Svavich from 2017, who consider limits of the sequence of iterations of the projection body operator with respect to the Banach-Massur distance. And what they show in this paper is that the iterations of the projection body operator actually converge to the unit ball as long as the complex ball. pole as long as the convex body k the initial convex body k is close enough to to the to the unit ball in the c22 norm uh so with this result and with the uh class reduction technique they managed to to to to to actually solve um petty conjecture or confirm petty conjecture inequality locally for a smooth inequality locally for smooth bodies. So then, and also classify fixed points of the equation pi square k equal to alpha k. So yeah, this is what is known so far. And now let me introduce you the class of Minkowski evaluation. So the projection body belongs to a rich family of geometric operators mapping the set of Geometric operators mapping the set of convex bodies to itself, and these are called Minkowski valuations. A map phi defined on the class of convex bodies to itself is called a Minkowski evaluation if it satisfies this inclusion, exclusion principle. So phi of the union of two convex bodies K and L plus phi of the intersection of these convex bodies should be equal to phi of K plus phi of L. And this is provided that the Provided that the convex volume is K and L, the union of the convex volume is K and L is again a convex volume. So, provided that this here makes sense. In this talk, we will be particularly interested in cost evaluations that are generated by some body of revolution. So, let me explain you what that means. So, we say that phi is generated by a convex body of revolution. Is generated by a convex body of revolution if there exists a body of revolution L such that the support function of phi of k is given by this integral formula here. So we integrate over the sphere the support function of the rotated copy of L with axis of revolution B and this integration is with respect to the surface area measure of the convector. Measure of the convex body, convex body case. And this can be interpreted as a spherical convolution. Basically, we just let's for now just define this operation to be just this integral. And yeah, well, yeah, as I already mentioned, L of B is just a rotated copy of L with axis of revolution B. Of revolution B, and this is the surface area measure of the combined for the case. Actually, Schuster in 2007 proved that any continuous Minkowski evaluation, which is translation, invariant, rotation, equivariant, and n minus one homogeneous is of this form. And the projection body pi itself is a Minkowski evaluation generated by the simplest body of evolution. Generated by the simplest body of evolution, an interval. So, why is that? We can see this by just a very simple application of Cauchy's projection formula. So, we can compute the volume of the n minus one-dimensional volume of the projection of k onto the orthogonal, onto the hyperplane orthogonal to the direction u just by this integral here. And if you see this absolute value of this. Absolute value of this inner product here times one over two is just the support function of this interval, right? Of the interval from minus v over two to b over two. And so actually, Ludwig proved in 2002 that the projection body is the only continuous affinity control variant in Cosmo version. So from all these evaluations, These evaluations that we are talking about, the only one that behaves nicely with respect to affine transformations is a projection body. And in this talk, we basically ask the following question: Is a generalization of Petty's conjecture to a larger class of operators? So, So we are interested. So basically, the same quotient, but instead of having here the projection body operator, we plug in Minka's evaluation generated by body of revolution. And we ask the same question, when is this potion minimized? And the conjecture is that this potion should be minimized when k is avoidable. You can also Be shown rather easily that a minimizer of this quotient for a given phi, for a given Rinkos evaluation, should satisfy the same fixed point problem. So phi squared k should be equal to alpha k for some alpha. And what are the advantages of working with this generalization? Generalization. Well, one advantage could be that the class of possible minimizers is reduced considerably. Since now the convex body of see, now we can take any convex body of evolution to generate evaluation. We can take this convex body to be smooth and then the image of any convex body K under this Minkowski evaluation should be of the same class of smoothness. Be of the same class of the smoothness. So, in this way, we will get rid of, for example, all polytopial solutions to the problem, for example, to the fixed point problem. And the second possible advantage is that we also get less minimizers. So, since we take phi, I mean cost evaluation generated by a smooth body. Then that is not the interval, then this quotient is no longer a fine invariant, but only rotational invariant. And this means that, well, we don't have ellipsoids as solutions either. So we will expect only to have bulbs. So final. So, final remark. Let me mention that if this conjecture is true even for only small bodies of revolution, then by applying a limit, we can recover Pettis conjecture inequality, as we can always approximate the interval by a sequence of the smooth bodies of evolution and basically. And basically, you will be able just to take a look at it. So, solving conjecture one will give us better conjecture inequality up to equality cases. So, for now, I'm going to restrict myself to bodies of revolution. Of revolution which are which have a high regularity. So we say that a convex volume of revolution is a plus C M plus if the support function belongs to C M. So it has m times continuous differentiable and the Hessian of the spore function is a positive, it's a positive matrix. So So, and we say that a Minkowski evaluation is of class Cm plus regular. So, it's Cm plus regular if it's generated by a convex body of revolution of class Cm plus. So now let me state our main result. Well, this result is join with Branch Schuster. Franchister. And basically, what we managed to do here is solve the fixed point problem locally. So, this is an extension of Ivaci's result for the projection body. In here, we have a Minkowski evaluation that is C2 plus regular. And we managed to show that there is a neighborhood in a C2 neighborhood of the unit ball, such that the only solution to the fixed point problem phi is where k ploto alpha k are. Our polls. So, this is the good news. And more recently, I managed to extend Saroglu and Islavich result for the projection for the convergence of the iterations of the projection body operator to C infinity plus regular in cost evaluation. So if you have a So if you have a C infinity plus regular Minkowski evaluation, then there is always a neighborhood of the unit ball such that you can always find a sequence of numbers, positive numbers, such that the sequence gamma m times phi m of k will converge with respect to the Hauser metric to the unit pole. Unitable. And this is a nice result because now with this result and with the class reduction technique, I managed to obtain a local solution to the conjecture. And sorry, a small remark is that if actually if the dimension is bigger than six, I managed to prove that the mean cost evaluation only needs to be plus C to plus regular. C to plus, regular, so you don't need C infinity, you just need two derivatives for dimension higher than six. And well, with this theorem, I managed to get as a corollary a solution to the conjecture. So for C infinity plus regular and cost of function. So if I is a C to plus regular Rincos evaluation, there exists a neighborhood of the exists a neighborhood of the of the unit ball a smooth neighborhood of the unit ball where this portion is is minimized by by the unit ball and the quality happens in this neighborhood if and only if k is a is a ball so so these two So these two results have a common ingredient. So a main ingredient of the proof of this result is a spectrogap of some multipliers of convolution transform defined by body of revolution. So let me remind you what multipliers are. So we denote by a k and We denote by a k and L the eigenvalues or multipliers of the spherical convolution transform defined by this piece. So T L of F is just the spherical convolution transform of F with the support function of L. This is just what I wrote before. It's just an integral of the support functions of the rotated copies of L and then you multiply by this function fq and then you integrate with respect to the integrate with respect to the nature of the sphere and so it turns out that so there there exists a sequence of numbers such that if you have the spherical harmonic expansion of F, you can compute the spherical harmonic expansion of T L of F by just multiplying each projection of F onto the harmonics of degree spherical harmonics of degree K. spherical harmonics of the group K by the corresponding multiplier. So this is the way they behave. The theorem that we prove is an inequality for these multipliers. So if we have an L, a convex body L, convex body revolution L, origin symmetric, then Then the k multiplier of this of the convolution transform defined by L is strictly less than the first multiplier, the zero multiplier divided by this number. And for the second multiplier, we don't have a strict inequality, just less or equal to this number here, which is exactly the same as this one. Number here, which is exactly the same as this one, but when you replace k equal to however here we don't have a strict inequality, however, when l is of class c to plus then we we have a strict inequality again for the second multiplier. So how this theorem is used to prove the previous two theorems? Well, the basic idea is that, for example, for the fixed point problem, Problem, once needs to compute the kernel or some of some derivative. And this derivative turns out to be a multiplier operator. And so in order to compute the kernel, one can use the fact that it's a multiplier transform. And at the end, in order to compute the kernel, one just basically requires this information. And for the second theorem, for the iteration, Theorem for the iteration for the convergence of the iterations. Basically, the idea is that locally around the ball, the Minkowski evaluation is going to behave as a linear contraction. And to prove that Minkowski evaluation is a linear contraction, basically once, basically Minkowski evaluation is going to be its derivative locally around the ball, and this derivative is going to be a multiplayer transform again. Is going to be a multiplayer transform again, and to show that this derivative is a contraction, again one it turns out that this is exactly the precise condition that one needs to prove that this is a contraction. And so basically, this theorem is quite important for getting both of the previous two results. Previous to results. So, I'm gonna explain you briefly how we prove a theorem like this. And so, I'm gonna give you an idea of the proof of the spectral gap. And the basic idea of the proof goes back to an argument due to Schneider to proving an inequality for multipliers of Minkowski endomorphisms. What is a Minkowski endomorphism? Well, it's just a Minkowski additive valuation. An Minkowski additive valuation that commutes with rigid motions. And so for any bigger than 3, Hnider proved that if you have a Minkowski endomorphism, basically a linear map, then there exists a sequence of numbers, the multipliers, such that the support function of the Minkowski endomorphism applied to k can be written as is. Written as this series again. So, again, the projection, you project the support function onto the k onto the spherical harmonics of the degree k, and then you multiply by the corresponding multiplier, and it sum, and this will basically give you the support function. So, schneider showed the following inequality. So, Schneider showed that the multiplier Show that the multipliers of Minkowski and domorphism satisfy this inequality, that the k multiplier in absolute value should be less or equal to the zero multiplier. So, how one proves an inequality like this? So, let me for each k, for each number of k, let me know. Number k, let me define ik to be the interval such that for all alpha in this interval, there exists a convex body k alpha such that the support function of this convex body is given by this formula, one plus alpha times the Legendre polynomial of degree k in dimension n evaluated at u times e is just a fixed point. Just a fixed point in the sphere, it doesn't really matter what it is, you it's just any fixed point, and uh well, the first observation here is that this interval contains zero, right? Because this interval, if you put alpha equals zero here, well, this is just one, and this is just the support function of the unit ball. And obviously, if we know that if We know that if we add anything to a support function, anything very small to a support function, then we also get a support function. So as long as this alpha is very small, this polynomial here is bounded on the sphere. So as long as this alpha is very small, we will get more support functions. So it's not hard to see that this actually, this. This interval here is a closed bounded interval in Rn. So P and K, sorry, PKN, there is a type of here, then also the gender polynomial of degree K in dimension. Well, this let me just remind you that these polynomials are the family of orthogonal polynomials with respect to the weight one minus t is. the weight one minus t squared to the n minus three over two on on the interval minus one um okay so so let me take any any alpha in ik uh so what happens if we if i apply phi to to the convex body k alpha well we just use the multiplier property here multiplier property here and we we obtain that k phi sorry the spar function of phi of k alpha is given by this series which turns out to be something rather simple because basically all this all the terms in the sum are going to be zero except for the first one and the k one because this polynomial sorry this polynomial here is actually a spherical harmonics of degree k is actually Spherical harmonics of degree k is actually the only sonal spherical harmonic of degree k that there is. So when you project, when you project this, the support function, well, the only things that survive are the first term, the zero term, and the k term. All the other terms are orthogonal to one and these polynomials, so they die. And well, we get that the square function of pi of k. the support function of phi of k alpha can be written this way for all for all you in the on the sphere and so hence well i can multiply the support function so i can multiply the convex value uh phi of k alpha by by this number here so just the reciprocal of the first mod of the zero multiplier of phi and well this is like this is still a support function of a convex body Convex body and it's given by this, right? It's just one plus alpha times this number here times the Legendre polynomial. But but then this number, alpha times this number here is again going to be in the same interval because it just satisfies the definition of the interval. So therefore, this number here should be in ik. And this basically tells us that, therefore, this number here times any number in the interval should be in the interval. So the interval times this number should be contained in the interval ik. And from here, well, one can easily deduce inequality, right? This will imply basically that this number here in absolute value is less or equal to one, which is equal to one which is uh what is neither uh proof proof that the first multiply said k multiplier is less or equal to the zero multiplier one can also prove that the zero multiplier if i is not trivial then it's always positive i i didn't mention that but that can be proven easily so so this is how how he proved the inequality and we would like to apply the same idea for our problem Problem. So for that, let me take L, any orient symmetric complex value of evolution in Km. And we know that for any k the T L of Sn minus 1K is going to be a support function of a convex value of k. This is what I already mentioned, right? This actually, this defines an n minus one homogeneous Minkowski coefficient, right? So this will be a So this will be a, this here is just a support function of a complex value of k whenever I plug here complex volume k. However, in here, the dependence on k or rather on the support function of k is not linear. It's not longer linear, right? The surface area measure of a convex value case behaves rather like a polynomial of degree n minus one. So we don't have like a map, we don't have a linear map. Map, we don't have a linear map from support functions to support functions, so we need to introduce something else. But the observation is that DL is actually a map, a linear map from the space of positive measures to the space of support functions. And moreover, T L is a multiplier transform. So we can compute T L of the surface area measure of T L. Measure of k by this formula here, right? So we just again, it's exactly the same thing, but now we project the surface area, surface area measure of k. But in this equality, in the left-hand side, we have a support function, and in the right-hand side, we have a sum of projections of some surface area density, right? Density, right? So now we need to introduce a new interval. So I define j k to be the set of all numbers beta such that there exists a convex body k beta with the surface with surface area measure given by again the same kind of formula. So now the surface area measure, the surface area density of this body is going to be given by one plus beta times the Legendre polynomial of degree K. polynomial of degree k evaluated at one u times e for all for all u and following exactly the same idea as we did in the few in a few slides before one can show exactly in the same way that the quotient of the of the k multiplier over the zero multiplier of l times the j times the j interval j k interval should be contained in the i chi i chi interval uh for all k so but unfortunately we have a there's a difficulty here so we cannot these two intervals need not to be of the same the same or they don't really need to be exactly the same right in fact as we will see Same right, in fact, as we will see, they are actually not the same. So, one in order to obtain an estimate for this number here, for this portion, we will need to determine quantitatively the correct sizes of these two intervals. So, it's not as easy as when the two intervals are just the same and. And in order to do that, let me introduce some very easy notation. So we denote by nu kn one to nu k n k over two, or the integer part. These guys denote the successive relative maxima or the absolute value of the Legendre polynomial of the group K in dimension n as t decreases from one to zero. So this guy here. This guy here, the guy on the right-hand side at the top, is going to be one. Well, there is a one, there is missing a bit from the plot. In here, there should be, let's say, one, but that's not a relative maximum, because in one the polynomial is not going to be differentiable. So, this is this guy here is B1, mu1, and this guy mu2, mu1. And this guy will be mu2, mu3, and mu4, and so on, right? So these are the relative maxima of the absolute value of the polynomial. And now let me state this proposition, which is basically the computation of the intervals that we need. And for all k. So we have that for all even k the The ik interval is contained in this interval here. So one over this number times this new kn1 and this other number here. And the jk interval is given by this interval here. So in here we don't have an equality. However, this is good enough for our purposes. And in here we do have an equality. And the inclusion And the inclusion in the in actually the this inclusion here in the case when k is equal to two is actually inequality and this minimum can be just very easily computed because yeah well the gender polynomial of degree two is just polynomial of degree two and can be finding the minimizer is quite easy. So this is just this and oh sorry. Well another observation is that if you take an alpha in the interval that if you take an alpha in the interval in the in the interior of the of the interval then you will get k k alpha will be a of class uh c c this is also a typo there so this is the the proposition that that we will need to prove and uh let me start with jk uh very Very quickly. So, here we just need to check that we need to check for which values of beta the conditions on Minkowski's theorem are satisfied, right? So those we just need to check that actually when this function here is positive, well, not negative. And why is that? Well, the other two conditions, this function is centered because if you integrate with you multiply this by u. If you multiply this by u and integrate, well, remember the gender polynomials of different degrees are orthogonal, so everything is going to be zero, so it's centered, and the other thing is that it is not concentrated at any sub-sphere, but this doesn't happen because it's the density and it's not trivial, it's not zero, so this will never be concentrated. Will never be concentrated. So, the only thing we need to check is that this is not negative. And this is very easy. Well, this polynomial is bounded in the integral minus one ground. So, we just need to solve the inequality and we get that beta should be bigger or equal to minus one over the maximum of the gender polynomial, and beta should be minus one over the minimum of the polynomial. The minimum of the polynomial, which is a negative number, and then, and this is the that can be written in this way, for k even. So, this is how you compute the interval jk. That's rather simple. And let me briefly explain how to compute the interval ik. So, in this case, we need another lemma because we don't have a Minkowski theorem. Minkowski theorem, so but the but it's rather easy to obtain. So, what we do is we have this lemma. So, for any for any function g in c2, we define this this function, so this hx to be just given by this, right? And the norm of x of times g evaluated at x times e over the norm of x. Norm of x. And this will be a support function of a convex value of revolution kt if and only if these two functional inequalities are satisfied. So let me just tell you how. So in order to prove this, it is a rather simple lemma. You just really need to compute the derivatives of the second order derivatives of h. It's just the head. You need to compute the hessian of h, and then you need to. H and then you need to write the Hessian in its spectral decomposition, then you realize that these numbers here that appear in the inequality are actually the eigenvalues of this Hessian. Well, C is also an Eigen value because it's a one-homogeneous function, so C is always an Eigen value of the Hessian. But the other two eigenvalues are given basically in terms of these two functions here. So in order to have a support function, you need the Hessian to be semi-professional. Haziant to be semi-positive definite. So this translates in having these two conditions here. So it's a and then basically we will apply this lemma to the function one plus alpha, the Legendre polynomial. And this happens if and only if this is so this is the first inequality here. We plug in G and we obtain this. For the second inequality, we obtain this here. And if you know a bit about the gender polynomial, this already looks About the gender polynomial, this already looks quite nice. This term here. So, but now the rest of the proof consists on plugging in the right values of t, because this should be true for all t. So just choosing the smart values of t here. So one smart value to choose is t equals one. And when you plug in t equals one, well, one property that you know is that the derivative of the Jindra polynomial. Derivative of the Jendra polynomial can be written in terms of a Jendra polynomial of higher degree, but sorry, lower degree, but higher dimension, given by this formula. This can be shown by Rodriguez formula. And we also know that the Legendre polynomial evaluated at one is one. So we can compute the derivative at one. This is given by this number here. We plug in this in the first equation in equation one. So in this one. So in this one, and then we rearrange the terms and basically this gives us the upper bound for the interval. And for the lower bound, we need to make another choice of TCO. So ideally, sorry for doing this. Ideally, in the second equation, we would like to kind of find the maximum or minimum of this function here. However, that's quite complicated because Complicated because we don't know what this function is. But it turns out that if I take the minimizer of the Legendre polynomial, that's good enough. That's actually close enough to the minimizer of this thing. And that's what I do. So I take T0 to be a critical point, the minimizer of the gender polynomial. And then I use this differential equation satisfied by the gender polynomials to get. By the gender polynomials, to get basically the value of the second derivative times one minus this square in terms of the polynomial itself. And using this information here in the second equation with T0, well, this term here vanishes. Then you know this is just the minimum. And in here, you compute this in terms of this one. So you can just rearrange everything. So, you can just rearrange everything again, and then you will basically obtain the lower bound of the interval. And once you have these two intervals, you can estimate the quotient of the multipliers and you obtain the desired inequality for the multipliers of the spherical convolution transform. And once you have this inequality, you can obtain the classifications of the fixed point equation. Of the fixed point equation and also the iterations of the mean cost evaluation in a rather different way, but this is one of the essential ingredients of both proofs. I think this is the end of my talk. Thank you very much for listening.
