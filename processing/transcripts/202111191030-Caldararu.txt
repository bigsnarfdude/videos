Wisconsin. We're going to talk about skyrocketable emergency ions and beach and joe online. Thank you very much for the invitation. It was a wonderful time here. The scheme was very good. I would like to, first of all, maybe take the opportunity to thank the organizers. Alright, so I will talk about uh some work in progress um with um um my student Joan Fan Hay and um uh plus earlier work with uh Kevin Costellov and Drew Motor. So I want to begin since this is a conference on derived categories Many people might not be so familiar with Gromovitan invariants. So I want to talk a little bit about what Gromovittin invariants are. It's a fairly classical subject, but I want to give a simple example so you have something motivating the project. So imagine that you have a target space. So you start with a target space x, let's say, and you want to count Um uh curves of a certain genus in X. That's the main question that Gromovit and invariants are solving. So when you count curves you really maybe you're not counting really curves, you're counting maps from C to X. So you're asking the number of maps Maps from C plus X, where C is some curve of genus G. Maybe you put some marked points on the curve and that allows you to fix some conditions through some divisors, for example, where those points must lie, things of that sort. So rather than try to develop a completely general theory, let me give you a concrete example. So let's say X is an elliptic curve. It turns out that Gromovin invariants are deformation invariant, so it doesn't really matter which elliptic curve I'm going to work with here. And I'm going to count from From curves from C to X, where genus of C equals to 1. And if I'm trying to count like this, there's kind of no hope. There's way too many such maps. You actually put two more conditions. This is built in the theory of Romovitan invariance, and I'm not telling you how, but I'm going to ask such that the degree. going to ask such that the degree of this map F is some kind of N, or let's call it D, and such that a fixed point in C maps to a fixed point in X. So it it is a map of elliptic curves, if you want, not just a map of curves of genus one. Map of curves of genus 1. You try to understand such maps, and it's very easy to understand this in terms of lattices. I will skip the discussion of how you do this, but it's very classical analysis. Such maps are isogenies. So you're looking at isogenies of degree D. That's the question. It turns out that it's the number That it's the number of the following types of matrices K L 0 D over K where K divides D and L is between 0 and K minus 1 and K minus 1. So you can show that you can basically Can basically such maps are parametrized by sub-lattices of a fixed lattice of index D. And to find such that's the same thing if you choose a basis it's matrices of determinant in matrices with integer coefficients of determinant D. Of determinant D up to conjugation by elements in SL2Z. And you can show that any such matrix admits a canonical, if you want, think of this like a Jordan canonical form in some sense with some block, with a block, but you can't make this one like you would do it for a Jordan canonical formula. You have to, but you can make it be in between 0 and k. Okay? But then you see that Then you see that for this number is exactly the number of such k's because sorry, so this is summation over all k divides d of this k. Right? Because all you have to do is pick some k which divides d, and then for each one of those k this number is fixed, and this number, there's exactly k choices for it. And this is a number which in number theory should. And this is a number which in number theory shows up very frequently. It's called sigma 1 of t. The sum of the divisors of t. Alright, and this is called, this would be written as the Gromovittin invariant with a search and class of point at genus 1, one marked point of x is equal to this sigma 1 of t. Right, so it depends on all these kind of information. This is very, very old. This is certainly early 1990s. Maybe you can find this calculation in papers from that time. Now, what you do in Gromovitan theory is you're saying, okay, well, we have all these numbers defined for this 1,1 for this particular. For this particular type of invariants, why don't we assemble them into a power series? That's something combinatorialists always do. So you're looking at the power series and you use a variable q. So you're going to put q to the d here. And you're going to take summation, the coefficient in front of q. The coefficient in front of 2 to the d will be your invariant. Now, there is also the question of what should you do for this made sense as long as you had maps of some positive degree. You could ask what happens if you have degree zero. The Gromobitan theory provides an answer, which is more complicated. You need to work with virtual fundamental classes and whatever not. But the answer is that in the Whatever not. But the answer is that in degree zero it's minus one over 24. So this is a q to the 0 coefficient. It's some calculation that you can do, not very hard. Any beginning graduate student can do this, and we're going to call this F11 of Q equals to this. And then anybody who has studied a little bit of number theory, A little bit of number theory stares at this and recognizes this as a very important function that appears in number theory. This is called the Eisenstein or maybe minus 1 over 24 times C2 of Q. This is the Eisenstein Basimodular. Holomorphic form of latitude. Okay? So it's a function that appears naturally number theory. So now there is an interesting question that you might ask yourself. Up until now, the Up until now, the variable q really had absolutely no meaning. You thought about this q as just a way to keep track of these numbers that you were putting together. It didn't have a meaning. There was no substantive meaning of the question, what does it mean to calculate f11 at the value q equals to 79? But number theories certainly think about this as an actual function on the upper half. An actual function on the upper half plane. So this people think of as a function on the upper half plane, complex upper body half plane, imaginary part of tau greater than zero. And in order to really relate tau and q, you take q equals to e to the 2 pi i tau. e to the 2i i. This is a standard thing that you see in numbers. So now there is a meaning to assigning actual values to this skew. So you really now imagine that this is a function on some kind of moduli space. And you ask the physicists and they And you ask the physicists and they tell you it's a Kayler moduli space. They denote this by M Kayler of the original X. It's some kind of space which us as mathematicians do not have a good idea what this is. Locally, it is modeled fundamentally by you can see that this D you can see that this D was important in this Q to the D and this D is the degree of the map. So this is somehow related to the choices of degrees that you can take. So maybe it's related to H2 of X very vaguely. So the reason that I have only one variable here, Q, in general I could have more than one variable, is related to the fact that the second homology Second homology of my X was one mesh, right? Okay. So keep in mind this picture that somehow what I've discovered is that I, by doing Romo-Witten theory, I have some special point here, q equals to 0, that's of interest to us. And in a neighborhood of it, at least, I have defined this function f11. function F11. And this is a picture of what I would call the moduli space of Getter structure. So this is the beginning of Gromo-Witten theory, very classical story. Any questions? Now you might ask, okay, well, if, so there are a few Well, so there are a few observations that are important to make at this point about this whole story. So if somebody told you, I give you this function f11, you would not yet know the Gromo-Witten invariance. So if If somehow by some magic I could calculate this function f11, I cannot yet compute the individual bromovitanymariates. And why is that? The coefficients required me to know what Q was also. If I just had an abstract function on this moduli space, I would need to know with respect to what coordinate am I actually expanding. So, what I do need A canonical coordinate around Q equals T. So somehow the way we've defined this is a little backwards. We've started by calculating the invariant, which in general is a hard job. We've assembled them into a formal We've assembled them into a formal power series. Then we took the idea of: well, this is not just a formal power series, it has a meaning as a function. And so we've decided there's some kind of function in this area. Maybe that's a more interesting thing to study. And if I want to recover my chromovid invariance, I would have to do some kind of Taylor expansion of this. But to do Taylor expansion, I need to know with... To do Taylor expansion, I need to know with respect to what coordinate. And I'm telling you that the coordinate was Q for us. We started out by doing this formally, but then we realized that this Q equals V to the 2 pi tau is the coordinate that we are working with. But that seems a little bit coming from out of nowhere. Why was this the coordinate? Alright. Let me make some other important observation. The other important observation is that F11 is holomorphic, but not modular. It is only what's known as quasi-modular. So holomorphic, it's obvious. So holomorphic, it's obvious. I wrote it as a power series in Q. Certainly it's holomorphic, wherever it's convergent. Quasimodular means that somehow it doesn't really... If I think about this upper half plane as being acted on by SL2Z to make it the moduli space of elliptic curves, which there's no good reason why I would want to do that. Let me be clear that this is just an observation for now. This function would not come somehow from a function or a section of a line bundle from the quotient. It does not play well with the action of SL2Z. But so this F11 was this basically to with some coefficient, but there is a There is a modular modification of it, which is called E2 star, which is just E2 plus some kind of, I don't remember exactly, something like 2 pi i over tau minus tau bar, something of that sort. More or less, I don't remember the exact coefficient here, but something of this sort, which is. But something of this sort, which is modular, but no longer holomorphic. You can see that I have a tau bar here, which stops it from being holomorphic, but it's now modular. Okay, now the way you should think about this is somehow as saying that As saying that this F11 really only makes sense in some kind of relatively small neighborhood of this point. That if I try to extend it, even though this E2 business actually makes sense as a function on the whole upper half plane, it's convergent. It will not behave well when I go far away. When I go far away. And somehow, the reason is: if you think a little bit about the geometry of the upper half plane, in the neighborhood of the point, so this point q equals to 0 corresponds to tau being equal to I infinity. In the neighborhood of I infinity, if you think about the upper half plane maybe like this, and you have the fundamental domain of the SL2Z action, the point Action. The point I infinity here, if I want to look just at the neighborhood around here, the only part of the SL2Z action that survives is tau goes to tau plus 1. Right? The SL2Z, if you think about it, is generated by two generators. One is tau goes to tau plus one and one is tau goes to minus one over tau. Tau goes to tau plus one preserves this condition of having a large imaginary part. Imaginary part being high up. On the other hand, tau goes to minus 1 over tau takes stuff that's way up there to stuff that's way down here, so it doesn't stick inside there. Now, because I took my q to be e to the 2 pi i tau, this is invariant under this. So, under this part of the, as long as I stick inside here, this F11 is modular. Modular in the sense that it behaves well with the part of the The part of the modular group that acts on this piece of this, on this small neighborhood. But the moment I move far away and I include points that are down there, I'm going to see discrepancies that this function does not behave well with respect to the full modular. Okay, so keep those facts in mind. Now I'm going to move on to the next topic. Move on to the next topic, which is let me see what did I want to say next. Yeah, let me say something about categorical enumerative invariants. So This is a topic that has been around for at least ever since Konsevich gave his famous talk at the ICM in 1994. But really, maybe I should say, Koncevich 94, Costello. Costello 05 and then myself with Costello and 2 2020. We have some papers. Before we move on, can I ask, do we know what this stringy gellermoduli space looks like in this case? We can only say what it is locally. Physicists tell us that there is some global gadget, but we have no idea. Is some global gadget, but we have no idea what that means. I don't think so. So we know that in this area, it should look like the quotient of upper half space mod is tau goes to tau plus 1. And in some other area here, around tau star equals to e to the 2 pi i over 6, which is this corner, if you want, in this neighborhood, it also looks like the quotient of like the quotient of the plane by tau goes to tau minus one over tau, which preserves this point. But I don't think we know we have a global construction of this. I mean people who do Britland stability conditions are very interested in this. There is this conjecture that globally it should be some kind of you take a quadratic inside something like you take a hypersurface inside the bridgeland stability condition. The bridgeland stability condition space and then you take a Lagrangian inside there, but that's just wild speculation as far as I'm a sent. All right. So what are categorical enumerative invariants? This all started from trying to make sense of physics, the physics of mirror symmetry. So let me erase this and try to explain to you what mirror symmetry is. To what mirror symmetry has to do with this. So, we were able, in this particular case, we were able to calculate the Gromo-Wittney invariance by hand. But in general, computing Gromo-Wittin invariance is a hard job. So, the big development was made by the Candelas, Delawasa, Green and Park paper in 1994-95, where basically they Where basically they said the following thing. We have this picture of the moduli space of Kayla structures on some space X, and we have some point here, which is called the large volume limit. And we have some neighborhood around it. And here we have some function. And here we have some function fgn, maybe depending on some parameter q, we have some function which is just the power series of Gromov-Witten invariants, power series encoding. So we have this first half of the picture that for elliptic curves we've seen exactly how it looks like. They said there might They said there must be some other picture which looks identical from the outside, but constructed for a very different space. So there is a moduli space of complex structure on some other space, x check. So they say if you want to calculate the growth invariance of this x, you don't know how to calculate them, but you assume that there are some such invariants, you put them in a power series, and you think of that as a function on this module. You think of that as a function on this moduli space of Keller structures. They say, well, what you should actually do is construct another space x-check, the mirror of x. Look at the moduli space of complex structures on it. We know what that is. Luckily, that's no problem. It's moduli space of deformations of complex structures on this space X check. There should be a point here called the large complex structure limit point. And a neighborhood of the large complex structure limit point. Those two spaces should be matched by something called a mirror map. And over here there should be some other function, some more easily computed function, which corresponds to this Fgn. corresponds to this Fgn. So somehow they would tell you if you want to calculate the Gromovin invariance of this space X, here's the procedure. Find the mirror, compute this function over here, which should correspond to that function over here, figure out what the canonical coordinate is here. So you need plus a canonical coordinate which matches to which matches which matches to which matches q. So you need to figure out not just what this function is which corresponds to this, you need to figure out also what corresponds to q under the mirror map. And then take this new function and expand it as a power series in this canonical coordinate that should read off for you the Gromo-Witty invariance for the original space. For the original space. That is the prediction of mirror symmetry. When people started out in Handelas, De Lausa, Greenham Parks, and for a long time, the genus was always zero. You were computing genus zero Gromovnin invariance. And what they said was, well, the genus zero Gromo-Witten invariance, so counting rational curves in your space X, if you will. Curves in your space X, if you want. That should correspond to something about deformations of complex structure here, which are encoded in Hodge structures. So this function, this easily computed function, had something to do with variation of Hodge structures. So you look at all the varieties in this neighborhood, you count the variables. This neighborhood, you calculate something about periods, if that's what you is your favorite thing, that tells us how the Hodge structures move here, and that is this function. And in fact, this canonical coordinate is also related to the variation of Hodge structure. However, this business is true if the genus is zero. If the genus is not zero, Not zero, nobody has a good candidate for what this function should be. There is some physics approach called the BCOV approach, but that's kind of something that I don't think mathematicians have a way to address it. And even that doesn't fully tell you what the function is. Alright, so the other approach to figuring out what mirror symmetry is supposed to be. out what mirror symmetry is supposed to be telling you for genus greater than zero. So if you try to understand, for example, how to recover this F11, remember that this F11 for us is genus 1. So we need something. The answer lies in Konsevich's homological mirror symmetry, which says something like this. We should imagine, even though this is not fully correct, that at every point here, That at every point here, we have some form of the Fukaya category. So, Fukaya category of the original space at some particular Q. So, you imagine that somehow the Fukaya category, which a priori is only defined over some Novikov ring, if you know what that is, it can be specialized, so it's something purely formal, but can be specialized at particular values of Q and then you have a particular category. You have a particular category defined over your ground field, and that is some category. The prediction is that you look at the matching point to that particular q, you should get the derived category of x, let's call this mirror map phi, of phi of q. x check. So remember we had a family of complex manifolds here for each one. Complex manifolds here. For each one of them, I can compute its derived categories. They vary with the point in the moduli space you have. And the variation of this family of derived categories is completely matched by the variation of the Foucault category. So homological mirror symmetry is saying that somehow this Foucault category of x evaluated at Q is the same thing as the derived category of x check at this point 5. Well x check at this point phi of q where phi is my mirror. So now if you take this homological mirror symmetry as the basis for everything you should imagine that somehow maybe there is a way to recover this easily computed function here which is the same as this function here just from this equivalence. Equivalence. So the idea of categorical enumerative invariance is define the Chromov-Witten potential FGN directly from the Foucault categories. From this. So think about this family. from this. So think about this family of Foucault categories. If I have some kind of a way to define this function purely without looking at x, just looking at the Foucault category of x and how it varies with the coordinate q, that would give me a function here. So hopefully this exact function which was abstractly just the power series encoding the Gromo-Witten invariants. Because then maybe I could do Because then maybe I could do the same calculation. Of course, because the Foucault category is the same as the derived category of the family of varieties here, and it encodes how the derived categories vary here, maybe I could do the calculation here and get this more easily computable function. So this is exactly what categorical and numerative invariance do. Categorical and numerative invariants do, then I'm going to tell you almost nothing about how they're defined because the definition is two 60-page papers and it's still impenetrable. But the moral of this is you should imagine that the goal of defining categorical and numerative invariants is to define something which has exactly the same flavor of this Fgn, but where the input is no longer x. Is no longer x, a space x, but rather just a smooth, proper Calabial category and a little bit more data. And I'm going to tell you what a little bit more data means in a minute. But this is the main idea. Somehow, if you can do this, the fact that homological mirror symmetry tells you that this category is the same as this category will tell you automatically that the function that you calculate here. That you calculate here is the same as the function that you calculate here. Okay? I like to think about this categorical and numerative invariance as a joke. I think it was said, I haven't verified this, but this might be apocryphal, but somehow that somebody asked Einstein how the wireless telegraph works. And he said, well, do you know how the wired telegraph works? I think I do. Well, I think I do. Well, how does it work? Well, here is how I think of it. There's a cat with its tail in New York and its head in Los Angeles. You pull on the tail of the cat in New York and the cat meows in Los Angeles. That's a wired telegraph. Well, the wireless telegraph is exactly the same, but without the cat. So this is kind of the same thing. We have the... we're trying to define We are trying to define categorical enumerative invariance, which would be like Romo-Witten invariants. Normally we would need the space x, but we remove the space x out of the equation. We only remember the character equation. Alright. Now, there is one most important ingredient that is still needed here, which I told you it is there, but I haven't. But I haven't yet told you what it is. So, categorical and meritive invariants take as input a smooth proper Calabial category C plus one extra piece of data which is called a splitting of the non-common Of the non-commutative Hodge filtration for C. So this non-commutative Haudi filtration is the it's coming from the spectral sequence which tells you that the oxial homology of C double bracket U converges to the negative Converges to the negative cyclic homology F C. And there's always such a spectral sequence, and if the category is smooth and proper, this degenerates at E1. There's a theorem which in the case that C comes from a smooth and smooth and proper variety is Variety is just the main theorem of Hodge theory. If in the more general cases, it's due to you could attribute it to Delini-Rousy, and there is now a version for arbitrary, it's most proper Calabina categories due to Kaladi. Alright, so what is this in What is this in concrete terms? Because this sounds super abstract. So let me try to say again in concrete terms for C equals to the derived category of an elliptic curve. There is no interesting Hodge structure on an elliptic curve in H0 and H2. It's only happening. It's only happening in H1. And in H1, you have this story that you have a short exact sequence which looks like this. H0 omega 1 goes to H1 Duram. This is algebraic Duram cohomology, but if you don't like that, it's just ordinary Duram cohomology. And the quotient is H1 of E. Right? Everybody knows that I. Right? Everybody knows that H1 deram has a decomposition into H10 and H01. This is two-dimensional vector space. This is one and one. This space naturally sits inside here. This one does not. It's naturally a quotient. So a splitting of the Hodge filtration is a splitting is the same as a splitting. is the same as a splitting of this of this shorted axioms. So you might say, okay, well, but I know when I studied the Griffiths and Harris, I know that actually this sits inside here. This guy is generated by dz. If you run an elliptic curve, there is a canonical up-to-scalar multiple of this. So dz goes to dz. So DZ goes to DZ and whatever generator we choose here we can map it here to DZ bar. People always talk about actually the rum the Hodge decomposition as a direct sum. It's saying this plus this equals to this. Now the point is that this part of the so Part of the so this is just one choice of splitting. I'm telling you one way to split h1 deram as a sum of those two by saying well it's generated by dz and dz bar. But that doesn't have to be the only splitting you're using and in fact this is not the right splitting that you're using here. So this splitting, this one that I just told you is called the complex conjugate. The complex conjugate splitting, which is a perfectly fine splitting, but it might not be the right one for us. Any questions? So, what I'm saying is, if I want to calculate my categorical and numerative invariance for this family of elliptic curves, of elliptic curves. I need to know the family of derived categories of elliptic curves as it varies around the point q equals to zero. That's fine, I know I have elliptic curves, I know how their derived categories vary. I also need to choose for each elliptic curve a splitting of the Hodge filtration, which means a choice here. I could do this splitting, nobody stops me from doing this. Splitting. Nobody stops me from doing this splitting. But I would not get the function that encodes the Gromobiden invariant. In fact, if I do this, so if we compute the 1, 1 invariant, so let's say C E I 1 1 over the family of elliptic curves, so E. Of elliptic curves, so EQ, let's say, using the complex conjugate splitting, so I'm going to abbreviate that as CC. Turns out that I get something very meaningful, but not exactly what I wanted. I get minus 1 over 24 e to star of capital. So the function that I get here is I get here is not E2, which is what I wanted, I get the modular version of that. Now you think about it, and it's kind of not surprising at all. This splitting does not vary holomorphically with the curve. So it's not surprising that this answer is no longer holomorphic. On the other hand, this splitting is defined at each single point of the moduli space of elliptic curves. This does not care about. Elliptic curves. This does not care about nearby fibers or anything. So it must be modular. It's completely defined for just an elliptic curve. I don't care for a particular lift of it to the upper half plane. So the question is, what splitting should I use to get E2 instead? E2 instead. The answer comes from Fukaya category stories. Turns out that there is a natural splitting of the hot filtration here, which is the main property of it is that it is monodromy invariant with respect to the Dubrovin connection. But the answer is The answer is nearer to saying flat with respect to the Broving connection, which turns out to be flat with respect to Gauss-Mannin connection. Which is another splitting which sends this generator instead of sending it to dz bar, it's going to send it to So I have this other choice of sending it to something that's like to do a calculation, it's one over tau minus tau bar dz minus dz dz bar minus dz. Something of that sort. You can see that this is something that also spans a vector space. Spans a vector space that's different from dz because it has a non-trivial dz bar part. So it does give me a splitting of this two-dimensional vector space. And you do a calculation with periods, it's very easy. You can find that this one is flat with respect to the Gauss-Pony induction. So the theorem that you can do is you calculate the categorical and numerative invariants for this family of derived categories with respect to this monogramy invariant splitting. Splitting, and you get indeed yes. And now you can see why what we got was holomorphic but not modular. This monotromy invariant connection varies holomorphically, it turns out. And moreover, it's not modular because I cannot say what it means to be monodromy invariant as long as I have a big moduli space. I can say what it means to be monodromy invariant around the cusp point, but that in But that in general. All right, so this is the second aspect of the storyline. So is there like, what is the space of splittings? The space of splitting. Yeah, so for a single elliptic curve, it's a P1. It's a P1. Yeah, because you've got a two-dimensional vector space. You remove a one, or maybe an A1. So you need to look at all the lines in this, yeah, an A1. In this, yeah, an A1. You look need to look at all the lines in this two-dimensional vector space, but which are not parallel to the given line given by this. You just need another line. It's an A1. But the point is, you don't care only for one elliptic curve. You want to do it in the whole family. So now this is a function on the moduli space. Right? So it's something with values in A1. But these are the two important. But these are the two important splittings that we'll care about. The complex conjugate splitting and the monodromy invariant splitting. I mean, I'm just curious, so what happens if, like, can you tell exactly what happens to the 1,1 invariance, for example, for any choice of splitting? No. No. I have no idea, but I guess. Alright. Now, alright. Now I need to tell you about another story. Sorry, it's not. Sorry, it's not a good novelist technique to introduce a new character in the last pages of a book, but I have to do this. So I'm going to tell you about FJRW invariants. These stand for Van Jarvis one Witten. They were introduced a while ago following a suggestion by Witten. So here So here the input to this story is something like a polynomial which for us in this story will be something like x cubed plus y cubed plus z cubed. This will be the potential and plus a group A group of symmetries which we will take g to be z mod 3 acting diagonally on the three variables. The output of this Romo FDRW theory is invariants which are very similar, similar. To Romo-Witten invariant. But now instead of the input being a space, the input is a polynomial on A3. Just for those of you who, since this is more of a derived category of this, you think about the relationship between derived categories and matrix factorization. Derived categories, you take just Factorization. Derived categories, you take just a space. Matrix factorization, it's a space with a potential. Same thing, but now you're doing A model, so Foucault categories and so on. And you can extract this kind of Romo-Witten FGRW invariants, which are similar, but not equal. They're just different numbers, very substantially different. Now, there is a major conjecture in the field, which is called the Lago-Guilt-Calabian correct. The Langdon-Guiltberg Calabian correspondence, which says FJRW invariants in their totality determine and are determined by the Gromo-Wittin invariants. So if you know the Gromo-Wittin invariance of elliptic curves, all the Gromo-Wittini invariants, at all genera and all, genera and all n, you should be able to read off the FGRW invariance for this polynomial and vice versa. Okay? Think about it a lot like Orlov's theorem, which says derived category of matrix vectorizations in some homogeneous settings are derived categories of Calabian manifolds. Now this was proved Four elliptic curves by Li Shen and Zhou. This is a paper in 2020 for all genera. So, and I'm going to tell you what they tell you to do, to figure out how to calculate FGRW invariance if you know the FGRW invariance if you know the Gromo-Wittman invariance. What you're supposed to do is the following bizarre procedure. They pulled it out of thin air, but this is what they say. And I'm not going to write it down because it's just too complicated to write down, but I'll explain. You have this function here. You calculate the Chromo-Widney invariance here. That gives you a function. Now that function is not defined far away. That function is not defined far away because it's not modular. You replace it by its modular version. So you replace E2 by E2 star, basically. There is something called modular completion which always allows you to do that. You replace a function by its modular version. Now you've got the function defined everywhere. But it's not holomorphic. You look at the other point, e to the at the other point e to the 2πi over 6 which corresponds to this particular polynomial, which is a point that's far away from the large volume limit. You look here and now you have a function that's not holomorphic, so it doesn't quite make sense to expand it in a holomorphic coordinate here. Because you would get some coefficients that are, it doesn't make sense to do a Taylor series with respect just to the holomorphic coordinate. But you replace it again by But you replace it again by a... So now you replace it by a holomorphic version of that. You throw away the non-holomorphic part and expand here with respect to some canonical coordinate here. That's our procedure. So imagine I have a function here, but I cannot extend it to here. I change it to get something that's defined everywhere, but which is not holomorphic. I look at that function over here. I look at that function over here, I throw away the non-holomorphic part that I've added, and then I expand it in a power series. The coefficients will be the FGRW invariants. They prove this by a very ad hoc procedure. So it's not... The only way they prove this is they say, well, FGRW invariant satisfies some differential equations, Gromo-Witten invariant satisfies some other differential equation. This procedure changes. Procedure changes the differential equation in just the right way. So if you had Gromovid invariance here, you must be getting the FDR, something that satisfies the differential equation. So it must be the FDRW invariance, as long as some initial conditions are satisfied. Is this motivated at least by somehow how the KLM moduli should like fit together at the two different at the Land W square point and the Lie volume points? Or is it They don't say. I I'm not going to try to speculate where they came up with this for. Where they came up with this for many years. Now I'm going to try to give you my interpretation of this. So I'm going to suggest what should happen on the B model side. So on the B model side, we also have these two areas, one the large complex structure limit point and one e to the two pi i over six here. I over 6 here. Again, here we have a splitting to calculate the Gromov-Whitney invariance. So to calculate the Gromo-Whitney invariance or the B-model Gromo-Whitney invariance, here we needed to use the monodromy invariant splitting. But I could use the complex conjugate splitting, which I told you gives me something modular. So this, I can do a calculation in the complex conjugate splitting, which I told you is defined everywhere. So here's Okay. So here is my main conjecture. For any categorical and numerative invariance, i.e. for any GFN, CEI of Gn for the family of elliptic curves. Or the family of elliptic curves, maybe let's say EQ. Computed with respect to the complex conjugate splitting is the, I will write Kz, this is the modular completion of the categorical and numerative invariance at G and N computed in the monodrome invariant. In the monodromy invariant splitting of the same thing. So remember, I told you that for the 1,1 invariant, this one was E2, this one was E2 star, and this Kanekozaguier functor, it's replacing E2 by E2 star. So this modular completion process is exactly what I told you is. Is this replacing a quasi modular holomorphic form with a modular but quasi-holomorphic form? So this is a conjecture. Now you might ask, okay, so this would explain why these guys are doing what they're doing. I'm saying I'm trying to compare the Bromo-Wittlin invariants with the FJRW invariance. How do I do this? How do I do this? I need something, some kind of invariant that's defined at both areas. And that's a complex conjugate splitting, the calculation in the complex conjugate splitting. So I need to somehow relate my Chromo-Witten invariant with the invariance calculated in the complex conjugate splitting. And then I need to compute, compare the invariants calculated again in the modular invariance splitting. Those would be my FJRW invariance. My FJRW invariant, if I calculate around here, with a complex conjugate splitting. So, from this point of view, both Chromo-Wittin invariants and FGRW invariance are exactly the same thing. They're computing categorical numerative invariants with respect to the monodrome invariant splitting around some points of the moduli space. There is no difference between one and the other. And the other. The only difference is that they, no, I cannot directly compare them because they're not defined in the same parts of the moduli space. To compare them, I need to go through this intermediate complex conjugate splitting, and that explains exactly why I need this funky procedure of Lichen-Jou, of taking a holomorphic quasimodular form, turning it into a modular form, turning it back into a holomorphic quasimodular form. It back into a holomorphic quasi-modular form. This is a conjecture. Now, I can tell you just in one word why we believe this should be true. I didn't get any chance to tell you about it, but one of the most important parts of the theory of categorical and numerative invariance is the question, how do my invariants change if I change my splitting? Change my splitting. This is controlled by something called the given tal group. It's something that appears extremely well known for people in Romo-Witten theory when they try to compare the various semi-simple theories. But it makes sense for arbitrary theories which are not necessarily semi-simple. And it gives you a complete formula for how to go from one splitting to another. From one splitting to another in terms of invariance. So the given tau group is a group which it's a group and the space of possible splittings is a torso over it. So if you want to go from one splitting to another, you're going from one to another by means of a given tau group element. And the action of the given tau group is The given tau group is controlled completely by there are formulas in terms of sums over stable graphs. So basically, what we are saying is that the action of the given tau group element, which is maybe CC minus Mi, by which I symbolically mean that. By which I symbolically mean the given tale group element which takes you from the monodromy invariance to the complex conjugate splitting is exactly this modular completion functor connectors ambient. I think I'll stop here. Questions? Okay, I have a couple of questions. So, I mean, this is interesting. So, the Gimatal group, so first of all, are these two theories semi-simple? No. They're both not semi-simple. No, elliptic curves do not have a semi-simple. So, okay, so then you're saying, first of all, like for every splitting, there's some Viantau loop action, right? So, you're saying that for every splitting? Yes, so. Yes, so the given tall group is telling me, so it's a torsor. So if I have two splittings and I want to go from one to the other, the given tall group action tells me how if I compute the categorical and numerative invariants with respect to one splitting, how they will be related to the ones computed in the other splitting. So I guess some of this is also related to the thing that I was wondering earlier, like if you choose a different splitting, which is now not either of these. So you're saying that. No, not either of these. So you're saying that you should be able to get there by just applying a given toggle by. Yeah, it's just that the formulas are some kind of complicated we there is a formula, but the formula is some kind of sum overall stable graphs, which is some kind of a mess. The whole thing that we are saying here is that for going from this particular splitting to this particular splitting, the formula should be extremely simple. The given tau group action So the given tau group action, even though a priori seems to be extremely complicated for these two splittings. And can you write down a stable, like subs write down both of these, or one of them at least has a somewhere stable class, like in the in NGN? Like the category of the invariant? One of these invariants? Yeah, either one of them. No, no. This is not semi-simple. The invariants themselves are. Are calculated by, I mean, Okunkov, Pandaripande, tell you what all the invariants are here, for example. They are some, they are not trivially determined just by some sober stable graphs. But still, I can still, knowing these either one of those, I can still compute in principle what happens under a Yodo brush. Yeah, so they're No, the given tau element? Yeah, the given tau element actually is uh something like um I don't remember the exact formula, but it's something like 2 pi i over tau minus tau bar dz. Something like that. So I should have said what this is. For elliptic curves, it's a very simple thing. You need to give a map from You just need to give me, to tell me where dz bar goes. So you need a map from h minus 1 to h 1. So you need to pick one particular element, and we have computed this, and this is what the given tau element is. So essentially, in the sums of stable graphs, Of stable graphs, every time we have this is a propagator over edges, I don't know if you know. You have to put this particular element. I'm not entirely sure if you want, I can look it up. It's something of that sort. It's dz times some constant which depends on tau minus tau bar. But this you can also translate into some sort of R matrix or something. You can write down like a. I think so, yeah, yeah. And this also exposure, yeah. I also have another question. So can you also can you do something like this in the setting of, let's say, funnels or something? No, I said that the categorical numerator invariants absolutely have to have as input a collabial category. This is essential, I think. This is essential, yeah. However, it depends what you want to do with Fanos. You cannot do derived categories. Is Fanos. You cannot do derived categories of Fanos as inputs, but you can put Foucault categories of Fanos because those are always Calabia. Always. So you can compute Gromo-Wittin invariants but you need to take the mirror of a funnel which is some kind of Landau Gisberg model, which again is somehow cannot you know dissolve it. Yeah. Okay, if there are no more questions, let's hand over again. And that brings us to the end. Thanks, everyone. It was fun. Thank you. Maybe let's thank the organizers one more time. So if there's a question for you in the chat, what is the question? Okay. Oh, Shenigan, yeah. Sure, thank you. Okay. Oh, Shinyan, yeah, Shepherd's perfect. Yeah, right. Yeah, I'll answer up to the other one.
