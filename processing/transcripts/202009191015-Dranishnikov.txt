Thank you. First, I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me. I'm going to speak about topological complexity of hyperbolic groups. Well, let me recall the main definition here. It's been recalled several times. If you have apological If you have topological space X and subset of the product of X with itself, a motion planning algorithm on that set is a continuous map to space of paths such that for each pair of points, the path is between these two points. So the value of S and these two points is the path between them. Between them. And the main definition of the talk, due to Misha Parker, topological complexity of a space is defined as a minimum integer k such that x cross x admits an open cover by k plus 1 sets such that on each ui there is a motion planning algorithm. So important part, I consider reduced I consider reduced complexity in this talk. Okay, so this well-known definition. And so Tc is a numerical invariant in the spirit of Lustering-Schneidermann category cat. They both are homotopy invariants. And they indeed similar, let me come to... Similar, let me compare the definitions. So, Listen-Schneidermann category of X is a minimal interject K such that X admits a cover by K plus one open set such that on each UI can be deformed in X to a point. Topological complexity, very similar, is a minimal integer k such that X cross X admins a cover by K. admins a cover by K plus one open sets and on each UI each UI to type us here can be deformed in X cross X to the diagonal so the difference in one you deform cells to a point and in the other to the diagonal and natural question maybe T C is not really new invariant maybe T C of X is just the category See of X is just the category of the quotient space. You collapse the diagnostic point. And it's answers yes for many known spaces. And later on, I found that the answer is no for non-orientable surfaces. And the reason there, of course, in the fundamental group. And I like the question of problem by Lucille. Maybe this still holds tofers into kinetic space. Still host over symptomatic spaces? Still open? Good question. Okay, so yeah, one remark on the definition. So originally the thermic engineering one used closed sets in the definition. In the forties, Ralph Fox proved that one can use open sets with the same result for nice spaces, nice such C level complexes or manifolds. Sea-level complexes of manifolds, generally ANRs. And relatively recently, my student Tulsi approved that in the case of nice spaces, one can use any kind of cells. And the result will be the same for CAT and for TC. Now, TC of topological groups is really nice. There is lemma by Schmuel. By a small Weinberger topological group, Tc of the group is just the same as a category. And then, say for example, Tc of n torus is N. Well, because category is N. Now, the main subject of my talk is TC of discrete groups. Groups. And see, for this case group pi, you can define the category as a category of BÏ€ or the classifying space, the same as K pi 1. And the same you can do for T C. T C of pi is T C of B of pi. So in most cases, these are well defined since this complex. This complex complexes BG are homotopy equivalent. And remark: if pi contains torsion element, then the category and the same is T C both equals zero. So we consider torsion-free groups here. And for the category, So, for the category, Eilenberg and Gagnier prove that it's actually the cognological dimension of a group. The category of a group is the same as cognological dimension. So let me recall that cognological dimension of a group pi is a maximal n such that the n-dimensional cohomology of a group are non-zero with coefficients in some pi module. And I use conventional. And I use convention, I use comma for cognology of group. If it's a cognology of space, then semicolon. And if you don't want to go in this definition in details, it's just easier reformulation. It cognological dimension not two, then the dimension is a minimal dimension of Eilenger-Maclean spaces representing. Magnetic space is represented by an index theorem. Now, say or category is just cognitive dimension, but for topological complexity you have this inequality between cognitive dimension of the group and cognitive dimension of its And cognitive dimension of its square. And Duncorn and Rodiak, they noticed that for any n and k, k between n and 2n, there is a group G with cosmological dimension n and topological complexity k. So it means every value can be taken between. Okay, so So it means you can compute a topological complexity of a group and it's actually a challenging problem. And I'm going to consider hyperbolic groups and hyperbolic groups are generic in some sense, depends on a measure by result of Gromov. By result of Gromov. And also, if you consider random, so it's a random group is hyperbolic, you can say that. And if you consider random simplicial complexes, they are aspherical. So it means computation of topological complexity for random spaces is just exactly the computation of topological complexity of hyperbolic groups. And let me recall the definition due to Gromov, say. Say, we consider a pointly generated group, a symmetric generating set, and it's called chromohyperbolic if there is a number delta such that every geodesic triangle in the Curie graph is delta thin. And delta thin means if you consider delta neighborhood of two sides of your triangle, then the third side lies inside of the unit. Lies inside of the union of these two delta net. And actually, yeah, as I said, a tangled in a metric space is delta sine if every side of it is contained in the delta neighborhood of the other two. And in this talk, I exclude integers from being hyperbolic. Well, Well, it's it, I mean, it's maybe not very general opinion. Formally it's hyperbolic, but it's Euclidean. And so it doesn't have hyperbolic properties. So for us, Z in this talk is not hyperbolic. To make some formulation easier. Easier. And the main result for torsion-free hyperbolic groups, Tc of pi is two times the dimension, cognitive dimension of pi. And the previous result by Farbe and Mescher was that for torsion-free hyperbolic groups is either Groves, it's either C D of cosmological dimensions of pi cross pi or that dimension minus one. Okay, now the rest of the talk are going to discuss the ideas of the proof and maybe the discussion of the proof. See, the main two results. Two results which I use in the proof are the following, and they are relatively new. First, I finally managed to prove a year ago that Cg of pi cross pi equals to time of Cg of pi for groups with finite p pi. And another very important result, I like that very much by By Farber, Grant, Lapton, and Apria. Tc of pi is a minimum of k, size of the canonical map of universal cover of B pi crop pi to some classifying space with that index g, I have to define that. Can be actually. Equivarially deformed to the K-skeleton. This is a really nice characterization of the Polaris complexity of groups. And actually, it has a nice proof. So let me recall the definition of classifying space of a group modular sum familiar F. To describe. For this group G and the family of its subgroup, which is closed under conjugation and finite intersection, the classifying space is J equivalent CW complex whose isotropic groups are from that family F. And for each such complex, there is unique up to G homotopy equivariant map tool. Equivariant map to our space. So, this space is called universal space, naturally. And of course, since it's universal, and then for free action of G, it's also, there is such F, and that F is called canonical map. It's unique up to G homotopy. And Volga and Luke Props the following. G CW complex X, so equivalent CW complex X is that universal space for a family F, if and only if for each group F, the fixed point set is contractible. And say in this talk, we're going to take In this talk, we're going to consider a family D in G, which is pi cross pi. And this is the family generated by the diagonal subgroup. So it means you consider a diagonal subgroup, which is of course isomorphic to pi, and consider all conjugates and all possible intersections. And And example of such space from the paper, FGLO. It's a Milner construction for universal space for pi. So it's just a joint product of infinitely many copies of pi. And pi, well say for universal cover, pi acts diagonally, but here Diagonally, but here you have to consider the action of pi cos pi on this, and action is also diagonal. You define that action on pi by this formula. AB applied to gamma is A gamma B inverse. And you can extend that action here. So this is the theorems. So they proved that they had that example, the theorem. The theorem they have to check looks a condition for this and say in Mesher's talk there was defined Schwarz genus of say colour of vibration or just any map. Just any map. And let me recall that there is a Gannier approach to the category, just using Schwarz genus. And in the case of the category of a group, so it's the same, the category of group pi is the same as Schwarz genus of universal covering of p pi. And now, question. Now question what what what is that characterization for for Tc? And for Tc it's the Schwartz genus of a covering that corresponds to the diagonal subgroup. And now yeah say that Covering map psi can be seen in the following Borel's diagram. Say you consider pi cross EG, where G is this, and consider diagonal action of G and then you have psi here. Well, of course, on pi, it's just gonna be one point. It's just going to be one point, and you know, in parallel construction, perimage is the orbit space of action of a stabilizer crop and that, and the crop is our diagonal. Well, say now if you yeah, this is just a general Schwartz theorem. Tc of pi doesn't exceed k if the Doesn't exceed K if the fiberwide join of K plus one copies of side has a section. It's theorem for general, there is a general theorem of Fourier 6s. But in our case, that fiberwise join can be seen in the Borel construction. Just instead of one copy of pi, you can see the k plus one. And according to And according to, yeah, if you have infinitely many copies, what you have, you have EÏ€, Milma construction. And then in the Borel construction, well, you have, in the case of infinite many copies, you have that space or the space of universal space for that action of bycast part. For that action of pi cross pi. But here the fiber is the joint of this corpus of pi. And now when this has a section, it means the same, like when EG has equivalent section, but this equivalence. Section. But this equivalent section is in bijection to equivariance to the space, which is part of that character, which is k dimensional skeleton of E pi. So the difference here between a category is that in the case of the category, you all everything. Everything you can do characterization on the bottom. So, whenever you have that section here, it's free action, say, in the case of the category. So, you have just the question, the section means whenever you can deform your space to k-dimensional skeleton here, or a question about dimension. But here, say if you have a section and you can deform here, it's not really a characterization. Characterization you have to do upstairs. Now for hyperbolic group, so my contribution here, well at least in part, for hyperbolic groups, we can construct simpler universal Universal space. And we'll say we're going to denote by G is pi cross pi and then be orbit space denoted by B and a canonical map, induced canonical map for Induced canonical map of orbit spaces. And now I get a characterization of this orbit space, classifying space for family. So for torsion-free group with citric stabilizers, this space is homotopy equivalent to the wedge of this space. Of this space, if you collapse the diagonal and batch of straight spheres indexed by weak conjugacy classes of non-trivial elements of pi. So A is a set of weak conjugacy classes. I'm going to define that later. So it means it's almost the space, it's almost like you collapse diagonal. You collapse diagonal and you have some extras, but it's not really important. And now say the proof of the main theorem for all hyperbolic groups, say it's easier for hyperbolic manifolds. For general groups, it has additional difficulties, but let us do that for hyperbolic manifolds. Assuming that we know this characteristic. Assuming that we know this characterization, this new construction of universal space for this cross-pi action. So suppose that d pi is closed-of-variable manifold of dimension greater than equals than 2, excluded z. And the quotient map induces isomorphism of integral to n dimensional cohomology. This is by dimensional reason. Diagonal has to small dimension. And then we consider canonical map, and use canonical map for orbit spaces. So you have that quotient map and the inclusion. And the inclusion. And this canonical map cannot be deformed to 2n-1-dimensional skeletons since it's induced isomorphism of 2n-dimensional cohomology crops. So it means the canonical map upstairs doesn't admit a G equivalent deformation to two N minus one dimensional skeleton, and therefore Tc of pi is greater equal than two N. Is greater or equal than 2m. So to prove the main result for hyperbolic manifolds, it suffices to have new construction for the universal cover. Generally, you need to do more work. And now extension to general hyperbolic groups. What are the ideas? What are the ideas there? So, suppose that you have a hyperbolic group of chromological dimension n, where n, well, we excluded one, greater equals than two. And well, first of all, it's a remark that for hyperbolic group, for torsion, free hyperbolic group, we can say the torsion, it's a finite dimension. Of finite dimension. BÏ€ is always a finite complex. I mean, the group is so-called finite, geometrically finite. All torsion-free hyperbolic groups are geometrically finite, since they admit a finite classifying space BÏ€. And so this group is finitely generated. And if it's not zero, If it's not zero, then n-dimensional cochomology of pi cross pi non-zero. Because it's finitely generated, growth, then just by the universal, by the unit formula. Because for all finitely generated groups, tensor product of that is itself is not. Of that with itself is non-zero. So, and similar argument as before, as for manifolds. This Q induce an isomorphism of two n-dimensional cochomology groups, and this argument works. But n-dimensional cochomology group of pi could be trivial. What we can say for sure is that What we can say for sure is that n-dimensional cohomology of pi with coefficients in ZÏ€ is not zero. So formally it's in coefficients with some module. You can argue this is in free module and since pi is geometrically finite, you can reduce one sum to z pi. Still there are two problems here. Why this product This product is non-zero in this case. And also, in homomorphism induced by Q generally is not defined for local coefficients. This is another problem. And how they can be addressed? Well, say, first, problem number one. This is equivalent to the question. This is equivalent to the question: does the formula for cognitive dimension of the square of the group logarithmic law hold? So the cognitive dimension of pi cross pi equals two times cognitive dimension of pi. So this is a good question. And I thought in the 90s on that and didn't. In the 90s, on that, and didn't come with a solution, but so there are many reasons, there are many abstractions to that. Say this doesn't fall true for general groups. Say C D of Q cross Q rationals is 3, while C D of Q is 2. Why is that? Well, Eiland McLean space Space KQ1, it's just a telescope. You take a circle and consider maps of different degrees, say, and map of degree n factorial. So you need all prime to be used infinitely many times. And this is KQ1. Q1 and you can show that this cohomological dimension is two, of course, using cochomology. But if you look at Q cross Q, instead of crossing these two angular two telescopes, say, when you cross them, of course you're going to have dimension four, they're two dimensional. What you do, you can see the torus. Taurus and constructs a telescope on Tauri, and that telescope will be three-dimensional, so dimensions three. Okay, this one abstraction I saw there, and in 90s I constructed examples of hyperbolic groups with C D of the product strictly less than. Of the product strictly less than the sum of C D's. Not the square, only different groups. And also closely related problem: can this group be something like infinitely divisible torsion? So it's supposed to be Zp infinity. Somehow I got infinity. Well, Zp infinity. Well, Zp infinity means direct limit of Zp to the k. So, can it happen? Because the problem here is that if you have Zp infinity, not the infinity here, the tensor product with itself is zero. And that for such group, you could have that. So, this is also a group theory question. Can you have that? And another general topology. Another general topology question was that Bespina proved that cognitology of group is closely related of hyperbolic group, closely related to cognitive dimension of the boundary. And say for boundary is a compactum, and Boltiansky in the 40s constructed compactum. Transcripted compactum of two-dimensional Boltansky surface. If you cross Z with itself, dimension is three. At that time, I realized that before Boltensky, Pantragin constructed his surfaces, and all his surfaces were boundaries of hyperbolic ropes. And the question, maybe Baltensky, can Baltensky surface be a boundary of hyperbolic growth? If yes, then it's a kind of a If yes, then it's a counterexample. And it turns out to be no. Baltensky, actually, I proved that time that Baltansky cannot be the boundary of Coxeter hyperbolic group. But it's true generally. For genetically finite group, Cd of pi plus pi equals two times C D of pi. I have published this result with somewhat longer proof because I did Sullivan's approach to that. I use C D, well, C D over integers. I do localization first and do some argument and prove that. But now I'm going to present a shorter proof. Shorter than published proof. Well, first lemma: for any geometrically finite group, there is a field such that Cd of pi equals C D over that field as a coefficients. So for that proof, I use localizations, but you don't need to do that. Well, say for genetically finite group, Cd is much. Crobe Cd is marks of k such that this is non-zero. And if this has an element of infinite order, then this is non-zero. You can tensor that with Q and you have that equality over field. If it has, it's, well, this finally generated. This finitely generated Z pi module, and if each generator has finite order, then for some m you multiply that by m, you have zero, and take p be a prime factor of m. Then cognitive dimension with respect to zp of pi will be equal m. So this is a proof of that lemma. You always can find a field, but over a field, you always have unit form. You always have a unit formula and then you have this quality. Now let me address problem number two, say local coefficients and when you collapse the diagonal, you cannot say anything for cohomology if you even have in top dimension. Have in top-dimension cohomology, but local coefficients. So you have to go to the universal cover. And let me recall that for genetically finite groups, if you consider n-dimensional cognitive of pi with Z mod pi, then it's the same as cognitive with compact support of the universal space, the E pi. And say in the case, well, genetically pi, Say in the case of genetically finite crop, you may assume that B pi, E pi is locally finite, B pi is compact. So it's the same as one point complication that and yes I what I did I did the same argument as for BG but going to upstairs Going to upstairs to universal spaces. And my first argument was for hyperbolic group groups, and I use Gromov's boundary. Say one-point classification is okay, but in Gromov's boundary, like using the sphinotype duality, you can see all cohomology and you can argue. And then later, I modified that argument to cover not only hyperbolic groups. Bolly groups just using simplest bound one-point quantification. So, by that reason, the argument is slightly more complicated. Just let me show the ideas here. Our construction for hyperbolic group that complex is what we consider if It's also the type of E pi is missing. Eg, just remember g is pi cross pi. So Eg is E pi cross E pi. And you have the diagonal there, and you collapse the diagonal and all translate of that to a point. Then the complement of my construction is three-dimensional. So, this is about the construction, and then canonical map induced isomorphism of enchogomology with compact supports. If you go to compactification, well, say for this map, if you just collapse the diagonal and translate this, and here everywhere E pi. E pi and then I consider assumptions that you can deform that equivalently to n minus one dimensional skeleton. And then you can argue that you have cocomological contradiction. So it cannot happen. It's a more delicate argument, but yeah, it's But yeah, it still works. So we argue that that commotopy can be preserved at infinity. You collapse some stuff where you attach k and it works. Now the construction of this space Of the space. The main idea, of course, is used that hyperbolic groups have the property that centralizers of every element, non-trivial element, are cyclic groups. So just Z, we can say proposition-free hyperbolic groups. And now my definition: two elements in pi are weakly conjugate if there are k and l are k and l such that a to the k is conjugate to b to the l just remark weakly conjugate doesn't imply conjugate say a is weakly conjugate to any its power and in hyperbolic groups this never happens and and then there is a nice description of Of groups in that formula D. It's just a formulation of description given by these four authors: Ferber, Grant, Lopton, and Apria. These are just well yes, diagonal is represented by what? If you consider Represented by what? If you consider a trivial element, then the whole group is a centralizer. So other elements are just considered centralizers in diagonal subgroup and their conjugates. And now the construction, I have a I have a picture for that. Let me do it by hello. So we consider the product of EP cross EP and consider diagonal. Diagonal subgroups and they conjugate and collapse them to the point. See, diagonal and they translate in this product and collapse them to a point to have space X. So what happens in that space X? Space X is still contractible. Well, we assume that we started from a Sidada complex and we may assume that diagonal is a sub complex. The diagonal is a subcomplex. It can be arranged. And so this is still compatible space. And for diagonal subgroup and their conjugate looks, condition holds true. These are vertices are just the compatible fixed point sets for them. This fixed point set for the bag now. So what you have to do next, you have to sew. You have to store this centralizers and conjugates, and that conjugates. Well, say A is from the class of a bit conjugacy class, and just this is the picture. What is the fixed point set for A? It turns out to be It turns out to be that it's not connected even. So this and this are, if you consider translate as a point, so all these points are fixed point sets. And what you do, you just add interval, attach one-dimensional cell. One-dimensional cell. So, you altogether you're gonna glue reals to space X along integers. You have the fundamental group. You have to feel it. So, you just consider a pass in X and fill it, and then translate by powers of A. Still, you have to translate that by the whole group and And say if you consider translation by A comma A, that it speaks on sigma new cell attached, but it translates I, translates I. So you're going to have a void and it's two-dimensional spheroid. You have to fill it by B3. And then do translation for by all. For by all groups, you're going to have some space. Well, all condition will be satisfied, but only for conjugates, only for ZA, centralizer of A, and the conjugates. And then you do for all A's, for all different representatives separately, and do all together, and then you have our space. Together, and then you have our space which has all these properties. Well, this is just a verbal description of that. And now we don't use hyperbolicity, so general theorem is that topological complexity of pi is two times C D of pi for any group with finite B pi. We need that. We use local compactness of V pi and the cyclic centralizers. And the cyclic satellizers. Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you. Are there any questions? I have a question. Can I ask you a question? Yes. Thank you very much. It's a beautiful construction, beautiful proof. What it looks to me, I mean, this hyperbolicity is used only in this. Only in this property that centralizers of every non-trivial area is secret. So suppose I have a group and I know that centralizers of all non-trivial elements have homological dimension less than x. And suppose that the group itself has comological dimension greater than x. dimension greater than 2x or something, then probably similar construction to what you described with this diagonals and feeling coming this compact. I don't know. Similar to your construction, maybe applicable, maybe, I don't know. Maybe, yes, it's also better. Maybe yes, it's also better to add that classifying space is better to have finite, so genetically finite copes. And Mike Hull was a postdoc at UF and he read carefully my paper and actually he applied that, but we didn't write up for the same for relatively hyperbolic groups, when you have a stabilizer two-dimensional. stabilizer two-dimensional, well actually z cross z. It it it works, but it's much more technical and description is painful. Well maybe we'll write later on, I don't know, but generally as you said it should be true but it could be more painful to write it. But then you need to put some assumption on uh comological dimension greater than something. Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. Yeah, yeah, slot, slot. Yeah. Yeah. Very interesting, yeah. Okay. Are there any other questions or comments? Yeah, I have a question. Uh-huh. What can you say about homogeneous spaces? What kind of spaces? Homogeneous spaces. Homogeneous spaces, homogeneous spaces, yeah. Oh, um, no, no, no, it's uh yeah, even for category, it's a good question. I mean, yeah, it's difficult. Yeah, I mean, it's probably a good program to start doing something, but it's difficult, certainly. Okay, thanks. Okay, thanks Okay, well
