So perfect model of it. It's a model of two energies in a platform complex when you have a number of aristocrats. And you can see that one of the aristocrats, with them, with the When the problem is with university, all here topological problems that interest in the community of people who digitize topology, the problems that are studied, and I will be able to connect telegraphic connections. Or, when they surge a component, surgery there is connected to the connection, so that we can see that in probability, one is that it surges. One is that the component of the idea, and well, one of the models that study is in my model of decoupling. That is my graph in the work. So, we have to dimension, we have the graph of the thing that you. And studied the question that we have the tub with a manifesto or when it is. Ok? So, that is a little model for diado que environment. And how do you? And I questions topology. If you want to read the. If the vaster only topology is a mutopia, so definitely in this world. So, with the aspect combination, the geologist laughed in the same way, the publicamos in the mathematical. Republicamos in the form of mathematics sigma form in novel of the vector is usually when trivia porque dormina in the momentum of the tribes very fast the trivia cuartos two can have a realization of the vandoo de movies  And the mirror number, okay? And the trick for there is a impression of this van esteem. That is the promise. And well, the intuition with the toddler, don't be able to. Today, today to have the toddler, which is what typological environments have more interest, that only. And here when we can put it, no? I suppose the question is that for many years, and that's it. Okay? Well, all have. Well, that's okay. So, this is the same thing. So, that is the same thing. That is what in reliance with two colors of the graph of the decumo, if you have been appearing very interesting, very rapidly. If you have there the plane of these 5 dimensions, so rapidly can use a distortion, in 5, and the things that are impossible. And the things that are important, so that is something that we are having a queerly random object that has a interest for all the queen of when Cubo and this expensive do not. Yes, and all this of the probability of this graph, works for the distributors of probability. This connected, you can say your probability of mass that one, and if we go. And we have the six. Plugo will be the same, it's a phenomenon, and if it is actually a medium, okay, and if you want to get a medium, your graph connects. You know, in the 60s, it's very cool, for example. Yes, very because. Because what happens in the model of complex complex, in the model of the graph in vertices, there is the probability in reality a function of vertices, not a number of numbers. There is a lot of space there, there are many. For example, well here, it is actually for the function of the distribution that is the threshold function for the concideness in the market between. So, it is a function that depends on. So, this is what the erosion is. Well, we are in a model that clearly distinctly correlates in the case one French. And now the model that we are like in Spain is one of the two things in Pugo, the do with a variety independent of what we are. Independence as well as all the students. For example, all combinatorials don't analyze how computational company works with the couple, because they don't have graphics, is that it is very fast when two in the couple. It's super sensitive, it's a. Such is a minutes in a class of first university, because we say a union vector, we can embed the dimensional space, we have a trades, all the connections, each one of the verticals we can use a vertical vertical. So, we have. So, we have two vertices. And when we are talking about distance, we have a list in one of the central centers, and we are two and one, we are two. So, as we say, we all computational questions with the group of Montopia que especially. That is in complete paid calcular group of motopia, so that inclusive, that we have, but here vanquished, well, can contract an upper bound gracias to gracias to. Pracias al a podcer en la community with this with this representation of two representations. Okay, so what we are doing the other puzzle with what we could do the group of utopia is super necessitated in the cuando. Image in the cabinet of when we produced these parasol north, they are not. But also finally, the new technical sustainable para corporate. All the people, all for this. But all for this calendar, we have a press that is in the character that this presente queen can transform. Passive here and here is the convergence in Union, here it will convert and return and also unentira, only when one. Well, we're with the tones and I agree, I learned my voice, And the result that you can see these four here and the other. Ok? What is the group of topics? Because no device pas topology, only the movement that has to be checked, who is all the way to a Los puedes when solo. And here the gusta topology continues, the formation retracts a second. So this is here local, the chisel. Ok. So, we prepare for the motopia of a three-dimensional tutorial with. Dimensional tutorial with the models and linear measurements. Because I have also linear measurements that is complete. Well, the ditch is maneras in the queue can calculate upper bounds for the group of utopian groups, some very sensitive area, an upper boundary. The number of four. Quattro decides four aristos. It is a van, because it was passed that we don't have a dos. It is not for me. For the group of mutopia, I don't know why. Yes? Yes, none of the words. Yes, the group that I handle is two elements, if working at a deformation. Because it is the number of four cycles that there in the cup. So that's a problem very because we have. Because we have directly with the vertices. Ok, what do you pregnant? Escape passes with the friends in one. That you can see good. So I'm going to. So I threshold to the connected, or connected. Ok, in the cup. Now they are going to do two cards. And the word of torrential establishment is a group of multiplayer. So the question is that one that we have the threshold for a seat in the identity. So it is to understand the dimension, a function of the dimension, or a number of pictures complete in what is happening with the complex respondent with two-s, well, measurable, what passed with. What passed with one is that you can approximately demonstrate a R threshold, is Pennsylvania. It's a function that depends on the number of vertices. That is distinct to the group, the number of vertices. Si y aquí es two lo que enes sorenes y a cueran en. Log in the solar, if it cuerdan en caso del grapo era log en espren. No, ya si sido. If you want higher dimensionals, if we have log en sovereign that the threshold para que para que se la identidad. Well, y llas we mos que dentrada a momento que lamos pay uno oce uno naridada. Uno, o ace una drawn, es va un medo un medo. Ok, no quiero que tense mucho, pero que estiero que maido dento saber es si que es que sella face el demustrad que es un vero. A medo fa por el grafo y resulta y un vero tamien es para fayur. Okes es thresho también. That threshold also identified. So, we have this because it reads a demonstration algorithmic demonstration. The first thing that we think was here is the point. We are first inspiration in the first place that is an operation so that. Spanish, so that's funny. For example, my understanding in Spanish. Well, but a point that we can also know that passing between a mello and approximately components with high probability Probability and one copy of it. And here, I can decide that what is affecting aristocrats that are not. If you have a rist in the graph, where do not vista nine incidents in one incident? This needs to be a little bit different than a doctor. And necessarily, because no man is in the Dequeforms the agenda. There will be a block, yes, that has a list and not in a dospecent. You are going to go a little estos. I will grant. So, if the entire vertical. And then all stars. But all the aristocracy, but we are not.  Elise that has a local, and notes ningara una vista, and notes ninguna two, so that isogram. Here, the composition of a composition, a little bit that also is because this has to be or Canela disable, exactly. If general discipline exactly selections, if you're going to play, they have to use the technical limits, and a microphone, if not that it is, because you can see the same technology, that passes. Well, and so the opportunity to go. So, the picture very much is that I want to segue with these isolated edges, what is a copy of the group in the composition. But what is a copy of the favorite? And you know the superficials that have society. If you want to torment, there are torsions.  That the cabinet has nothing to do with copies of sets, not in source, not in the scenario, that copies of settings that are listed. No, not literally. And one can say, ah, we also supervised the superhero to guarantee that we are there, there will be your supervisor. Well, there are no pork visitors that we can. Well, we have a siempre to do if you have a two complex in Cubo. In Cubo, the major vertices can bear, you can see a simple queen what have you. Now, simultaneously, there is a lot of pedie because we have two aristocrats, and here number of aristocrats are linear with the number of verticals, which is exponential. The whole thing is. The pier is much, for me, what we have to do in the rediscipliation is that not that there is a canonical discussion. We are very great, in a square and power, one square of the podcast. Then, how can we finish the squeeze as a passion? So, I think. Has to be a supervisor fabric in a cook. Yes? Dimension, these are there, similar, I will calculate a pee. There in Max Planck. In Max Planck, we demonstrate that the minimum representation of the projective plan in 50. And with the other with Henry Segerman, which is one in the Mathematical Improvement, is generating a model, because a artificial intelligence to produce intersectionalities. To say intersections in realization physicalized. So this history, the view is contact with the dictionary of history. But here, well, that is predictive, can really exhaustive of a representation of predictive representation for their Latino vertex, but a service. So can I recently? Well, what have you here in the number of numbers? And if it is insistent of when you have a isolated story, here that is these aristocrats, with these. Because if I go with a corruption, I do not see more. Structure endo in no more, not the structure to perfect. Don't go to serve the track. No? And you are the aristocracy and these aristocrats that are not. How viewed guarantees are in probability when variable independent variables distributed possibilities. What? No, but a medium. It means that it is decided to make these lists. And one of these has a little bit in these models, and they are the dimensions of infinite dimensions, pas tener una linear, que peri con dimension. A hi tienes una paso tener una cancidad linear. Por eso divor este denes a representation favorita. So, y here is impossible as structural, that is projective, and what you do when they have a sper that we have. For example, a sphera que tem use all thes, we have a positions that are optimizations in the sense of cases in the spheric uses all the vertices, when you are the toddler vertices. So the vertexes can be one of the images. So there in these very well. Such very well. This composite for the global es que este extermal structures are very important to determine thresholds in models electoral models. In model electoral models, when we have copies of the structure that structure with probability with probability. So, we are extremely, but because we are interested with this extreme, you can result in the idea of this passive in the work and all of the formal disputes. But, Well, so many of the languages of structures in the fourth, these are all the possibilities, also not negative with the models, with them, and this is a possibility that they have to have superficial differentes in the future. So, So, the spheroids, and you can see all the spirits, and we have the torn and para. It can be two spirals that are here in the photo, but if you have this, and they have the same are two, and all. And all the masses will be here, and the four, and more of computational resources. This is the resume of different ways to calculate the physician. Pecado loses these experas who are top, no, no, and the toddler expert, a two experas, in the top, and the top. Ok, and this is the number of scars that need to be universal. That's the vertices, las aristas, las doscaras, the number of verbs. No, we first entered the immunities because they had the power. Muy del Gadas, but very interesting resolves the projections geographical because the first dimension and local project, yes, I need very much. But the point is that the day one clearly because when they present the clean, two mobiles. Today, modios in Rocho and the lands in the parallel. Okay, now I want to continue a little like the demonstration mode. Ah, but I'm not sure. No, it's a combo. So, everybody is reproduced that in the neurodimensional so that this connection. And what we're doing. Right? And what we are analyzing is what, if I had a graph, this one of the model, if I had a graph in wherever they are, and connect two cycles, if they have a cubo que los contien, y can retard between them. So, three. The moderator face and we can publish. And that with this unlike this, one complex. And what you can do. I can see that the four cycles are going to be a graph where all the four cycles are panels between them because the principle here is that they are and that are panels. So what I want to do is this same pero combo. So I want to do everything where everything is part, all these. All these four includes and podcasts retract of the constant. And even the probability of one of these here, one of these all here. And that is valid to be that I completely, because I think it is. So, the only thing that observes if we have a dimensional is how we can use one dimensional with the structure that we speak. And we all know that it passed with the two. So, So, when they were in puzzles, there are three. And when four cycles are 40, remember, all four and a half. And we mask voyage two, si panaleros. So 3ces in the cup. And how here a rista, what you say is these aristocrats, the voyage can get probability, and the probability of this. And the probability of this calorie will be in the fourth because it goes to the fourth of the credit estimates to decide that this four sign is topic for yo decides the four presents, how the four lashes control independently to the four. We do not completely enable the probabilistic model of the circumstance. So, that is convention in media that is that we are silent, we are active, what we are contrary to here are and you can see that. Yes, I was here. And that three dimensions, but campaigns are represented by two. So these two are parallels. They are two representation for this and this and what is the sustainability of the same.  And then, if you can, and with what they are saying, we will all five years.  Because we have the minimal structures, because when we say, I want to contradict the minimum number of lists that need to have to be that, in the brunt, in the composition of it. Yes? Lux for the respondent, a lot of your commentary. Documentario que technas aquí lo que esto haciendo es commando estrescuvo por que mesto ido en que na las los. Now my ten que tagaro todo enquireto two dimensional. All the vertices to the distance and toads. And I can reveal the couple. But when two trespasses have a four and parallel. And they are parallel. When you are a cruise interval, generas, one of the dimensions, but when you can learn, and that will allow that, they are locally. Okay, good. Well, you understand what you are. Today, the demonstration of the threshold in the case of the dimensional cases, the same in the case of a dimensional cash. And we have how we use computational computing for experiments, the reality of the men. Because we have an experience that the probability of. That probability depends on the number of vertices in the case of simplicity. For many all these different things, well, and the final por, this management of the message, but the final parameter with the models between them, and that. And that is a bug of artificial intelligence that we have to expose the intersections. Well, so that model, and this developed value to me of other projects of automatic models, and mathematical visualization with Claudia, I can't here. This is a. This is a mystery of art and materials. And we are a codado, okay? Did the facility go to the truth that I figured all the time, and I can't tell you. Ok, you can see, and we can. Now, we have two y ten siempre six project a sex bundle. And if you say, well, what you pass is more. So, my interest is a good idea, so I want to talk about it. You have to pay for there, no? That is a road for this, what is the object. And we have. And we can see more. And that's a phenomenon more than intuitive, which is a phenomenon in the world, which is going to be a phenomenon that will be universal, so if you have a technology, I see that it doesn't exceed regular, okay? What is the use of this model to have all the topology occur of the boundary? And for there, I think the probabilistic models that could be fed, only for that, but in this case, all the topologies, and this is the. It is not the packing because there are what is not. Well, everything is accomplished. At the moment that these models are a model of first-class percolation, that is a study of children, and there is a coxider, or this study automogilla, of these models, but in limiting shape. But the limiting shape is the structural limit of these objects, a question of natural remote probabilities. Yes, what we could demonstrate the coxyls is that exist a limiting shape that is convex, no vacuum. And you will see the spheroid for the case. The expert for the case of the destination can be done very well. But there, as you can see here, the people who can understand that the convex structure is also discovered. But we could imagine 20 and 10 mentioned. So interesting, captured, and. I know, I don't know how to do it. How do you understand the brain that allows us? And all these studies in the value for all the institutions, we are the number of units. Well, you can see this conclusion, because the dimension and more vector, no. Más veti uno, no, pato dener veti uno, vetidos, etc. Here no. Ok. Your example of one observa: this one of the doors, French friend part, of the type, it was the most parallel that is, and the Munich and all the opportunity to block with Silk Bett, which results that is. And a remote dependency of a conjurer in first pathway population and the conjuring concept that I think is the creation, for example, in space. Undo the cream, for example, in space is that in perimeter of circular especially the paris puppets. That is what I can demonstrate for this, because this is not a circle. This is a question with this, that is a concept that I think with limits to the limit, because it is going to compete. And alleged, no, we are, we have an ecology assume, and we can say that all the time is between a constant between two constants. This constant, the sector with extreme combinatoria, and well, this very lower bound, and here we are one or two queues that usually. Titos that the first very sensible aspects that number of women who are tag, tag, tag, tag, tag, and question there that you can make two in the sixteen paso porcupine. So I go this camino, and you can see here. Plus, if we have more, here it is from topology, and again, the number of bugs here is finitas of here. Ok, so that is the maximum if you have other dimensions, what is the structure for example between. For example, allow maximizing a pass or other retirement. So, that future group and pass that is put in a couple of maximize the number of passes from the state, but one in this model can be. Ok, and good, but. And well, yes, if the gusta como must have function in the various latitudes, and put a model of trash, I think that these are random box. Ok, problems that have not much for there, I think it is for the past, not that. No, no, no, I think the distribution that is like, but if the pods and very future is all the two dimensions between a dimensional interest, all the dimensions, all the ajaros dimensional, will be linear with respect to the image, and everything else in the front. All the fronter. In the front, if these are not because they are a local, where do you pass? And then this passes in our metropolitan and in the journey of dimensional journeys, and it is like a private control. And what we can do is that clearly veto majority. Attendees constantly major. Here we go, and here, of veto, that vegetation completed no, because for vegetables, I need more vegetables, but the points so that it's important and. So that is important, and we animated the couple, which the model with machines can be. This model is not allatorium, no especially, it is in the complete passing, and we have changed the number of vettiums, with the time. We are. Constiemo are various and we lose all the topologies in the floor. And in the last minutes that I did, in a way, models that can bear the top, we will see this others, but I would say this to pass when we have a technology room. A telecom. A television. I have no importance. There is a way that a text, or when the plan could include the name, composed two regions. So a shape, all the topologies that are when we say, if you don't colour, in the pledge. Pones unpentagon logo, but then the aristocracy intersects no ponos. Okay? Well, van passes like this. You para comil, y what you say is that there are many. Yes, because it does not completely with everything that is produced. Because their end, I think, is that we have produced a graph that. No search, we foreigner control a modern queue, but not going to be, and well, these miles, a little more. And this is a local puedo bridge, for there can be a critic that can be peros, but in reality, pued esteemos que eso token in medio de la distances. Yes. And this is for that variable. They are vertices. It is a number of women that are linearly, or if it is comporting, and in the case in the case that has a test. Tesla of the panel cannot be done because they are fronter and fronter in the chamber, and well, I think we have to parallel there. Here with Claudia, and also with it. And also with it, where we are with a series, we are models, and we are in a galic exposure to this. And how a little bit with the population because they put a value and this is, and a little bit of time because. Because a mathematical method of inventory, emphasis with students who are with artistic projects that are investigated. Well, we have to present. This doesn't matter the confederacy to prove the problem. And what is that although you are put in a cadet? And all the metro is going to share as you go. The enunciated por this principle osatrada can be super local, these posts are. So that perimeter with a crude spirit and dimension 3 on this converse. This converse to the spirit, or superimposed for the spirit, for 20 seconds. But the motor of demonstration. If I paradox of a principle of 190 para riba, and it was 30,000. I put annotated two, if you have a number.
