Additive power operations in Echograin Corellogen. Alright, well thanks very much for that invitation. It's very exciting to be here. It's a really great crowd. I'm excited to talk to many of you over the course of this week. Alright, so today I'm talking about this project that we've recently done. We have a paper on the archive now, posted in January. And so this is joint work with Matt Stapleton and with Peter Von Ventry, who is currently on the job market. From the job market. And so we're talking about additive power operations. And so I just want to start in algebra. So let's say that R is a commuted ring. So what sort of thing are we looking at here? Well, let's take our ring and let's raise an element to, let's say, the pth power. And so this is a nice multiplicative operation. x times y to the p. Sure enough, that is x to the p times y. However, is it additive? Well, not quite, sadly. We have a formula, x plus y p power. Well, we have those two terms we like, that we're happy with, but then there is a sort of error term, right? So the sum, i plus. Sum i plus j equal to p. I guess I want i and j positive here. And then we have the binomial coefficient x to the i y to the j. So not additive. And so maybe it's a little disappointing. You know, when you're faced with disappointment, I guess you have choices. You can just sort of accept the situation or maybe try to do something about it. And so, what can you do about it? And so what we do about this to fix this non-adductivity, well, let's just throw this part in garbage. So what does that mean? Well, we're just going to pass to a quotient. And so here we're fortunate, all these binomial coefficients happen to be divisible by p, and so if we mod out by p, they go away and we do get something nice and additive. Okay, so that's our additive power operation now. So with the price we've paid is we have to reduce to a quotient. Okay, but this is now a ring map. All right, this is just algebra. Let's bring in some topology. And so now I'm going to bring in a cohomology theory. Theory. So let's use a cohomology theory. And if we have, oh, let's say that x is a space here. And so if we have an H infinity structure on E, that gives rise to power operations. That gives rise to power operations in Equilog. Okay, and so those look like, well, we're going to map from degree R cohomology of X, let's say. We actually get power operations for every M. Every M, and so maybe, as a brief reminder, H infinity, right? So this is a weaker notion than E infinity, but it's a little bit more than just being homotopy cumulative. Somewhere in between, this is the right thing that gives you power operations. All right, so then we have some, let's say, mth power operation, and so that's going to go to degree R times M cohomology of X. And now we have a classifying space. A classifying space for a symmetric loop that goes there. Alright. So we get these for every m. And again, as we were just looking at, you know, we shouldn't expect these to be additive. Okay. So I'm going to focus on the case where r is equal to zero. It's still very interesting there. You know, if your cohomology theory is periodic, then that's not really much of a price to pay. All right, so again, we're maybe a little bit sad that we don't have something additive, and so let's fix that. Okay, so how do we do that? Well, let me remind you, if we have a subgroup H in G, then when you pass to, so we have the inclusion of the subgroup, when you pass to classifying spaces, this gives you a finer covering. We're going to use that in a second. The degree of the cover is the index of the subgroup. So let's now define the transfer ideal. And so we're going to take the image of some maps here. So we're going to take a direct sum. Here. So we're going to take a direct sum. So my formula is still on the board over there. I guess now I've switched from P to M for the moment. So I plus J should now be M. I and J are still positive. And so what we can do is we can apply cohomology. So with X times, it's now for every i and j that's summed to n, I'm going to take a classifying space of the product with some other groups. Okay, so that product sits inside the symmetric group sigma M as a block sum of matrices. And so that inclusion of subgroups gives us this finite cover on groups. And so for a finite cover, remember we're in eco-homology, but for a finite cover we get a transfer map. Okay, so I'm going to use that transfer map. I'm going to try to be careful. Whenever a transfer map appears in this talk, I'm going to write it in orange. So if I have time, I'll put up some slides at the end. Time, I'll put up some slides at the end, and those are going to follow this color coding, and so that'll be helpful at that point. All right. Anyways, so as I said, we're using the inclusion of this product of symmetric groups into sigma m. And so we go to E0 X times V sigma M. And so there we go. We have this transformat for each pair of I and J, and it's the sum of that. And it's the sum of that. Okay, so if we define that transfer ideal, it turns out if we pass through the quotient by that in analogy with what we did here, then we get a nice additive power operation. So, again, this is nothing new, just we're reviewing some sort of classical material. So, this Uh so this uh is an added uh operator. Any questions over? All right, so just a couple of quick examples before we move on to the meat of the story where the equivariance will come into play. Um maybe just a sort of basic example are Maybe just a sort of basic example: if R is a commutative ring, we can look at the Eilenberg-McLean spectrum, so ordinary homology. And so there are sort of two cases to think about here. On the one hand, we might take our m to be a power of a prime, so p to the k for some prime p. And then in this case, the transfer ideal is just generated by p. Generated by P. Whereas if M is composite, so if M is not a power of a prime, then the transfer ideal just becomes the whole thing, and so the price you pay to get the additive operation is that it's the zero. Okay. So the other more interesting example comes from K-theory. comes from K-3. So this was studied by Batia in his power operations paper, which appears in the appendix of the K-3 book. So here let's focus on the case. And so here let's focus on the case of a prime. So we have k u 0 of x, and we can take our non-additive operation. So here, again, thinking about the prime base. So this is then going to go to Ku of X times K sigma v. By the completion theorem, this is, this can be identified as K of X tensor with the completed representation ring. So again, this is not added yet. We need to pass to a quotient. Matt is going to yell at me if I put a lowercase t there. And so then Aetia, I was supposed to say that, Atia then identified this quotient. Turns out that this is just Ku of X, and if you like tensor with Z, that's just Ku of X when you modify the transfer ideal. In fact, this map here. In fact, this map here, and we're going to use this later, this can be identified as, well, the identity tensor, a certain evaluation map. This evaluation map is taking the representation and then getting the induced character and evaluating that at a p-cycle. So evaluation at a p-cycle. I'm sorry? I am forgetting some completion. Um here? I don't believe so. Oh, well, sorry. Okay, yeah, there may be some P-It completion here. You're right. Thanks. Okay. Evaluating at what? Element worker P cycle? So we're going to take the representation and evaluate that character at the P cycle, the long cycle. And then, furthermore, this composition is nothing but the atoms operation, which is a ring homomorphism. Great. So no aquavarants yet. So let's think about the aquavariks now. What about that V sigma p? That's just Borrell. That's not appropriate for being honest. And the prime is odd. All right. So, of course, equivariance, I'm definitely thinking of G. Equivariance, I'm definitely thinking of G being finite. I guess I should say that, but if you know me, that should be obvious. All right, so just some brief review here. So if E is a genuine V spectrum, then when we consider a cohomology, we can think of it as taking values not only in abelian groups, but rather in ackeeping. Groups, but rather an IK functors. And so we use the underlying notation. We're thinking of the Machie functor. And so remember, this is something where you plug in the subgroups of G. This is going to be a G-Machie functor. You can plug in the subgroups or equivalently the orbits. The orbits. And so the value at the orbit g mod h is, well, just take your homology here and evaluate it at the g-space g mod h times x. I guess I should have said here, I mean, x was already a g space. This is now still a g space. That's how you get your machifunctor. And so remember, a machifunctor is not just this collection of groups. There's also maps sort of connecting them. them and so this is the way we'll sort of typically be drawing them. So at the top we're going to have, so we're going to have g mod g, and so that's going to be e naught g mod g times x. At the bottom we have e naught g mod e times x. And most of the time there's other things in between. But anyway, so we have these groups and so Groups, and so at the level of G spaces, there's the collapse map from the free orbit down to the one-point orbit. Okay, so this map going up in G spaces, when we feed it into cohomology, this gives you the restriction map going down. And there's also a transfer map from this finite G cover, and so that goes the other way. It's a gap. All right, so these are what we get. Alright, so these are what we get from an equivariant cohomology theory. So now let's bring in the power operations as well. Okay, so if, and now there are several choices of what we might be thinking about, so what I'm going to talk about here is if E is an ancient vendor ring in G spectra F. And so there's certainly things. And so there's certainly fancier notions that you might need here, which will give rise to different kinds of power operations. That's not what I'm talking about today. Okay, so if we have this extra structure on E, then we get two things. So number one, well, these groups or these Mackie functors have more structure. So E not, oops, E not x is now a green functor. So green functor means not only these abelian groups, they're commuter rings. And the restriction maps are ring homomorphisms. The transfer maps are not quite as good. They're module maps. So we get that additional structure. And second, we get power operations.  Okay, so again, going from E0 of X now, we have this Mackey functor, in fact, a green functor. That's going to, now E0 X times the cloud sign space. So how are these defined? Well, just defined level-wise in the Mackey sense. So, you know, So I look at level G mod H, so here I'm looking at E naught of G mod H times X. And so here, you know, it's important to sort of choose conventions which are compatible. So there's two things that are going on. I have my Mackie functors, which means I, you know, I have to put in a G mod H somewhere, and I also have my B sigma ns. And so I'm always putting my GMODHs on the left and my B sigma's on the right. My piece again is on the right. Okay. All right, so we have this level-wise power operation that we can look at. So now we have, we want to think about, well, how nice is this power operation? Okay? And so we've already talked about how there's the multiplicativity question and additivity. But now we have this extra structure, namely restriction in transformatic, and we want to know, is it also compatible with the extra structure? So this is true, this is not. And again, one of these, it is compatible with the transfer, but not with the result. The transfer, but not with the restriction. Okay, so we have two problems to solve. The first one, we know what to do, we're just going to follow what we did non-incovariantly, and then we're going to think about the transfer function. Okay, so at activity, we're just going to, again, define a transfer ideal and then look at the, we're going to define the ITR from B. But we're going to define the ITR from before, and then think about the Machine transforms. Okay, and so now, you know, if you think about what's happening, the x is just sort of coming along for the ride. And so from now on, I'm going to stop writing x. So in other words, without loss of generality, x is a function. Alright, so let's define our ITR, and we're just going to do the same thing we did level-wise. Again, I'm dropping x, I'm thinking of x as a point, and so the Mafia functor I want here is just E naught. The Mackey functor I want here is just E0 underline of B sigma m. No. And like I said, we just defined this level wise. So to be levelwise. Okay? It's not obvious right away that this is actually an ideal in the Mackie sense, but Ideal in the Mackie sense, but it's not hard. So, lemma. This is a Mackie ideal. So what does that mean? Well, if you have your ITR at level G mod H and then you apply some restriction down to G mod K, you want that to land inside the ideal at level K, and similarly with the transfers. Because this is defined in terms of transfer maps, actually. In terms of transfer maps, actually showing it's compatible with the transfers is the easier part. The restriction takes a little bit more work, but again, it's not that difficult. All right. Great. So now we get an additive power operation by passing to the quotient by this Mackey ideal. So these are both Maggie functors, and we want to know, is this a map of Maggie functors? In other words, restriction and transfers. And we've already said that it is compatible with restrictions, but it turns out it's not automatically compatible with the Mackie transfers and the Mackie induction. Answers of the Machine Duction. So let's look at an example to see how that fails. And so we're going to bring back the K-theory example here. Anyone want to guess what group I'm going to use? Okay, so C2, our cohomology theory again is Ku. And I guess now I'm talking about equivariant Ku. And I'm going to take M22. Okay, so I'm looking at the second additive power operation on the equivariant K-theory. And so one thing we need here is, well, what is the Mackey functor? Well, what is the Machief? And so KU underline here. Well, this is the complex representation ring Machief. And so at the top, we have the representation ring of C2. At the bottom, we have the representation ring of the trivial group. Well, that's just C. Okay, for C2, there are two irreducibles. There are two irreducibles. There's the trivial and the sine representation. So this is a rank 2 for your ability group. It's z on 1, and I'll call it s for the sine representation. And then, well, we have our restriction map, so both 1 and s are one-dimensional, so both of those go to 1 here. So in other words, I have this matrix 1, 1, whereas the transfer sends the trivial representation to the irregular representation, which is 1. Regular representation, which is 1 plus the sine. And so that matrix is this one. Okay. And so now let's look at our additive power operation, which again, Atia really told us about. Okay, so again, what we said before was that if we take this, you know, the RU mod, well, the target here, mod ITR, that gets identified with the source, right? And we saw that the mass are the power of the atoms operations. So I'm just going to put RU CT in. So again, strictly speaking, there is an issue with completion. And so I guess that's because the completions are really interesting because we should be thinking of this example globally and then the completions don't arise. So we do talk about it this way in the paper as well, but for the This way in the paper as well, but for the purpose of this talk, I thought it would be simpler to just stick with this story. Alright, so now we have our power operations, and again, I'm going to color code them because that's what's going to happen in the slides later. Okay, so here, P is 2, and so we have the second atoms operation. Now, the second atoms operation on Z, I mean, there aren't too many ring hole. I mean, there aren't too many ring-home morphisms from Z to Z. This is just the identity down here. Whereas the items operation up here is not the identity. And so let's see. So if we start with the element one down here and trace it around the diagram, we're going to see it doesn't commute. So let's first do the simpler thing of going over to the right. So the identity takes one to one. So the identity takes one to one. But then when we use up, as we said, this goes to one plus s, right? The regular representation. Whereas if we go the other way, so one goes to one plus s. And then we have to take the atoms operation on one plus s. Now in general, it's not so easy to know what the atoms operation does on a typical element, but we know what it does on one-dimensional elements. These are both one-dimensional elements. Elements. These are both one-dimensional representations, so psi 2 just squares them. So this goes 1 plus s squared. Now the sine representation squared is 1. Okay, and so we're sad, those do not agree. So once again, we have disappointment. We can just accept this fact or we can do something about it. Do something about it, and let's, you know, we can make those i agree. So, here, what we see is that we need some identification, a further quotient. In this case, we would want to identify one mass in this representation. All right, so now, yes, I sort of set it up, and so I'm going to tell you. Tell you about the solution, at least in a sort of simple case. I'm just going to talk about the case where m is prime, although we do describe the more general case in our paper, but as you can imagine, it's a little bit more complicated to state. Any questions for anything? All right, so again, just a little bit of setup before I can define the new ideal we want to quotient up by. So if I have some subgroup gamma of, so we're going to go to G cross sigma p in a second, but let me first put an intermediate subgroup. And I'm calling it gamma because I'm thinking of it as a graph. A gamma because I'm thinking of it as a graph subgroup, and it will be in a moment. Okay, so if I have this inclusion of subgroups, then I can think about quotients. So first of all, I have the orbit g cross sigma p log gamma. And then I can modify the larger subgroup, and I go to g cross sigma p l cross. L cross sigma p. Well, that's the same thing as G mod L. I'll be identified. And so here we have this rejection. I can pass to homotopic orbits. And I'm going to pass to homotopic orbits with respect to only sigma p. And so then this quotient, when I pass to homotopy orbits, it's going to give me a cup of. So over here, G mod L homotopy orbits with respect to sigma P, well, that's the same thing. There's a trivial action of sigma P here. This is the same as G mod L across the classifying space of sigma P that we were seeing showing up earlier. And as I was saying, this is a finite G code. Okay, so as we've seen in the talk, G covers well we can expect transfers with respect to those in cohomology. Okay, so now we're gonna define the new and improved ideal J. And again, I'm just sticking to the sigma p case just for simplicity. But in the paper, we do give the more general case. Oh, right. I want to do it this way. So let me do it one at a time. So here, it's going to be Okay, so here it's going to be inside of E0, well, it's the Machief at level G mod L. And again, that's the same thing as E naught at the product G mod L cross E sigma U. And so this is the ideal of generated by two things. And so the first Two things. And so the first part, we're just going to force the old ITR to be contained in J. So we're just going to put in those old transfers that we already had. So here again, we have the direct sum, i plus j equal to p. Okay, and then number two, so here is we're gonna use the transfers for these types of covers, and so the points we're gonna specify what sub gamma we're gonna use here. So again, we're going to have g cross sigma p mod gamma of A. So I have to tell you what that is. And then again, we're going to pass to homotopy orbits with respect to sigma p. And then we're going to apply our transfer moment, which takes values in E0 of L G mod L. Of G mod L cross B sigma ph. Okay, so in addition to the transfers we already had before, we're now going to mod out by these transfers. So again, I have to tell you what the gamma A is, where, so I'll say for all. So remember here we had some subgroup L of G already specified. And so now we're going to run over subgroups S inside of L. And then we're going to run over homomorphisms. A from this subgroup to the symmetric group. And so then we're going to, but we're going to look at homomorphisms such that the image of, well, the image of A contains a P cycle. So we could say some CP is contained in the image. Okay, so that's the definition. Alright. Uh and so then, well, two things. Number one, I claim that this is actually a Mackey ideal. Again, not obvious. Actually, this took us quite a bit of work to see that. Again, compatibility with transfers is not so difficult, but compatibility with respect to restrictions is non-trivial. So, the first theorem. Is that this immaculate deal? By itself, that would not be so exciting. I mean, we want to know if this really solves the problem. And so that's sort of part two of the theorem. That's the next result. And we didn't just choose this randomly. We were led to this by sort of careful analysis. And so, in fact, this. Sort of careful analysis. And so, in fact, this is really the correct thing to do. This is the minimal ideal. So, J is the minimal Machi ideal for which the quotient map becomes a map of Machiavelli. So, P. So P, again, right now I just stated in the case where M is equal to P. So this, again, is a map. The MACE where you could say green functions, same thing. Same thing. Okay, so here we get our green power operation, our power operation of green functions. Okay. And so I mentioned earlier that there's this other perspective. So in fact, so we started when we were doing In fact, so we started, you know, when we were doing this work, we started by just thinking about trying to solve this problem. And as we were doing it, we sort of realized more and more that a lot of this goes over also to the global setting. So in fact, so we proved a more general result which specializes to give this result in the case of G spectra. And so we also get an ideal J. An ideal J, which works and solves the problem in the global setting. So again, if we have a global spectrum, and then there's this analog of H infinity in the global setting, Schreeder calls this G infinity. And so for G infinity global spectra, you can define Global spectra, you can define power operations. Again, they're not additive. They don't give you maps of Machief. But again, we describe the ideal J, which will give you that map of Machie functors in the global setting as well. Okay, so I'm not going to say much about the proof. I'll turn back to that example of K-theory, and then I'll put up some other examples as well. Let me just Let me just say that in terms of this result, so this is the one that sort of took the most work in the paper, again I said that compatibility of the transfers with restrictions took the most work. And so what you're trying to do there is sort of compose restriction maps with transfers, with wrongway maps, and in general, you have to deal with homotopy pullbacks to get these commutative diagrams. And so most of the work is analysis of these homotopy pullbacks. Analysis of these homotopy pullbacks, decomposing the orbit types, and understanding what arises there. Okay, so like I said, let's go back to that example of K-theory. So, all right, sorry, I just erased the description of The description of J. So again, let me remind you: I had the, it was just over here. I had the S ranging over L, I had the homomorphism from A, from S to sigma P, and the image of A was supposed to contain a C. That was the condition on that part two. Okay, so again, here, we knew what was happening when we modified ITR. That was given to us. By ITR, that was given to us by ATIA. And the question is, what else do we need to add in? And so that was this item 2, which I just reversed. And so here, again, in our case, M was 2. So we're looking at sigma 2 there. And so remember, the picture that I had before, it was at the top of the Magkey functor where things broke down. So that was the case where L was equal to C2. Is equal to C2. And so now I'm trying to look for homomorphisms from a subgroup of C2. So homomorphisms to sigma 2, which contain a C2. So there's not a lot there. So there's only one thing to worry about here. So we need to add in. So again, S here is going to be all of C2, and then the A. And then the A from C2 to sigma 2 is the isomorphism. And so remember, I had the gamma of A, and I think I forgot to say this out loud. Gamma stands for graph. So this is the graph of this homomorphism thought of as a subgroup of, in this case, C2 cross sigma 2. So, the graph of this homomorphism, this is the diagonal subgroup. The diagonal C2 inside of that Klein 4 group. Alright, so now in order to sort of fix this problem, we need to mod out by the transfer along that map here. And so, what we end up needing to look at here. And so what we end up needing to look at here is, so we're working in the representation ring. And so before we model by ITR, what we're looking at is we have the representation ring of this graph subgroup, which is a C2. And then we induce over to the bigger group. Now, complex representation ring of a product does split as a Representation ring of a product does split as a tensor product. Okay, and so then remember that, you know, TO told us what happens when we passed ITR, we have that specific evaluation map on this factor. Okay, so we're going to Ru of C2 again tensor Z, and this Tensor Z, and this is really the identity. Tensor, this evaluation map at a P cycle, that's in this case, it's evaluation at the transposition 1, 2. That's our P cycle. Okay? And so the thing to think about is where does 1 go under this map? And so you have to compute, right? You have to think about if you induce representation, and then we really want to then write it in this term. We really want to then write it in this tensor product. So in general, that's not so easy, actually. But it turns out you can show that in this case, 1 goes to the element 1 plus S tensor S bar. So here, I'm using S to know the sine in the left vector, and S bar is the sine in the right vector. Okay? And so when we evaluate this S bar, we take the calculator. S bar, we take the character we evaluated at 1, 2, that goes to negative 1. Okay, so this goes to 1 minus s. So when we modify that, we get the 1 identified with s as we solves the problem in this case. And so the last thing I want to do is just put up a few other examples that we have. So, if you have a case of the case, so here, so I have A underlying. Here, so I have A underline, that's the Burnside Mackey functor, so this corresponds to the sphere cohomology theory. And again, all of these examples are really coming from the global setting where we don't have to mess with completions. Okay, so anyway, so here's the Burnside-Mackey functor. In the middle, we have the mod I. And so here, so there are five orbit types of C2 cross sigma 2. When you modify the IT, Sigma 2, when you mod up by the ITR, 3 of them survive, but it's not yet additive, and you need to kill out this diagonal subgroup. And then in the end, you get that diagram, which is a map of Machiefunctors. In fact, it's not a terribly exciting one. It's... I don't know how to work this pointer, but I think it's because I focused away. Alright, so in this case, it turns out to be the identity map after you quotient by j. It's kind of strange. In fact, this is not special to g equals c2, so we were able to show that actually this is always what happens for the second power operation. When you modify j, it becomes the identity operation for any genome. So here we have g equal to c three. G equals C3 and the third power operation. And so again, I'm using, so the gamma here is playing a slightly different role than it was playing on the board earlier. So now gamma is our big group at C3 cross sigma 3. And in this case, so before, yeah, so there are 10 orbit types of C3 cross sigma 3. And when we model by I, six of them survive, but it's not yet. Survive, but it's not yet a map of green functors. We need to mod up one more, and so now we get five orbit types which survive, and this is the resulting green power functor. Okay, so still cyclic groups, but C3 is a little bit better. What about sigma 3? So here we have these Machine functions for sigma 3, and so the way that we're denoting things is And so the way that we're denoting things, at the top we have the sigma 3, at the left we have the C3, the cyclic of order 3, at the right we have the C2, and at the bottom this trivial group. And so here is, so now we switched over to Ru. This is the K-theory one. And so I claim this is what you get for the power operation after you mod out by J. So again, before, you know, if we just mod out by I, this was the identity map. By i, this was the identity map, but it was not a map of Machief. And we need an additional quotient. So you can see here, like, the s became 1 in this map. And there was also identification at this level 2. I mean, this is really the C2 quotient that we saw before. So this representation room for C2 is getting quotient down and becoming the constant vacuum functor. Okay, and then just one more. So still, One more, uh, so still sigma three, and now this is the third power operation. Okay, and so I guess I didn't explain all the notation. So, s is the sign, w is the reduced standard representation of sigma 3, you know, lambda are the, lambda, lambda squared are the one-dimensional irreducibles for c3. This one's interesting because all of a sudden we get torsible when we mod. So, this is the first case where we saw torsion coming up. Now, we were a little bit surprised by that. We're a little bit surprised by that. I don't have slides of these, they are in our paper. So, you know, these power operations, they're not so easy to compute in general. I mean, again, here we know that they're the atoms operations. But even then, still, I mean, so at this level, these are all one-dimensional, so the atoms operation, we know what to do. Here we have a w, which is two-dimensional, and so the atoms operation on a two-dimensional, how do you compute that? And so, the way we did it was actually mapping to the character ring and The character ring, and it's easier to understand what happens in class functions. And so we also have these written down for class functions, and then the comparison is what allowed us to deduce what this map must be here for representations. Yeah, lambda bar. So, you know, so rho bar is, when we take the regular representation minus one, and so I'm using the same notation, this is lambda. And so I'm using the same notation, this is lambda minus 1. So it's a virtual representation, dimension 0. Yes. These are all complex representations. Okay, well I'm going to stick. Analog, we don't be analog of this idea of like instead of character right itself. Is there anything else? Yeah, yeah, so we do describe that. I don't remember off the top of my head, but we were able to get a complete description for there. In that case, yes. Do you have a global description in the case R unit compared to the burn side of the tool? Yeah, I mean again this is really global. I mean I don't have any completions here, right? Maybe I meant here like, so did you work it out for all financing? No, no. No, no, no. Right, right, I see. Yeah, so the one case where we had it for all of finite G was the p equals 2 for the burn side. And then it, you know, turned out we were able to describe it up in the general. And yeah, and then for class functions, again, we were able to see what happens. And I think. Oh, right. Oh, for class functions and a billion p groups? Right. Yeah, so in a few limited cases, we're able to describe everything. So, like for Emma. So like forever we didn't know what these what power operations are elements of. And then finally Jacob Lurie constructed an E1 algebra of power operations. His course and now Tyler has written about in a paper so there's actually a place one can refer to. So I would like to encourage you to think about that. Think about that and say we'll do these power operations later. And yeah, so because this comes as the homotopy groups of an E1 algebra, they're total brackets. And so Tyler has shown that these are. Thanks for the comment. The same thing is true at Variant. Of course. Of course, you can't do that. So that's the first word. All right, so we reconvene here at 1:30. Have a nice one.
