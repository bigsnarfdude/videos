Okay, well, thank you very much. I think it's this, I can see that it's going to be a great conference. I mean, connecting the geometrical side and then the algebra side of Poisson geometry or non-commutative Poisson geometry. Okay, I'd like to, yeah, I should thank the organizers for the invitation. My um, right, so there will be four parts, so mostly I'll give. Four parts. So, mostly I'll give an intro, first of all, to give an introduction on integrable systems, a very short introduction, and then present, and then I'll present a general construction, our construction, for constructing integrable systems. And then the main examples will come from cluster theory, cluster structures. And then I'll give three examples for this construction. Okay, so I may many of you already are. Many of you already are already familiar with integrable systems. So let me just give a very quick review. So here we start with an n-dimensional complex Poisson manifold. And if you want, you can consider a Poisson algebra. Okay, so take the algebra functions. That's a Poisson algebra. And so therefore, the Poisson bracket is denoted by that. And then we have the maximum dimension of. We have the maximal dimension of symplectic leaves, and that's called the rank, which is always an even integer. That's called the rank. And then there is a very simple lemma, which says that if you have m holomorphic functions, which are independent and pairwise Poisson commute, then there's a constraint on this m. So the number, the maximum number of such independent Poisson commuting functions. Independent Poisson commuting functions is no bigger than that n minus half of the rank. So remember the rank is even. So why? So if you break that number into that, oh, I can do this. So this is the number of independent cash mirrors, which is roughly the dimension of the center, and then plus half of the rank. So the maximum number of independent involative functions you can get is this one. functions you can get is this one. And then this is called, this number has a name. This number is called the magic number. Let's just give it a name. It's called the magic number of the Poisson manifold. And then the definition of an integrable system is a set, a maximal set of independent functions which, so this means is independent. This means it's independent and pairwise Poisson commute. So, finding an integrable system on the manifold is to find such a set. Now, if you have a Poisson algebra, then you'll be looking for the maximum number or independent elements, algebraically independent elements, which pairwise Poisson commute. And if you have a quantization of that Poisson algebra, then you're looking for a maximum dimension commutative sub-algebra of your. Commutative sub-algebra of your non-commuted algebra. So that's the setting. Okay. Sorry, I think there is. All right, that's it. Okay. Now, so what we are looking at today is actually a special case of a Poisson manifold on which we are looking for integrable systems. And these are the linear ones. So it's a vector space with a linear Poisson structure. So what this means is, so, and these are in one-to-one criteria. So, and these are in one-to-one correspondence with finite dimensional Lie algebras. So, if you have a finite dimensional Lie algebra, then the dual space as a vector space is a vector space. It has a linear Poisson bracket. So, given by, if you have two elements in G, you regard them as linear functions on the dual, then the Poisson bracket is just the original Lie bracket. So, this is the, other than the constant Poisson structure, this is. Than the constant Poisson structure, this is the next just linear Poisson structure. This also has a name, the Kirilov constant surreal Poisson structure. Okay, so these are so every time you have a Lie algebra, let's say we are going to only look at finite dimensional Lie algebra, and then it has a Poisson bracket. The quantization of this, of course, is the universal enveloping algebra of this one. For example, I can take geology. For example, I can take GLN, and then you can, then what you get is a Poisson structure on the dual, but we identify the dual with GLN by the killing form, by the trace. And then to what we get, we are talking about a linear Poisson structure on GLN. So if you write elements in GLN as like the entries as Xij, then this is just a Lee bracket. It's just given by this. So that's just a linear Poisson structure on GLN. And you might Structure on Geolith, and you might ask for integrable systems on this one. So, what, let's see, what did I say? So, then there is a famous conjecture. It's the Michenko Fomenko conjecture, which is proved, which says that for every finite dimensional Lie algebra, let's say over characteristic zero, so this linear Poisson measure. This linear Poisson manifold always has an integrable system consisting of polynomial functions. So, since we are on the vector space, we can talk about polynomial functions. So, for today's talk, we are interested in finding integrable systems on this. And then we want the functions to be polynomial functions. So, the general question then is how to The general question then is how to construct, since the theorem says there are always such systems, and how do we concretely construct such integrable systems in general? And then this topic, so there's a famous method called the Times method, and then this is how you construct the, for example, the Gauffin set in integrable systems and so on and so forth. And that's not the method that I'm going to talk about. Okay, so I will. About. Okay, so I will not even recall the TIMS method. It's somewhat related in some examples, but it's a very different method that I'll talk about today. So we'll talk about the new method for constructing integrable systems on this, but not for every G. Okay, for I'll explain like for a special class of linear Poisson spaces. A linear Poisson spaces. Okay, so as an example, as a starter, like a preview of an example, so let's take n to be the strictly upper triangular matrices of size of size n by n. So diagonal zero. So this is the algebra level. So on the diagonal zero. And then n minus is the opposite. So strictly lower triangular matrices. So then you can actually do then there as. Then you can actually do then they are as vector spaces, they are dual to each other under the trace form. So, you can so n minus is a Lie algebra, so it's dual, has a linear Poisson structure. So, you can regard that linear Poisson structure as a Poisson structure on n. So, here this n is just the vector space. The Poisson structure comes from the Lie algebra on n minus. So, as an example, let's say for n equals 4. For n equals 4, so I'm just looking at this, yeah. So, I'm just looking at this. So, there it has six coordinates, six-dimensional vector space. And then our result is going to give an integral system consisting of these four functions. You can check that the magic number is four. Okay, so you need four functions. So, what are these four functions? You start with this x12, and then you do the x13, then you do the x14. So, you can see these are the minor. Yeah, okay, let's. The mine, yeah, okay. Let's then you do this uh square one, okay. So, so then you get this integrable system in general. Here is the recipe. In general, I have a let's say I have this. So what I start, I start with the top line. So you should always touch the first, so I'm taking a so-called minors, and then I always touch the first row. So that's X1, and then this one, and this one, and this one. One and this one, and this one, and these are the one by one minors, these are all polynomials. And then for the two by two, you look at this one, and the next one, and the next one, and that's all the two by two ones. And then the next one, for the three by three, it has to be a solid, no zero. Then you just get this one. Okay, so this is a particular example. All this, the minors indicated above form an integrable system. So that's an example that we are going to get. An example that we are going to get as the general theory. Okay, so now I'm going to explain the general theory. Okay, so I said that it's only for a particular class of dual of the algebras. So let me, I'm going to explain what the setup is. So first of all, we have this notion of linearization of Poisson structures. So I start with a complex Poisson manifold and have a point where the Poisson structure is. Have a point where the Poisson structure is zero. I think this just means that you have a maximum, if you, in terms of Poisson algebra, you have a maximum ideal, Poisson ideal. Okay? And then you consider the cotangent space at that point, and then that has an induced Lie algebra structure, just defined in this way. And this is independent of, you represent a co-vector by D differential of a form of a function, and this is independent of the choice of the functions. Of the choice of the functions you take. So, this is a well-defined V bracket on the tangent on a cotangent space, and therefore the tangent space carries a linear Poisson structure. Okay, so that's very, very, so this linear Poisson structure, we call it, we call, what we call this pair, so this is a vector space with a linear Poisson structure, we call this pair the linearization of the original Poisson manifold at p naught. Okay, so it's this pair, not only. Okay, so it's this pair not only, yeah, or you can just see this linear Poisson structure is the linearization, but I so this pair is called linearization. So, what I'll explain today is a construction of general integrable systems on this linearization using something from P, from the original Poisson manifold. Okay, so I had so I'm going to explain what do I need on the original Poisson manifold in On the original Poisson manifold, in order to get an integrable system on the linearization. Okay, so that's the goal. So I need to explain what I need and what the construction is. Okay, so that's the setup. So now, how do I go from the original Poisson manifold to the linearization? So I need to do a little bit of preparation. The first thing is if is if I have a local, so because I'm only going to work near P naught, so I just care about local holomorphic functions. If phi is a non-zero local, so let's assume it's non-zero local holomorphic function around t naught, what we can define is called, so we can choose any holomorphic coordinate system around that point, and then we can define what's called the lowest order term of phi in the Taylor experience. term of phi in the Taylor expansion. You do the Taylor expansion and there's a series of polynomial series and then you just look at the lowest order of that Taylor expansion so it's a homogeneous polynomial. So that is called so that's the lowest yeah so it's a whole non-zero if phi is non-zero then you get a non-zero homogeneous polynomial and then which is regarded as a polynomial on the tangent space. This is called the lowest order term of that local holomorphic function. Of that local holomorphic function. And then the statement, you can easily prove that this is independent. So this lowest order term now is regarded as a homogeneous polynomial on the tangent space. It's independent of the choice of the local coordinates. It's a well-defined. So each local holomorphic function, non-zero holomorphic function around P0 gives rise to a non-zero homogeneous polynomial on the tangent space. This is the sum variable. This is the sound very, very. If you, yeah, and if you work with algebra, you can take the maximal ideal defined at t naught, then you take the girl of the m the, I don't know how that is called. You can, yeah, you use the m to the power model by the, you use the filtration, the m-adic filtration, and then you take the girl of that, which is can be identified with the polynomial ring of the tangent space. Rank of the tangent space. So that's how you do it in Germany. Okay, so this is what I need. And then we have a lemma. This is our first, this is actually rather easy to prove, the very simple lemma, which says that if you have, oh, sorry, I didn't. If you have two local holomorphic function functions, which this means that their Poisson bracket with respect to pi is log canonical, then if you take the low of Then, if you take the low for each one, lowest order term for each one, then they are going to Poisson commute with respect to the linearization. The proof is very simple. You just compare the lowest order terms of both sides. You look at this, you compare the lowest order of both sides, and you will see this. So, this is the key starting point of our work. So, this is a recipe for computer. A recipe for compute for constructing Poisson commuting functions on the tangent space. Yeah, so to get this, whenever you have this, you get this. And then I also remember that if fine are non-zero, and then this term, this lowest order terms are also non-zero. They are not zero. They are non-zero polynomials, and they automatically pass on to me. Okay, so therefore, Okay, so therefore, so now the question now is: if I have many, so let me go back. If I have many of this, if I have many of these functions pairwise canonical, I would get many of this. Then you think, oh, then I probably can get the integrable system. Okay, so therefore, we have a very natural question now. Let me okay, I'll just. Okay, I'll just okay. So if you have said your n is n is the dimension of your original manifold, and we say this set of functions is log canonical, it's pi log canonical. Remember, pi is the original Poisson structure. So pi log canonical means that pairwise is log canonical. And then we say that phi is a log canonical system at P0 if it's log canonical and If it's log nonical and independent. Okay. And then, so this is as many as you can get. And then what we, the previous lemma or observation, says that, see, even without being independent, if this whole C sequence is canonical, then pairwise the Poisson commute. So the question then is how many, even if I get algebraically independent ones to start with, and I get this by taking the lowest order term, since they all Poisson community. Since the old Poisson commute. So I ask, does it contain an integrable system? That's the yeah. No, if it's a linear combination, then I can, I don't get the this condition, I don't get this. So you see the proof, because in the proof, I need to compare. In the proof, I compare both sides. If it's a, since this side is quadratic, when I compare, I see that this the lowest order term is equal to zero. No, no, when you see linear, oh, you need linear combination of quadratic terms. Oh, or not linear combination of linear combination of quadratic terms. Ah, okay. No, I No, I or in that sense, maybe even higher, right? It doesn't have to be at least quadratic, you mean, even with other yeah, yeah, yeah. I need, I need that's right, because when you do linear combination, when you take the low lowest order terms, in my The lowest order terms, they might cancel. So I have no control of what happens to the lowest order term of a sum. But if you have the product, the lowest order of this product is equal to the product of the lowest order term. And then I can compare the degree. And then if I have I okay. Yeah, I don't know. I think. Okay, I have to go through the. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why do I need if you have a sound? Yeah. Yeah, because I don't oh okay, it will be weaker, so the degree will be even bigger. Even bigger. Oh. Well, that sounds strange because then, if that's true, then whenever, then in that case, you don't even need this to be quadratic as long as it's more than quadratic. Quadratic or higher order, then according to that argument, it looks like. But that's, I think, I'm a bit scared of that. I'm not sure that's. We need to think a bit. Yeah. Okay, very good. All right. Yeah. Okay, all right. So the question now is Okay, so therefore so what we have proved to form an integrable system on a tangent space we need so this is the magic number we need that many algebraically independent awesome commuting functions polynomials I already got n of them so the question Already got n of them. So, the question is: how many among those n polynomials and how many of them can be algebraically independent? Yeah, because we know that you cannot get more than this many algebraically independent polynomials by the general construction because they blossom commute. So, therefore, you need so the natural question: so, if you are given the law of canonical system at P0, high at P0, does this contain? Does this contain this many algebraically? It can only contain at most this many algebraically independent polynomials. The question is: does it contain this many? When does it contain this many? Then it turns out that there's a sufficient condition, so that's what I want to present. It's rather simple, sufficient condition. So, to prepare for that, I need to talk about. So, what do I do? I need to talk about. So, what do I do? I need to talk about the lowest order terms for meromorphic forms. So, I just talk about the lowest order terms for a holomorphic function. So, if you have a holomorphic differential form, let's say not meromorphic, you can do the same thing. You can take, again, take any local coordinates and define the lowest order. So, it's going to be you do the Taylor expansion, and then you're Expansion and then you're you write, then you look at the lowest order term. This first non-vanishing term. Um, sorry, the first non-vanishing, the total order, so the, so all of these are homogeneous polynomials in degree m, and then we define the degree to be m plus k. Okay, so that so this has degree k 1, each one of this has degree one. So that we define the degree of this to be m plus k. If m is the Plus k if m is the lowest degree non-zero polynomials that appear in your Taylor expansion. And then we regard it as a polynomial k-form on the tangent space. And then again, you prove it's well defined. It's independent of the choice of your coordinates. Okay, so that's the preparation. And then here is the definition. The definition. So, given, so again, recall that given a lot canonical system at P0, I want to construct to see what I have constructed integrable system. So, what we introduce is this Meromorphic N form. Just take this. Yeah, so just take this one. So, this is the top is a holomorphic one. And then, so this you can see we can write it as the differential of the log functions. And we even call this the log volume form to give it the name. And then, for this, since it's a very And then for this, since it's a Meromorphic one, we define, so we just use simple, we define this as a definition. Okay, its lowest order term is defined to be the lowest order term on the top, which is a polynomial differential n form, and then divided by this polynomial, which is now, so now this is a rational n-form on the tangent space. This is the definition, and then we define this degree to be the degree of the top minus the degree. of the top minus the degree of the bottom so this is well defined okay so out of this uh integrable system out of this log canonical sorry out of a log canonical system at t naught we construct this volume for log volume form compute this lowest order term it's now it's a rational n form on the tangent space it has a degree and now the theorem um is that for in order for the For in order for this is a theorem. In order for, so this is a sufficient condition. If the degree of the log volume form is less than equal to half of the rank of pi zero, it turns out to be equivalent. Okay, that's a little proof, a small argument. Then the lowest order terms of all the phi's contain a polynomial integrable system. So all you need to compute is just. To compute is just this degree. So that's the main theorem, and which is not hard to prove. Oh, you need to compare the degree with half of the rank. Remember, the rank is, this is the linear Poisson structure, linearized Poisson structure. The rank is always half integer. I forgot to say, because we are looking at a dual of a D algebra, so the sympletic leaves are the co-edge or this. So we are looking at the largest co-dimensional. Looking at the largest coordination among all the coordinate organs, that's an even number, and then divided by two is what we need. Okay, so this log volume form must have that degree, or if it is a sufficient condition, if it has that degree, then we have an integrable system. Okay, so that's the construction. So now I'm going to apply this. And when do we have this? In what situation do I actually have this so that I get an integrable system? Okay. So the further, I give you the So, for the, I give this a name. We say this log canonical system at P0 has property I. We don't have a better name, I for integrable. You can see E means enough. So, this is called property I if this degree is what we need. Okay, so property I means a degree, we get the integrable system. So, property I implies that I get an integrable system, it's a sufficient condition. System. It's a sufficient condition. Okay. Okay. So the recap now, yeah, I already said this. This is just a recap of the program, the program, starting with the Poisson manifold, where the Poisson structure vanishes at a point. You linearize the Poisson structure there. You get the linear Poisson structure. You ask for integrable systems for that. And then you, if you And then you, if you have a log canonical system on your original Poisson manifold, you compute this log volume form, you take this log volume form, compute its degree at that point. If that degree matches half of the rank, then we get an integral system. Okay, so that's the scheme. Okay, so now we need to look at examples. How do I get log canonical systems? The whole point is that cluster theory, the cluster. That cluster theory, the cluster algebras gives you a source, it's a rich source for log canonical, um, Poisson, log canonical systems on the Poisson manifold. So I give a very quick review of class algebras. Okay, so I'll give you a quick review of what class. Now, before even reviewing this, I want to explain how. So, what happens? Okay, the what I call this the wonderful lemma is like a wonderful fact of life, which says this, is so I'm. says this if so i'm going to explain what this means if you have a compatible class you have a poisson manifold if you have if it carries a compatible cluster structure i need to i'll explain what that means then is actually by definition every the so-called extended clusters in your cluster structure every one of that is a lot canonical is a log canonical system okay that's almost by definition that's actually part of the definition but the magic is Definition, but the magic is that all these extended clusters in general are infinitely many. I wrote it on here. Oh, sorry, let me just go back. Um, all extended clusters have the same up to a sign, up to a plus, minus sign, they all have the same log volume form. So therefore, if one of them has property i, then all of them would have property i, because they have the same volume for log volume form. So I just need to check for one cluster, I get property i. Cluster, I get property i, then every cluster would have property i. That's the wonderful part of this whole thing. And when this happens, I give this a name. So if it if pi carries a compatible cluster structure, and so if this property happens, so because because they all have the same log volume form, so I denote it by, it only depends on the cluster structure. So so how a clock, I have, I'm going to explain this, a cluster structure for us, you can regard it. Structure for us, you can regard it as a collection of coordinate charts. Okay, collection of coordinate charts on your manifold. So, if one of them has, so this common block volume form denoted by mu C, if that has this correct degree, then we say this cluster structure. Yeah, then every cluster is going to give a polynomial. So, this is a property of the cluster structure, not individual clusters. Clusters. So, in this case, we also give this a name. So, in general, typically, there are infinitely many clusters. Potentially, you get infinitely many integral systems. Oh, no, no, no. They don't have containers. No, your P does not have P0 does not have to lie in those coordinate charts. So, I'll give you examples. No, they don't. Okay, so then. Okay, so then, right, so we give this a definition. We say the compatible cluster structure has property i if you have this, okay. So, therefore, what I need for the rest of the talk, I'll just quickly explain what compatible cluster structure is. And then this is what I call the wonderful lemma. Um, these are all very, very simple. And then I look at there are three examples. I'll just go through them very quickly. There are three examples that I know from D-theory where the cluster. That I know from D-theory, where the cluster structure is compatible with the interesting Poisson structure. Therefore, you, and it has property I. Okay. All right. So now let me, so I have a couple of slides to explain. I think probably many of you already know cluster structures. So what is a cluster structure on a variety? So I start with irreducible rational affine variety. Okay, and rational because I'm talking about the And rational because I'm talking about the field of rational functions. So, what is called a seed? So, Cp is the field of rational functions. A seed in the field of rational functions is a triple. A seed is a triple, where the first one, the phi, is a transcendental basis over a seed. So, you think of this as a coordinate chart over your manifold. Okay, and then EX is a subset, it's not empty subset of your Non-empty subset of your index set. It's called a set of exchange directions. And M is a so-called mutation matrix. Its principal part has to be skewsymmetrizable. For this talk, the M is not that important. What is important is, so how do we mutate a seed? So we should think geometrically is just the coordinate chart. And then for those k that lies in this index set, we can do. lies in this index set we can do mutation in that direction this mute this m is used to mutate to get new coordinate charts so so here is how you mutate uh okay then before that each one of this is called extended cluster um and then this function are called so for k lies in here these are called cluster variables and for those which are not in there are called frozen variables so the frozen variables stay there Variables. So the frozen variables stay there. You don't change those variables. They are always there in every cluster. You only change the cluster variables. And here is how you mutate. So you mutate in the direction K. So K has, so this is how you mutate. You start with one seed. You only change one of the K. If K is in your index set, exchange set, you change the 5K to a new. You change the phi k to a new phi k prime, which is of this form. Where this is here, this is the entries of the mutation matrix. Okay, the point is that you just, this is the formula. This is how you mutate. You get a new function. The m prime is obtained from m by a mutation formula, which is not very important, but I wrote it in here just in case. I purposely did not want to write. I didn't. I purposely did not want to write it on the slides because I don't need it. Okay. This formula, you probably have seen it in from cluster algebra, but most people get stuck with this formula because there's no motivation for this formula. And why are you muted in this way? Okay. I gave a lecture a couple of days ago on how to get this formula from Poisson's geometrical point of view, purely from Poisson geometrical point of view. Why you do it this way? Okay. But for this talk, it doesn't really matter. Doesn't really matter. But what is important is what is important is we notice that the right-hand side does not contain phik because m k is equal to zero. So there's no phi k. So the two monomials do not involve phi k. They involve all the rest of the variables, but not phi k. That's one thing to remember. And the other one is then we call two C's are mutation equivalent if they can. Are mutation equivalent if they can you can start from one seed and perform mutation in any sequence of index and sets and then you get then we get um mutation equivalent then what is a cluster structure in general is the mutation equivalence class of seeds so you mutate all these seeds and you take the equivalence class mutation equivalence equivalence class um the the other thing is that all these mutation equivalence equivalent seeds and Equivalent C share the same set of frozen variables. So, those K, which is not in the exchange set, they stay the same in every cluster. So, those are called the frozen variables. This is what we need to remember. That's all. So, that's the definition of, so sorry, I should say, what is the cluster structure? So, a given mutation equivalence class of seeds, and then you can choose, this is a little bit technical, you can choose a particular subset of the set of. Particular subset of the set of frozen variables, you define the class algebra to be the sub-algebra. It's a sub-algebra that in the field of rational functions generated by all the class variables, all the frozen variables, and the inverse of the chosen frozen variables. This is the definition of the cluster algebra. Okay, so this is the definition of this. And a cluster structure, what is called a cluster structure on P, is Structure on P is a mutation equivalence class such that this algebra you get, the sub-algebra, which is the algebra of the field of rational functions, is equal to your algebra of regular functions on your variety. Then you get, then this is called a cluster structure on your variety. Okay, you want this cluster algebra to be equal to the ring of regular functions on your variety. Okay, so that's the definition. And the implication of this. And the implication of this, because all the cluster variables must be regular functions here, so all extended clusters consist of regular functions of Q. So that's the consequence. Okay, so all the class extended clusters will consist. So therefore, if I have a cluster structure, the way from the geometrical point of view, I think of it as coordinate charts. And all those coordinates on this coordinate chart consist of regular functions on my variety. So this is one way of, they just mutate in. Is one way of they just mutate in a very particular way, yeah. So that's what's called a cluster structure. So then finally, what if I have a Poisson structure? Then this is a definition by Gechmann, Shapiro, and Weinstein. So a cluster structure on P, which is set to be compatible with my Poisson structure, is, by definition, if every extended cluster is pylog normative. That's just the definition. That's just the definition. Okay, that's inner definition. Of course, you can ask: do I have one? So, first of all, to even a variety, for the variety to have a cluster structure is already a miracle. I mean, if you have experience working with cluster algebras, in general, you have to work very hard to prove that your variety has a cluster structure. But if your variety now also carries a Poisson structure, then you're asking your cluster structure to be also compatible. Cluster structure to be also compatible with the Poisson structure. If you already have a cluster structure, checking compatibility is actually not that hard. It's just a linear algebra thing to check. But in general, it's a miracle. You have a Poisson variety, you have a compatible cluster structure. And that's rather hard to get. But turns out that in lead theory, there are many varieties which do have this property. Okay, so that's what I want to say. But the other thing is that cluster structure. But the other thing is that cluster structures typically infinite type. So you have infinitely many extended clusters. Okay. So now very quickly, I just don't know the time. Now I'm going to go to the examples. So sorry, I want to define, prove the wonderful lemma. The wonderful lemma says that if the cluster structure is compatible with pi, then every extended cluster is log canonical and all extended clusters. So part one is actually in the definition. Part one is already in the Definition. Part one is already in the definition. That's inner definition, just to see part two, why all the extended clusters have the same log volume form. So that's because you just compute. So here, here, you see in the log volume form, you have to wedge exterior power with log phi K. So if I take away that one, I call this alpha, then the log volume form, because remember that. Because remember that the mutation rule says that this is a sum of two terms where neither term contains phi k. So, therefore, if you do the log, so the volume form becomes plus minus sine of this alpha. I see I take away the log phi k. Yeah, so I get this. But these two, if you take the log and take the d, they differ by this, so you get this. But all this alpha contains all the other variables. And then this. Other variables. And then this also only contains the other variables. When you do the exterior power, it becomes zero. You don't see the alpha exterior power with this d of log a1 plus a2 zero. You get this. That's all. So that's why. You can also see that I don't have to have two terms. I can have many terms. And then this is called the general or exotic cluster structures or generalized cluster structures by Gechman and Shapiro and the Weinstein. Shapiro and the Weinstein. So, this lemma also works for generalized cluster structures. Okay, so the conclusion then is that all the extended classes, once it's compatible, then they all have the same log volume form. So, when you need to check that property J, sorry, you just need to check for one cluster. Then, then automatically all the other clusters have the same problem. So, that's what I said. So, suppose you have a compatible cluster structure, then you can use any. Then you can use any cluster to define this long-column form. They all differ by plus minus sign. And then you compute property whether you, if it has property i, then you get integrable system for every extended cluster. Every extended cluster gives you a polynomial integrable system. So now the question, yeah, so then if I have this property, I give this a name. This is when we carry out in examples, I need to modify the I need to modify the frozen variable part. So I would not go through the detail, just give a remark that when I compute the block volume form, I need to modify sometimes the frozen variable part, which is fine, okay, to ensure this property I. Okay. Right, so now I just I'm going to go through three examples from V-theory where property I appears. Up to sign up to scatter is a is a is a is a no, but it's not a holomorphic one. It's a meromorphic one, it's a log of holy form it's not a merriment, it's not a holomorphic What do you mean log volume form globally? It's this one. This is volume form. It's not. Oh, yeah. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. You have a well-defined memory mode. Meromorphic volume form. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Okay, so now I go to the Lee theory. I go to three examples from Lee theory. So again, as usual, I have to fix all this stuff. Okay. Yeah, so semi-simple Lee group, Borel subgroup, Maximal Taurus, Vaughl group, and so on. Okay. Then the semi-simple Lie group has a standard so-called complex semi-simple. So-called complex and simple Poisson structure, multiple Poisson structure, and this is the semi-classical limit of the quantum group that everybody talks about. So the quantum group is a Hoff algebra, a semi-classical limit, it's a Poisson-Hof algebra, which translates into this language as a Poisson-D group. In particular, I have this group itself, has this Poisson structure I call ST stands for standard. Okay, so that's one of the examples of Poisson variety I'm going to talk about. Poisson variety, I'm going to talk about it has a class for structure. So that's our first example. The integral system, so the first example is that I'm going to look at this Poisson manifold, and the point I look at is the identity. This one has well-known, so the Poisson structure is zero at the identity, so I can linearize. And now then this one decomposes into double, so-called double. Composes into double, so-called double Brojas cells. And each double Broja cell is a Poisson sub-manifold. And each double Broja cell carries a compatible Poisson structure. This is the first systematic example of cluster structures that's constructed by Fumi and Zelovinsky in the cluster algebra three paper. So, this is the first systematic example of cluster algebras, cluster varieties. So, if you take, but they are not on double. If you take, but they are not on double Braja cells. If you take the longest element in the bowel group, and this is the longest element, then you can regard it as a cluster structure on G. Okay, so now on G, we get a cluster structure on G, which is compatible with the standard Poisson Lie group structure. And then you ask, does that have property I at identity? And there's the theorem which says yes. So this one has property I at identity. And so that we need to compute. And for that, we need to compute that volume form, log volume form, and compute how it vanishes, the lowest order term, the degree. Yeah, so that's the first theorem. And if you linearize, so I probably don't need to, so then you add, then of course you don't want to stop there, you want to study what kind of functions you get, what kind of polynomial functions you get on the dual of the Lie algebra. And then so we can do lots of Lie theoretical interpretation, understanding those polynomials. Those polynomials, at least some of those polynomials. Okay, so I will not go to the detail of that. So the second example is on the so-called sugar cells. So we consider the so-called flag variety, which is G mod B, and the flag variety carries a well-defined Poisson structure, which is just a projection from G to G mod B, which is called, I just refer this as the standard Poisson structure on the flag variety. Now, the flag variety decomposes. Now, the flag variety decomposes into the so-called Schubert cells. For each Vaugh group element, you have a Schubert cell, and there's a Poisson manifold, and then that Poisson structure vanishes at the so-called group elements point for the Schubert cell. So, therefore, you can linearize there. And then, moreover, now this is the work of a lot of people. The sugar cell also carries a cluster structure compatible with the plasm structure. And this cluster, I just Structure and this class, I just refer to because there are so many people involved, I don't know which one what to call, so I just call the standard class of structure, cluster structure on the Schubert cell. And so, this was in the work of these people. And then our theorem is that the standard class structure, cluster structure on each tuber cell also has a property at there. All right, then the last example. Oh, okay, I probably have a slide on what. Probably have a slide on what the linearization. Maybe you don't care about this one. There's a little bit like what is the algebra that's involved, and I'm getting what is the yeah, what is the tangent? What is the so the linear Poisson structure is basically comes from this Lie algebra. So this is this is a little bit detail. And therefore, yeah, so just a little bit detail what the linearization is. And then you can also study what are the lithium. Also, study what are the theoretical meanings of this sum of these polynomials you get. This is typically this is an infinite, infinite type, so there are infinite many clusters, and there are infinite many in principle. I don't know, we have only studied some of the clusters, which are the well-known clusters, for which we can look at, we can compute their lowest order terms. So we can interpret them theoretically, the meaning of those functions. For arbitrary clusters, nobody knows what they mean. Clusters, nobody knows what they look like. So we don't know the meaning of their integration of those order terms. For W equals W naught and for SLN, and this is the example I did at the very beginning. Final example is on the so-called dual Poisson Lie group. So the dual Poisson Lie group is a subgroup of B cross B minus, where the diagonals. B minus, where the diagonals have to be inverse of each other. So, this is a very particular. This is the dual, every Poisson Lie group has a dual Poisson Lie group. This is like every Half algebra has a dual Half algebra. Okay. And in this case, then there's this identity. So this guy, and then the Poisson structure vanishes at this point, and you can do linearization. The linearized, and then now this one does not have, this one has a generalized class of structure by these three people. Structure by these three people, and which is compatible with pi. And then is this one where for this one we prove this theorem? And this is the one that took us a long, long time to prove because the linear algebra is very complicated. This is where I got stuck for a long time with our collaborators, and we were very happy to solve the linear algebra problem. So, that's yeah, so that's so the corresponding so linearization is a what you get is. is a what you get is the is the is a Poisson so so we so what is the linear Poisson structure vector space what is the linear Poisson structure as at the beginning I identified GLM with the dual so I'm looking at this particular Poisson structure okay I'm looking at this very particular linear Poisson structure I just want to give you a flavor of what those functions look like those polynomial functions so I'm going to get the integrable system on on here okay so I get I have to show you a collection I have to show you a collection of polynomial functions. So, it's very straight. The linear algebra involved is very weird from my point of view, but you have to consider this F. You consider this map F. So, what this means is that this is the first column of X. X is an element in here. First column, and take X squared and take this first column. Takes X to the power n, take its first column. So, put those columns together, you get a new matrix. Consider that matrix. Consider that matrix. X is an element in here. X is a matrix. Okay, I'm going to define the polynomial functions on this space now, right? So I start with a point, which is a matrix there called at X. Then you take, this means the first column of X, put it in here. Pick X squared as a matrix and take its first column and so on. So this is a new matrix. And then you have to do, okay, forget about this. Um, okay, forget about this thing, and then what you do, so this is your fx, suppose your f looks like this. So you're going to take functions, polynomials of entries of f of x by doing by looking at these minors, this one, the corner one, the two by two one, the three by three one, all the way up to there. And then you do this for you, then you start from here, and then two by two and three, and then so on. And then you do, and then you do at the end, and then you plot some passive function, and the fact is that all. function and the fact is that all these functions are from that's the integrable system we get okay for n equals this is this is not definitely not the same as the well-known gelfon settling system uh we don't we haven't studied a lot so for n equals three let me just the magic number is six so so you take this is an element in gl3 yeah nine-dimensional the f of x looks like this you take the first column you take x squared this is You take x squared, this is the first column of x squared. You put in the second column here, it doesn't really matter. And the functions that we get, the integrable system consists of six functions. They look like this. Just as an example. I think I don't know the time. I think I'm done. Yeah.
