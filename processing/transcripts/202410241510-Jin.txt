I'm very happy to be here and have the opportunity to give the talk. Today I will give the talk titled Natural Model Reduction for Kinetic Research, which I think may derive from the topic of the workshops, I think. This is a joint work with my advisor, Professor Rodi at Peking University. So let us begin with the atmosphere we are living in. Atmosphere we are living in. As we all know, the gas is composed of a huge number of particles, very tiny particles. And if we look at the particles will move randomly and rapidly. If we look at a point in the space-time, near each point of the space-time, we can see many, many particles. And each particle has... How each particle has its own microscopic state. For example, it has its own velocity, it has its own momentum, mass species, rotations, whatever. Let us denote all the microscopic variables as casc. And it denotes the state of each particle. And since the number of the particles is very, very large, so we. Is very, very large. So, we can treat the evolution of the particles in a statistical way. So, we can consider the number density distribution functions of the particles. And here, we denote it by a function f. Here, e is the time, x is the space, and c is the microscopic variable. And this is the number density distribution function in this small, small. This small, small, is this small cube? And f is a distribution function in the phase space. So let us consider a very classical example. Assume that here, the microscopic scoping variable is less on a side. Let us consider a very example, very us consider a very example very simple example let us only consider the microscopic variable is just the velocity of the particle the velocity of the particle and we know the particle will move uh move move move move forwards until until it collides with another particle until it it collides with another particle and we will denote the distance denotes the distance the particle moves freely by a free a free the so-called free path and the Newsen number is defined as the ratio of the mean free path and the typical length scale in this model in this model there is only the only interaction between particles is the two body collisions and the collision is elastic this This is the only interaction we are considering. And at this time, let us imagine we use magnifier to look at the one point in the space-time. We use the magnifier, and if we zoom in and zoom in, we will find the guise is verified and verified. It corresponds to the typical. it corresponds the typical life scale is smaller and smaller and the loose number is larger and larger so the the so the guess is more rarefied and if the mean free path is larger it means the particle will move more distance to collid uh before it collides uh with with another particle and the noose number is also larger and it also means the uh guess is more rarefied. Is more verified. And on the contrary, if we consider the problem on a large scale, it means the typical length scale is large and the mean free parts if it is smaller, then the noose number is smaller and it means that the gas is denser and denser. Actually, on different scales, the physical system can be described by different equations. For example, Equations. For example, if the Newton number has to zero, it means the gas is denser and denser. The gas is so dense that the distribution function of the velocity of the particles will reach at equilibrium. And the equilibrium, we denote the equilibrium distribution function by this guy. And it is determined by several micro. By several microscopic quantities, including the density rho and the velocity u and the temporal seat. And the equation can be described by, the evolution can be described by continuum mechanics. For example, we all know the compressible OLI equations, for example, and for example, the nerve-source equations. And at the other extreme, if the News number is very large, The News number is very large, it means the guess is very verified. And the guess is verified if the number of the particles is very small. So we can use the molecular dynamics to describe this system. And we will evolve the position and the velocity of each particle. And the corresponding distribution function is just the summation of several Dirac mirrors. Rock mirrors. And in general, if the loosen number is not so small and it is not so large, it is on the mesoscopic scale. And the evolution of the distribution function can be described by the connected theory. And we have a general distribution function f. And we can notice that if the number of the particles n tends to infinity, anyway, this. Anyway, this function can converge weakly to a general distribution function. However, obviously there is a gap between the equilibrium distribution function and a general distribution function. If we solve, for example, the compressible OLI equation, the equation is too rough. On the other hand, if we saw equations in kinetic theory, it is In kinetics theory, it is too expensive. So we want to find some, we want to make some trade-off between these two things. So let us come back to the equilibrium distribution function. Maxwell discovers that at equilibrium, the distribution function of velocity of particles will satisfy a normal distribution. And the mean is the And the mean is the velocity, microscopic velocity, and the variance is the temperature. And the integral of this equilibrium over the full space will be density, density rho. And this is equilibrium distribution function. And if we want to know how the non-equilibrium distribution function evolves, it is actually can be described by Actually, it can be described by Bird's My equation. In Bird's My equation, this is a, it has the convection term and clearing term. The convection term will describe how the particle moves freely, and the clearing term describes how the particles interacts with each other. Since in this model, we only consider the two-body interaction term. So, the clearing term here is a bilinear map. Bilinear map. Okay. Actually, in this work, we will not only consider Bertman equation. We will consider connected equations in a general form. And here is the convection term, and here is the collision term. And C is the microscopic variables, and the V C is the transport velocity. And we do not. Not require this cursy, this set cursi is R3, for example. Actually, this general form will have many important examples. For example, the Birdweight equations, the radiative transfer equation, and many other examples. And this type of kinetic equations will describe the non-equilibrium thermodynamics. For example, the Dynamics. For example, the gas is rarefied, and another example is if we consider the gas-solid interaction, the gas is near the solid, and the distribution function will be far away from the equilibrium. So if you find the continuum mechanics is not sufficient to describe the physical phenomena you are interested in, so maybe you can consider the kinetic. So, maybe you can consider the kinetic equations. And the numerical challenges of the kinetic equations is the dimension is too high. For example, in Burzman equation, we have one dimension in time, and three in space, and three velocity, and we have seven dimensions in total. This is two high dimensions, and it is beyond the computational. Beyond the computational resources. And our objective is to develop a framework of structure preserving model reduction on the microscopic variables. Then we need structure preserving. Here is an example. If the model does not be structure preserving, let us see what will happen. Here is a grass 30 moment system. 13 moment system. You can see this is a reduced model of the Bird's magnet equation. For example, in OLI equation, we have five moments, and here there is a certain moment. And in Burzman equation, it corresponds to infinite moments. And here is just a model between Euler equation and Burzman equation. However, this system does not preserve Does not preserve an important structure. We will find it does not satisfy the hyperbolicity. In the first numerical example, we solve the Riemann problem, and we can say everything it performs very well. And in the second numerical example, the initial volume is just multiplied by a scalar. Here, rho is Here rho is four, here rho is six. So theoretically, the shape of these two examples should the shapes of the functions, the shapes of the solutions should be same, should be the same. However, we can see there is some high frequency oscillations, which we don't want. The reason is that this system does not satisfy hyperbolicity. And the green. and the uh the green region is uh the green region is where the system satisfies hyperbolicity and the red region the orange region is the system does not satisfy the hyperbolicity and we can see the numerical solutions just uh reach the the region uh uh the region uh reached out out of the uh hyperbolastic region and we can see this defect uh we want This defect. We want to emphasize this is not a numerical effect. It is a defect of the model. So what is a good model? What is a bad model? I want to quote a sentence from Professor Lubig's talk at the International Congress of Mathematics, SAM, 2018. He said a good algorithm should. He said a good algorithm should respect the structure of the problem, and in many cases, the structure is of geometric nature. In the model reduction method, I think a good model should also set a good model should also respect the structure of the problems. So in kinetic equations, what are the structure we are interested in? What is a good model? What is a good model? The first thing we want the model to satisfy is the well-positiness, the well-positive. And it turns out that the well-positiness is connected to the hyperbolicity and stability. And also the kinetic regions also satisfy many physical properties. For example, the conservation loss, the entropy dissipation, H-thereum, and the Dalian invariance. And we also want the reduced model. One the reduced model also satisfies these physical laws. And as a good model, it should be efficient in approximations. That is, accuracy and the degrees of freedoms can be guaranteed theoretically. And also, a good model should be easy to implement. And in this work, we don't involve anything about Involved anything about the implementation. And we will, in this talk, we will focus on the first two things: the structures. And actually, in our paper, we discussed the accuracy things, the things about the accuracy. But I will not mention it in this talk. So let us begin. If we see dynamics, numerical analysis, geometry, analysis, geometric structure, what we can think. I think the most classical example is the Hamiltonian system. So I think it will be helpful if we study Hamiltonian system first. So Hamiltonian system is just like this. P is the momentum, Q is the location, the coordinate, and we write P and Q in a variable U. in a variable u. And here dt equals to xh xh is a tangent vector field, tangent vector, tangent vector of the manifold M. And in many cases, the dimensions of the manifold M is too large. So we want to do model reduction. It actually corresponds to a pyramid addition. parametrication uh let us assume the parameters uh uh let us assume the manifold of parameters let us denote the the manifold of the parameters by m height and the dimensions of m height is much less than the dimensions of m and here is the parametrization map u height is a parameter u is a solution so we want these two things uh is approximate approximately Approximately equal. And by time derivatives, we want these two things equal to each other. And the question is: how to determine the time derivatives of the parameters? How to determine the time derivative of your height? It corresponds to project the tangent vector xh onto the tangent vector space of the approximate manifest. The approximate manifold. Maybe a very nature idea is to solve the least square problems. By solving a least square problem, we can minimize the error. We can minimize the error. But does it work? Absolutely not. Since it will destroy the structure of the problem completely. So what is the structure of the Hamiltonian system? The Hamiltonian system, the structure of Hamiltonian system is a symplectic structure. And the manifold is a symplectic manifold. Omega is a symplectic form. And the Hamiltonian will satisfy this equation. The Original Hamiltonian system is just this thing. And after the model reduction, we also want the. one the the the reduced system is also a hamiltonian system and by a direct calculation we can find uh we can find the the time derivatives of the approximate solution will just be a projection the projection of the oregano tangent vector and i actually we we we will require that the the the mapping between The mapping between the tangent space, that is the mapping A, it should be symplectic. In other words, the A should be a symplectic matrix. At this time, we will find the projection P is a projection satisfies this thing. Actually, if omega is not a simple active form, if it is an inner product. In it is an inner product. We can we will see the projection p will be an orthogonal projection. However, actually, here omega is a symplectic form. And we will find under this condition, the symplectic structure will be preserved. Let us give a summary on the discussions about we have a Hamiltonian system and the solution will And the solution will lies on a simple active manifold. And the simple acting manifold will have a simple active form omega. And the structure of this system is a simplex structure. And XH is a Hamiltonian vector field. And if we want to do model reduction, we need the omega height. That should be the four byte. four byte of of the oregano simple active form omega and the projection should be a simple active projection and now let us come come back to the kinetic equations so in kinetic equations may i may uh can we uh develop uh similar things as a hamilian system since kinetic equations have many structures the conduition loss the hyperbolicity could we uh have uh similar things Have similar things for kinetic equations. And to begin with, we need to reformulate the kinetic equations. As we see previously, we want to conduct model reduction on the microscopic variables C. So let us define the solution manifold as a sub-manifold of some function space defined on cassique. Space defined on cassi, and at at this at this time for fixed space-time point, the distribution function will lie in the solution manifold. And at this time, we can see the kinetic equations can be written into first-order PDEs. And here, AG should be a one-want tensor between One tensor between the tensor space. And in the context of kinetic equations, it corresponds to a multiplication operator by the function Vga C. And the right-hand term Q is a tangent vector. It actually corresponds to the collision operator. And now we want to conduct model reduction. Let us explain this figure. Assume the full space. Assume the fourth space is the full space is the solution manifold M. And this guy, which really looks like a manifold, this manifold is just the approximate solution manifold M height. And at one point, the right-hand side term Q, for example, the Q may not The Q may not lie in the tangent space of M height. The Q may may, for example, Q is here, and the tangent space of the approximate solution manifold is this. This is a tangent space. So we need a projection from the tangent space of the manifold I'm to the tangent space of the approximate solution manifold M height. We need a projection. projection and we project the collearion term we project the the convection term onto the onto the tangent space of m height and this is what mode reduction do and at this time the oregano state equations can be written in this way in in a first order PDEs and after the model reduction that is we act a projection operator on on the both sides of kinetic equations. The both sides of kinetic equations. And at this time, the reduced model will also be written in a form of first-order PDs. And our question is, does the reduced model satisfy the desired properties? And we want to prove this thing. We can have three steps. The first step is to define the desired property. The desired structure property in a unified way. And the second step, we want to prove that the model reduction will preserve the desired property. And the third step, we want to prove the kinetic equation also satisfies the structural property we define. Okay, let us begin with the very important structural property that is the local verposeness. I actually saw this is a actually for uh this is a this is a first order first order pd if we have if we do not have any requirements on this pd uh if the smooth if if the if the initial volume is analytic then the the the equation is loc locally well posed me locally well posed. However, if we do not have any requirements, even though the initial volume is The initial volume is smooth. At this time, the equation do not have local velposiness. However, Cato proved that if the equation is symmetric hyperbolic, then the equation is locally velocity for smooth state. So we can see hyperbolicity is very important to guarantee the local value positive of the equation. Covaposiness of the equation. So let us recall the definition of matchable hyperbolic systems. It requires that for each point, at each point U on the solution manifold M, there is a symmetric and positive definite matrix A0. And A0 multiplied Ag, multiply Ag, this matrix is symmetric. Actually, Actually, it will associate each point on the solution manifold with an inner product since A0 is metric and positive definite. And it will determine an inner product on the tangent vector space. So actually, this determines the remaining manifold as defined as follows. The remaining metric will define as the inner product. The inner product determined by the SPD matrix A0. And at this time, we can define hyperbolicity in this way. Suppose we have a remaining manifold Mg, and the system is hyperbolic if the convection matrix Ag is symmetric with respect to the Riemannian matrix. Remaining metric remaining metric. And actually, this is if the manifesto, the solution manifold M is finite dimensional, it is exactly the definition of symmetrizable hyperbolicity. And GAGX, GAJX just equal to this thing, and this term equals this thing. And the symmetrizable hyperbolicity tells us this matrix equals to this matrix. So this is quality. These two terms do equal. And we want to do model reduction. And as we said previously, we need a projection. So how to choose the projection? Actually, it will be dependent on herbolicity. And we prove this theorem. If the projection operator is orthogonal with respect to the remaining metric. To the remaining metric. The remaining metric, of course, it will be determined by the kinetic equations. If the projection is orthogonal, then we can prove that hyperbolicity is preserved. And at this time, the property of finite propagation speed are also preserved. We know if we are considering the kinetic equations with relativistic effects, for example, For example, the relativistic Burt's mind equation. Another example is the radiative transfer equation. And the transport velocity must be less than the speed velocity. And under this condition, we can prove that the agent volume of the reduced system also be less than the speed. Less than the speed of light and the property of finite propagation speed is preserved. So, this is the second step. We prove that the model reduction does preserve the hyperbolicity. And the third step is we want to prove that we want to know the kinetic equations is hyperbolic with respect to what remaining metric. And we can prove this theorem. I think it is. Theorem, I think it is interesting. The kinetic equation, we can prove that this two statement is equivalent. The kinetic equation is hyperbolic with respect to the remaining metric G, if and only if G is an L2 inner product. This tells us if we want to do mode reduction, the remaining metric cannot contain any information about contain any information about the derivative of the microscopic variables. And the condition is very weak. We assume the set of microscopic variables is finite dimensional and the transport equation, the transport velocity is a smooth injective immersion. For example, if we consider the R3 to R3, it is a smooth injective immersion. If we consider Injective immersion. If we consider the immersion from the sphere S2 to the fourth space R3, it is also a smooth injective immersion. This is the case in radiative transfer equation. This is really a very weak condition. And we can prove that the kinetic equation is hyperbolic only if it is L2 inner product. And let us make a summary. Summary. The model is kinetic equation. And the approximate solution manifold is just the Riemannian metric. The Riemannian manifold. And the structure is hyperbolic. It means that Ag is symmetric with respect to the remaining metric. And the model reduction means the MAP I star is a local isometry and the projection. isometry and the projection should be orthogonal with respect to the remaining metric. And here we give the first criterion for the selection of the remaining metric. We need it is an L2 inner product. And the second property, structural property we want to discuss is the conservation laws. And we know Burzman equations satisfy several conservation laws, conservations of mass, momentum, Conservations of mass, momentum, and energy, and it also satisfies the entropy dissipation. It also satisfies the H-theorem. Here we want to have some comments of entropy. Here is a famous Bird's man's entropy formula, which is on the Birdsman's Grave Stone. Here, in the Birdsman equation, the Bird's Man entropy is defined as this one. And what is the entropy? And what is the entropy? It should satisfy three things. The first thing is the entropy should have a flux. And the second thing is that the entropy should have entropy dissipation. And the third thing is the entropy should be convex. And we will find the convexity of the entropy is very important to ensure the linear stability data. And we define the We define the local balance law in this way. And at this time, we can show that the evolution equation of C, the quantity C, actually satisfy local balance laws. And we prove if this equations hold, and we can prove that the local balance law is preserved and the conservation laws entry. The conservation loss entropy dissipation is also preserved. And we also discuss what quantities have flux in the context of kinetic frequencies. And it is very similar to the previous theorem. And because of time, I think I need to be fast. Actually, this theorem can help us to exclude. help us to exclude some the possibility of some quantity to be a candidate of the conserved quantity or entropy. For example, these two things, these two quantities cannot be a conserved quantity or entropy. And let us give a summary. And here the structure is the local balance law. And we need this secure this the pair between the this the pair between the D C and the Q, if it equals to zero and it corresponds to a conserved quantity. And if it is less than zero, it corresponds to an entropy. And the model and the projection, actually we need certain tangent vector should lies in the tangent vector space of the approximate manifold. Manifold. And the third thing we want to, the third structure we want to discuss is well putness in the zero relaxing relaxation limit. And here there is a small parameter on the right-hand term. And here is a stiff term. Actually, the hyperbolicity corresponds to a priori estimate for epsilon equals to one. And we also, where we are, We are also very interested in the behavior as epsilon tends to zero. If we only have hyperbolicity, actually there is examples that as epsilon tends to zero and the solution will blow up. And the question is, what condition will ensure the asymptotic convergence? Actually, in a previous work by my professor, By my professor and my advisor and me, we show that the bondedness as epsilon tends to zero is enough to guarantee the asymptotic convergence. It corresponds to the Lex equivalence of the hyperbolic relaxation approximations. And for quasi-linear case, the professor proposed the sufficient condition. And for Burstman equation, if we have Burstman equation: If we have a distribution function, we can calculate the microscopic quantities. And the microscopic quantities will determine Maxivian distribution as this way. And actually, in the general settings, in the case of general kinetic equations, this will determine a projection from the Aurigano solution manifold to the equilibrium. To the equilibrium solution, equilibrium manifold. And the generalized, the linear stability conditions will define as this way. And the first condition is the condition term Q will decouples decouple the macro and the macro part. And the second condition is hyperbolicity. And the third, I think it is a core of the linear stability conditions. Conditions. It requires that this term is less than zero. And here is a weak condition. And this is the definition. We also define the uniform stability condition. And we will find the new stability conditions is equivalent to the stability conditions proposed by Professor Wen Anyu. And actually, there are many previous works. If the reduced system satisfies, for example, the first stability conditions, and our work will ensure the asymptotic convergence. And if it satisfies the second stability condition, it will also have many important properties. For example, the existence of Existence of initial layer expansion and global well posting is near the equilibrium and existence of small short profiles and so on. And we prove that if the equilibrium manifold am tilde is preserved, then we can prove that the stability conditions are preserved. We also want to discuss the relations between the H-thoreoreum. Between the H-theorem and the linear stability. In summary, we prove that H-theorem use linear stability under this condition. And here is a very natural choice of Riemannian metric. For example, in the context of hyperbolic conservation laws, if we have an entropy, if we have an entropy and the and the actually the remaining metric corresponds to symmetry there in the hyperbolic system. If we have an entropy and the Hessian matrix of the entropy is just the symmetry of the hyperbolic systems. And in summary, the structure is linear stability and here the model reduction reduction corresponds to actually this thing is Actually, th this thing is the Gauss-Kodazi formula in Riemannian geometry. And the projection should satisfy that it preserves the equilibrium manifold. And we have the second criterion for the remaining matrix. It should be the Haitian operator of the entropy. And here are some examples. The first example is the entropy minimization principle proposed by Leroy. Proposed by Leromo in 1996. And we want to minimize the entropy under the moment constraints. And here is a set of optimal solutions. And actually, this model can be included in our framework. And the hyperbolic moment equations. Hyperbolic moment equations proposed by Jen Yun Sai, Yu Wei Sai, and my advisor Ruody. Actually, with some modifications, this model can also be included in our framework. And the difference is that here, I star is now the push forward between the tenant space. And I star should be defined as the projection onto the equilibrium. uh equilibrium uh multiplies uh the the the polynomials and it is not the tangent space of m height and a very recent work uh by lubic he proposed the regularized dynamical parametric approximations and here p star he wants to sol solve this uh optimization problem if epsilon equals zero it is just the the framework we develop and here if And here, if we add this term, we can also develop a similar structure preserving mode reduction framework. And here is a conclusion. We develop a new geometric structure to ensure the well positiveness in different regimes, in the O1 regime, and if this term is stiff, if there is one over epsilon, they can also ensure the well-positiveness and the. Also, ensure the well-pusness. And we also can also under which conditions some other important properties can be preserved by our model reduction method. And I actually will also give the error estimate. And we first justify the H-theorem, we will use the linear stability of the reduced systems. Thank you. Thank you.
