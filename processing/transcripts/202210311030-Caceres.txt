Maria Caceres from University in Granada, and she will be talking about non-linear, non-noisy, leaky, integrate and fire neuronal models. Please. Okay, thank you very much. And thank you also for the invitation. Well, I'm going to speak about the non-linear and oscillated neuronal model. So, first, Neuronal model. So, first, we have to recall that the neuron is an electrically stable cell of the nervous system that receives, process, and transmit information through electrical and chemical signals. Neurons connect across synapses and it happens at the level of the membrane potential, at the membrane of the cells. So, we are dealing with mathematical models to describe the membrane potential. So, first, So, first we have to say what is the membrane potential and the difference potential inside and outside of the cells. And there are different concentration inside and outside of the cell due to the different concentration of ions. And it's important to know also that when the membrane potential arrives to a threshold value, emit an action potential and then is depolarized. And then is depolarized to the reset potential. We call it in this moment spike times, or because the emission of the action potential, we call it spikes. Okay, so there are relations between neurophysical phenomena and the property of the solution of this kind of mathematical models. For instance, synchronization or asynchronization of the network is in relation with the blow-up. Is in relation with the BlowA phenomena, with periodic solution, and with stability, asymptotic stability. Also, it is related with the blow-up phenomena. And I don't know what you see in these two pictures. Maybe in the first one, you see old or a young woman, and in the second one, maybe you see two weight face or two vassal. So, this kind of thing. So, these kinds of things is related with the most stability result. So, what is my talk? I will start with some background. I want to say a few words about that I call it the family of model or call it non-linear non-sylikit integrated five models. And I will focus in my talk in a simplest one to try to explain you what is the blower. What is the blow-up phenomena versus the global system? And to be more precise, I would like to consent in what happened after the blow-up phenomena. In the second part of my talk, I will try to give you two different techniques to prove convergence to the study state. The first one is the well-known entropy method, which works for poorly connected networks. And the second one is a new strategy that works for large desynaptic delays. For large synaptic delay. Okay, so first, Lapec in 1997 gave us the key to describe the behavior of the membrane potential. He said that the membrane potential can be modeled as an electric circuit. So this means that the evolution on time of the voltage is in relation with the applied current. So we can We can think what is the applied current. Well, we can split in two in three in three terms: is the leakage current, the Eons current, and the external current. There are a lot of complicated models, but in this talk, I will focus in the simplest one, which is the integrated fire models. So, what is this model? First, well, we have the equation for the evolution of the voltage. If we don't have Of the voltage. If we don't have current, that happens is the voltage relax to the leakage voltage. Okay. As I said you before, there are some times, we call it five times where the voltage arrives to the B threshold, emit the action potential, the spike, and after that go back to the reset. So we have three typical value of the voltage, which is the leakage voltage, the reset voltage, and the reset. Uh, voltage, the reset voltage, and the threshold, and like in this picture, the voltage increase until this threshold emits the spike and go back to the reset. Okay, so how is model the current? Well, in the network, there are excitatory and inhibitory neurons. So, this means that the interaction in terms of the synapses of the excitatory neurons produces the increase. Neurons produce the increase of the current and the interaction with neurons reduce the current. So at the end, that we have is for each neuron several spikes which follow an stochastic process. So if we consider an infield limit, we obtain our Fokker-Planck equation. Well, obtain the Fokker-Planck equation, we assume. Fokke-Planck equation, we are assuming a network sparsis random connectivity with n neurons, a small synaptic strength compared to firing threshold, and every neuron spike according to a Poisson process. And assuming the number of neurons tends to infinity, we have two families of models. One from the microscopic description, we have an stochastic differential equation, and from the macroscopic description, Topic description: We have the Fokker-Planck equation that I want to explain in this talk. Well, parallel to our result for the PD description, obtain the analogous result of the differential equation. Well, here I include four references for the original of this partial differential equation due to Brunel and collaborator and Sirovic collaborator. This family of non-linear legit integrated file model because there are several that take into account. First, networks are composed of excitatory and inhibitory networks. Also, as I said you before, when the membrane potential reach a threshold value, emit an action potential. Emit an action potential, we call it a spike, and their voltage value returns to a reset value. And between the emission and the reception of the spike among neurons, there are some transmission delays. During a certain time, we call refractory periods. The neurons do not respond to a stimuli. So, if we take into account all these phenomena, the model is composed by four equations. Composed by four equations. Two Fokker-Planck equations, as I show you now, which describe the activity neurons, coupling with two ordinary differential equations, which describe refractory pairs. But in this talk, we will focus only in the simplest one because I would like to explain just the global phenomena, what happened after the global phenomena and the two. The global phenomena and the two different techniques to prove convergence to the study state. So, this means that we are considering only one population, we call it in averaging excitatory or in averaging inhibitory, and sometimes we consider transmission delay between the neurons. But in simplest model, we don't have into account the refractory state. Okay, so what is the non-linear Fokker-Planck equation? Well, the non-linear Fokker-Planck equation. Equation. Well, the non-linear Fokker-Planck equation is this one. We have a drift term due to the firing rate. Capital N is the firing rate. P is the connectivity parameter. This is the key parameter that we have to keep in mind in the rest of the talk. If B is excitatory, this means that the solution goes to the V the F to the V dashboard. And if B is negative, which means this drift moves the solution in the Drift term move the solution in the opposite direction. And we have here the diffusion term. In the rest of the torque, we will consider constants not depending on the firing rate. And in the right-hand side, we have the direct delta in the B reset times the firing rate. That means that if the when the neurons arrive to the V threshold, emit and go back to the V reset. So this means that there are no. This means that there are no neurons in the threshold, and in minus infinity is equal to zero also. And the filing rate is computed as the derivative of the solution with respect to B in the B threshold. So the system is non-linear and we have conservation of mass. So if we integrate in the variable B, we have conservation of mass. Of matter, we consider that this mass is equal to one. Okay, so what can we say about the blow-up versus the global system? Well, the result that we obtained for the blow-up phenomena was for the, well, we have blow-up phenomena for the excitatory network. For the inhibitory network, as we will say in a few seconds, we have global system. But for the excitatory network, there are blow-up solutions phenomena. Phenomena in different sense. If we fix the connectivity parameter, we can consider the initial data concentrate enough around the B threshold in such a way that we have blower. Or if we fix the initial data, we can consider the connectivity parameter B large enough in such a way that we have blow up. In one sense, we say this. Well, we have to have an To have an initial such that the exponential moment is bigger than this quantity. So, this means if we fix the connectivity parameter P, we can consider P0 close to the V threshold, we can consider as an approximation of Dirac delta in the V threshold in such a way that this inequality is true. If we fix the initial moment, we fix this exponential moment and we can take B. Moment, and we can take B large enough in such a way that this inequality. Recently, Pierre Rose and Vin Shalot proved that for B large enough, in this case, there are no steady states, all the initial data produce a blow-up in finite time. After terrible to the blow-up, Carrillo, Anzale, Guardani, and Shombi give us a criterion for the blow-up. For the blow-up, they prove it that they are a global solution if the firing rate, or in other words, they are blow-up of the solution if the firing rate diverts in finite time. For the inhibitory case, they prove it the global classical solution, so there are no blow-up, but for the sitatory case, there are only local well-positive of the classical solution because we previously prove it that they are blow-ups. Prove it that there are blow-ups in finite time. Well, after that, for the stock valuation, the Larouan collaborator did also the blow-up phenomenon. Okay, so if we put the delay in the model, which means that the the firing rate is delayed in uh because there are some transmission delay in terms of the synapsis information. The synapses information, the system avoids the blow-up. Here we can see what happens if we start with something which is close to the B threshold, which is the solution go back to the B reset and produce the blow up in the final time. However, if we consider the delay in this case, we observe how the solution go to the stationary solution. A stationary solution. Well, we prove it analytically that there are global solutions if we put the delay even in the case of the sitatory network. Well, in this picture, observe what happens in general, depending on the connectivity parameter B. If B is small, in this case, we have only one steady state and the solution goes to the stationary solution if we put delay. But in the case of But in the case with large delay, if we put excuse me, if in the case of connectivity parameter be large, if we put delay, that we observe it is that the fine rate is increasing, but doesn't diverse in finite time. So what's happened after the blow-up phenomena? Well, to answer to this question, we have to go back to the microscopic description. The microscopic description, and we analyze what's happened at the numerical point of view. So, a typical neurons of the network, the evolution of the voltage is given by the drift term and the Gaussian noise, the Gaussian white noise. Recall that when the voltage arrives to the V threshold, emit the spike and go back to the V reset. So, what is the relation of this fine rate with this stochastic process? A stochastic process. Well, the Laruan collaborator gives us the answer. The firing rate is exactly the derivative with respect to t of the theoretical expected number of spike times by a typical neurons. Okay, so the description we announce happen numerically and we answer to the question what happened after the blow-up phenomena and the answer is sometimes a tend to a plateau is Times tend to a plateau distribution, which means that the neurons are uniformly distributed between the B reset and the B threshold. Okay? To be more precise, we find the connectivity parameter B. Well, in fact, the connectivity parameter B, we are always in the case B positive because the situation where there are. If B is small, we know that there are only one study state. That there are only one study state. If P is large, there are no study states. If P is in intermediate value, there are at least two study states. Well, this is in relation also with the notion of physical solution. I don't have time to enter in detail, but the notion of physical solution was given by the Larut and collaborator at the microscopy level. And the main difference is that the expectation can preserve giants. Countries are a jam discontinuity. And with this, they prove it that they are global physical solutions and after the blow-up, so after the blow-up, the system continues. Well, the notion of physical solution makes sense for weakly connected networks. This means that the connectivity parameter has to be less than the difference between the V threshold and the VC because the network. This is because the neurons cannot fail more than once at the same time. So, what is the simulation? What happened after the blow-up? We fixed the red value as one and the threshold value and the diffusion term is constant equal to one. So, this is what happened if we are starting with something which is close to the V threshold that we know that there are blow-ups. The blow-up classical solution, but where the sense of physical solution makes sense. So, in this case, we observe it that after the blow up, the solution go back to the B-reset and then relax to the stationary solution. Well, the solution have a singularity in the derivative with respect to B in the B reset. With respect to V in the B reset, this is a function of the firing rate when the firing rate can be understood also as the difference of the derivative in the V reset in the left side of the B reset and in the right side of the V reset. And here we observe it, what is the time of blow-up? Here we have the singularity of Here we have the singularity of the expectation. After that, the expectation increasing the rate of growth is constant, which is exactly the fighting rate of the stationary solution. So this is, we observe it that the solution continues after all the neurons are spiking in the same time and goes to the stationary solution. So under what situation do a plateau stays appear? Plateau still stays up here. Well, the plateau distribution appears in the sense in the situation where the notion of physical solution do not make sense. And we observe it, this is in the limit case, that if we start with something which is close to the B threshold and we don't tend to echo the delay or we consider a small Delay, or we consider a small delay, the system tends to be uniformly distributed between the V threshold and the B the V threshold and the V rest. But in the case where the notion of physical solution makes sense, if we consider a large delay, the system tends to the stationary solution. However, if P is large enough and if we However, if B is large enough and we start with something which is close to the B threshold, the system takes into account the delay thanks to a plateau distribution. Okay? This is the case that the study state that we observe it numerically if we start with something which is close to the B threshold, the system tends to a plateau distribution, as you can see in these two simulations. And if you start with something which is far Start with something which is far from the threshold, the system tends to the stationary solution with the lower firing rate. In the case where B is large, there are no steady states, there are no sense of physical solution system thanks to a plateau distribution. So some words about the plateau formation. Well, this is the profile of the steady state. So if we solve it the stationary solution, we obtain that this is the profile of the stationary state. File of the stationary state. And in order to know exactly what is the steady state, we have to solve it this implicit equation for the firing rate, what is the implicit equation that we need to satisfy the conservation of mass. So if we impose that the integral of p infinity have to be equal to one, we obtain this implicit equation. We obtain this implicit equation for the file employee. We observe numerically that in the case of patho formation, the system are in some points close to that we call it pseudo degilibrio. What is the pseudo-equilibrium? We fix n and we compute n tilde infinity in such a way that this profile that we call it pseudo-equilibrio have mass equal to one. must equal to one. So if we relate with the stationary solution, if we put n infinity, this is an steady state because the integral of this quantity is equal to one c if n infinity is here. Okay, so this is different from the pseudo equilibrium because we can take any n and we have to consider here exactly the value that the this integral. Do that this integral equal to one. So, that we observe is if n tends to infinity, this pseudo-equilibrium tends to a uniform distribution between V reset and B threshold. And as I said you before, a pseudo-equilibrium is a steady state if and only if N is equal to N tilde. Well, in the case of B equal to B F minus V R, the Plateau distribution is in some sense. The plateau distribution is in sunset and steady state when n tends to infinity. Okay, this plateau formation gives us the idea to prove convergence to the equilibrium with a different technique than an entropy method. So the last part of my talk, in the last part of my talk, I want to speak about convergence to the study state. So the entropy method and it's in this model, if In this model, if B is small enough, we consider an entropy convex function and we construct this relative entropy, which is a positive quantity, and we can compute the entropy production and compare the entropy production in terms of the entropy using one carry inequality and usual groundwater inequality, where we can obtain exponential conversion to the state. To the state. So, in this case, for the linear case, when B is equal to zero, the entropy method works very well because the diffusion part we can use Poincaré inequality and the drift part have sign and can control without problem. The problem is if we consider the general case, the non-linear case, we have this extra term without sign. Without sign. So, in order to control this term, we have to assume that B is small enough. So, with this assumption, we can prove that the solution converse to the stationary solution. So, the open question is: how to control the vector in the case that B is not small. So, in So for using the entropy, so we are close to a linear case. Okay, and we present at the last part, in the last slide of my talk, this new technique, which works for D large enough in such a way we are close also to a linear case. So as I said you before. As I said you before, this is the profile for a stationary solution. And know exactly this profile, we have to solve this implicit equation for the firing rate. And this is independent of the model because this function of the model depend only in the parameter B and in the parameter the diffusion parameter A. Parameter A. So we can construct, we can build a firing rate sequence given initial firing rate. We obtain the term of this sequence using this expression here, 1 over a in 0. And with this firing rate sequence, we can build a seller equilibrium sequence as I said you before. So if we put here n, sorry, here. sorry here n k infinity n k plus one is exactly the value that we have to to to put here in order to mass of the pseudilibrium is equal to one so we have a sequence of firing rate and in this firing rate sequence give us a pseudo-equilibrium sequence and we well first a pseudo-equilibrium is the unit equilibrium is the unistadiest state of the linear equation with the drift term given by the constant value n k infinity. So the behavior that we prove is the behavior of linear equation given in terms of the day is determinated by the behavior of the faring rate sequence for D large enough because in some sense the system is linear in interval In interval of site the delay. Okay, so under some technical assumption that we do is the firing rate to have a limit, the firing rate sequence have a limit and infinity, then the also converges and converts to a stationary solution of the model, and we can prove that they are exponential convergent to this steady state. Okay, so to So, to finish, only to say what is the behavior of this sequence of firing rates. For B positive, as I said you before, we have three situations, B small, where there are unique study states, and in this case, the firing rates compare to this unique study state. For B large, there are no steady state, and this firing rate sequence diverse, and so the cell equilibrium converts to the plateau distribution and the distribution and they for B in the intermediate value there are at least two steady states and then we observe the stability if we start far from from with a small firing rate the the firing rate sequence to the firing rate of the of the lowest stationary value and if in another case diverse okay for d negative For B negative, we obtain that there are a value B star in such a way if B is between B star and zero, the firing rate sequence compares to the unique steady state. And if B is smaller, the firing ray sequence tends to a two sequence. And this is in relation of the firing rate of the sequence of the pseudo-equilibrio is in agreement with the previous result. In agreement with the previous result in the case of B positive and also with the recent result of Ikeda, Rux, and Salot and Smith about the model in the inhibitory case. Okay, so conclusion. Well, I will focus my talk in the blow-up phenomena and present two different methods to prevent the blow-up. There are blow-ups for the acetatonin. Blow up for the acetatonic network, not for the inhibitory network. And after the blow-up, sometimes the distribution of the voltage neurons are uniformly distributed between the B-reset and the B-threshold. We present two different methods: the entropy method works when B is small, when the connectivity parameter is small, and a new instruction. Small and a new strategy is follow the pseudo-equilibrium to prove the convergence to the steady state when we consider a large delay. Well, we are working in extending the result also in the inhibitory case where the distribution come the firing rate of sequence thanks to a two-to-cycle and also in the case of plateau distribution for the sitatory network. For the edatory network, so I will thank you very much. Thank you very much, Maria. We run a little bit out of time here, but we may have time for a very quick question here, either in the audience or. Yeah, go ahead. Is there bifurcation for the parameter B? For the parameter B? Yes. Because you mentioned there's only one unique solution when a steady state when B is small, no steady state when B is large, and at least two. I was wondering, first of all, the bifurcation for the parameter, and then second is how you present or prove the existence of multiple solutions in the mid-value for B. value for b uh well uh i i don't have time i i didn't have time like what where what's the reason of the of the bifurcation and the for b well you you have to solve this implicit equation for the for the firing rate for the steady state for the for the firing steady state okay yes so you you have to to to solve it this equation and this is the reason that the And this is the reason that working with this A function, you discovered that if B is small, you have one steady state, and if B is large, there are no steady states. Okay, so in the middle, you can guarantee at least two. I see, I see, I see what you mean. It's because you can study what is the behavior of this function, okay? I see. I see. Okay. Thank you very much. I'm afraid we need to move to the next talk. Thank you, Marie, again. And the next talk is by Chen Ho Tan from University of South Carolina. Chen Ho, can you start sharing your screen? Yes, can you hear me? Yes, yes, we can.
