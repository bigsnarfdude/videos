And it's a pleasure to welcome Antonio Vidile. I made a point of writing down the site of this talk, because I don't think I can remember everything. He's going to talk to us on projectivity, interactivity, push-up, and automation, and universality in mono-factory. Thank you very much. I'm not the one to blame for the title. Actually, I wasn't asked for the title. It was automatically given about it. But it's fine. But it's fine. I mean, it's okay. So I'm going to talk about some concepts, which actually are concepts that are coming from general category theory. And they're kind of objects that are studied in several other categories, both in analysis, algebra, and other fields. And so, and what we're But we are going to view them in the category of Banach Lattice. And actually, Banach Lattice is viewed as a category. It's not a unique option because what is a Banach lattice? It could be two things. It could be a Banach space together with an order relation satisfying some actions. That is a way to view a Banach lattice. But you could also view a Banach lattice as a Banach space together with some operation, soup, satisfying some other list of actions.
