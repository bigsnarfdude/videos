Marta Pielopan, who will talk to us about compania points, a new number theoretic challenge. Thank you. Thank you, Samir. Thank you very much for the invitation and for organizing this online event in a time zone where I can actually follow. So, here we're evening, well, dinner time actually. Let's have Let's have a nice dinner conversation. Okay, so I want to talk about company points. And in order to define them, we need a pair, a smooth projective variety X, and a reduced divisor with strict normal crossing. You can think of your favorite curve X with a bunch of points that make up your divisor D. Of points that make up your device ID, or you can think of a surface, for example, with some curves that intersect transversely and no more than two intersect in the same point. For simplicity, I will just work over directional numbers, but all the constructions can be done over number fields and actually over global fields. Okay, so define company points. Okay, so define component points. We also need integral models of this pair. So a regular proper model colli x of x and colli d will be just the closure of straight d inside collie x. And well, we start with the slogan. So company points are supposed to interpolate between integral Interpolate between integral points on the complement of the boundary colleagues inside colleagues and the rational points on X, or if you want rational points on colleague X, that's the same thing. This is the first slogan. So Kampana points should be an intermediate notion. The second slogan is that we should be able to think of Kampana points as some rational points on X, which have special conditions. Which have special conditions with respect to the boundary, and we will see them they look very much like tangency conditions. If you work over global function fields where integral points are actually curves, then you really speak about tangency in the classical geometric sense. All right, so let's go back a moment to revise rational points and integral points. We know that on projective integral models, these two notions are the same. Models, these two notions are the same on the projective line. Of course, integral points and rational points are the same form the same set. Then, if we consider a model which is not proper, for example, we take our proper model and the closed subset, for example, our boundary, and then we look at the complement of the boundary, then we look at rational points and integral points on this. And integral points on this model, and the two sets in general are quite different. In our example, for example, we just remove the point at infinity on P1, and then what remains is the affine line. And then we know that to sum up the rational points on P1, it suffices to take the rational points on the affine line and the point at infinity. But if we do the same operation with integral points, of course, these two sets are going to be equal. These two sets are going to be different. If we take just the integral points on the fine line, well, this is in projection with the ring z, and if we add the point at infinity, we will never have it match up with the set of operational points. Okay, so why does this happen? Well, because integral points are actually positive dimensional objects and the integrality condition is an integral dimension. The integrality condition is a condition that has to be satisfied modulo every prime. So for example, sorry, if we look at this representation of the projective line with like coordinates a and b from a2. So we have a point, for example, one, two, that modulo two reduces to one, zero. And then if we consider comma zero and then if we consider this representation of of rational numbers as points by taking a over b then of course one two so one half is going to reduce to the point at infinity during this operation so we see that this is a rational point of course one half is a rational point and since it would have to reduce to the point at infinity The point at infinity, modulo 2, then it cannot be an integral point, and of course, we know that one half is not an integer. All right, so this is somehow the correspondence. Now, let's try to understand what Kampana points are supposed to be. So, they are supposed to fill up the void between the set of integral points and the set of rational points, now that we know that there is some space to be filled. In our favorite example, we want with the point at infinity. We want with the point at infinity, then we have a fine line inside, which is just the rational numbers, and we write them as fractions. And then inside this set, we can have special subsets by imposing special conditions on the denominators of these fractions. So, for example, if a prime divides the denominator, then it has to divide the denominator with a high enough power, for example, two or three, or we can. Or three, or we can continue. And if we take the intersection of all of these conditions, then this intersection says that, well, we want that if a prime divides by denominator b, then an arbitrarily high power of the same prime has to divide b. And this, of course, cannot happen if b is an integer. So this means that in this intersection, we can only find numbers p that are. That are units. And then, of course, if the denominator is a unit, then we go back to the integral points, to the integers, sorry, and the integral points. So Campana points do like this. They are points that whenever they reduce to the boundary modulus and prime, they have to reduce to the boundary modulus sufficiently high power of the prime. In the example that we had before, for example, Example that we had before, for example, we see if we choose one, four, it's another rational point which is not an integral point, but modulo four it reduces to the boundary, which means that it is compana for the multiplicity tool. So maybe now that we have seen some examples, we're ready for the definition of component points. The first thing that I want to recall is that this component is To recall is that this condition that when a prime divides an integer, then the nth power of the prime divides the integer. This is called an nthness condition. I'm adding here also that I want my integer to be non-zero. This is my extra addition, just for coherence with the slides. So, in order to define component points, we have seen that we need a pair, so X and D, and now if we And now, if we have seen in the previous slides that we always have this condition that depends on the exponent that we choose for the primes, so we will have some multiplicity to fix. And we will actually fix one multiplicity for each irreducible component of the boundary. And then we can define when a rational point, which we look at it as an integral point on our projective model, we say that this point is a company point. That this point is a company point with respect to the chosen boundary and multiplicities, if well every local equation fi when evaluated at a point x is mi full for the chosen multiplicity mi. So this is the condition that I call a tangency condition in the sense of high enough tangency. So like m i times tangent. Of course, this is a normal Of course, this is a notion that makes sense in geometry and not much in arithmetic, but this would be the analogue. Okay, so now here is our new favorite example for this talk. We take again the projected line and now we take three points, for example 0, 1 and infinity, and we fix 3 multiplicity, m1, m2, and m3. And then we can try to And then we can try to understand what is the set of company points in this example. We take a coordinate A and B for P1 and then the set of points of P1 will be defined by co-prime coordinates A and B. And the Campania condition will require that, well, A is M1 full because A is the equation that defines zero, A minus B is M2 full because it is the equation that defines the point. Because it is the equation that defines the point one, and b is m3fold because it b equals zero is the equation that defines infinity. So, this is the first concrete example. And now, maybe we can start asking questions about these component points. So, first question: well, one of the very natural questions about rational points as well. If we have If we have our setting is the set of company points finite or infinite, and in particular, if our variety we start with is a curve and we know that it has an infinity source risky dense set of rational points, under what conditions, under what company conditions is the set of company points finite? So this is a very interesting and difficult question. Question. The first example. So, this is our favorite example, and we know that if we impose special conditions on the multiplicities, namely that they are all at least four, then this set is expected to be finite. And this is actually implied by the ABC conjecture, for example. There is a more precise general conjecture, which is due to Campana. That says that, well, this should be the case every time that we have a so-called log canonical pair. What does this mean? Well, if we look at the log canonical divisor, which is associated with this, say, Campana conditions that we chose, and this is going to be the sum of the canonical divisor of the curve. Of the canonical divisor of the curve plus, well, the sum of the reducible components of the boundary, each weighted by a special coefficient, which is one minus one over mi. So we look at this divisor, if this is ample, then we expect the set of component points to be finite. And this goes under the name of orbifold model conjecture. This conjecture is indeed a consequence of the ABC conjecture over number fields. And what we know so far about this conjecture. What we know so far about this conjecture is that it holds over function fields, of course, in particular over global function fields. And I think that this is the best that we know. I don't think that there is even one instance of the example that we have here, this P1 and so on, with some choice of multiplicities such that we know that this result holds unconditionally. All right. So this is for the finiteness kind of question. Now I go for the distribution of component points. So many of you may know that on phono varieties there is a conjecture of Manning that predicts an asymptotic formula for the number of rational points of bounded height when we let the When we let the bound go to infinity. So, what I'm going to present here is an analogous conjecture, which has been formulated in joint work with Anna Smith, Schulten Emoto, and Tony Radi Alberado. And it goes as follows. So, we take a number field and then we assume, well, this is the opposite condition as the one that we've seen before. Opposite condition as the one that we've seen before on the curve. We assume that the log anti-canonical divisor for the Campana condition we're interested in is ample. So our log pair is going to be of funotype. And then we also require, just to make sure that we are asking a reasonable question, we want that the set of Kampana points is Zariski dense in X. In X. And then we also take an idelically metrized ample line bundle. And the conjecture says that, well, possibly outside a thin set, a thin subset of the set of rational points, then when we count company points of bounded height, where the height depends on the choice of the idyllic arimeterized line bundle, then Line bound, then the number of these component points of bounded height outside the thin set should grow like a constant times the power of b and the power of the logarithm of b, where the constant in front is positive. And a and b are two geometric invariants of the variety x. In particular, they don't depend on the choice of the integral model. And well, this is. And well, this is like in the case of rational points, except that instead of the canonical divisor, we look, you use this log canonical divisor that depends on the component condition. So A is the infimum of the numbers T, real numbers, such that T times the delicate trace line bundle plus the canonical plus this weighted divisor is effective, and B is going to be the dimension of the minimal phase of the effective. Of the minimal phase of the effective cone that contains well, this joint device where in front of L we put the A that we computed before. All right, so this is our proposal for the conjecture for the definition of company points that I've given above. Let's see some results about this conjecture. So, I want to start with So, I want to start with an example. I'll try to go in chronological order as much as possible. So, the first interesting example that we can ask for is our favorite example with multiplicities 2, 2, and 2. So for each of the three points that we chose. And then we have to count the set of co-prime integers such that, well, the three polynomials that define the boundary. Polynomials that define the boundary a, b, and a minus b are all twofold, squarefold, and while the absolute value of a and b is at most big p. And then, well, this conjecture would predict that this grows as a constant times b to the power one half, actually this conjectural asymptotic is not due to our conjecture, it's much older. To our conjecture, it's much older than our conjecture. And I think I've seen it the first time proposed as an open problem in a talk by Bjorn Punen in 2006, I think. And it is still an open problem. The best result that we know in this direction is that we have a lower bound, which is sharp, and an upper bound, which can still be improved. And I think this is the best we know about. And I think this is the best we know about this specific example. But we do have results for the higher-dimensional generalization of this example. So instead of the projective line, now we look at a big enough projective space. And as a boundary, we have hyperplanes. We take all the coordinates hyperplanes here. And then we also add one additional. And then we also had one additional hyperplane, which is defined by the sum of all the coordinates equals zero. So in this case, there has been some work by Fan Valkenburgh in 2012, where he shows that while the asymptotic predicted by our conjecture that came later actually holds Actually, it holds in the case where the dimension of the projective space is at least three. So the number of irreducible components of the boundary is at least five, and all the multiplicities are equal to two. And there has been a generalization of this result very recently by Tim Brunning and Shuntaro Yamagishi, where they show that for the same They show that for the same family of examples, the conjecture asymptotic in the conjecture is true if we take the multiplicities at least two and well essentially the dimension of the projective space large enough, well, which is predicted by this formula here. And this formula has to hold for at least one choice of J. So. So these are two results that both employ the circle method for the proof. And I have to say that these applications of the circle method are not straightforward applications. There's a lot of work that had to be done. So this is for the first examples. Now I will turn to my own My own contribution to this conjecture. The first result is about smooth compactifications of vector groups with equivariant boundary and over arbitrary number fields. Now I didn't define for you the definition of company points over arbitrary number fields. What you have to do is to replace that by the ring of integers of the number field instead of instead of prime divisor you have to look at prime ideal. So you will just require the same conditions for the prime factorization in prime ideals. All right, so this result employs the height zeta function method and Method and which means that we analyze the heights data function for the set of component points, which, if we fix a height, looks like this. In the paper, we actually work with all the possible heights at the same time. And then in order to get a result, we want to apply a tobarian theorem, which means that we want to understand the pulse of this zeta function. The faults of this zeta function, and in order to understand them, well, we look at this expression and we know that this sum is going to be absolutely convergent, so this function is going to be holomorphic if the real part of the complex variable s is large enough. But otherwise, this expression doesn't tell us much. But we can use the group compactification structure, so the action of the group, of the vector group. Group or the vector group to apply a Poisson summation formula. Essentially, what we do is we take an auxiliary function delta here to encode the company condition. And then we take the Fourier transform of these new functions h times delta. And then we have a new series that we can actually understand much better. Most of the techniques come from These come from the papers by Chamberlois and Schinkel on rational points and integral points on compactification of vector groups. In our case, we have to deal also with the places of bed reductions for the boundary because we never require that the boundary is simple normal crossing everywhere. So that's an additional step that we have to ensue. So, this is for the first result. The second result is about Toric varieties. So, in collaboration with Damaris Schindler, we have been developing a so-called version of the hyperbola method for split Tori varieties. And we use it to show that the Manning-type conjecture for Campana points holds. Conjecture for company points holds for a lot of toric varieties with equivariant boundary undefined over Q and for the log anti-canonical height. Now this mainly comes from a technical condition that is well what we have for now for the hypergola method. So the proof goes More or less as follows. We use parameterization by split torsors to write down the set of points that we want to count as, well, points in the lattice, lambda, that have to satisfy certain constraints, including the companion condition, and have a height condition. Height is a must be, and this is logantic canonical height. Well, this can be very Well, this can be very complicated. And usually, the space defined by the height has spikes and looks like, well, hyperbolas somehow. And that's where the name of the hyperbola method comes from. So the idea of the hyperbola method is to separate dealing with the constraints and dealing with the height as two separate problems. So hopefully they are easier to deal with. So, hopefully, they are easier to deal with. The first thing is count the lattice point that satisfy the constraints and use a very easy height like the soup height. And then this gives some function, some asymptotic. And now we want to take this function of the asymptotic and put it inside the hyperbola method machinery, which is count certain functions with the easy constant. With the easy constraint. Well, the constraints are already all absorbed into this function, so we don't have any more constraints in the summation that we are left with. But now we deal with the height. So this is a machinery, kind of general machinery that you put inside a function, so an easier symptomic that satisfies well very specific technical conditions, and then the hyperbola method gives as a result the asymptotic. That gives as a result that the asymptotic with respect to the complicated height. Okay, so this is what I wanted to say about my contribution. And I want to finish with some more open problems and very, very recent results. So the first result I want to talk about is about Kwan Xiao, which is a student of Shotanimoto, who very recently Who very recently generalized the Heiseta function method for compactification of vector groups to bi-equivariant compactifications of the Heisenberg group with equivariant boundary. And he proves that our Manning-type conjecture holds also in that case over the rational numbers. And there is another very interesting result by Sam Streeter. Who is a student of Dan Lochron? I think that this paper came on archive just today. This is slightly different than the setting of the conjecture that we have, but it's very much related. It goes as follows. So we look at norms of number field extensions. In this case, so an extension of degree D. An extension of degree d. And then we look at the norm form as which defines a hypersurface in a projective space of dimension d minus one. For this norm form, we fix the basis of the extension. And then if we look at this pair now, and we look at some multiplicity, now here is just one irreducible component in the boundary, let's say, and we fixed this multiplicity, which is, well, okay, at least two. Which is, well, okay, at least two and is co-prime to the degree of the extension, then he computes an asymptotic formula for this case. I think that what happens here, which is slightly different, is that this is a pair that does not satisfy the simple normal forcing condition that we had. This asymptotic formula still satisfies the predictions for the exponents of the power of P and power of p. Power of B and power of the logarithm, but the constant seems to be different. All right, now, well, I thought of mentioning these two things because they are related, but also because right now that everything is online and most seminars have been stopped, I know that a lot of young people don't have the opportunity to actually present their work. So, if you're interested in component points, I really suggest you to look. Studying component points, I really suggest you to look into these two papers. And then the last plethora of open problems. So, the study of component points is just at its beginning. So, I presented a couple of problems, but there's many, many other questions that one can ask. For example, if we are still in our say log fano case, then well, do campano points satisfy potential density? What can we say? If the set of component points is a risky dense, is it thin? Well, we would expect that it is not, but we don't have much evidence. Actually, in the work of Tim Browning and Shintoviyamagishin, there is some parts that address this question. And of course, we can also ask: well, do company points satisfy some version of weak approximation, for example, weak approximation? For example, weak approximation. And of course, any other questions that you know that you can ask about rational points or integral points, you can ask also for an analog of recompane points. All right, I think I'll stop here. Okay, let's thank Martha.
