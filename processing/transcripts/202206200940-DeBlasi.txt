People, and thank you very much to the organizers for the nice invitation. So, today I would like to tell you something about my research in collaboration with Susanna Terracini and Vivina Barrutello on a particular dynamical system that can be described as a refraction billiard and comes from celestial mechanics. So, let us start with the classical Birkhoff case. You have a Case you have a domain which is a planar, convex, and smooth, and bounded, and you take a particle moving in it. So, every time the particle reaches the boundary, it bounces back by preserving the angle with the boundary itself. But there are many variations to the classical case, and I would like to focus to the case in which we have two potentials separated by an interface. So, our particle is not longer Constrained to be into the billiard, but it can exit following specific rules. In the case of the refraction galactic billiard, we have a caparium potential inside the domain, a harmonic oscillator outside the domain, and the junction is governed by a Nelson refraction law. I will describe later. There are other variations of this kind. For example, the inverse magnetic billiard studied by Sean Gazarek. The study by Sean Gazarek, in which we have a free motion inside the domain, a constant magnetic field outside the domain, so we have straight lines inside, and the circular trajectories outside. Why study these models? In general, refraction billiards can be used to study the motion of a particle subjected to the action of a discontinuous potential. In our case, it is used to study the motion of a particle in an elliptic galaxy having a black hole in its center. Having a black hole in its center. So, if you are near to the black hole, you feel essentially only the influence of the black hole. So, you see a Keplerian potential. But if you are far from the black hole, you feel the gravitational influence of the whole distribution of matter, of the whole elliptical distribution of matter, which generates a gravitational potential, which is essentially the potential of a harmonic oscillator. This model has been already studied by Delis Estino Bolos and Calabotaragos. Who showed by means of both analytical and numerical approaches the chaoticity of the three-dimensional model by estimating the Lyapunov exponents. So in our analytical model, we are in the plane, we have a bounded, irregular, and open domain in the plane containing the origin, and we consider the discontinuous potential given by a harmonic. Potential given by a harmonic oscillator outside the domain, a Keplerian potential with positive energy inside it, and then we study the trajectories at energy zero of this induced by this potential. I say energy zero because the energy is included in the potential. And this is a technical trick to consider the energy zero for all the orbits, both for the outer part and for the inner part. So the trajectories will be So, the trajectories will be the concatenation of elliptic arcs on the outer part, caparian hyperbola in the inner part, and these are hyperbola because we are taking a positive energy here, so E and H are positive. And on the boundary, we have a Snell's law, a refraction Snell's law in which if alpha is the angle of an outer arc and beta is the angle of the subsequent inner arc, we have a Snell's law. We have a Snell's law in which the refraction indexes are given by the square roots of the potentials computed in the transition point. So the angles are with respect to the normal unit vector to the boundary in the transition point. So we have a Snell's law, a refraction law, which depends on the transition point and in particular on the norm of the transition point. This Nelt's law can be considered as a generalization of the classical Snell's law for. Of the classical SNES law for light rays. And it comes from a critical point argument. So, to be more precise, let us fix P0 and P1 as two points respectively outside and inside the domain, and then consider a point P barred on the boundary. Then consider the geodesics Zd and ZI, connecting respectively P0 to P and P to P1. Of course, the geodesics are with respect to... Are with respect to the metric induced by respectively the outer and the inner potential. To this geodetic, we can associate the Jacobi lengths, which are curved lengths weighted by a term which depends by the potential, and then the Jacobi distances, which are functions of the endpoints and are essentially the Jacobi lengths of the corresponding geodesic. Then, if you sum up, some If you sum together SC and SI, you have a sort of distance between P0 and P1 following the all concatenation exterior-interior. And so the Snapchat law says that the transition point P barred must be a critical point for this total Jacobi length in the sense that the gradient of a C plus Si with respect to the transition point must be zero and with some. Be zero, and with some computations, we arrive exactly at the Nels law, as I already showed you. So, a critical point argument. As customary in Billiard's theory, we can study the dynamics over this model by constructing a first return map, which keeps trace over every time our trajectory completes a concatenation exterior-interior, refraction included. So, first of all, we So, first of all, we parameterize the boundary of our domain with a smooth curve γ. And then, considering P0, V0 as the initial conditions for an outer arc starting from the boundary of the domain, we can find a pair of coordinate C alpha describing these initial conditions. And C is the C0, is the parameter of P0 through gamma, and alpha is the angle between V0 and the normally unit. V0 and the normally unit vector to gamma in the point P0. So once we have this system of coordinates, we can follow our dynamics through an outer arc, through a refraction exterior-interior, through an inner arc, and then again a refraction interior-exterior. So we start from C0 and the red alpha, we arrive in C1, alpha 1, and when we are in C1 alpha 1, we are ready to restart with another. Start with another outer arc, so another concatenation. So we can construct this first return map that, given x0, alpha 0, returns x1, alpha1. Actually, this is a second return map, but every concatenation has two intersection points with the boundary, but in accordance to the literature, we call it first return map. So it can be proved that in a suitable set of canonical variables and we return on it, the Des Nels law implies that our map is This next law implies that our map is conservative, in the sense that the determinant of the Jacobian matrix is always one. But we have to be very careful by studying the good definition of this map. In fact, if our boundary is very general, we cannot be sure about the good definition of the map, and we have to study it in terms of existence and unicity of the arc, both outer and inner. Of the arc, both outer and inner, connecting a pair of points, and a good definition of the refraction. In this context, the geometry of the boundary plays a crucial role. So, what kind of problems we can study on this model? We study essentially three problems. First of all, we searched for equilibrium trajectories or equivalently fixed points for our first return map and then wonder about their map and then wonder about their linear stability. Then we have four physical parameters which are the energy, the frequency of the harmonic oscillator, the central mass, and the energy jump between the outer and the inner dynamics. And then we can try to understand how the changing of these parameters acts on the map. So searching for bifurcation phenomena. The second study was made Was made by taking boundaries which are close to the circular boundary. In fact, we have that. If our billiard is circular, we have an integrable map, and then we can ask if there are properties of this map which are preserved under small perturbation of the circular boundary. For example, in terms of existence of orbits with prescribed rotation numbers or existence of caustics. The third point is to analyze the possibly chaotic. To analyze the possibly chaotic properties of our map. And this starts from the construction of a symbolic dynamics. So, fixed points. The simplest case of orbits, of equilibrium trajectories we can imagine are the homogenic trajectories, which are always parallel to a given invariant direction. So, our inner and our outer potentials are centrally symmetric, so every radial direction is. So, every radial direction is invariant under them. In particular, to treat this singularity at the origin, in the inner case, we use the levisivity regularization. So, every time a trajectory arrives on the origin, it bounces back by following the same direction. Then we have that. Moreover, we have that every radial direction which is orthogonal to the boundary is not deflected by the Snetz law because sin alpha is equal to S alpha. Does not slow because sine alpha is equal to sine beta, which is equal to zero. So if we have a radial direction which is orthogonal to the boundary and does not intersects the boundary only once, this is the direction for a homothetic trajectory which corresponds to a fixed point for the first return map, and we call these points homothetic fixed points. These points depend only on the local properties of our boundary. Properties of our boundary. But in general, we are not sure that again our map is well defined all over the boundary. And moreover, we have for very general domains we have not an explicit representation of our first turn map. Of course, it's always implicit by the intersection between the various curves, but there are cases in which finding an explicit Which finding an explicit expression for our map is not so easy. This is not a problem because we are able to prove that locally around the homothetic fixed points, our map is infinitely many well-defined and differentiable. So we can study the linear stability of this kind of fixed points by considering the again values associated with the Jacobian matrix of the first return map computed in the homothetic point. And this map can be explicitly computed. This map can be explicitly computed, even if our first return map is not explicitly determined. So, we can construct a stability criterion based on the sign of the discriminant of the characteristic polynomial of the Jacobian matrix. And in particular, we have that, since the determinant of the Jacobian matrix is one, if this discriminant is greater than one, then we have an unstable saddle point. And if the discriminant is great, And if this discriminant is less than zero, we have that the eigenvalues are purely complex, have modulus one, then we have a stable center point. Again, this discriminant can be computed even if the map is not explicitly determined and depends on the boundary up to the second order and to the bar and on the physical parameters. So if we keep the boundary fixed, If we keep the boundary fixed and we play with the physical parameters, we are able to change the stability of these homovatic fixed points, so having bifurcation phenomena. To make these reasoning quantitative, let us consider an explicit example and then take a boundary which is an ellipse with a simulator axis equal to one and similar axis depending on the eccentricity. If the eccentricity is less than zero, so we are not in the circular case, we have only four homothetic trajectories or homothetic. homothetic trajectories or homothetic fixed points corresponding to the direction zero of pi pi and three of pi these are um pairwise symmetric so we can consider delta zero as the discriminant associated to zero and pi and delta one as the discriminant associated to alpha pi and three alpha pi. Again, now we have fixed the boundary, so our discriminants are function only of the parameters. And again, even in this simple And again, even in this simple case of the elliptic domain, it is not easy to find an explicit representation for the first return map. So in this first example, you can see an example of a bifurcation. In particular, here in the first image, you can see the graphic of the signs of the delta 0 and delta 1 as a function of h and mu. The other parameters are kept fixed. And the eccentricity, as you can see, is very small. So whenever. Very small. So, whenever we are in the blue region, delta zero is greater than one, and then zero. And whenever we are in the orange region, delta one is greater than zero. So, the other three Poincaré maps correspond to the three red dots you can see here. So, in the first case, we have that delta zero is greater than zero, delta one is less than zero, so we expect to have a subdo in zero. Have a saddle in zero and pi, and the center in half pi and three half pi. And this is exactly what happens in the numerical simulations. In the second image, you are in the tiny white region here. So both those criminals are less than zero. So we have four centers. And this is exactly this example. While in the third case, the situation is complete. In the third case, the situation is completely reversed. And in fact, we have that delta 0 is less than 0, delta 1 is greater than 0. And so we have two centers in 0 and pi, and two saddles in half pi and 3 half pi. And so, moving the parameter mu, we are able to swap completely the stability of our homotic fixed point. Here, another example for an ellipse, which is Is more far to the circular case. And here you can see, here everything is kept fixed except for H. And you can see us letting H grow, you can assist to chaotic behaviors. In particular, if H is small, you see essentially pretty irregular dynamics. But if you let H grow, you can see here the appearance. So, you can see here the appearing of diffusing orbits around the saddle and then diffusive orbits in a wide region of the phase space. So, this is a numerical evidence of a chaotic behavior, even in the simple case of the elliptic billiard, which I recall that is integrable in the classical Birkhoff case. So, this is for the first part. And for the close-to-circuit case, we have to Circle case, we have to specify the variational formulation of this of our problem and return to the total Jacobi distance here as a function of c0 and c1, which are the parameters of the initial point for the outer arc and the final point of the subsequent inner arc. Here, the Jacobi distance is as a function of only these two points because you can define implicitly the transition point as a function of the other two. Point as a function of the other two points by means of the Snell's law again. So, as in the classical case, you can use this distance as a generating function for your system and then consider the corresponding action angle variables. The angle is the same and the action is computed by means of the user rules starting from the generating function. Then you can consider your first return map as a function of these new variables. You can consider the orbit. You can consider the orbits associated to the initial point at C0A0 as the sequence of the iterates of the first return map starting from C00. And then you can consider the rotation number associated to it, which is the average of the angle variable, average of the displacement of the angle variable over k for k going to plus infinity. So you can ask, we can say something about if we have a general domain. We have a general domain. So, to every domain corresponds a different first return map. You can say something about the rotation numbers of the orbits for a general first return map. The answer is that there exists a class of beers for which we can say something like that. And in particular, if we have that, our domain is regular enough and sufficiently close to a circle, so it can be considered as a perturbation, of a small perturbation of the circle. Perturbation of the circular case, then there exists a set for a set of R for which, for every row in its set, there exists at least one orbit with the rotation number rho. If the number is too pirational, then the orbits are two and they are periodic. How to prove this result? This result is, of course, a perturbative result. So the first step, as always, is to start by the unperturbed case. So the circular case, which is completely integral. Case, which is completely integrable and has some nice properties. Then we take a perturbation of the circle, and by means of a KAM theorem, we are able to prove the existence of an invariant set for the perturbed dynamics in which our dynamics is well defined and has some nice properties we will use. Third, existence result. So we obtain the existence of orbits with prescribed rotation number. Prescribed the rotation number by means of Dipon-Karabikov and the Obri-Mader theorem. So, KM theorem is used in the version by Moser for finitely differentiable discrete maps. So, take a conservative map for which X1 is equal to X0 plus a shift depending only on the action plus a perturbation, and A1 is equal to I0 plus another perturbation. Of course, if the F and G are equal to zero, we have a 100% of the 1 G are equal to zero, we have an integral C, an increment, an integral map in which the action is kept constant, and the angle is shifted by a constant quantity which depends on the constant action. And so in the phase space, we see invariant straight lines which are horizontal with constant action. When we perturb this system by means of FNG, we can say that there exists a set. Say that there exists a set such that for every omega in this set, if the perturbations are regular and small enough, again with respect to a suitable norm, then we can find an orbit with the rotation number omega. If omega is the image of some I-barred through the unperturbed shift, then our invariant curve converges to the straight line of constant action. Of constant action I barred when the perturbation goes to zero. The other theorems we used are Pohreberkov and Obrimador theorems, which claim the existence of orbits with a selected rotation number for conservative maps. In particular, let us take a conservative homomorphism on the annulus and suppose that the boundaries of these annulus are preserved by our map and they have rotation numbers for A and Rock B. Rotation numbers for A and B. Then, suppose also that our map is twist in the sense that the derivative of the action with respect to the initial angle has a sign. It doesn't matter so much if the sign is plus or minus. Then, Ponkharibikov's theorem says that for every row which is two pirational between row A and row minus row B, there exists at least two periodic orbits. To periodic orbits with the rotation number 2πm over n. And the Obermader theorem extends this result to every rotation number, to every real number between rho A and rho B. So these are the ingredients. And again, the proof is based on these ingredients. So first point, circular case. Second point, construction of a invariant set. Third point, existence result. Third point existence result. So when our domain is circular, we are able to find the explicit expression of our first return map, and this turns out to be exactly as in the form of the unperturbed map of the KM theorem. So we have a phase space which is essentially volunteer by these horizontal invariant straight lines. So we take two orbits with the rotation with Diophantine rotation numbers. Fantarian rotation numbers. And we can use KM theorem to perturb our system, find the two invariant orbits related with the rotation numbers we choose, and find an invariant set between them. We can prove that if the perturbation is small enough, in this set the perturbed dynamics is well defined and it is twisted. So we have also that the boundaries are invariant. That the boundaries are invariant under these dynamics, then with a suitable change of coordinates, we can use Ponkare-Birkov and Obremador's theorem to prove the existence result for orbits with a rotational number between rho minus and rho plus. In the closed circle case, we can prove also the existence of caustics for our trajectories. So a cosic is essentially a smooth Is essentially a smooth closed curve which is tangent to every arc of a given trajectory. If you think about the classical case, it's very clear. So, orbits which are tangent to every segment of your trajectory. In our case, we have inner and other caustics, so we inner and outer arcs, so we expect to have inner and outer caustics. And in fact, again, we are able to prove that if we take a if we think about the If we think about the circular case, we take initial conditions for an orbit with Diophantine rotation number, then we perturb our system and we are able to prove that the perturbed trajectory has an inner and an outer caustic. Again, the proof relies on an application of the KAM theorem. Now, the third part. So, does our system have a Have a chaotic behavior. So, in the second example I showed to you, it seems clear that, or at least for a numerical non-rigorous point of view, it should be some kind of chaotic behavior. But what kind of chaos we have to consider? We use the Devaney's definition of topological chaos, which is based on three fundamental assumptions: the sensitive dependence on the Assumption: the sensitive dependence on the initial data, the topological transitivity, and the density of the periodic points. So, as Tere just told us, I will add some details, the model chaotic dynamics is given by the Bernoulli-Reich shift, which is essentially a map, which takes a B-infinite sequence of numbers within a set which can be finite or countable, and make a shift on the right of every term. The right of every term. Why this map is so important? It is important because through the it is very easy to, if we consider a suitable topology, it is very easy to prove that our the Bernoulli-right shift is chaotic under a according to the definition of Devane. And the chaoticity of this system can be used to prove the chaoticity of way more complicated system. We are a more complicated system by means of the conjugacy. So we say that a system given by a function f is conjugated to the shift if there exists a function a map pi for which this diagram commutes. And if this map is bijective, if the map is only surjective, we talk about semiconjugacy. So it can be proven very easily again that if f and sigma are conjugated, then also are conjugated, then also F is topologically chaotic. So we are able to prove the chaoticity of F by relying on the chaoticity of the shift. So the first step to prove the chaoticity of a complex system could be constructing this map pi. And this is connected to the concept of symbolic dynamics. We say that a system has a symbolic dynamics. Say that a system has a symbolic dynamic if there exists an invariant set X such that the restriction to our map of our map to X and the shift are semi-conjugated. Returning to our galactic billiard, we have that if our boundary satisfy a very broad geometrical condition, then we are able to prove that if H is high enough, H is again the energy jump between the outer and The energy jump between the outer and inner dynamics, then we are able to prove the existence of a symbolic dynamics for our model. This geometrical condition is the existence of two homothetic trajectories, which are trajectory of at least two homothetic trajectories, which are not antipodal with respect to the origin. And the symbols of our symbolic dynamic are exactly these homodelic trajectories, although, of course, with no. Although, of course, with numbers. So, we are able to prove the existence of the symbolic dynamics for a wide class of billiards because the condition is very broad, including the ellipse. So, again, we are moving in the direction to prove the chaoticity of the billiard, of the elliptic billiard in this case, as the numerical simulations suggest. So, this is what we have done. This is what we have done. What we are doing right now is to transform our semi-conjugacy in an actual conjugacy. So proving that our map is also, the map that describes the symbolic dynamics is also injective, and then arriving to proving the actual analytical chaoticity of our model. But there are other generalizations we can make. For example, we consider the end-central galactic billiard. The end-central galactic billiard, and then replace the central mass with a core in which we have many different massive bodies. In this case, it's pretty reliable with the reality, as there are many galaxies with a central core with many curves interacting. And here, the variational approach becomes fundamental as we to prove the existence. As we to prove the existence of the inner arc connecting to points on the boundary. Another complication could be adding the relativistic correction to our case. So for example, considering for the inner case a spartial metric. But other generalization can be done, for example, by considering the whole three-dimensional dynamics on our model. On our model, instead of restricting only to an invariant plane, or for example, considering the problem of cosillations, in which we don't have only a central core, a central massive core, but many different clusters scattered around the inner region. But I stress again that in general, the refraction model can be used to pair every Be used to couple every pair of potentials, for example, when we have a regional influence, like in this case, or when we have different regimes depending on the position of our particle. And I think that's all. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you. So, is there any personal remarks? I have a question if it is possible to ask. Maybe first. Yeah, go ahead. So I was wondering, I mean, the link of the elliptic boundary with very, very, very small eccentricity. Eccentricity with the circular case. Yeah, so of course, the boundary with very small eccentricity can be considered as a very small perturbation of the circular case, but we have that in the circular case is completely integrable, but in the circular case, of course, every radial Case of course, every radial direction is orthogonal to the boundary, so every radial direction defines an homotetic orbit and then an homotetic fixed point. But these fixed points are highly degenerate because their eigenvalues are equal to one. So of course the ellitic case can be considered as a perturbation of the circular case, but we have to consider that the Consider that this unperturbed case is highly degenerate, so we have to be very careful when we perturb it. I hope this answers your question. What are the descriptions of the word? Are the restrictions of the world? Do you have any restrictions on the border of the domain? So if we have restriction of the yeah, if we have restrictions on the boundary of the domain. Okay, it depends on the problem you are considering because, for example, for the first problem, you don't have any particular restriction because to study, to have the existence of a homothetic fixed point. Or mothetic fixed point, your only constraint is not to be a circle. Because if you are a circle, if you have a circle, you have that all the points are highly degenerate. So you cannot say so much about the homogeneous fixed points. But if you saw to, and for example, in general domains, you have at least two on. You have at least two in completely general domains, you have at least two homothetic directions corresponding to the maximum and the minimum of the distance of the boundary with respect to the origin. Because in that point, the derivative of the function norm of gamma is equal to zero, and that corresponds to have an orthogonal intersection to the boundary. intersection to the boundary. So this is for the first case. In the second case of course we can take close we can take close to circle billiards to apply perturbative techniques and in the third case as you see as you saw the the conditions to have symbolic dynamics are present but they are very broad. So it depends on the kind of problem you are studying. So they are asking if I consider only convex domain in this context? No, because it depends, again, it depends on the problem. Of course, for example, these results are very local in the sense that both the existence of homothetic. Both the existence of homothetic and the existence of symbolic dynamics are very local results for which you need only the local good definition of your map. Of course, if you want to study the global good definition of your map, you need some kind of additional results, additional requirements on the boundary. For example, there are results for example, there is this strange condition, which is the convexity for hyperbolas. convexity for hyperbolas which is um which uh is needed to prove the a to prove the good the global your definition good definition of your map because you need that every pair of points can be connected by a capillary and a parabola and for example the elliptic um domain satisfies this condition i i i don't remember but well but if the energy is high enough i think I think. Of course. If you take the circle, but then you put more than one center, could you make a regime where this is constant? I mean, obviously not going back a force, but taking like far away from the center as well. I think that if the I don't I didn't yet. I didn't yet consider this case, but I think that if the cluster is very small, the boundary is very far from the cluster, and you take orbits which are very far from the center, you can approximate it by a Kepler-Rand case, but you have the problem that you cannot go near. Near to the cluster. For example, you cannot consider the case alpha equal to zero because you cannot go in directly in the cluster. So even in this case, you have to make some restriction in your phase space to have reasonable regimes. Thank you. I'm returning a few minutes, sorry.
