So I'll talk about integral points on elliptic curves. And so before I stop the beginning, I should stop defining what I'm working with. So I will restrict to elliptic curves over the rations. And integral points depend on the model we're taking, the equation that we're taking, and how integral. We're taking, and in this talk, brother's talk, I'll assume that the equation taking is a minimal or positive minimal Reuben transform. So it could be y squared equals kube plus axb. Um, a b being uh in the integers and integers and uh the discriminant uh to me non-zero yeah we could and uh the minimal condition means that if there's four power dividing a then it implies that the six power of a prime cannot divide b. That's what minimal means and in terms of for integral points and let me just define what What I mean by integral points here, I just mean that some of the rational points on the Q curve where the x, y coordinates are both in the influence. So I'm satisfied, x and y satisfied this influence and the nine terminal. And the quasi-minimal condition on the model that we're taking means that if we didn't have that minimal condition, what happens is that we can take What happens is that we can take a rational point and then try to rescale the whole model to get an integral point in the whole model. So in some sense, the minimal condition tries to eliminate any sort of points that are integral points and not fundamentally sort of integral points. Are these the stable integral points in the sense of like a bombovich? What does that mean? Uh what does that mean anyway? So, stable in a random thing, you have to pick some really minimal model, but which is not necessarily this one. And the integral points there are some kind of like the absolutely the most integral points you can have. I think it's the same thing, but anyway, this is the well-law take, and that kind of eliminates the rescaling problem of integral points. Okay, so I'll stick to integral integrals in that model, and I'm interested in trying to estimate the size of this set in some sense. And a conjecture, well, before that, it's a theorem by Siegel that this set is necessarily finite. This is a theorem of twenties. That the number of integral points is There were more bells, actually. So, um yeah, the size of the set is finite. Size of the set is finite. But can we get some uniform bound on the number of points in number of physical points on the curve? Conjecture by lag says that we should be able to find an upper bounded above by only Bounded above by only bounded above in terms of on the internet. And in some cases it is sort of proven, but there's some restrictions. One example is theorem of Hadrian's overlap, which says that the size of this set can be bounded by some constant times. Constant times constant to the rank times one times that spiral ratio. So sigma here is the spiritual. So it's a log discriminant of the log of observed and logical power. This is the zeros ratio. So I think generally we kind of You kind of believe that Strom's ratio is bounded somehow. And if you also believe that the rank of the lithium curve should be bounded, then let's say that you can find up to the constant that bounds sets of number of integral points on elliptic currents, at least. Assuming that you're taking always the quasi-minimal model of the curve. But that's what we believe, and that's kind of a bit out of reach. So what we do instead is we could maybe average things. And okay, so we might ask, what are the average results? Alright, so I don't know if answer any question. Or sort of that's any questions we could ask. And it's a theorem by Levant, of course, that if we order by height, say order the elliptic curves by height, the height function is applied to the maximum. Maximum four cubed points were so if we order by by height moments theorem says that. Ment's theorem says that the average is founded and so what I mean is the linksuit, you take all the verticals up to height n and sum over number. And sum over numbers and then divide out by the number of ellipticas point up to n, and then take n to this infinity. And this limit here is bounded above by like 65 or something, but I'll just write 66. Or something, but I'll just write 66 just to really convene it. Okay, so it's founded in average at least, even though we can't say, we can't prove anything about sort of uniform pointwise bound on the count, at least on average is fine. So the open problem is how small can we actually prove that this average is in fact? Open formula and show that actually the average is zero. So heuristically, if you want to just get heuristics, you can kind of view the points or slightest point in some regions. Points, status points in some region, and then you can try to estimate the area of the region in which the points can lie. But usually you can't control the error term, so that's not really a formal way of doing like a formal way of proving this thing, but at least you can get some heuristics on how large it should be. I think it should in fact be zero, and it should also in fact be zero for For any families which you sort of restrict zero for any reasonable family in the patient. Reasonable means that you don't have a point uniformly or something. You have a marked point. Yeah, yeah, so I'll get to that. Yes, so I'll get to the answer. Any reading will come the overlap of curves. And after you remove any trivial points, so any fixed point that will be in order of cards. After unreasonable family could be the family of all of the curves of at least three points or something. Yeah, so I'm yeah. So you need something that sort of does not interfere with like with yeah with that. After removing any With that. After removing any trivial or any points in the total plateau for the right value of trivial, that's not an open problem. The problem is just files file definitions. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I'm not being precise here, but I'm sure like there were some cases we know, but okay, so one family I have worked on, so a quadratic twist family. So I'll just write E sub D to be the following table twist. Follow table twist. So d is an integer, and with all of the jargon, we'll assume d is positive. And square free. So the square free condition is to match The square free condition is to match this minimality condition there. And we can order by the usual high function, but in this case it's also the same as the ordering by discriminant. So order by d. And the discriminance of e to d is two. 2D or 6. So that's the same as rate discriminant in this one. Okay, so there are some, if you sort of stare at this at the moment and think about what points there are that are trivial, so what are the immediate integral points here? In on every private dispaling, With this value, you can observe that actually the two torsion points, a rational two torsion, are actually integral points. So, here here are 0.0 and plus or minus the these are integral points. And these are integral points on every curve in this value. Check that. So the only persistent points that are line with this values are basically these integral points that are two torsion. So we should expect that after we remove these two torsion points, After we move these two torsion points in our integral, then we should expect that the average is zero. So define a settlement. Fine settled more towards marketing with that. Mark them with that. Mark them with them. This is all the integral points that are not subject to the function. So y log equals zero. So the result, I have Is that in this family the average is indeed zero? So if I sum up all these counts, not the count, the square of the family with d less than n, then the estimate I get here is n times o n Again, to the minus one-eighth plus some small observer. So that implies, well, there are n curves with d up to n. So if you divide out by d on the left-hand side and divide out on the right-hand side, you get something that tends to zero as n tends to infinity. N tends to infinity. So that implies that in this family, the average is in the city. These are the non-trivial points. So would your statement be perhaps statement be perhaps cleaner if you ask whether the average is equal to the number of trivial points. I mean there's nothing changed about the proof but then you sort of at least remove the definition of what a trivial point means. Yeah but how do you generally define what trivial point means? It would be the number of It would be the number of points that lie on all the curves, basically, because that's what the average would tell you. Never mind. It might be quite a comment because this is a cleaner way to statement, you know. That's not going to change the proof. Then you have an error term, you get like three plus or whatever, three plus O of log and n to the minus one eighth plus such a plus. Yeah. Anyway, uh six little questions. This may be a silly question, but do you have examples where the minimality assumption of the equation is satisfied and the trivial points are non-torsion? Points are not torsion. Um torsion point on that. Yeah, it's not a good equation, but So for chordiac twist families, it's always the two conjugate points, I think. But if you construct some other family, some other properties, you can fix a point. I can imagine that you can force a point to appear in one of the equations, but then I'm not sure about the moment. The condition on p to the four, dividing a, yeah, like Artema and Hollow have those families, like, you know. And hopefully, have this family at one hard point, but it doesn't, it's not expressed in the Shorebar specific point. You have to get stuff in the calendar. So, yes, I'll just go through some ideas that we're going to prove. One related result is, I think I'm going to Bottom of the two cellar randomly. The average two cell random is found in the moments are all bound uh are all bounded and well it's like they're it's like they're all explicitly computed. Some constants. Some constant for each k. Some explicit, constantly think of explicit formula for each k. So all the k moments are bounded and bounded for this family. And actually with this result, and you combine some known cases in Lang's injection. In that sense, it gives you a bound, a point-wise bound on the number of integral points. So the rank is bounded by the two-sided rank. So if you take some large k so that this If this self or two self to the k is greater than the c to the r, then this means that combining these two things means that the average number of interval points is 120. This is one reason why I kind of have to restrict to this family is because I have this boundedness and in fact even more I can take the moments of the lemophilithic verbs and it's still bounded with P-bound results. So sometimes I know more stuff about this family than other projections families, even though we have Smith results on the distribution. On the distribution of two summer rank. It's not something, you don't get something for the moment, so it's not strong enough. It's not if you want to do some, when you remove, when you try to remove some crowds, you know, with some more points in this one reason why you need it. And Uh so um the crucial thing that I used in my proof is the balance correspondence. Um it says that uh well you have a digital point These things are in bijection with certain integral binary coordinate flows. Something as far as you satisfy some properties, but these are not too important, except it has to be an integral, it's an integral binary quadratic form. And also, this also. And also this also the relationship between the covets. Quadic form is that the discriminant of these quadric forms are in fact related to the discriminant of the elliptic curve. So there's some relationship between So, there's some relationship between them, some conditions on the coefficients, but so the crucial property here, and also you can also view these quartic forms in their sort of SL2Z family and view as SL2Z equivalents of equivalence of Equivalent passes forms that represents it's sort of the crucial thing here is that all these forms represent one. Here you can view by substituting. Here you can view by substituting 1 for x, 0 for y, then you see that these forms are represented 1. And if you look at their equivalence classes, it's 0% 1. So it's tempted to, well, let's just count the equivalence classes and drop that condition 1, but it turns out that if you need to get a saving, you need to, like, if you need to get a saving, this is a crucial problem that you cannot drop. So this is basically where you would get a saving. This is basically where you would get the savings from if you were able to just capitalize forms that sort of satisfy the relationship without the property that there is at one. At most, you're going to get that number of integral points are bounded in the family, but you cannot get a saving that reaches for. So, the idea is to transform these quartic forms to forms with small land discretion. Then, and then hopefully, we somehow can get a saving by handling fewer forms. There are some properties required to define So if I such a transformation so suppose I have an integral point and suppose I use this model square one cross one is to get my quadratic foil on the right hand side here. So suppose now F is the Now, f is the image of some integral points in my class. And suppose we can also find a prime that divides the Um that divides D, um, but does not divide x. X will be x1, I double that into a point. Then um we can transform this, and this is the excess transformation. is an integral of some integer k is an integral binary quadratic form. With discriminant original product formed about P to the sixth and And this form represents P. Okay, so instead of an integral form that represents one, now I transform the forms to something with a smaller discriminant and represent something slightly larger. Represents something slightly larger, but usually still kind of small. So there's a position here that has to be satisfying to be able to find such a prime that's of good size so that small discriminant, but it has to be from the device C and do not divide exponent of x. Under Mordell's correspondence, do you know what kind of elliptic curve that form corresponds to? Uh you can get a P integral point? So from this, you can, from the resulting form, you can build an integral point in a twist of the original family. But a different curve. A different curve, but still in the family. Yes. That's all integral, yes.  So another input okay so an input I need is that the so I need to make sure that when I look at the reduced the the forms after I've reduced the discriminant that they come They can't represent too many P's here. So you need to make sure that the image, like the fiber, is not too large. But that's okay because for an integral quarter, the integral is the same. Quadric form. So an integral quadric form generally cannot represent too many small numbers. These will be forms that represent the P we want to use here. So we need to make sure that each resolving form does not correspond to too many P's. So that's okay because this is something that's known. So we kind of are looking at solutions, bounding solutions to the two Two for some small edge. So that's one input. The other input is that we need to make sure that P is of size so that we could make sure that we can get a That you can get a good bound from this first step, but this first point here means that these discriminants are much smaller. So, this is something you can extract from the proof of the theorem of H. Brown. For 100% of the twist, I can find P of size. Both sides are roughly size that satisfy of this box condition for all For all integral points that are non-tension. Actually, if I be more precise, I still need to exclude some points here just to prove but for 100% of the counts, I can find. For 100% of the curves, I can find a prime of that size, which is good for reducing the size of the discriminant to the so that we have saving in the number of currents of form of the accounts, and also that I have a little bit of first point. This is my By short sale commission from this mountain. So then there are we go ahead and sort of count the resulting sort of count the resulting quadrant forms that we get after the production. There are little quadrant forms left. But the place is stopped. Any questions for Jerry? In your abstract, you also mentioned the cubic twist families. So which family can you just tell us about that? Yeah, yeah. So the cubic twist family For A and 3 D squared, where K is 0 or 1 times 3. The result is that 100% has no integral. A is the fixed one, and I'm averaging over D. The average is zero. Not the same, but sorry, yes. So you said that 100% have no integral point, but it's also true that the average is zero, I see. Good to have curves in the average. But to have curves that you can use. So here I don't have the Agrafree self-labor. Only. Okay, that's an interesting cell. I don't have an Agra Cell Q, in this case. Further questions? In your result where you're looking at the congregant number curve, how important is it in that process that you take genetic twist values? Also take sort of quadratic twists. Not necessarily just take Not necessarily just take x x cubed minus d times x. So, I'm not going to see that because that might foretold. The key is that you need to find a transformation that does this. So if you have so here this thing here is like 2d to 6. So it's important that this is equal to 6 power and you can divide out by some factor of 6. But I guess if you do y squared equals x cubed minus g x, right then this will become a 3 instead and maybe there's Maybe there's something we could do here, but I think that's a good idea. Further questions? Okay, thank you for going. Oh, thank you. And uh
