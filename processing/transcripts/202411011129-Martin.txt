Okay, so I'm not. Just a second. Okay, so may I start? Yeah, just go ahead. Okay, so thank you very much. Okay, so thank you very much for the invitation. So I will speak today about a few topics concerning Kasimutal equatorial flows, namely exact solutions, stability, and wave breaking. First, so this presentation is concerned with the problem of finding exact solutions concerning geophysical equatorial flows. And I start with the presentation of the coordinate system. So I will System. So I will look at the problem from the perspective of a cylindrical coordinate system, which means that the actuator is represented by a line which is parallel to the z-axis, which will actually denote the azimuthal west-east direction. And the r is the vertical variable, which is the distance to the center of the earth, and theta is the latitudinal angle. And I shall denote. And I shall denote with u the velocity field with the corresponding components and er, e theta and e z are the unit vectors in this coordinate system. So then the equation of motion, the equations of motions are represented by the momentum conservation. So the terms in black are simply the usual The usual terms, which now are written in cylindrical coordinates, and the terms in blue are representing the Coriolis effects, while the terms in red stand for the centripetal terms. And as usual, we have mass conservation written now in cylindrical coordinates. And similarly, I forgot to mention here is the equation, is the incomplete. The equation is the incompressibility. And so this velocity field is subjected to boundary conditions of kilometric type on the free surface, which here is denoted with big R plus H of theta and Z. R stands for the radius of the Earth. And on the bottom, we have the same. We have the same kind of condition just with the function d now is supposed to be a known function. Here, h is an unknown part of the problem, as like u v and w. And the pressures, so at the free surface, the pressure is required to match some given pressure function, which is capital P of theta n z. And so the main point is to look for And so, the main point is to look for azimuthal flows, which means that we are only looking for those solutions that are in this Z direction, so this is the azimuthal direction, and moreover, they present no variation in this direction. And we will assume that the given pressure on the surface depends only on theta, and likewise, the surface-defining function. Function. So in this setting, one can solve this the previous system of valuation for w and for the pressure p with explicit formulas, well explicit for the velocity field and explicit for the pressure. And we still have to find the free surface or the small h, which is actually given implicit. Which is actually given implicitly as this equation written here. And well, it turns out that we can solve this by functional analytic methods. And actually, we can immediately identify a simple solution, which is the one that keeps the free surface following the curvature of the Earth, and then slow. Taking sufficiently small deviations from this pressure, which keeps the free surface undisturbed, and we can always find a unique function which stands for the free surface. This small epsilon here stands for, designates a width of about 100 kilometers on each side of the equator. So this is a fixed quantity here. So this is the main. So, this is the main result here. And well, the relevance of these flows is shown by their stability, which means that we look at some perturbation of the azimuthal flow. The small W and PREP are given by the former as written before. And since we are dealing, we wanted to consider small perturbations, then it makes sense to ignore quadratic. To ignore quadratic terms, and then the capital U, which represents the perturbation, and capital P, which represents the perturbed pressure, satisfies this system. So we are given a small perturbation with some initial data. And we shall apply the WKB ansatz, which means that we are looking at short wavelength. Wavelength perturbations in the form of the terms given here in blue. And then if this A represents the amplitude of the perturbation and the small F is the phase, so these are highly oscillating wave numbers. So then, if this amplitude remains bounded in time along the trajectories of the Along the trajectories of the basic flow, which was the azimuthal flow with given by W. So, if this amplitude remains bounded, then this basic flow is called stable under short wavelength perturbations. And so I just state the results. So if we take the density to be of the particular type, so I want to mention that the density that we consider here is a variable, depends on r and theta. In the previous Theta in the previous slides, but here to be able to compute some quantities, we take it to depend on R and theta in this way. So then the basic flow given by this formula in blue is stable on the short wavelength perturbations. And finally, so now we so here I list a few papers on stability and instability related to the short wavelength method. Flood method. And finally, I would like to pass to a slightly different problem. So we are still looking for azimuthal flows, but we allow them to depend slowly on, to depend on time. So this is expressed by this formula by taking W depend on TR and theta, and the pressure depends also on TR, theta, and Z. And the free surface depends on T theta and Z. And so And solving the previous system, we come up with these formulas. So, this is the velocity, this is the pressure, and this is the shape of the free surface, which is given in terms of the pressure on the surface. So, this is an outcome from the dynamic boundary condition. And now we would like to use the kinematic condition to verify that such a flow exists. And actually, it turns out that they. It turns out that they exist if the free surface satisfies this Burger's-like equation. And now, so this is a non-linear PDE. And if you see that we fix the time t equal to zero, then this point and fix some theta and some z, this point is non-characteristic. And applying the general method, this situation is solvable in a neighborhood close to this. neighborhood close to this which in the neighborhood of this point zero theta zero is zero and we would like to to make things easier by choosing an initial data calligraphic h so this is the initial data and if you choose it to depend on z then we can the solutions to this equation star they are given in this implicit form and we can actually And we can actually calculate this z derivative. So, this is the z is the propagation direction, and this z derivative is this formula. So, now we can choose in the previous formula a small f such that this numerator doesn't vanish. So, we see that if we can make this denominator vanish, then we have a singularity of this derivative, which is the same as saying that there is one. Which is the same as saying that there is wave breaking. So we just have to make sure that there are t bigger than zero such that this quantity, which is actually this denominator, so we have to be able to make this equal to zero. And then we define this T0, which is taken by this infimum, and try to show that if we insert T0 into this formula for Q, then this quantity will be Quantity will be zero for some position h, so along the propagation direction. So then, because of this fraction here, we see that this happens, that this is zero exactly when this H prime in some sequence converges to this infimum. And so, this is an infimum over T and Z, over the time variable and Z variables. And we showed that actually this. We show that actually this infimum is equal to the infimum of over Z. So, infimum over Tz is the same as the infimum over Z, and then this would ensure that this H prime would converge to this quantity. And this double star formula, it's ensured as soon as we make the assumption that the initial data is bounded away from zero, and the same for its derivative. The same for its derivative and some other condition on infimum of h and h prime. And then we would have a wave breaking at some at some t0 defined in this situation, which is greater than zero and finite. So now I list a few papers on the phenomenon of wave breaking. And I guess I have to stop here. And thank you for your attention. Attention. Thanks a lot, Carlin. So I think since we're running over, we have to go directly to Henrik. Okay, okay. So thank you again for the invitation. And if there are questions. So thank you very much, Kellen, for jumping in.
