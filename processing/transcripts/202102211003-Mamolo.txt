So, welcome. Good morning. To get started, thanks first for the land acknowledgement. To get started, honestly, this time, I threw up this image and I wanted you to just have a look and think about, well, what could be depicted. About what could be depicted here? And to what is your eye drawn? Feel free to use the chat or open your mic. We're a small group. I don't expect necessarily right answers, but immediate reactions. What does this look like? What could it be? What does it bring to mind? I've seen diagrams like this before that are about sort of connections between like basically a double sorting between the same set. And this one looks really pretty even, like lots of, like there's lots of mixing. And so I don't know what it represents. And it's not obviously direction. And it's not obviously directional. Okay. So I can't say, like, I can't tell that these, or maybe it is. Well, there's some. So, so that's fantastic. So you're noticing a lot of the complexity. You're having a look at what relationships are happening. Is there directionality? Sarah has a connection to hyperbolic geometry. I don't know if you can see it on your screens. Around the circle are Are continents, well, not exactly continents, but geographic locations. And so, when you're paying attention to aspects of the diagram, I think we're a group of mathematicians and educators here. What was catching your eye? What were you focusing on? One thing that kind of stands out to me is there's like these little raised white sections on each thing. So it looks like each thing has like an outgoing thing that's all the same. Each thing has like an outgoing thing that's all the same color, then incoming stuff that's different colors. Yeah, absolutely. And you've hit on actually a really good hint for what data is being represented in this in this picture. And it's actually international trade, I think, related to agriculture. It's an old image, but if you look at world trade, you might find a lot of data represented in this way. The ribbons of the same color are going out. Of the same color are going out from one area, ribbons of different colors are coming in. What's interesting as an education researcher to me is what comes to mind? What are you noticing? What ideas are being elicited? And how does this representation capture aspects, mathematical relationships that might not be obvious in numerical presentations? But I don't think I have to work very hard to convince you guys that geo. Work very hard to convince you guys that geometry and geometric representations are important and valuable. So, actually, the plan for today is to focus on a little bit of a shift in gears. And when I came up with this title, I had the metaphor of shifting gears like when you're driving manual transmission. I don't know if people, many people still do that. We do. And it speaks to the sort of the shift in attention that we as. That we, as education researchers, sort of experience when you're toggling between teacher, mathematician, and in exploring these different sort of curiosities. So Alice in Wonderland and her curiosities, not just as mathematician. Oh, this didn't turn out. So this graphic shows up again later, but we wear multiple hats. This metaphor came up the other day. Hats. This metaphor came up the other day. So it was the same as the shifting gear, but we're mathematicians, we're researchers, we're people, we're teachers, and we are artists amongst us in the group. And as an education researcher, you might wear each and all of those hats at any time. And so the main question driving today is: how can we reframe some curiosities about geometry and art as research questions in education? To give you a little bit of context, I work lately mostly with pre-service teachers. And again, I mentioned, even though it's Canada, I'm in Toronto, Banff is pretty far away. And my work in pre-service education is around knowledge at the mathematical horizon. This sort of, it's quite specific in the literature, but it speaks to the kinds of mathematics we typically are exposed to in post-secondary studies, focus on structure and value. Focus on structure and values related to maybe proof and aesthetics. And my work really zooms in on how we can inform better mathematics instruction through co-developing deep mathematical knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and contextual understandings that are appropriate for mathematics, embedding mathematics in captivating but also meaningful learning activities. A good amount of my work connects to spatial visual reasoning. And my work here, Sarah might know, started with Walter Whiteley. And a lot of the activities and research we focus on are really aimed to be multimodal, experiencing concepts with the imagination, with visuals, with physical. With visuals, with physical materials, with dynamic software to sort of focus on how to design and develop activities that can capture challenging content in accessible ways and with attention towards the kinds of different thinking that's made affordable by these geometric representations that capture a whole lot more in one moment. So, that original image. Image just in its picture, you could, if you look, if I gave you more time to look, you would trace where the ribbons are going. You might look at the different sizes of the ribbons and get a sense of ratios of trade and that sort of thing. That would be a lot harder to make sense of in just lists of numbers. But it does take a little bit of convincing to get teachers on board. To get teachers on board and practice those aspects in their own classrooms. So, back to this question of juggling hats. I'm not sure why the graphic isn't working, but this is what I really was hoping we could workshop today is reframing some of your curiosities about geometry and art and thinking about, well, how can we articulate those as research questions in education and move forward for that? And move forward for that. And I thought we could do one of two options: one is to explore some of your own geometric artistry or artistic geometry, workshop those questions that could generate educational research, maybe discuss methods for tackling those questions. How could they evolve? Or I also have some samples of geometric artistry or artistic geometry that we could explore and generate or discuss. And generate or discuss some sample educational research questions and possible methods related to that. So I just wanted to throw it out what people feel open to this morning. Sure, Brian. That was a vote for B. Okay. Okay. I get it. B. All right. Any A's? Well, nobody else has their camera on, so sign language doesn't work. B, okay, two B's. No, and not two B's, but I guess we can move forward. Thanks, Sarah. I see your hands, I'll take that as a B as well. And there will be plenty of opportunities if we want to tie into your own artistry and so on. Your own artistry and so on. The first example is one that I will say is what I think of as geometric artistry. So, this is some work from Kumi Yamashita, pardon me. The website is right there if you want to check out more of this work. But again, the attitude I'm trying to convey for today is illustration. Trying to convey for today is eliciting some of our questions. And Kumi Yamashida uses paper folding as well as light and shadow in some of this work to create something really interesting. As mathematicians, as artists, or as educators, what questions do you have? I like that one too. Well, I like them all. I picked them. Is the number seven the light source? Where is that light coming from? Light source? Where is that light coming from? Great question. It looks to me like the light source might be further past the seven, but thinking about, well, where must it be given these angles, given these shadows, given this directionality? What would a student need to understand to make sense of where that light needs to be? And how might you, as an educator, access that understanding? Access that understanding. With my graduate students last year, we did a project like this as well. I introduced them to Kumi Yamashita. We discussed it. We interrogated a little bit. Is this really math that's happening or is it just kind of looking mathematical? Did it come together deliberately? Was it sort of haphazard? And then how can we create our own? Yeah, one question that comes up for me is: do you start? That comes up for me is: Do you start with the so just looking at zero to nine? Because that's my favorite. Do you start with the outline of the person and then design the heights, or do you play with the heights until you get a person? I have no idea which order is easier there. And neither do I. And that's one of the things that I like about this artwork is that, well, one, it invites this conversation. And if you were going to be mathematical about it, what would you do? What might you conjecture? What might you conjecture? What might be your approach? And why might that be? My students didn't feel that this was really mathematics. It couldn't have been deliberate. It had to have been art first. And then it just kind of haphazardly had this geometric aspect to it, or it was sort of a little more contrived, was kind of how they felt about it when I started asking. I started asking a little bit about their interpretations. I mean, a geometry question that drives it is what shapes of shadows are possible, right? And, you know, with the angles and the curvature of these standard finite list of shapes, what, what, yeah, what's possible? What's possible? Like the, yeah, and the nose, the sort of like slightly upturned nose that is particularly Surprising to me because of the shadow. So that's, yeah. It's actually a really beautiful curve that nose with, and then the eyelashes and right into like this lip, there's a lot of like really nice curves happening. And what's possible? And that's a really nice question that we like to ask as mathematicians: what if, what if not, what's going on, what must be true, what can't be true. Be true. And part of my work as an educator with pre-service teachers is to help them embrace that sort of thinking for their future students. If we look at that art, a lot of the questions, at least my initial questions, are the math ones or the art ones rather than the education ones. And so one of the ways to kind of shift those, juggle those hats or whatever, shift those gears. Those hats, or whatever, shift those gears, is to really think about: well, what's actually answerable via education research, and how can this inform teaching and learning and geometry? And then what research insights can be gained. We heard from Sarah's talk yesterday one of the ways that she incorporates a research-based practice into her own practice and how she uses that to reflect and improve on her teaching. And that's a very useful strategy. Useful strategy and one that you could apply not just for your own practice but to make broader insights around educational praxis trying to remember what I was thinking for this little interlude here and I think it related to some of the questions that come to mind in shifting hats tend to be really big questions with Questions with terms that are not necessarily well defined. One of our favorite things. So, for instance, could something, could an activity where students have to create an interesting shadow art out of different blocks help motivate learners? And that's a kind of overarching question people might have, teachers might have. Might have teachers might have, you know, can my art help inspire my students? I mean, that's actually a really hard question to research, to address, to have a valid, reliable response, or even one that can scale. And a lot of that has to do with ill-defined concepts like motivation, achievement, and even learning. And so these why do you These, well, I'd use FOSAT as well. I think you guys, I don't need to do that. But having working definitions of these terms makes a big difference in terms of not only what can you make sense of what insights, but what can be applied to your later practice. And that touches on one of Sarah's points from the other day. Thinking about possible research questions that I could tackle. Well, a Google search of Geom. A Google search of geometry comes up with a lot of prototypes. And if you consult the education research on teaching and learning and geometry, well, you find that a lot of kids, teachers, when they think of geometry, they're thinking about rule-based answer your worksheet, name these shapes, do this algebra. And so, one question that we could ask might. That we could ask might be: Can playing with artistic geometry or geometric artistry influence prototypical expectations for teaching and learning mathematics? That's still a big question, but it zooms in a little bit more than the broad, can art help motivate my students. But even then, if I were to set up a study to tackle something like this, I'll find myself asking a heck of a lot more questions. What are the prototypes? What are the prototypes? Well, there's lots of research around there, so I can consult that and make sense of it. But what data might need to be collected and how would I go about that? What items would I use? What would they reveal? How could I push to get at what might be under the surface? We see a lot of survey data, self-professions, and analyses around what students are saying or how they're. Are they saying, or maybe how they're behaving? And we make those interpretations as teachers. But it's a little bit different when you're looking at it from a research lens, partly because one of the shifts is from assessment to analysis. It doesn't matter as a researcher, it doesn't matter, put those in like bunny ears, if the learners are correct or giving, recalling knowledge that you're... Recalling knowledge that you're looking for, fishing for, or that you expect or that you hope. It's really more about what is happening in their heads and why. Could that be occurring or what could be influencing that or what might need to change or how might that need to change? But it sort of stops being about what is right and focuses more on just what is. So, like, some of the really common questions we all Really common questions we always have: we all have: how did they react? How did students feel about my lesson? And these came up the other day, too. What were the students doing? That tells me, you know, something or other about how things went, whether it was successful of the lesson or not. And as teachers, we get our gut feelings, we have some visual data we collect in the moment, we have our assessment pieces, we have all of this stuff. But often there's more under the surface, and so one of the sort of dilemmas in educational research is asking this question: How can we really tell? How do we really know? And the interpretive lens becomes really, really important. I was sort of zooming through things at the start, but I can speak a little bit more about different interpretive lenses and how. And how different educational, how different research analyses can provide different insights. But before I do that, I guess I'll give it a choice. Would you like me to circle back and sort of address some of those pieces or wait on that and move forward looking at an example of artistic geometry? So, I guess A. So I guess A or B. Circle back, move forward. B, B. Okay, cool. All right, thanks, guys. So I distinguish between geometric artistry and artistic geometry for a reason. The first example, really, I feel, is a piece of art. A piece of art. What I'm going to go over now, I think, is really a piece of geometry. And I'll ask you to do this really quickly. So please close your eyes and imagine a cube. Select one of the vertices of your cube, attach a string to it, and hang your cube by that string. Now imagine a horizontal plane that will slice your cube exactly in half. Make a conjecture about what the cross-section looks like. Draw the shape and explain yourself. Draw the shape and explain your thinking. You don't have to draw it, but imagine the cube suspended, that intersecting plane. What does the cross-section look like? We do this activity and I tackle it in, again, a lot of different ways. The first is exactly as I've described now. Close your eyes, imagine, draw it out. Draw it out. So the visual piece. Then we spend about a good 30 minutes constructing a cube out of origami. I'll show you a picture of the one we construct in a second, but I chose it very deliberately because it has six pieces. You have to fit all of the pieces together like a puzzle. And once you fit them, the answer actually is kind of right there in the construction of your cube. Your cube. So we build these cubes, they suspend them, they move them around, they get out their string, they measure their sides, they pretend they're ants and crawling up and along things. And eventually, they, some of them get out scissors, but eventually they get a sense of what it is, what that cross-section has to be. And once they get there, then we start unpacking it and we start looking at At how can we make sense of that? How can we see that? And then how can we connect to the algebra? And so we build this cube, like the one that's in the top left, and you can see that it has all these different colors. And there's a point where three colors intersect along the edges, and that turns out to be the midpoint when you suspend by a vertex. If you take your pencil and you just connect all of those points, you get this really nice regular hexagon. Regular hexagon, and they can see it right there. And we play around in GeoGebra. There's some animations just on YouTube. And we compare and contrast, you know, how do you hold the cube? What difference does it make? But actually making that origami goes a long way to helping make sense of what the heck is going on in the algebra. Because when you start, if you just start in the algebra, it's really challenging, even actually once you. Really challenging, even actually, once you've gone all the way through this construction, you've held up this physical cube, you've moved it around. It's still quite a leap of abstraction to get to knowing how to label your vertices, making appropriate decisions, because it's a lot of arbitrary choices. Well, does it have to be 0, 0, 0 to 1, 1, 1? We know no. But playing around with that construction goes a long way to. Goes a long way to understanding that structure, but also drawing attention to important questions to be asking us learners. I just want to, I just want, just because this is a really nice example, I just want to share the cleverest question I think a high schooler has asked me. And I was really, really moved by this question. So we were playing around with this keep slicing thing. And earlier in the week, we had been playing around with the tour that Playing around with tour that visits all the sides of the cube. Nice. And there has to be a shortest one. So a high schooler said, Well, there has to be a shortest tour that visits all the sides of the cube. And there has to be this cut that cuts the cube in half. Are those the same path? Lovely. And I was like, oh, that's such a math question. That's really lovely. Anyway, yeah, this is a beautiful construction and very, very visual and lots to play with. And I'm glad you mentioned that. Those are. I'm glad you mentioned that. Those are, it's a great story, and the points are really important. I mentioned earlier that part of my ambition as an educator is to help teachers develop a disciplinary awareness for what it is to be mathematical. And we know that that's a lot more than what they experience in school and tends to also be more than what they experience in their university mathematics courses. In Ontario, along with In Ontario, along with a lot of other parts of North America, you don't really need to do that much math to end up teaching math. In K-8 in Canada, you do not need to be a math specialist or have taken any math since grade 10. And our curricula suffers as much as just about everywhere else in the world, being a little bit, maybe more than a little bit shy about geometry. Than a little bit shy about geometry. Walter Whiteley has a lot to say about that, as I'm sure others do as well. But there's not a lot of geometry actually in our curriculum. But that doesn't mean we should keep it out of there. And geometric representations of the algebraic stuff, of the numerical stuff, of data visual, data management, these can all be really powerful for helping students understand the mathematical structure, the mathematical depth, but also for generating questions. But also for generating questions, knowing what to ask, what mathematical things the questions are. We see in research this aspect of prototypes. So we mentioned like there's some geometry prototypes. Well, there are also prototypes around what is a math question. And lots of our students and student teachers get their prototypes from their textbooks, which are, you know, offer. Are you know often exercises, or they're these like they're pizza fraction questions and that sort of thing. So, exposure to different representations that can trigger different curiosities as learners can then be really interesting things to examine as researchers for trying to make sense of the sorts of things that I mentioned that I was interested in. So, I'll use that as my excuse to circle back. Circle back. One question I have about the literature here is: Is there any literature on, like, I think BK and I have the sense that like geometry is a nice place for investigating question answering, question asking and question posing. Somehow it's more approachable or amenable to this kind of thing. And is this something that people study? That geometry is a particularly nice area for doing this kind of thing, as opposed to, say, calculus? There is some. So there's some broader research. There's some broader research around visualization in general. One out of the articles that Walter, my colleague Robin Rutenberg, oops, pardon me, Robin Rutenberg-Rosen and I worked on speaks exactly to that. I'm just going to highlight it if I can by crossing it out, but this is the one. So, so in this project, So, in this project, we looked at the max box problem. And you can see some pictures on the right, this popcorn box activity that we called it. And the approach we took was, and you know, it's an optimization problem. So typically, and in our curricula documents in this province, they tackle it by number crunching. Create a list of your different volumes. We'll add them up, and that's sort of the approach. And that's sort of the approach that's advocated. And so we did something different. Walter, over years working with teachers, developed a geometric approach that used some physical models. And we expanded on that and also geometer sketchpad. And we expanded on that to include paper folding activity and a network of learning activities that allowed us to take what's really a calculus optimization problem into grade two and three. Into a grade two and three class. And it was actually really quite exciting. The kids were, it was the most unruly grade three class I've ever set foot in. And this was a while ago. So, I mean, we published in 2015. We were probably collecting data a couple years before that. And it was just, you know, very, very different. Know very, very different. And the kids, you wouldn't guess that they were high-achieving based on anything typical. And they got really involved. We created a box by cutting out corners of paper, and they had to estimate which one they think would be the biggest. Draw what you think is the biggest. And they compared them, and they filled them, and they poured, and they estimated visually. They estimated visually. And then they came back the next day, and we had these plastic models that they played with with foam inserts that allowed them to compare the difference in volume just by looking at surface area. And we spent a good several days just playing around with these ideas with them. But in the end, when we asked, like, which of these two boxes is bigger, they were pulling out the foam and laying it on top of each other and saying, well, this one has to be bigger because. Be bigger because, and their because has made sense, and it was really eye-opening because these are complex ideas that they were physically working with and making sense of and bringing forward. We developed the task in the sense of this network, and the network was really an important part of it because part of being successful in mathematics often involves switching between representations. Often involves switching between representations. You want to make sense of the numbers and have a picture of what's going on, but you kind of need to work with both. And so Geometer, Sketchpad, and GeoGebra, they give us really nice ways of tracking both the visual stuff, the numerical stuff, and then being increasingly creative in how we can extend the exploration. So the max box can change from a square box to something with tilted sides, and then the exploration changes a lot. And then the exploration changes a lot. And so the possibilities of exploring become a lot more rich as well. The multiple representations, tracking the physical, the numerical, and the visual dynamic have been essential to each of the activities we've sort of developed, focused on bringing sort of complex concepts. Complex concepts in an accessible format to like unexpectedly young learners. Some of the other work here is more geared towards adults and undergraduates. This one here stuck on convention. We used a geometric representation of derivatives to pull out some inconsistencies, to like reveal some inconsistencies. Inconsistencies, like reveal some inconsistencies in students thinking about derivatives. And there's a benefit to these sorts of aesthetic approaches. They're not just beautiful. There's structure in the mathematical structure and what they convey that the students need access to and to work with and think about. I could say more, but I tend not to like talking, and it's a workshop, so I feel like you guys need. And it's a workshop, so I feel like you guys need to be working. But there's a couple of ways we could do that. We have about 15 minutes left. One of the slides I had at the end was just to look at kind of coming up with more focused research questions. Like, if there are things that you're thinking about researching, can we articulate those in something that would be answerable? Something that would be answerable and consider how to sort of go about structuring such a study. But why don't I stop this screen share for now and see what you're feeling the conversation, where it could go, what you're up for. We have some Jamboard, and I've put the slides. And I've put the slides on Google slides as well. So if people want access to look at things, we could do that as well, or space to post their own stuff. So I don't know if this will be too far in a tangent, but I know how to teach a full geometry course that really challenges future teachers and makes them think about how we know. Makes them think about how we know the things we think we know and what's going on there. But I'm teaching a capstone course right now, and I have 30 meetings to talk about like everything they might need to have thought about in high school. And also to make meaning of everything that happened in college, and to be the last time it's really a map content context before. Text before all the rest of their work is sort of more generally focused on teaching. And a couple of my students feel comfortable saying that they hate geometry. And so I don't, I'm sort of struggling with what to do with like three days of class that will target changing how they think about geometry. So do you have any? About geometry. So, do you have any? I work with teacher secondary teachers in this class. So, do you have any thoughts about a particularly effective task that pushes on these things you've been talking about? Yeah, absolutely. Well, the popcorn box activity that Walter and I have written about has been, I would say our most successful. It probably takes about three hours start to finish if you're going to use all of the representations. I've used it in pedagogy courses. Used it in pedagogy courses and it's a nice bridge. So often our pre-service teachers, like they're really focused on what they can do in the classroom. And when they're thinking about geometry and hating geometry, they're thinking about those prototypes sitting in their desks doing worksheets. But getting them to touch and feel stuff, anything with origami is a nice experience, but Is a nice experience, but it has to be visible as something connected to their curricular obligations, especially in those pedagogy courses. In the content courses, if you're in a math, especially I found if you're in a math department, you get a bit more buy-in. At least they kind of accept that I'm supposed to be learning math, so I guess I learn math. When you try to sneak math into the pedagogy courses, you know, it doesn't always go well. You know, it doesn't always go well, it's not what we're focused on now. Um, but uh, but the popcorn box activity has actually been really nice, especially when it comes to doing the algebraic part, because when when you set up it, when you set up the box with the right ratios, the algebra just falls right out. And we get these like aha moments. You won't be able to capture everything, right? And so, a good example that will give them ideas that's accessible and visible. So, if it's too novel, if it's too far out there, like the Yumi art, I think would just be a deal break. I don't think you'd get a lot of buy-in. Maybe in the elementary grades, it would be a lot easier because they teach everything in the same class. Everything in the same class, and so interdisciplinary connections are a lot easier to motivate. You're in the States, your high school situation I think is kind of like Canada, where you've got your math teacher teaches the math class, and that's it. And anything that sort of context outside of math is like, well, a challenge because you're balancing priorities. And interdisciplinary work is challenging, like interdisciplinary lessons are challenging to develop. But I would. To develop. But I would try anything that incorporates different ways of interacting with the ideas. So they get a tactile sense of geometry and a visual sense. So in that vein, we're digital and remote and geoja. Yeah, yeah. But you know, we really like your 3D, like your popcorn idea. If I code it, it's no longer. If I code it, it's no longer reliable, right? It sort of becomes, not only did I take care of it, but I also might have secretly forced something. Like I'm an untrustworthy source in that sense for physical experience. So origami can still be done at home on your own. We had some success yesterday. But what I would suggest is choose the origami constructions carefully. The one that I choose for the cube, I mentioned it's because it captures the answer in its representation. It also forces them to confront the symmetries of a cube. They actually have a lot of trouble constructing the cube, partly because of origami, but partly because they're not thinking about the symmetries. You've got six shapes, they're all the same. You're putting together something that's six sides that are all the same. Same, there should be some intuition there, and uh, and instead, they're used to that like T-bar six squares that fold up, and it's like, no, that broke the symmetry. Exactly. And so they'll do it. They'll try to recreate that net. They'll do it with four pieces. It's this really flimsy thing. And they'll say, look, I got it, right? Well, no, here, I'll show you why not. Really, I mean, tactile is nice to be with people. I miss. Be with people, I miss being with my students. But like this Q problem, they could make something on their own, and there's still something to be explored. Play-Doh also works well if you're thinking about cross-sections. We had a lot of success working with cross-sections in our research, and actually, a lot of the research around task design and teacher understanding and getting them past those prototypes focused on. Those prototypes focused on cross-sections. This is kind of novel for them. It connects to some interesting, complex math, but it's also something pretty everyday. We chop up vegetables all the time. Like we have a sense of, I do this a lot to describe the cross-section. And I need a new example because, but anyway, but we have these other intuitions about cross-sections, they experience them in science. They experience them in science. And so, and geometrically, they're cool. Like, we know with comics, you can chop comics up in awesome ways. So, Play-Doh, if, or gamma isn't, or any kind of clay and a piece of floss or string to cut works really well if you're decomposing shapes, 3D solids. The way that I've liked to use, the way that we've liked to use the dynamic software tends to be Dynamic software tends to be to support the physical interactions. So, and the research supports this. Early learners have a natural understanding of the 3D world and 3D geometry. And as they go through school, they get more routinized into our 2D representations. And that's what they start to expect. And that's what their teachers start to replicate. And we kind of lose sense of our 3D connections. But they don't. Connections, but they don't disappear. And actually, we have a lot of good intuitions, we live in this world. So, those physical experiences have shown up in our research as being really important for setting that stage and for helping make sense of some of those simulations. If your students are doing Scratch or can program in Python even better, but there are some nice computational tasks. Some nice computational tasks that give the geometric representations and help make that bridge. Might not be right for a geometry course, but it's pretty good for a like non-geometry course to throw in some geometry. Always looking for ways to kind of pull things in. Something I'm working on now is around infographics. And again, it's sort of coordinating these different representations of the same ideas. Representations of the same ideas, to see it from these different angles, from an educational point of view, not just to understand the math, but to communicate it, to see it in different light and all that stuff. Any other questions? Thanks, Brian. Amy, not a question, but a comment. And back to Brian's question about capstone experiences. I've done this both at the 1000 level with students that don't like math very much. Students that don't like math very much, but also with those future high school teachers to ask a question about asking them to reflect on what is geometry and how does that connect to their past experiences? Because I think they sometimes don't think big picture. A comment like I hate whatever is because you're not really thinking very deeply about that. So sometimes a reflective assignment and then having them share with each other can really help. Can really help get them thinking at a deeper level. Absolutely. Math biographies tend to be talked about. We do that in a mathematical thinking and doing course, and it's our content course for our pre-surface teachers. And it's meant to be broad and meant to be focused on ways of thinking and so on. And one of the things we do is this math biography at first. They share it with their small group. They can choose. They can choose to give me access to it or not. Most of them do. But it's getting out those feelings because a lot of them have terror, let's say. Unhappy feelings about being there. And that can go a long way. There's some nice work by Do Zaskis around, he used scripting to get at the pre-service teachers. Uh, their pre-service teachers, sort of deeper feelings about math and what might have connected to them. And so, what he asked them to do is to personify mathematics. And he did this three different times during the year and see how their stories change, how their relationship with mathematics through his course was changing. And he found that there were sort of three archetypes: the lover, the sort of distant friend, and the monster. And I don't know if your teaching evaluations are anything like mine, but I feel like the monster, the friend, and the lover are pretty much like I get a third who love the math, a third who are like, this is all right. And a third who are like, I'm still pretty scared. And just getting those out was also really comfortable in the sense that like you're trying to establish some new socio-mathematical norms, some new ways of thinking and. Of thinking and interacting with math, and whether you do collaborative work or independent work, it doesn't really matter. I think a few people talked about inquiry-based learning. I know Parker is big on that. But really, we want students to be active in thinking about things. And however we get about that, getting them to open up and feel comfortable in your space is really, really important. And letting them know that things are going to be different. This might be different. Different. This might be different than what you're used to, and that's okay. Here's what you might find challenging, and that's okay. But it's this balance. And then that's kind of with your teacher hat and with your educator or your education researcher hat. Well, if you're researching your own practice, you're looking at what, you know, how might I modify my activities and why? What other information might I want to collect from my learners to get a better sense of whether they've really understood what I've asked or if they're just regurgitating what they expect? Regurgitating what they expect I need to hear. And I'll use that to come full circle. We've got about two more minutes. I think we're good to go. Yeah, we've got two minutes till 12.50. I just shared two tweets that I very recently saw that relate to your Cube activity that people might find fun. Oh, great. Thank you. For people who are interested. Who are interested? I can share with you also a little applet that Natalie St. Clair put online for us, the max box problem that we have. So, oh, I think I send that. Sorry, privately, I'll send it again to everyone. We have a full geometer sketchpad that nobody uses anymore. That you know, nobody uses anymore, um, but like a multi-sketch investigation that takes first through this uh just dragging to tracking the numbers, mapping it onto a graph, finding tangent lines, and then extending to different shaped boxes.
