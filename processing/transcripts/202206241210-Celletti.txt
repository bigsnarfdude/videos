Thanks for the introduction and for giving me the opportunity to talk about these recent projects. These are two groups of projects, one on machine learning and the other one on computer-assisted results. The first one was done in collaboration with Catherine Gales and Victor Rodriguez Fernandez and Maximiliano Vasile, while the second one with Renato Calleja, Jean Quimeno, El Rafael, and Jean Quimeno and Rafael de la Yabe. So this is the content of my talk. That is, I will try to tell you about two aspects of using computers in a problem of rotational dynamics that I use very often in the spin orbit problem in celestial mechanics. And I will use the two different approaches, I will show you two different approaches. One is with Two different approaches. One is with deep learning, which is used to classify regular enchaotic motions, and the other one is a computer-assisted or rather proof or rather validation in a sense that I will explain later to prove KM theorem. So I know that you are all very tired after the whole week of seminars. So let me start with very simple things that is the content of my talk. is the content of my talk will be the introduction of the problem, then I will tell you something about a deep learning method and then the computer assisted KM theory. So first of all, let us see the problem that is the model, which is that of a tri-axial satellite that we assume to have principal moments of inertia, I1, I2, I3. And we assume that the central mass of this satellite The central mass of the satellite moves on a Keplerian ellipse with semi-modular axis A and eccentricity E, and with the planet in one focus. So this is a Keplerian ellipse and it is run by the central mass of the satellite, and the position is given by the polar coordinates, the radius, and the true anomaly. Then we assume that the spin axis of the satellite is perpendicular to the orbit plane and this coincides with the shortest physical axis. coincides with the shortest physical axis. So this axis here is indeed the greater axis of the ellipsoid, and which makes an angle x, which is the rotation angle, with the periapsis line. So this is the model, and then we have a bifurcation. We can have either a conservative model if we disregard the fact that the satellite could be non-rigid, if we assume that it is rigid, that then we have a conservative problem, but satellites But satellites are indeed non-rigid typically, so there is a tidal torque, and the tidal torque induces some dissipation in the system. There are very nice facts which are related to this model and precisely the spin orbit resonance, which occurs whenever the period of revolution of the satellite around the planet is commensurable with the period of rotation of the satellite around its phenax. Or the satellite around its phen axis. When this happens, that is, when there is a ratio between the periods of revolution and the period of rotation is equal to P over Q for some integers P and Q, then we have a P to Q spin orbit resonance, which means that during P revolutions around the planet, the Q revolutions around the satellite, the planet, the satellite makes P rotations. And an example is that the Moon for which these two periods are equal to 28 days, so it is in a To 28 days, so it is in a one-to-one resonance. The equations of motion: first, the equation of motion in the conservative setting. So, no tidal torque, we assume that the satellite is rigid, and then the equation of motion is given by this second-order differential equation here, where we have in the rotation angle x, so we have x double dot plus epsilon. Epsilon is a parameter which measures the equatorial flattening of the body. Equatorial flattening of the body. A over R cube, A again is the semi-major axis, sine of 2x minus 2f equal to zero. And I highlighted here the fact that r and f, due to the assumption that the satellite moves on a Keplerian orbit, are known functions of the time. This can be obtained very easily by solving Kepler's relations. But one of the most important point here is that this equation corresponds to Hamilton's equation. Corresponds to Hamilton's equations of a one-dimensional time-dependent Hamiltonian, which is given here. It is a pendulum plus epsilon times a potential which depends on x and t. And this Hamiltonian is integrable when epsilon is equal to zero, because it reduces to y squared over two. And it is integrable also when the eccentricity is zero, because you can immediately realize that r is equal to the semi-major axis, also this term simplifies and therefore corresponds. And therefore corresponds to the time, so it means that there is only one angle to x minus 2t. Now, due to the fact that R and F are known functions of the time, let us expand the potential here in Fourier Taylor series, in Fourier series in the angles 2x minus kt and with coefficients which are Taylor series in the eccentricity. And if we retain the terms up to the fourth order in. Terms up to the fourth order in the eccentricity, we obtain a Hamiltonian which is the pendulum minus epsilon times a trigonometric polynomial with six terms, one, two, three, four, five, six terms. This is very important for what I'm going to say about deep learning. And this is a Poincar√© map of this Hamiltonian for the value of epsilon corresponding to the asteroid palace and the eccentricity equals to 0.01. 0.01. So we see that we have here periodic orbit, librational tori, then we have secondary islands, chaotic motions, then we have KM tori here and other the 322 restaurants. This is the one-to-one restaurants and this is the 3-to-2 restaurants. It will be interesting to locate, for example, where there are the regions of KM Torre by means of deep learning methods. The decibel equation. The dissipative equation. The decibel equation means that we restore the assumption that there is a tidal torque due to the no-rigidity. Therefore, we replace the right-hand side with the dissipation, which depends upon the velocity x-dot and time. And whose explicit expression is given here? So it is minus eta. Eta is a parameter which disability constant, which depends upon the rigidity, the density of the satellite. A over R cube, x dot minus. A over r cube x dot minus f dot. And the fact that it is linear in the velocity will make this system conformally simpletic, according to the definition that I will give later. Now let us see some results about machine learning techniques applied to this problem. And since it is a new topic, at least for me, I would like to start with fixing some definitions, which are the fact that, well, this is well known, machine learning is an automatic. is well known machine learning is an automated process learning by examples and which can help to classify discover predict or generate new data while deep learning which is what we will use is a subset of machine learning which is typically a neural network composed by three or more layers so we will use a deep learning with five layers and precisely supervised machine learning which is a technique based on learning from a set of features From a set of features using belabeled data sets contrary to unsupervised machine learning. What are the results of machine learning in astronomy? They are given here in this nice review by Fluke and Jacobs of 2020, who make the classification of applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence into the following categories, emerging, progressing, and established. Progressing and established, and you see here that within the merging, you find from planetary studies to instrumentation, progressing to from solar system objects to Arctic, galactic, nuclei, posits, and so on, establishing our extrasolar planets, galaxies, gravitational wave astronomy. And precisely in celestial mechanics, there are already several applications. For example, this list is not exhaustive by Brin. Exhaustive by Brin and co-authors made solutions of the three-body problems. Where to get the solutions, they gained a factor 10 to the 5 or even 10 to the 8 with respect to the numerical integration. Karub and co-authors made several works on the identification of new asteroid families, and there is a review that is published in Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy next month. Buzzic and co-authors, as well as Novakovich, again on asteroid families, and finally Punjati and Toputo on small body shape information through convolutional neural networks. But the way we use deep learning is given in this paper here, published in 2022 in Scientific Reports, where the aim is to classify the types of motion through convolutional neural networks, starting from time series. Starting from time series and without knowing the underlying dynamics. So we use these methods with essentially two goals. The first one is to distinguish between chaotic, rotational, labrational motions using time series and chaos indicators. The second goal will be to use a convolutional neural network trained on one dynamic model. For example, the Hamiltonian that I was showing before with two harmonics. Showing before with two harmonics instead of six, and using just two harmonics to predict the character of the full six harmonics model. To do this, we use a convolutional neural network which is called inception time, which has five layers. And well, this applies convolution operators to create transformations so that the series becomes easier to be classified. And then we use Kelsey. And then we use chaos indicators. For example, I mentioned we use several chaos indicators, but in different ways, but let me mention here, fastly upon indicators and frequency map analysis. So according to the following steps, first we given an initial condition, we generate random time series provided by the solution at different time intervals with the fixed step size. Step size. Then, for each of these time series, we compute either the FLI or the FMA and we assign a label. So, we say that if the motion is chaotic, we assign label 0. If it is vibrational, we assign label 1. If it is rotational, we assign label 2. Then we use inception time to train on some data sets to validate and then to predict. And again, I remind you that the goals, according to that the goals according to this labeling of the of the motion are either to train the deep learning model and use use it to identify in some regions of the phase space for which we do not compute the chaos indicators whether the time series are of type 0 1 or 2 and the second goal will be to train the time series with the Hamiltonian with Fiorma series with the Hamiltonian with few harmonics and classify the motion for a potential approximated by a larger number of harmonics, which becomes very useful in celestial mechanics because one often uses a simplified model with few harmonics. So let me say that this procedure is sensitive both to the fact that the indexing method introduces, let's say, approximations and also the deep learning method that can also the deep learning method that can the reliability of the deep learning method that can introduce approximations so we need to be careful in interpreting the results but let me say in more detail how we use these caus indicators well everybody knows fast lyaponov indicators or at least lyaponov exponents and the fast lyaponov indicators are indeed lyaponov exponents at finite times so what we do is we start from some initial condition We start from some initial conditions, so we integrate up to 20,000 points the previous Hamiltonian with the Rungekuta fourth order method. Then we take a sub-sequence, a subset of this time series to train. And experimentally, we decide that if the chaos indicator is the FLI is less than three, we assign Three, we assign, we know that the motion is librational and we assign level one. If it is this is experimental, because we know we made several tests and we decide that if it is between three and three point nine, we say that the motion is rotational and assign label two. And if it is greater than 3.9, we say that the motion is chaotic and we assign label 0. So we have a way to assign the labels with FLI, and in a similar way, we can proceed with the frequency map analog. With the frequency map analysis. That is, we compute the frequency of the motion by means of this formula, which is given in the nice paper by Sander and Miss, says through the Bilkov averages. So the limit is these functions bn, which are one over the sum of this weight function here multiplied by yj, y is x dot times this weight function here. Wave functions here, then we approximate the frequency with a B capital N with n high. And we say that if omega is irrational, we have a rational, we have a labrational motion, we assign level zero. If it is irrational, we have a rotational motion and we assign label two. If there is no convergence, the motion is chaotic and we assign label zero. So in both ways, we are able to use them to assign a label. And then we use. And then we use the deep learning inception time, training the network on a model, and using it to complete the cartography in different regions of the phase space. So again, this is an example for the asteroid, same as epsilon for the asteroid palace. We take eight values of the eccentricity, we generate 10,000 orbits, and we use 70,000 for training, 10,000 for biology. For training, 10,000 for validation, and here is the result. The result on the left, this is with the FLI, so the numerical computation of the FLI in all dots, 100 times 100 dots. And here is with the machine learning, the deep learning inception time, where we use on a subset and we let the machine complete. And this is the confusion matrix. The confusion matrix tells The confusion matrix tells on the diagonal the cases where everything is fine because the machine and the FLI provide exactly the same result, chaotic, vibrational, rotational. And there are a few cases, as you can see here, see here, 7, 13, 6, or 8 to 26, which are not correct because the FLI, for example, gives in 13 cases that the motion is rotational, but the motion. Is that the motion is rotational, but the machine enterprise is chaotic. But this, as I said before, could be either due to the fact that the FLI, for example, at the border here between the chaotic region and the librational region here, might be not reliable. So, or the deep learning method is not reliable. But in any case, there are only a few cases, and we can use the fact that the information that there are KM. Mentioned that there are KM tori in this region, for example, and we can look for KM tori in this region of the phase space. The second result is indeed the fact that we train the model on pharmonics, we compute a number of time series, precisely ninety thousand time series, and then we generate test data sets for the six harmonic models. For the six harmonic models, and we evaluate the performance making five runs of this experiment. And the accuracy is given in this plot as a function of the eccentricity. So we see that for small values of the eccentricity, the two harmonic model provides already a good prediction for the six harmonics model, it's close to 98%, but this deteriorates as we increase the eccentricity. As we increase the eccentricity. Indeed, for small values of the eccentricity, the two-harmonics model provides already a good approximation of the full model. And of course, for eccentricity high, this is not the case. But nevertheless, you see that we are close to 87%. Okay, so this concludes the part on the machine learning. And now let us go to another use of the computer and precisely in KM theory. And precisely in KM theory, that Komoga Arnold-Moser theory provides results on quasi-biotic motions and invariant tori in unintegrable systems. And we know that they can give results either in Hamiltonian or distributive systems, and we will consider mainly conformally symplectic systems. Which, and you know, that they already were introduced in the talk by Rafael de la Yave a few days ago. Ago. So I will just briefly remind the main definitions because they were introduced in the previous talk. So first of all, let me say that the fact to add the dissipation to Hamiltonian system is a very singular perturbation, because in the Hamiltonian case, one can have a lot of invariant tori, and these tori do not exist in the dissipative case. There are just a few attractors. And besides, And besides, our needs to include the drift parameters. This was already very well explained, starting from the pioneer papers by Moser, Brewer, Simone, Chanciner, and so on, and that explained very well the mechanism of KN theory for non-Hamiltonian systems and the necessity to include drift parameters. With Rafael and Renato, starting with the paper published in JD in 2013. Published in JD in 2013, we concentrated on a particular aspect of this problem: that is the one of having efficient KM theory because we wanted to have realistic results and implement this theory to specific examples. And the examples that we were considering are conformally symplectic systems. I will give the definition in a moment, but before that, let me motivate. Let me motivate the motivation of the study because many problems of celestial mechanics are indeed modeled by nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems. The spin orbit problem is an example, but also the three-body problem is another example with a perturbing parameter epsilon. Or rather, or nearly Hamiltonian systems, which are dissipative systems, which are ruled by two main parameters, which are the dissipation. Which are the dissipation or the conformal factor and the drift parameter. And I use the letter E because in the spin orbit problem, the drift parameter is identified with the eccentricity. Now, what is our goal? Our goal is to use a constructive version of KM theory and provide a result which states the existence of Which states the existence of an invalid attractor with fixed frequency omega for any epsilon less or equal than a given threshold that we call epsilon km of omega. And then we want to compare this threshold to the experimental expectation. And the experimental expectation could be the astronomical value, for example, the epsilon of the moon, or rather the numerical value, which that is at the Numerical value, which that is at the breakdown threshold that can be obtained by means of numerical experiments. So we wonder whether this epsilon Km of omega can be obtained approximately very well if it is very close to the experimental threshold. For a long time, it was believed that that was not the case since the works of Michel and Non, who made an application of Arnold theorem to An application of Arnold's theorem to the three-body problem. That was one page of computations and without computers, but nevertheless, Michel and all that I had the privilege to know at meet at the observatory of Nice started these computations of KM theory to specific examples of celestial mechanics. And indeed, he was correct because nowadays we can say that. Say that using two main ingredients, we can obtain very realistic estimates. And the two ingredients are the aposterior approach and computer assist techniques. The aposterior approach was already explained by Rafael, which means that to prove the existence of invalentori, one needs to find solutions of a functional equation and one can start with an approximate solution and prove the existence of The existence of environmental closer to this approximate solution. Computer-assisted techniques. Here we need to make the discussion a little bit more precise and to say that we can use the computer to get a rigorous proof, so a computer-assisted proof, marketing green CAP, by making a rigorous control of the computer errors. For example, using Errors, for example, using interval arithmetic, or rather, as we will do later with, we did later with, and we'll show later with Renato, Joanne, and Raphael, one can make a computer-assisted validation. This is in blue, CAB. That is, we do not implement interval arithmetic, but we use a very long precision computation, for example, using MPFR. And this table here provides a summary of A summary of explicit KM estimates in some models. The first group is on the conservative standard map, and the last paper by Figuera Saroluke is the one which gives the best result, is close to 99.9% of the numerical expectation, and it is a computer-assisted proof, so with interval arithmetic. This group here are applications to celestial mechanics. Applications to celestial mechanics were in all cases, the spin orbit problem, the three-body problem, the planetary three-body problem, it was obtained results which are computer-assisted proofs. So with interval arithmetic, 100% consistent with the astronomical observation expectation. And of course, the astronomical observation is typically less than the numerical one. And the last group is an implementation. And the last group is an implementation to dissipative systems, the standard map or the spin orbit problem. And in all cases, we have 99.9%, we reach 99.9% of the numerical expectation, but with the computer-assisted validation. So, not implementing interval arithmetic. And the rest of this talk will concern a KN theory for the A KN theory for the spin orbit problem. So let me remind you what is a conformally symplectic system. We say that a map P e from a sympletic manifold to itself is conformally symplectic if it satisfies that the pullback of PE applied to capital omega, which is the sympletic form, is equal to lambda omega. Then we need to use the Diophantine condition. Need to use the Dieufantine condition, so which I remain here. So, the frequency vector omega must satisfy this inequality for some constants c and tau. And also, we want to introduce the definition of a torus, which was introduced also by Rafaeles for a map, conformally symplectic map PE, as with three Diophantine frequency. which is described parametrically by an embedding k and a drift e will satisfy this invariance equation p e composed with k of omega is equal to k of theta plus omega then we want to give explicit estimates so the first one it will will enter the statement of the theorem and then we will use the second the analytic norm and then we will use the sobore norm And then we will use the Sobolev norm to get a numerical breakdown threshold. So the first one is the supovanalytic function of the complexified torus with parameter rho, and the second one is the Sobolev normal with parameter m after the expansion of the Fourier function in Fourier series. Then we can give the theorem. We can say the theorem and let me say that the sympletic version of the theorem was Sympletic version of the theorem was already introduced by De La Riabe Gonzalez-Joba Villanueva and by Rafael in his book. And then we extended to the conformally simpletic case in this paper with Rafael and Renato. This is a simplified statement which says that if we let us assume that omega is the Euphentine, P E is a conformally symplicat map, rho is a positive parameter. positive parameter. Assume that k0 is an approximate solution which satisfies the invariance equation with an error term E0, which we assume to be small. Then assume that a suitable non-degeneracy condition is satisfied, then there exists an exact solution, let's say k star e star, which satisfies exactly the invariance equation. And besides, K star E star is close to the approximate. To the approximate solution k00 because the difference is bounded by the norm of E0. So, this is the statement of the theorem and which relies on this, whose proof relies on these ingredients that are complex extension to get Cauchy estimates and provide bounds on the derivatives on smaller and smaller domains, the Diophantine condition to control the small divisors, the non-degeneracy to The non-degeneracy to be able to solve the homological equations, which give us a sequence of approximate solutions in such a way that at each step we have error terms which are quadratically smaller than with the Nash-Moser method that we control the convergence of the method. And finally, if we can prove local uniqueness and eventually possibly we can implement computer assisted. And implement computer assist proofs or validations to get control of the rounding of errors. Now let me come to the last part, which is the Deceibity Spin Orbit Project, which is composed by three parts. The first one is published in Journal of Nonlinear Science, all of them in collaboration again with Rafael Renata and Renato and Joan. And in the first part, we make a reduction of the spin-orbit problem to a conformally symplectic Pancari map. The second part is published in Communications in all linear science and numerical simulations, and here we give explicit estimates. And the third part is an ongoing part that we are just finishing. It's a computation of the numerical breakdown threshold, and there will be also a fourth part on renormalization theory, which gives Renormalization theory, which gives very interesting results. So, first part: how do we construct the spin orbit map? Everything is given here, but let me briefly explain without entering the details of the formula. What we do here is that we construct a two-pi time map in the following way. First of all, we take an eccentric anomaly U as independent variable. Them variable. Then we replace in time so that we do not have to invert the Kepler's equation. We introduce new coordinates, beta and gamma, which replace x and y. So beta will need to satisfy a second-order differential equation, which is given here. We denote by Re the two pi-time map associated to beta and gamma. And then we denote by CE the change of variables from x, y to beta and gamma, and finally. To beta and gamma, and finally we define PE, the map PE, in this way. And using the components, we introduce the spin-orbit map that gives from x, y, constructs x-bar, y-bar. And therefore, we obtain this map here. And one can prove that this spin-orbit map is indeed conformally symplectic in the sense that p is omega is equal to lambda omega. And one can compute. Omega, and one can compute by the Rice Due theorem the conformal factor lambda as the exponential of this term here, which is eta, the C-body factor, times a function of the eccentricity. So you see that for eta equal to zero, we have the Hamiltonian case, otherwise we have a contractive or an expansive system, and this map PE must satisfy the invariance equation. Then we fix omega, for example. This is not mandatory, but we can take the golden ratio. We can take this noble number here, which is closer to one, so to the one-to-one resonance. So we can take either omega one or omega two. And then there is the next step. The next step is to have a guess on the drift. This is important if we want to have an efficient KM theory. So we and the guess. So we and the guess is given in the following way. We compute the frequency according to this formula here, and we provide a graph of the frequency, the rotation number versus the eccentricity. The zoom here is a zoom for omega 2. So we can make a zoom and see that, for example, for omega 2, a value equal to 0.250207 is. 250207 is a good approximation for the drifter, which provides the value omega 2, which was given here: 381966. Okay, so we have a way also to give a guess on the drift. And what we do is we implement the algorithm that Rafael explained in his talk that is composed by 13 steps. It is an explicit algorithm. So, again, I don't want to go. So again, I don't want to go by the detail of the formula. Just say that if we start with K and D, we can construct E, and then we construct everything, we can solve the homological equations, blah, blah, blah. And we end up with a new correction, W and sigma, which give us a new approximation, K plus M W. Approximation K plus Mwm is an auxiliary quantity E plus sigma, which provides a quadratically smaller error at the next step. We can do it several times, and this is the result of this very efficient method, which gives us the Tori. This is for omega 2, and this is the right one is for omega 1. So the golden ratio, and here we start with the pink torus, which is. The pink torus, which is for epsilon equal to 10 to the minus 4, and for a fixed value of eta, 10 to the minus 3. Then we increase epsilon, the blue one, the green one, the yellow one, and the light yellow one. So up to 1.110 to the minus 2. And then we stop because you are not able to go farther. And the same for omega 2. So we can construct the tori and then we concentrate on the last tori. On the last order, the last or the total, the last value of epsilon that we are able to construct. So, are we able to finish in three minutes? So, this is KM estimates for the conservative part. Why do I give it? Because it was my PhD thesis, so it was decades ago, but it was the first result in the conservative. Result in the conservative spin-orbit problem, where I constructed with interval arithmetics, I constructed invariant for the two values of the parameters of the moon through interval arithmetics. And being the system one-dimensional time-dependent, we had that we have a traffic of the motion of the moon between invarantori. And this is the result with much as with the deep learning method, because we know that we can use now the know that we can use now the deep learning method to try to see where we can find invalent tori then we have a result of much much recent result 2022 on the dissipative km theory the dissipative km theory again this is exactly the same statement of the theorem that I was giving before but just highlighting in red these words for parameter value small enough so what we Value small enough. So, which is the value of epsilon for which we can find the tori? Okay, so then this is given here. And with the computer-assisted validation, we can find indeed results which are extremely close to the numerical breakdown threshold. And this validation is composed by two parts. The first one is a construction of the initial approximation using the algorithm that I was given. Algorithm that I was giving showing before using multi-precision arithmetic with 50 digits, Newton tolerance of 10 to the minus 45, an estimate of the partial tail of the free expansion, and then a second program which makes a check of the KM analytical estimates to prove the convergence of the iteration. And these are the numbers, these are the drift, and these are the values of epsilon. And finally, the last slide is to... Finally, the last slide is to show what we can do with this. Are these values of epsilon close to the breakdown values? And the answer is yes, because the breakdown values are given here. And indeed, up to very few digits, they are the same. These are the values which are obtained by implementing a Sobolev's method. Sobolev's method means that we compute We compute a trigonometric approximation of the embedding up to a given order L, and we know by the KM theory that the Sobolev norm of this approximation blows up when we are close to the breakdown of the invariant attractor. So, with a little bit of experience, we can guess what is the breakdown. By the way, we are writing the paper now, and we were not able to find very good. We were not able to find very good results by implementing Green's method because it is much more difficult to implement. And now I would like to make the conclusions. The conclusions, which are, let's say, a wishing list. A wishing list, which is the need to implement deep learning to different problems of celestial mechanics and astrodynamics. There are several special issues that we are organizing with Rafael Susana and Ugolo Catelli and Daniel Angel. Ugolo Catelli and Daniel Angel Jorba on celestial mechanics and dynamical astronomy, which is our reference journal, and trying to push in different directions. One is how to use, how we can use deep learning in different problems of celestial mechanics, not only for classification, but possibly also for regression. And can we use deep learning to investigate decibelive systems? I made an application to the conservative one, but not to the decibative one. Can we have computer-assisted tools? Can we have computer-assisted tools to have application to make rigorous our results in celestial mechanics? How can we try to connect deep learning and computer-assisted proofs? So these are wishing lists that I hope we can discuss in the next meetings. And being the last talk of this workshop, I take this opportunity to thank a lot all the organizers, and I hope that all the people that are still attending. All the people that are still attending the workshop will join me to thank all the organizers for the very nice organization of the workshop. And it worked perfectly, especially because there were many young people in presence and other people connected everywhere in the world. So thank you very much. And thank you also for your attention. Okay, thank you very much for your presentation and for your nice words. Is there any questions on the audience or at home? Yes, I have a question. Yes, okay, go on. Yes, actually, I was planning to ask you that question, and then you mentioned it in. You that question, and then you mentioned it in the conclusions, right? Because you showed us. Uh, I'm talking about the first part, the deep learning part. So you showed us this method in order to choose different models and then that predict like different dynamics of a given model and so on. I was about to ask you in what way can deep learning or this kind of Can deep learning or these kinds of techniques be used to classify the observations that we see, to see what the celestial bodies are doing, and then saying something about the possibilities of following that with a model and then choosing from For classification, you mean? Yes. Okay, so first of all, I'm new in this topic, so I cannot give many answers. And there are very few papers indeed in the problems of celestial mechanics. What I can tell you is that in the paper that I was showing before, we started from a simple model, which is the Penduron-Hamiltonian, and then we implemented in the conservative case. Then we implemented in the conservative case. I'm pretty sure that it works also in the decibative case. So, which is something that we are just doing now. The works by Karub and co-authors are very nice because they made applications to asteroid families. So, you know that in the main bird dynamics, there are asteroids which group into families. See, this was since Hirayama discovered these families in the 20th century. 20th century. And they used deep learning to say whether a given asteroid is part of the family or not. So, this is very effective indeed. This is a way to make an application to celestial mechanics. And of course, but there are many applications nowadays to astral families. What we are trying to do now, together with PhD students. A PhD student Tudor Bartolome is to use machine learning deep learning methods again to classify space debris. And there we need different ingredients because we don't have many observations. So we needed to make a simulator of space debris and then we needed to make a normal form to compute the proper elements, which are quasi-integrals. Which are quasi-integrals of motions, and then try to classify them through machine learning methods. So the answer is yes, but we are really at the beginning of something that I think will have, can have a big potential. Sounds exciting. Thanks a lot for the answer. Okay, any more questions? Yes, I also have a question related to the machine learning thing. Very nice talk by the A very nice talk, by the way. I mean, is it conceivable to have a computer-assisted proof through, say, deep learning, or is it an initial guess to then implement a computer-assisted proof? Okay, this was my the last point, ballot point in my wishing list. I don't have an answer. What I can tell you is that to have To have what I could do is the following. Since we know that for the posterior approach, we need to have a good guess. And the good guess could be obtained by machine learning. And then once you have the guess from machine learning, you implement a computer assisted proof. So exactly the way you were saying. This is one way, but not only that. I must say, but here is that my wishing list is very big. Is that my wishing list is very big? Another wishing list is to help machine learning to guess, for example, to make a regression, to use it for a regression, not only for classification or guessing of the initial condition. For example, to make a regression to find the frequency of motion and to compute the frequency. Frequency, and especially, this is a very difficult subject, especially when you are in more dimensions, not in two dimensions. In two dimensions, you have a simple example like the golden ratio. But when you are in more dimensions, even three, four, five, six dimensions, then everything becomes more complicated. I have a parallel work which is with Adrian Bustamante and Christoph Lopto on more dimensional systems. Of locked down more dimensional systems, and you are facing these problems in more dimensions. And I guess that my guess is that also there are deep learning methods could be very helpful. Thank you very much. Okay, any more questions? If not, let's thank the speaker again. Thank you.
