Oh should I start? Let's wait. Give me one second. There's something on the screen that is let me see if we can do something about that. You don't see on this, so it clicks on Zoom frame, because I also don't see for what's going on is that there's like a, you cannot search area on the screen while the other participant is sharing box right on top of the Zoom presentation that doesn't show up on Zoom, but shows up. Bottom signal that shows up on the PowerPoint, like all of us to see in the room. I know, right in the middle. Also, the updates, because I thought that I thought it was just the last computer that was updating, but now I know a Zoom advantage. Yes, there's a Zoom advantage. That Zoom advantage was. advantage that Zoom advantage was present when parents started showing the circle and writing on the whiteboard. So that was when it finally popped up with this weird can't share screen model or participant is sharing thing. So we don't know why that is there or the App Store thing at the time. And so is it should we have the is it is it possible for us to have Is it possible for us to have the password to be quick seven? Oh, does it look before? Oh, I did not send it off about the depot there was no password, so it's still more secure than nothing at all. So I'll just yes. Okay. Okay, you heard it. Great. And the second link. Karen, I see the links you put in, chat. What is the second link is the. Chat, what is the clinic link? Is the other gift that didn't play? Oh, thank you, Jacob. Sorry, okay, okay. So that should be good to go now. If anyone is interested in the gifts related to character, they are put in the chat on top. So I'll hold on. And it looks like we just got an email that the group tour is on. We are cleaning the beginning tour. So even though it's the Queen's funeral day. Okay, yes. Okay, yes. Okay, Daphne, we're all set. Great. Okay. So you can hear me okay? Yes. Yes. All right. Okay, so I'll get started. So hi, everyone. My name is Daphne Klotza. I'm in Chapel Hill, and I wish I was there, though. Thank you for the invitation, and it would have been lovely to be there in person, maybe next time. So, I will talk a little bit about some of the work that my group, we have been doing in my group for the past few years. And it's going to be on swimmers at intermediate Reynolds numbers. But I'm going to get started, check that everything works, with some acknowledgments for the people of the people who have worked on this project with me. So, can you see my mouse? Hopefully, you can. Yeah. We can, yeah. So, um, Thomas was my student. Hong is my postdoc and former postdocs as well. Kimal is a student, co-advised with Laura Miller, who's also speaking, and Virginia Paceauer, who's also part of some parts of this project, Boyce Griffith. Laura, as I mentioned, Amnit, who has helped us with some of this work. More recently, Chris and Nick at Harvard, as well as some people when I was still in the UK in Nottingham. UK and Nottingham. But I would like to get started with some motivation for why I am interested in this. And of course, in the process of working on this project, I got interested in other things as well. But the initial motivation was that I was interested in what we call, in this community I'm in, we call active matter. And active matter can be represented by some of these, by these images shown here in this slide. Images shown here in this slide. So, what you will see are things like schools of fish, flocks of birds. These are very typical examples of what we call active matter or swarms, bacteria, humans, penguins, but also robots, nanoparticles, traffic, and so on. And I would just like to go through some of the characteristics of what we mean by active matter. So, we define active matter. So we define active matter as a collection of motile or self-propelled particles. The main difference with other systems that we study in statistical mechanics and physics is that the air is consumed locally. So at the particle level, again, like emphasizing the word self-propelled here. And many, many times these systems can be described by simple local interactions. Actions, yet giving rise to quite complex global behavior. What you see in this slide here is that we see this kind of behavior, we see active matter across length scales and also environments. So one of the things that the thing that I will be focusing on today is the role of fluid environment and specifically fluid environment at intermediate Reynolds numbers. Reynolds numbers. In my group, we do other things as well. So we have projects on active matter mixtures. So these would be self-propelled colloids, so simulations of self-propelled colloids and trying to write down the statistical mechanics of these mixtures of particles with different kinds of activity, as well as project on liquid-liquid phase separation in the cell. This is collaboration with biology. Collaboration with biology, and I'd be happy. Just some of the people I haven't met in this community yet, so I thought it would be good to sort of tell you a bit more. But today we're going to talk about this. So I would like to start my talk with this plot, which if you are in the field of biological fluid dynamics, you have seen before, which basically shows the speed of the organism as a function of the Reynolds number. And the Reynolds number is defined here. Reynolds number. And the Reynolds number is defined here as the speed of the organism times its size, characteristic size, divided by the viscosity of the surrounding fluid. And over here at low Reynolds numbers, we have the viscosity effects dominate. So here we have a Stokes regime and we see things like microorganisms, bacteria, cells, but also synthetically, we see nanoparticles and colloids and things like that. At the other end of the spectrum, we have End of the spectrum, we have high we're at high Reynolds numbers, so here inertial effects dominate, and we can make approximations about inviscid flow further from the object, but also we see things like birds, whales, ships, airplanes, as well as humans. But what you can see in this plot already is that there is a very large range here that where neither assumption can be made. And this is what we call the intermediate Reynolds. This is what we call the intermediate Reynolds number range, where the influence both of viscosity and inertia need to be taken into account. I call these organisms vesoscale organisms, and they're basically anything that's between roughly, obviously the velocity matters here too, but we can think that it's roughly things between half a millimeter to 50 centimeters. So these would be things like ciliates, plankton, insects, any kind of small animal, but also any. Of small animal, but also any kind of machine that one would like to make at those scales, like drones or robots. And what I would like you to notice is that you can see that this covers many orders of magnitude, and also these boundaries are not clear. So I will be focusing on, I will completely ignore the high Reynolds regime for now and just focus on mesoscale organisms. Mesoscale organisms, and also this interaction, this what happens at the boundary between low and intermediate Reynolds numbers. So, as you can see in the plot, the boundaries are not clear, but they can be very important both for biology and materials, and I will show why. This is an example of why these boundaries can be very important in biology. So, this is an ecology paper. And what they talk about in this paper, this is not my work, but what This is not my work, but what they have, what they say, what they talk about is this fact that has been known for many years since 1914 that 99% of larval fish die within the first few days after feeding. But ecologists didn't know why. And what they claim in this paper is that the reason why they die at such high rates is because of what they call hydrodynamic starvation, which basically means that they're Basically, it means that the Reynolds number is too low for this organism to break time reversibility and be able to feed. So, this is a video that they have. So, this is a little larval fish, and this is these black dots are food. And here's what happens. So, the food goes in, and then it goes out again. So, the fish can't, it's very hard for the fish to eat. So, they claim that this is why. Now, I'm not looking at feeding, but you can. Now, I'm not looking at feeding, but you can imagine that this can be important for other things. So, this kind of boundary. So, if the organism is, say, on this side of the boundary, it can eat, but if it crosses, it can't eat. If it crosses, it can. So, what happens at the boundary is an important question that I'm trying to look at. And what I mean here is this kind of transition in behavior. So, it could be feeding or it could be swimming, which is what I will be focusing on. I will be focusing on. The other question that I'm interested in is what happens for many swimmers. So, this, and here I say on either side of the boundary, what I mean is of this boundary here, and on either side, what I mean is the following. So, first of all, within this mesoscale, this intermediate Reynolds regime, we have different behavior at different numbers, different Reynolds numbers. And what I mean is that what happens at Is that what happens at intermediate Reynolds number one is not what happens at 10, is not necessarily what happens at 100 or 100. So, because this is a region where all we're saying is that we can't make any of the other two approximations, it's not a limit, everything else gets in that bucket here. And so, there's no, you know, there's no universality here. It's just we see different behavior. It just we see different behavior and we are trying to make sense of it when it comes to motility. This is part of my work. And the other thing, so I'm very interested in what happens for many swimmers in this regime, in the intermediate Reynolds regime, but also what happens when we have swarmers of microscopic swimmers, so over on this side. And the reason for that is because there is an effective length scale that one can define for a swarm versus Define for a swarm versus an individual swimmer that may possibly increase an effective Reynolds number, or maybe we need to define a different Reynolds number that would tell us that this is what we're actually looking at is a swarm. And finally, thinking of these systems in general as active inertial suspensions, thinking of them as materials. So, how are we going to? So, how are we going to answer these questions? So, what we are doing is designing different model swimmers and basically observe the behavior. And we do this computationally. And we do this as we cross the boundary, this boundary, as we add multiple swimmers, and as we try to do statistical mechanics of the suspensions, I should say that this we haven't really done, but we have made progress with the first two. So, this is what I'll be talking about. The model swimmers we're looking at are We're looking at are so far we have looked at are basically these two kinds. So, one is this reciprocal swimmer here. So, this is two spheres connected by spring that oscillate in time. And it's reciprocal because the second half of the cycle spatially looks identical to the first half of the cycle. So that means that it doesn't swim at zero Reynolds number. And this is an experimental implementation realization of Implementation realization of this that I won't talk about much, but it's just showing. And this is the self-propelled swimmer that we have in the simulations using immersive boundary. And this is a non-reciprocal swimmer. The idea here is to make it look like a brine shrimp, which I understand it does not, but it's a model. And it's non-reciprocal because the second half of the cycle is not identical. The first. I'm not going to talk about this today, but this is another example of a swimmer. Example of a swimmer. So, this is an experimental implementation of this swimmer that I'm going to focus on, the dimer, the asymmetric dimer. And I'm going to skip this. So we use the immersed boundary with adaptive mesh refinement that was developed by Boyce Griffith, and we adapted it for this system. And there are a lot of papers on this. And it works pretty well for intermediate Reynolds numbers, though, of course, it's not trivial. So, here's what we have. Y'all. So here's what we have. So, so the first, um, so here's our swimmer, okay? And we are doing this the following sort of computer experiment. So we have a Reynolds number five and Reynolds number 150. So the swimmers are identical. The only difference between the two systems is that is the viscosity of the fluid. And I'm going to play this video where you'll see the vorticity and the vorticity colors are the directions are shown here on the right. Directions are shown here on the right. And let's see what happens. So the swimmers have the same amplitude, the same frequency, same size, everything is the same. But what you see fairly quickly is that the one at Reynolds 5 is moving down with a small sphere in the front, and the other one is moving up with a large sphere on the front. So we want to understand why this is. So, we want to understand why this is the case. So, these are both considered to be in intermediate Reynolds numbers. So, we did the same, we ran the simulations for a large number of Reynolds numbers, and we found the following. So, this is the velocity of the swimmer normalized by the frequency and the radius as a function of the Reynolds number. And I'm going to start with zero. So, at zero, at Reynolds zero, we see no swimming, which is good because it shouldn't swim because it's a Because it shouldn't swim because it's a reciprocal swimmer, like I said before. I can explain this more later. But this is what we expect, and it's fine. And then as soon as we have non-zero Reynolds number in our simulation, so as low as 10 to the minus 4, we start to see the swimmer move in the direction of the small sphere. And the swimmer increases its speed and then it reaches a maximum, and then it slows. It reaches a maximum and then it slows down again until at some point around Reynolds 18, Reynolds number 18, as it slows down, it's zero, and then it starts to swim in the opposite direction. So with a large sphere on the front. So already we see very rich behavior with a very simple system just by changing the Reynolds number in this regime of intermediate Reynolds numbers. At Reynolds numbers. And we did this for a large number of other parameters, including the amplitude, the radius, the distance, this d-naught here, the equilibrium distance between the spheres about which they oscillate. And we found something very interesting, which is that we can collapse the transition from the small sphere leading regime to the large sphere leading regime if we plot it as a function of the small sphere essentially. Of the small sphere, essentially. So, this is again the velocity of the swimmer as a function of the Reynolds number, but the Reynolds number shown here is the Reynolds number essentially of the small sphere. So, this little r means small sphere. So we find that we can collapse this transition and it's around 20. This is 2D, whereas the previous results were 3D, but it's similar, you know, very closely, very similar phenomenon. Similar phenomenon. So, what does that mean? So, we find a transition from rest to motility for any Reynolds number greater than zero, and then a transition in swim direction around 20. So we were very curious about why this is happening. We see that the transition is dominated by the small sphere because if we plot things differently, this does not collapse. This transition point does not collapse. But, what is the fluid doing? The fluid doing? So, if we look at the time average vorticity, what we see is that it actually switches direction in the two different regimes. So, when we have a small sphere leading regime, so this is, again, this is the time average over a cycle. So, for Reynolds number two, so in the small sphere leading case, what we see is that there is flow pushing away perpendicular to the dimer and then pulling in in the direction of the small sphere. Pulling in in the direction of the small sphere, in the direction of the large sphere of vertically, in the direction of swimming. Whereas when we're on the other side of the transition, we see the opposite. So what we see here, it's more complicated, but what we see essentially is that the small sphere on the vertical axis, the axis of swimming, we see fluid pushing away from the small sphere and then coming in. From the small sphere and then coming in, and then the flow around the large sphere is much weaker. Um, this is quite reminiscent of pullers and pushers if you work in this area of stokes swimmers. So a zero Reynolds number, the direction of the fields can be defined, the flow field around typical swimmers can be defined as a polar and a pusher. And these look very similar, but remember that they are not at zero Reynolds number. Not at zero Reynolds number. So, why does the flow change and why does the swimmer switch directions? What we're trying to understand. So, what we, the way we understood this was that this is related to this classical phenomenon of steady streaming for an oscillating sphere. So, if you look at the if you look at the literature for a single sphere oscillating in a fluid at intermediate Reynolds numbers, there is a there There is a field itself, just for a single sphere, switches direction as the Reynolds number increases. And so our results look very similar, but now this is attached to a dimer, so it causes propulsion, but it comes together with this field switch. And why does the swimmer switch direction? It's very interesting because it's sort of like it has to. It's sort of like it has to, because the small sphere is essentially acting like a flagellum, even though the shape is the same in both cases, and the swimmer does exactly the same thing. But because of the viscosity of the fluid, in one case, it acts like it's pulling fluid in, and in the other case, it's pushing fluid away. So it acts like a flagellum in a real organism. So, what I want to talk about next in the remaining time I have is to talk about now looking at pairwise interactions and collective behavior. Because initially, my motivation was to look at active matter. This is how I started my talk. Even though I should say that the details of this single swimmer are also very interesting, and I can talk more about them. We have actually. Talk more about them. We have actually three papers now. We just got a GFM accepted for looking at the more analytical calculations of how this happens. It's really interesting. So now can we use this kind of interesting result to understand something about pairwise interactions, whether that is related to biology or having more control of synthetic systems. Synthetic systems. So, if we put two swimmers together, what we find is that we find these five stable pairs essentially, and they're all related to this flow field that we were talking about right before. So, these are new pair swimmers. What I mean by that is that when the two swimmers come together, Two swimmers come together in these three configurations, they swim together as one. So they have a net velocity as a pair. We also find this immotile pump. So these ones stay in place. They don't go anywhere. They're symmetric. And we also see these orbits, these dynamic orbits that stay in place mostly. And here's another, and here's what happens if we look. And here's what happens if we look at the velocities of the pairs now as a function of the Reynolds number. And this is a single swimmer, just for reference, is the black one, what I was showing before. So it shows the transition for a single swimmer. But now, if we look at the inline pair, we call this one. So the velocity is a little slower than the single swimmer, but it follows a very similar curve. It follows a very similar curve and then it kind of falls apart. So we couldn't track it for higher Reynolds numbers. They start to, the pair doesn't, it's not stable anymore. If we look at this V shape, this is very interesting because it follows also very closely the single swimmer, but then it actually speeds up and then it has this plateau and then it switches. So the onset, so it actually stays. So, it actually stays in the direction of the small sphere. It swims in the direction of the small sphere for much more of a range of Reynolds numbers than the individual, than the single one. So this is kind of new behavior and we're trying to understand the flow fields around these. And then it swims over here with a large sphere in the front. We also see these orbids where initially, Initially, over here in this at lower at the lower end of Reynolds numbers, they just move apart. So they don't actually orbit, stay together as an orbit. They orbit out of each other's range. And then at some point, and they do this counterclockwise, whereas, so with the small sphere on the front, whereas then there's a transition and onset to large sphere on the front. To large fear on the front. Again, different to the individual swimmer. And I'm just going to, I don't know how much time I have, I'm just going to show a few movies so that you have a sense of what these simulations look like for the pairs. So this is a V pair where they move together. This is a V pair where they move with a large sphere in the front, so a higher Reynolds numbers. Here it becomes messier as you increase the Reynolds numbers. Messier as you increase the renal thumber. So it's not super clear. And this is an immotile pump over here. And these are some of the orbits that we see. So these orbit out of each other. And then this one is moving clockwise with the small sphere on the front. These ones, oh, it's hard to tell, I guess. These ones are moving with a large sphere on the front. And finally, I just want to point out some more recent work on the collective behavior, adding a lot more particles, trying to understand the active matter of these systems and how it changes with inertia. So what we see is that when you have, when you're at the lower end of intermediate Reynolds numbers, we see these head-on interactions that are favored. And this is because of this flow field that is more like a flow. Flow field that is more like a puller along the swim direction. And so, what we see here is the collective behavior. Basically, these swimmers form like an inline stationary network, essentially. So they form this network that is kind of breathing and staying in place. And we're trying to understand this behavior a bit more as you increase the Reynolds number, what you see is side-by-side interactions. Side-by-side interactions are favored. So now you see this kind of other weird network made out of these side-by-side swimmers. And as you increase the renal number more, we see short-lived clusters of swimmers that come together and then fall apart. Again, mostly side by side, driven by this flow field that changes. Just a quick demonstration of these. These simulations take a very long time. So we're running them and then add more and more seconds to the movies. So I would like to finish off by saying that we see very rich behavior from very simple model swimmers. These non-linear hydrodynamic interactions generate different assemblies, and we're trying to understand how and the details of that. Details of that. These interactions may be relevant for biological and artificial swimmers at these intermediate Reynolds numbers. I'm convinced that these things matter. They might not be the dominant effect, but it's a very interesting control parameter to use if we want to control behavior. So we can use these nonlinear effects to design complexity into systems. And there are certainly applications in materials where these different transitions. Different transitions can give us more control of what the material is doing, this behavior. So, I will end here, just showing the publications so you guys can look them up and I'd be happy to take any questions. And I think I'm doing okay with time. Thank you, Daphne. Maybe we'll start with questions in the audience. Audience. Mari, what's going first because I have to ask a question. Kind of a general question, since I'm part of the crowd here who's interested in network structures and things like that, was that from the previous talk that we had this morning, there were these different approaches of how you can look at these structures, and sometimes the network. Structures and sometimes the network approach tells you a lot of things, and there are limitations to that. So, I was wondering for those structures of active swimmers that you get, but that you know if people have looked at it from a network's perspective or if people haven't, but if you think that that would be a promising or best promising approach, I couldn't hear the question for I'm not sure. Let me try to repeat, see if I got it right. Right. So you're asking if I can apply some of the network theory stuff to this network of swimmers? Yes. Yeah. Unfortunately, I was teaching during Karen's talk, but Karen lives down the road. So I'm definitely going to ask her about if she has any ideas because I absolutely Because I absolutely would like to get some help with these guys here. So, because I'm not, my background is not in networks. I have seen a lot of talks in general in my career.
