The University of Manitoba. Okay. So here's the general plan. We're going to use vibrations over the circle in order to construct new Anosa flows. So this is kind of people are interested in knowing many things about Anosa flows, in particular, how many Anosa flows in particular, how many different anosso flows can you construct on the same manifold? And the end result of this talk, which hopefully you can all understand by the time I'm finished, is that to construct a graph manifold that has so many anosso flows, so n different anosso flows for any natural number n. Okay, so we're gonna start with saying what we need about the geodesic flow on. We need about the geodesic flow on the modular surface, which is an anoso flow on the trephyl complement. And then we're going to lift this flow via self-coverings so the trephel complement covers itself. And that will give us many different anosoflows on the trephyl complement. And then we're going to glue these flows to each other to get anosoflows on closed graph maps. Okay, so that's the graph methods okay so that's the plan for the talk on that colour one use the poly poly just a question um modular surface what does that mean okay so i i will say i will say everything i just wanted to say like what's the general plan for the talk but uh and i'll show what's the molecular surface and feel free to stop me at any time so okay so first i want to say what's an analysis So, first, I want to say what's an anosoflow. So, kind of unformally, just using this picture. So, this an anosoflow will be a flow on a three-manifold, where for every point in the three-manifold, I have this decomposition of the tangent bundle into three transverse directions. One of them is the flow direction, the other one is the stable direction, and the other one, the third one, is called the unstable direction. Unstable direction. All of these directions are preserved by the flow. So the flow takes this decomposition to the each direction to its, I don't know, sub-bundle or whatever you call it. And the stable direction is contracted exponentially. The unstable direction is expanded exponentially by the flow. So by the differential to the flow. So in particular, So, in particular, this is for a specific metric on my three-manifold. Okay, so whenever I can find these three different directions, the flow is called an anosso flow. I want to say, you know, why do we care about anoso flows? So, first, we have a strong relation to the topology of the three-manifold. So, whenever I have an anosso flow on a three-manifold, then the three-manifold has to be irreducible. Has to be irreducible and it has to have a fundamental group that has exponential growth. So we can say certain things. Not every manifold can carry such a flow. There's a relation to contact structures, so tight contact structures, even bicontact structures, and to top foliations. And there's a relation to viewing triangulations. So I'm not an expert on any of that, but that's why. On any of that, but that's why people in topology are interested in these flows. Okay, so there are two kinds of classical examples of an ossic flows called algebraic flows. The first one is what's called a suspension of an automorphism of the two-dimensional torus. So you take this two-dimensional torus that is down here, say. Is down here, say you cross it with just an interval, and then you create this three-manifold using this monogramy, which is just a two-by-two matrix. You want the matrix to have an eigenvalue that is larger than one and an eigenvalue that is smaller than one, or between minus one and one. And then you define the flow to be just the flow going upwards. And you can. Okay, kind of smoothen things out so you have this expansion along that expanding vector eigenvector of the matrix, and you have a contraction along the other eigenvector. Okay, so this is one classical example. And then there's a geodesic flow. So for the geodesic flows, I want to first draw this hyperbolic plane. Hyperbolic plane. Okay, so here's a hyperbolic plane. I kept the simple drawings to do in live. So I take a point and a direction in the hyperbolic plane. And then you can flow along the steodesics. So there is a point on the sphere at infinity that you kind of emanated from at minus infinity time, and there is a point that you're going to. And now this. Going to. And now, this geodesic flow is going to keep these set of horror cycles in each of these points at infinity invariant. So this horicycle, if you flow along this geodesic, will just go to this, I don't know, larger horicycle. And that's also true for the other horocycle. Maybe we should change colors. Maybe we should change colors. So here's the other horocycle. And so I want to say this is the decomposition into the three directions. So for the unit tangent bundle, you have this direction that is tangent to the geodesic. And you have this, okay, this horocycle with a perpendicular direction at each point. And you have this other horocycle, again, with a perpendicular direction. Again, with the perpendicular direction to the other side. These will be transversal in the unit tangent bundle to the hyperbolic plane. And when you flow by the geodesic flow, you're expanding one horocycle and you're contracting the other horocycle. And maybe you can do this computation easily, maybe in the half-plane model using these two by two matrices of the horocyclic flow and the geodesic flow. And so it's easy to see by the geometry. And so it's easy to see by the geometry of the hyperbolic plane, okay, that you have this decomposition. And now, once you have it on the hyperbolic plane, or actually you need a unit tangent bundle to the hyperbolic plane, which is also known as PSL2R. Okay, so PSL2R is the group of isometries of this hyperbolic plane. This hyperbolic plane. The stabilizer of a point is the rotation around this point. So this means you get all possible directions around this point. So it is homeomorphic to the unit tangent button. Once you have this up there, then you can take the quotient by any discrete subgroup of isometries, and you'll get a geodesic flow that is a geodesic flow on a surface. surface that so the surface sorry the surface is just the plane mod gamma and the geodesic flow will live in the unit tangent part of that surface with it which is this this no this PSL2i mod gamma okay now there are results that tie the the geo geometry of the Geometry of the three-manifold to the anosso flows. So we know that if our manifold is a solve manifold, then the only flow, the only anosso flow that can live on this manifold is this first type of flow, the suspension. And if our manifold is a seifer fiber space, then the only possible Then the only possible and also flow on it is a geodesic flow. So for nice geometries, these are all the possibilities. So for solved manifolds, this is plant, and for geodesic flows, this is yeast and barbo. Okay. So now a three-manifold with an anosso flow, it has to be irreducible. An anoso flow, it has to be irreducible, but it can still be torolled also. So it makes sense to try and take this manifold with an anosoflow and cut it along this, the JSJ tori in the manifold. And this is a result of Bourbon and Fenney, that these tori can be isotoped to be transverse to the flow or quasi-transverse. Quasi-transverse means this, so first, transverse means you're not tangent. Transverse means you're not tangent to the flow to the torus in any in any point so you're always pointing outwards or you're always pointing inwards. Quasi-transverse means you can be tangent along a finite number of periodic orbits. And on the complement of these periodic orbits, you have these annuli where your flow is transfers to the torus. Okay, so it's the JSJ tori can be made. J Torah can be made to be very simple relative to the flow. Okay, now you can also try to do the other direction. So you can take these pieces of an osophlose, which live on three manifolds with boundaries, and kind of glue the boundaries together to get different things. Okay, and it turns out that you can Quite generally, glue things along transverse tori. So, this is not so difficult to do. This theorem, you can glue pieces of anosoflows, is actually much more general. So, you can glue things that you don't know if there are pieces of anoso flows, but they have a hyperbolic non-wandering set. So, these are called hyperbolic plugs, but we don't need this generality. But we don't need this generality. Okay, so now I want to talk about the TREFO complement, and we want to kind of get very specific, build a concrete example of an anosoflow. So here's the trephole. As you can see, it's a total S knot. And the Treffo is kind of, you can find an action of S1 on the three-sphere. On the three-sphere, for which the trephoil and all these parallel trephoils on the centaurus are orbits of, and this is this action. So this is, you know, e to the 2 pi i t, say, and you take this squared and cubed. So you take S3 to be z1, z2, where the sum of, you know, the moduli of you know the model i of z1 squared plus the model i of z2 squared is one okay and this would give you just um this this would preserve the decomposition of s3 to these um parallel you know two-dimensional tori and the decomposition of each one into trephole knots okay so it just kind of pushes it forward along each of these trephonots Of these trephones, and of course, these two-dimensional tori become just singular circles on the cores of these tori, you can say. So, all together, you have a ciphered vibration of the three-sphere that has two singular fibers. Okay, and one cusp. Okay, and one cusp when you take out the trifle. Okay, so and you can compute the ciphered invariance of these singular fibers, right? So if you take one of these cores, okay, then a regular fiber like that will go twice along this core. Yeah, am I clear? When you push these trefoils into the core of the torus, then Core of the torus, then this blue one will just you know go twice, so you don't you know, it's kind of like that. Just one quick, yes, yes, please. Tali, one more. Oh, the cores of the solid tori are our orbits in the fibration, yes, and that's that's okay, right? So, near those, it just looks a little different, okay. Thanks. So, I mean, just to remember. So, I mean, just to imagine the picture, you take these, all these two-dimensional tori, right? And so the core of the inner one and the core of the outer one will gonna be just circles. And all these two-dimensional ones, you can draw these two, three curves on them. And another way to say that, I guess, is that if you have points on the sphere where Z1, say, is zero and Z2. Say is zero, and z2 has modulus one. And then, you know, while you would go while you need this lambda to be, you know, one for me, to come back to any random point, to this point where z2 is of modulus one, you will actually come back after one-third of the circle. See what I mean? See what I mean? So it's a shorter fiber kind of the fibration. Okay. So this one's a two and the other one is a three. So these regular trefoils will go three times around the other chord because the trefoil is a two, three knot. Okay. And so we could, you know, compute the cipher invariance, but actually when you have a two, then the Have a two, then the beta has to be a one, right? Because it has to be smaller than two. For three, also, it can be a one or a two, but a two is actually minus one one three. So there is only one option for the ciphered invariant of this fibration. Okay, so now when you take out one of these regular prefols. out one of these regular treffles and of course it doesn't matter which one then you get also one cusp and then you can consider the orbit space okay so what's the orbit space so it's an orbifold it's a two-dimensional orbifold with one cohoint of order two and one coherence of order three and one cusp at infinity okay because I'm taking each fiber to a point so here I'm left with this you know So here I'm left with this, you know, half disk. Outside, I have a one-third of a disk. I'm gluing these to each other, and I'm missing one point. Okay, so this surface, this 2,3-infinity triangle surface is called the modular surface. And the modular surface is also in the half-plane, this what you get by gluing the edges of this. The edges of this fundamental domain. So you glue this to this, you glue this to that. The kind of the depth transformation group is generated by this translation by 1 and this rotation by pi around i. So z goes to minus 1 over z. Okay, so the molar surface. Okay, so the molar surface is also H2 mod, this group of matrices, PSO2Z. Okay? So if you glue this to that, then here this I becomes your point that is a con point of order 2. So the total angle you have around I is only pi because you're doing this half of the geodes. This half of the geodesic to that half of the geodesic. Okay, and these two corners are the same corner on the surface, and it's in the order 3 components. So if I stand on just any random point on the modular surface, and I ask how many different directions I have, then I have a circle. Okay, a circle. Say I have two pi. But here, when I stand in I and I do the same thing, then I have only pi, so my fiber is shorter. Okay, and on the other point, it's only two pi over three. Questions? Okay, so I'll just say again that you generate the group of isometries by this translation and this rotation. So Z goes to Z plus 1 and Z goes to minus 1 over Z. Okay. So anyway, it's a hyperbolic surface. That's the About surface. That's the, I guess, the only thing we really need to know about. Okay, and so you can ask what's the unit tangent bundle on that. Well, it's a cipher fiber space with two singular fibers, right? Because there are two fibers around these components, which are shorter than the other fibers. So that means that the complement of the Trepho-MS3 is is homeomorphic, I should say. I should say. The unit tangent bundle to the modular surface, which is exactly PSL2R mod PSO2Z. So I should say, I'm not really into these matrix groups. So if you don't like matrices, that's okay. So there is a homeomorphism. Okay, and that's a classical result due to Stalling's, I guess. Pierzen Wilner's book, one of his books. Books. Okay. So it's a hyperbolic surface, and therefore, there is an anosa flow on its unit tangent bundle, which is a geodesic flow. So we know we can build one Anosa flow on the strefoil complement. That's what we want to get from the model Earth surface. Because it is the only kind of bounded to a hyperbolic surface. I'd like to compactify so we can ask what is the boundary behavior of the flow. So I want to, okay, so I want to compactify this triffle complement, so I put in this torus, and I want to compactify the surface. So how do I compactify the surface? Well, this used to be a cusp. This used to be a cusp. So I'm missing one point at infinity. I'm missing one point at infinity. I open up this cusp to be kind of a funnel and then I cut. So open up and cut along a closed geodesic. So when you have this funnel, you have a unique closed geodesic. You cut there. So you compactify the surface, you compactify the three-manifold. Okay, and I want to say something about the behavior of this Anosso flow, this geodesic flow, on the boundary of my three-manifold. Okay, so what the boundary of the surface, it's just this closed geodesic that I cut along. Now this closed geodesic, I can look at it as a closed geodesic with the tangent going to the right or with the closed geodesic. Or with the closed geodesic with the tangent going to the left. So if I look at the torus that is above this geodesic, I see two tangent orbits to this torus. Okay, so if I look at a point, if I look at a point on the boundary, then I have a direction, a unit tangent vector pointing somewhere. So it either points. Somewhere. So it either points to the upper part where I used to have a surface, but now I don't. So this means it points out of my manifold, or it points downwards here, which means the flow is pointing into my manifold, or it points to a direction that is exactly tangent to my geodesic. Okay, so my, I'm going to say the The boundary to the trefoil complement, the boundary to my three-manifold, is just this two torus, where I have one tangent orbit, you can call it G, a second tangent orbit, which is G, with the tangent going the other direction, and between them, I have one analyst where the flow is pointing outwards. So, this is all points on the boundary with directions that are pointing, you know. That are pointing, you know, somewhere upwards between these two tangents. Okay, or I can point downwards, then I'm somewhere in this inward analysis. Okay, so if I stand at a point and I rotate along this fiber, the cipher fiber, which is I rotate along the circle of directions, then I'm tangent, then I go outwards, then I'm tangent to the other side. Tangent to the other side, then I go inwards until I come back to the same original direction that is to the right. Okay, any questions? Okay, so now I know that the kind of the behavior of the geodesic flow on this toral boundary of my Toral boundary of my space. But what I want to know still is how is this torus embedded into the three-sphere? So, I mean, here this is kind of, I can draw it on the surface, I can imagine these directions, but I want to know where is this framing in the 3-stream? So, relative to the meridian longitude framing. Framing. Okay, so for this, I need to use the other structure that I know of on the Trifle complement, which is the existence of a ciphered surface or a ciphered vibration. So here's a ciphered surface. So it's made of these, you know, two disks in one of these solid tori, okay, and three discs, which I see here as kind of twisted bands in the other. In the other solid torus. Okay. Good. Now, a regular fiber of the fibration, as you can see, this is this red thing, will intersect the ciphered fiber, this once, I should say, it's a once puncture torus, as I let you know. Okay, so this red fiber intersects this ciphered fiber. Fiber, this one's functure torus in six points. Now there are two special fibers. So there's this core of this torus, which will intersect it in two points. So this point and, I don't know, infinity. And there's the core of the other torus, which will intersect it only in three points. So I have for every fiber, it will intersect it six or two or three. Intersected six or two or three points. So now when I take this once-punctured torus and I just push every point forward along its one-dimensional ciphered fiber until I get back to my torus, so most points will just move forward to the next intersection of their fiber and will have, will be a periodic orbit of period 6 of this monogram. Of me. Just because I have six intersection points, I'm pushing each one to the next one. So, in total, I have to push six times until I come back. Now, of course, this core will be a period two point. Still, if I go six times, it comes back to itself. And the other one will be a period three-point. So, still, after six times, it comes back to itself. So, the conclusion is. So the conclusion is that this monado means periodic of order 6. Of course, we should know it's periodic because it can't be pseudonasiva. Otherwise, the trifle complement will be a hyperbolic manifold. Okay, but we know exactly what it is, so it's a very simple monogram. Okay, so this means my triffel complement, which I will now call M, is the suspension as a mapping cylinder, and I have this monadrom. Cylinder, and I have this monodromy, so I can write it like that. I quotient out by the monodromy, okay, and I get my triffel complement. Yes, and I should say the nice thing about this thing up here, so this is a once-puncture torus cross an interval, right? Well, if I would glue it to itself just with the idea. Just with the identity, then I would get the unit tangent bundle to the once-punctured torus because, as this is just a punctured surface, my unit tangent bundle is a trivial bundle. Okay, so here, when I take six copies of my full complement, so I open up, I cut open this one's puncture torus, and I'm gluing copies one over the other. If I glue six. If I glue six of these, okay, then all together I'm gluing the top to the bottom with phi to the order six, which is just the identity. So I'm getting a trivial bundle over the once functor torus. So I'm getting the unit tangent bundle to the once functor torus. And this is covering my trephoid complement with a degree six cover, obviously. Okay, and I know how this cover behaves, so I know. How this cover behaves. So I know that a longitude is covering a longitude because a longitude here is just a boundary of these siphon surfaces, right? These ones puncture tori. So of course they just cover each other. And I know that a fiber covers a fiber. So now with the once-puncture torus itself, if you take the quotient. Itself, if you take the quotient, it covers the modular surface, of course, and here you see the cover. So you take the once-punctured torus, you take this axis, which intercepts the torus at three points, and you take the rotation around pi. So you created now this kind of sphere with three cone points of order two. Okay, so each of these intersection points becomes a cone point now. becomes a cone point now because you divide it by z2. And now you insert this new axis and you rotate by 2 pi over 3. These three points now become one point and you have a new cone point which is this intersection that becomes a cone point of order 3. Why do I need this drawing? Because I want to show that the action of this This group generated by phi that I'm quotienting pi is just on the boundary, it's just a rotation. Altogether, phi is a rotation by 2 pi over 6 of the boundary. So that means I can take an orbit of the geodesic flow on the once-puncture torus, and I know it will cover six times the orbit of the geodesic flow. Of the geodesic flow on the modular surface. Okay, so this I see by this action on the boundaries. Okay, so now we're gonna make this small calculation and we know to calculate everything in this trivial bundle, the unit tangent mother to the once-puncture torus. Okay, why? Because on the once-punctured torus, we know to draw a section. Here's a once-puncture torus. us yeah i should really say oh no i should really say where the gluings are so they're like this right okay here's a once function for us so here's a section i dropped okay the gluings respect that so you take just any non-zero vector field it's a it's a section so you take all the vectors pointing upwards that's a section okay so the boundary of this section Of this section is the longitude. Okay, so the longitude is this here. You go along the boundary and you have a vector that is pointing upwards all the time. So now the longitude is an orbit, which is you go with a tangent direction, minus a fiber, which is you rotate once. This is just from this picture. You don't want to be tangent, so you're getting, you start passing. you're getting you start tangent here but when you wrote it around you're getting further and further further away from being tangent here you made half a circle and then you continue to another half circle until you come back okay so in this unit tangent bundle we have this equation orbit is equal to a longitude plus a fiber and now we we can go down using using our Using our projection, I don't know, to the unit tangent middle to the molar surface. And we know that the orbit covers six orbits downstairs. And that means that in the unit tangent middle of the molar surface, that is the treffel complement, we have this equation. So six times the orbit is a longitude plus a fiber. Okay, six times the orbit is a longitude. Of the orbit is a longitude plus the fiber. Okay, now if you recall, one fiber will intersect this, this, one spontaneous towards the ciphered surface six times, right? So this means in the meridian longitude basis, that a fiber is a longitude, okay, plus six meridians. six plus six meridians or minus six so up to sine fiber is a longitude plus six meridians okay and this means that this equation would mean that an orbit is equal to a meridian in the embedding okay that's the information that we need so we know to compute for the flow we have these two tangent orbits to the boundary torus and we know that these orbits are exactly equal Orbits are exactly equal to meridians in the trephil complement. So, when embedded into the 3-sphere. So, I should say that this calculation is originally due to Tianjis in his ICM talk. There he uses this Feierst elliptic function. So another way to say all this is to say the molar surface is the space of all lattices in the Euclidean plane. All lattices in the Euclidean plane up to rotation and scaling. And the trifle complement is the space of all lattices in the plane up to scaling. So when you lose the rotation, you don't get the molar surface, you only get the trifle confirm. Okay, now, so we have this one flow, okay? We understand the flow. Okay, we understand the flow because it's just a geodesic flow, and we now want to get take covers of the flow. So, this is very easy using what we have already done. So, we have this periodic monogramy, and that means that if I take this kind of the same thing that I had before, but now I have seven copies of my trephoid complement, and so I glue by phi to the order seven, but that's. phi to the order seven, but that's exactly equal to phi because phi to the order six is the identity. Okay, so I have a degree seven cover from the trephole to itself. Okay, so it's the cyclic cover. And I construct a similar cover for every degree that is six times. Okay, 6k times phi, which is the identity, plus 1. Okay, so for each one of these degrees, I have an orientation-preserving cover from the trephole to itself. And I can use each one of these different covers to pull back my geodesic flow and get a new anosa flow on the Trefoil complement. The trefold complement. Okay, so I mean, obviously, I get infinitely many different flows. I still will have to show that I don't get somehow the same thing in various different ways. Okay, so for that, I'm going to compute what these flows do on the boundary torus. Okay, so for the Okay, so for the original one, I know that I have two periodic orbits and they are exactly equal to meridians. Okay, and now I want to know what are the tangent orbits for a general lift of the geodesic flow. So I have this degree D covered. This is my D. I know that the longitude is covered by D times the longitude. Okay, so this is just from this. Okay, so this is just from this tower construction. So each of these punctured tori will cover a punctured torus, and I have D of these in my tower. And I also know that a ciphered fiber covers a ciphered fiber from the way I construct the thing. Okay, and I'm asking what covers a periodic orbit? So what is the pullback of a periodic orbit by this? Of a periodic orbit by this cover map. Okay, so we're going to use our little equation. So we know that six times mu, okay, mu is a meridian, which is exactly our orbit downstairs. So on this n, is equal to lambda plus h, if we choose signs correctly. Okay, so now to compute the pullback, we know that the pullback of lambda is d times lambda, and the pullback of h is And the pullback of H is H. So the homology of the pullback is just this: D times lambda plus H. Now, D is equal to 1 plus 6k. I put that in. And instead of writing H, I use again the same equation, but I move my longitude to the other side. So H is equal to 6 mu minus lambda. mu minus lambda because I'm used to seeing things in the meridian longitude basis. Okay, so this means that the pullback of six times the orbit, this is what I can easily compute, is six times a meridian plus six times k lambda. Okay, so six k times lambda, I mean we should see. So this means the pullback of one orbit is exactly of the homology. Exactly, is of the homology u plus k lambda. Okay. Okay, no objections. So you believe in that. This is the pullback of the order, of the orbit. And, okay. So these are different homologies. So because the boundary tangent orbits are different from each of these flows, then I'm going to conclude. Then I'm going to conclude that these flows are not topologically equivalent. So there is no homeomorphism from the trifo complement to itself, taking one flow to another flow out of all of these covers of the geodesic flow. Because any self-homeomorphism will know where's the meridian, where is the longitude, and where is the ciphered fiber. The ciphered fiber. So I go back to the geodesic flow, I get all these different flows, so psi d, where d is any of these numbers, and I get a new flow on the trepho component. Okay, and I know the homology of the orbits, that's why I know the flows are different. Okay, so now I have these I have this trepho complement I have these self-covers I lifted my flow so I have infiltrating in a different flow and I want to glue them to each other So what do I need the gluing back map to do? So I want to glue flows so I have to glue tangent orbits to tangent orbits right I have Right, because the gluing map has to respect the flow on the boundary. Okay, so that's one thing I have to do. I have to glue tangent orbits to tangent orbits. So mu plus k lambda will have to go to some other mu plus k prime lambda so that I can glue psi d to psi d prime where I put k prime here. Okay, this has got to happen. And the other thing that I have. And the other thing that I have to respect is that if I have an analyst where the flow is pointing outwards on one piece, then I have to glue it to an analyst where the flow is pointing inwards. So if I can match inwards to outwards, then I'm good. Okay, so now this all means. This all means that we can define this gluing map. So I take longitude to minus longitude, and I take the meridian to a meridian plus two times n for some natural number n times the longitude. Okay, so I should really put an n here. So for any n, I have this Gooing map. Gluing map. And this gluing map will take this periodic orbit of psi d, where d comes from this k, to a periodic orbit of psi another d. So as long as I have something, some positive integer here, then I'm good. So I'm a tangent orbit of something. So when I, when the So when the gluing matches things exactly, then I get a flow on the glued thing, which is a graph manifold made of two copies of this Treffo complement. And some fixed gluing map. So kind of, if we want to build lots and lots of different flows on the same graph manifold, then we want. On the same graph manifold, then we want to take this green map to match as many flows on the pieces as possible. So we want to make this n as large as possible. Okay, so for each natural n, I'm going to get n different flows on my graph manifold, on my graph manifold, which is this two copies of the Kerfo confonant y. Copies of the Kerfel component. Why? Because I'm gluing this, say for k equals 1, this would glue to something that corresponds to k equals 2n minus 1, right? And for k equals 2, this tangent orbit will glue to 2n minus 2, and so on. 3, 2n minus 3. When I get to n, to capital N, then I'm already gluing my flow to itself. And then if I go past that, then... Go past that, then okay. I'll get something that I already counted. Depending, maybe on no, not depending. So I think I get N plus one different flows on the same graph manifold. So I would like to say it looks easy. It looks easy, and for a long time we thought we could make this work for infinitely many flows, because actually, it's a very simple problem. If you could send longitude to plus longitude, for instance, then it would be enough to send meridian to meridian plus one times a longitude, or any variation on that. And you will match infinitely many flows. Unfortunately, it turns out. Unfortunately, it turns out that these gluings that can match infinitely many different flows never respect the orientation of the flow on the boundary tori. So this is quite unfortunate. So this is our final theorem that for any n there exists a graph manifold and it's a very simple graph manifold with n non-equivalent and also flows. And also flows. And okay, all these different flows are gluings of covers of the modular flow, which means the geodesic flow on the modular surface. So I want to mention that there are other results doing the same thing, so obtaining n different analysis flows on the same manifold. The first one is Begas Bonatiu, which which use it kind of they use the the transverse tori they're gluing on transverse tori to take lots of different pieces so capital n different pieces and gluing them to one manifold and bowdoin and mann solved the same problem for hyperbolic manifolds but the nice thing about this construction is that the manifolds do not be Is that the manifolds do not become much more complicated to get more and more anos of flows? So basically, they're kind of the same. They're simple graph manifolds. And this is not true on the other construction. And the other nice thing about this is that I can understand the construction. So that's a plus. And the third point is that it comes very close to something that could produce. To something that could produce infinitely many and also flows on the same manifold, but it doesn't yet do it. So you could think of other variations of this. For instance, you could also look at orientation reversing flows. So if you take, you have this phi that is periodic of period 6. If you take 6k plus 1, you have an oriented. K plus 1, you have an orientation preserving cover, but if you take 6k minus 1, you have an orientation reversing cover. So you could hope that you can somehow reverse the orientation on the boundary torus to allow for more gluings. We do not have a very good understanding of this. For now, it looks like it. For now, it looks like it doesn't solve the problem. So, to really get infinitely many, you would want to have something that doesn't come from a geodesic flow on a hyperbolic surface. We're not sure, but it's our current guess. Okay, so I'm going to end here if anybody has any questions. So, you are constructing many non-equivalent analysis of flows on some graph manifolds or some Seifert fibered manifold. So, for closed hyperbolic three manifold, are there many infinitely many different analysis of flows? Araza flows? Right, we don't know. So that's open. We don't know. We don't know for any, even not for the graph manifold or the we don't know any three manifold carrying infinitely many and also flows. So for example, if the closed high public three manifold has a like battery number greater than two. Greater than two. You know, there could, you can take a finite cover, which fiber of our circle. So there's a pseudo-anas of map gluing some surface into itself. I think that that is announced of flow, right? Right, right. But if the rank of the The rank of the H1 is greater than two. Pseudo anosol. It's a pseudo-anosa. Oh, it's not, it's not an answer. Okay. Yeah. It can be an osso. If you're a figure eight, not for instance, it's an osso. That's not a closed example. Right. So, your manifolds here, I mean, your description is great, but you're taking the same manifold and sort of doubling it, right? Or figure eight, sorry, kind of element and looking at the flows and gluing those. And so I'm like, you know, I like ciphert manifolds are my favorite class of manifolds, right? And first, the first example that comes to my mind is, is not. comes to my mind is not the treple knot complement, but I love it. I tend to think of small ciphered fibered spaces, right? They're fibered over the sphere with three exceptional fibers. So you could get one of those by taking the triple and not complement and doing a Dane filling, but would these flows, would they extend at all or not? Yeah, so for any filling you do, you can never get an ass of flow on the field. I want to say because there is no growth of the fundamental group, but I think it's even more elementary, like because you could lift maybe the flow to the three-sphere and there is no anoso flow on the three-sphere. Anyway, so for instance, on the figure A naught complement, this anoso flow coming from the monodromy survives. Monodromy survives most dense fillings, but that's not true at all for the trifole. So, any filling will kill the flow. Okay, any other questions? So, on the hour, right, we will have our The hour, right? We will have our group photo. So you're welcome to take a few minutes' break, but yes, Salt, absolutely. Go and take that comb and get ready for the perfect. Right. And then be sure to turn on your camera, right? Anyway, again, it's great to see everyone.
