So, I wanted to start by thanking the organizers for inviting me, but also thanking all the other participants and all the presentations. I've been great, and I've really enjoyed having conversations. I don't know if this is actually going to work. I'm going to talk to you a little bit about work we've been doing looking at sexual and asexual reproduction. And I want to say, like, this is the spice that we're really interested in, but everyone's done that, and now it sounds stupid, but that's what we're going to be talking about. That's what we're going to be talking about. Yes. Oh, cool. Okay, so with apologies to Mark, but Mark has left on an airplane, so we can say whatever we want. Colonial production is actually... Oh, you're still here. Clonal production is actually... It's not common, but it's widespread is what I view. So I'm really interested in what's called partial colonality, which is the existence of a form of colon reproduction and sexual reproduction in the same organism. And you guys probably wouldn't be surprised. And you guys probably wouldn't be surprised to know that tons and tons of plants reproduce vegetatively, they spread and fragment, and just that kind of way of increasing their population size can also have sexual reproduction. We also see that in marine invertebrates. So, things like corals, which structure entire ecosystems, but also anemones and lots of other marine organisms reproducing sexually via vision and also sexually. Vision and also sexually via production of gownies. You know, here's, you can't talk about asex without having a hydro showing budding, but so here's something a little bit more subtle. So that's hoabulbosa. That's a grass. And it's producing something that looks like seeds, but they're not seeds. They're bulbules and they're asexually produced dispersal forms. So it's a kind of asexual reproduction that kind of looks like sexual reproduction. So all of these different aspects of life history could really affect a population's ability to. Can really affect a population's ability to adapt, both in time and in space. And so we, you know, we have to sort of show this sort of thing. Here's a cartoon of what we think about a lot of times with some phenotype. And we might imagine that the value of that phenotype determines fitness. And I'm using fitness in an absolutely vague way, but I'll be more specific later in Carmen's 20. So here, you know, here we're sitting right at the optimum and everything's really good. But we might also imagine that there could be environmental change. That there could be environmental change, climate change, or introduction of a new predator, or moving to a new host. And now, all of a sudden, we have a new optimum theta, and that same mean phenotype is actually quite far away. We see a decrease in fitness, and that decrease in fitness, of course, leads to our friend evolutionary rescue. We've had a few people talk about evolutionary rescue already. So, we've got population size, it's a function of time, we imagine there's an environmental change that causes the absolute fitness. Causes the absolute fitness to sink less than one, and we start seeing a demographic decline. If natural selection manages to change that phenotype, we might see a recovery in evolutionary rescue, right? So this is what we think about. But when we worry about population sizes getting low because real populations experience stochasticity, and that's where extinction can go. And there's been lots of theory about sort of all of these aspects of this dynamic, of this eco-evolutionary dynamic. The question we've been asking is: How does partial colonality and those kinds of life histories affect populations' ability to track environmental change? And the motivation for this was some beautiful work done by Barfield et al. in 2011. This paper is actually made like the best paper in MNAP that year. Yeah, Mike Barfield and Bob Holt and other people. Richard Colbo-Kabots, I should mention who's gone. Yeah, I know. Yeah, we miss Richard. We miss Richard. So, phenotypic evolution with stage-structured life histories. So, we follow sort of in a classic quantitative genetic way, a multivariate phenotypic trait that has n different variants, although I'm going to warn you that I'll later only look at a single variant because it makes things easier. And that trait, we're going to break it up into two parts: an additive genetic component, and E, which includes all the non-additive genetic components, and environmental variation in that trait. We'll come back to that. In that trait. We'll come back to that. And we develop recursions both for the number of individuals in each stage of this life history and a joint probability density function for both genotype and phenotype for each stage. And so often we summarize more complicated life histories with a life history graph. And this is a stage-structured life history. It's a little different from what Amy was talking about, an age-structured life history. And the main difference is this ability to stay in the same stage because they're not defined by ages, they're defined by... They're not defined by ages, they're defined by some life history thing, so size, some other thing. And here's a cartoon of a coral, right? So you've got little sexually produced larvae, and then we've got a single polyp, and then we've got sort of binary fission, meaning something bigger. We have all kinds of transmissions. And what we do is we separate the transmissions into three different types. And then we summarize them in not a Leslie matrix, but a Lefkimitsch matrix, which is like the cousin of a Leslie matrix. And we can use it. The matrix. And we can use it to predict the number of individuals in each stage in the future. And we can, more interestingly, sort of subdivide all the transitions into these three types. The first are what I would consider to be simple transitions. So simple transitions are growth from one stage to the next, right? So those are exactly the kinds of things we see in the Leslie matrix. But we also have these self-loops where you can stay in the same stage. That's what makes this not a Leslie matrix. And then you might also have, you know, depending on the kind of You know, depending on the kind of stage you're keeping track of, if it's size, for example, you could have movement back, which is something you don't see in all of the pages generally. You also have sexual reproduction, and this is the part that reminds me a little about what Amy just said about having, you need to all go through a stage where everything kind of gets wiped and starts again. That's kind of what happens here. So, this is the sexually produced individuals. In our model, they're going to retain their genotypic phenotypic information, but everybody's got to pass through this stage. But everybody's got to pass through this stage for this, for everything we do to sort of work. So, this is sexually produced individuals, and these are fecundities. And we can also allow clonal production. It could be various things. I've drawn it here that it's a production of a single polyp, but it doesn't have to be that. We'll just sort of summarize it. All right, so we explicitly consider these three types of movements in classic demographic ways, where we have transitions, we have sexual reproduction, and we have colon reproduction. Sexual reproduction and we have clonal reproduction, and we keep track of those. I won't talk about averaging because that is actually a very subtle thing that Amy has been discussing. Okay, so let's talk about the phenotype. So here we're going to be sort of in quantitative genetics land, and we have a phenotypic trait, Z, and G is the additive genetic factor for that trait, and E is the non-additive genetic and random environmental factor. And I wanted to sort of walk through sort of what makes up E because there's a sort of amazing Because there's a sort of a major difference between sexual and asexual reproduction in diploids, and I need to specify that we are in the land of the diploids, despite Sally's great talk that sort of implies we should maybe have a look at both, but today we're going to be in the land of diploids. So, sexual reproduction and colon reproduction are very different for the transmission of genetic variation and phenotypic variation. So, in a random mating sexual diploid population, there's a lot of words there. There's a lot of words there. Mendelian segregation breaks up associations again between alleles, within a locus, recombinations breaking up all kinds of other associations across the genome. And on average, it's important on average, the only thing that's inherited is the added genetic value of the trait. That's the building block of classic quantitative genetics. We've symbolized that by alpha, and that's what gets taken up in that G that I just showed, right? But if you have clonal reproduction where you preserve. Clonal reproduction where you preserve the entire linked diploid genotype. Not only are you keeping any associations between alleles at a single locus, so all the dominance interactions that might affect the phenotype, but also any epistatic interactions and higher order interactions. So those are what we call the non-additive genetic factors. So we just lump them all together, and they are also included in what a clonal offspring could inherit, potentially. But also random environmental factors. But also, random environmental factors, it depends on what the phenotype is. And we've seen that in some situations, we have some aspects of the phenotype. We can imagine if there's a large proportion of parental tissue that's being used for some sort of fragmentation, that the phenotype would be preserved. So we define this association parameter, rho, that's an association, it's not exactly a correlation, it's just association. Between E, this. Between E, this non-additive genetic and environmental component in the clonal offspring, and what we might call E-star, and say the parent. Now, that's going to be zero for sexual offspring, because again, we're assuming random mating and diploids, and we're losing everything except the additive case. So we defined it this way. I'm terrible at Greek letters, I think that is zeta. It's a zero mean unit variance, Gaussian deviant. And basically, the thing that you see here is if rho is zero, then basically you're choosing. Then basically, you're choosing this environmental component from a random distribution that's centered at zero for the environmental variation. If rho was one, you would make an exact perfect copy of the phenotype and give it to your clonal offspring. And this is reminding me of Dan's, just candidly, Dan's discussion yesterday of Juana's work, where you were looking at sort of how faithfully you translate a phenotype and this idea of asexual reproduction being. You know, asexual reproduction being low noise compared to sexual reproduction. This is an example of that. This is one way to think about that. And again, there might be forms of asexual reproduction, like our dandelion friends, where maybe it really is very physiologically similar to producing a seed in row. It's actually very close to zero. I don't know. But you might imagine if you're using a lot of parental tissue or maybe parental tissue late in development to make your colonial offspring, that some aspects of that phenotype are going to be passed on. So the type of research. Are getting passed on. So the type of reproduction might be really important here. Okay, so math happens, and you develop recursions for the phenotypic and genotypic means. I know this looks ugly, but we were actually, the fact that it reduced to this made us really happy. This is the absolute general one, but we are making some assumptions. It's a big assumption that both genotype and phenotype are during the Gaussian. Now, we've done simulations to test that, and as long as we don't have tons and tons, like when colonial reproduction gets really high, we go. Colonel reproduction gets really high, we go away from that. But we're close enough that we're satisfied that this assumption is okay. This is just some of the definitions of the pieces in here. The only thing I wanted to say is because I'm talking about an n variant for z, row is actually a matrix of rows, but it doesn't matter. We could just have a single row. Here's the identity matrix. That could be a one if you just want to live in unit land. And the cool thing is for the recursion for phenotype, row. For phenotype, Rho partitions clonal reproduction into two types of transitions. There are types of transitions here multiplied by rho, right? And this is a little up C is the amount of clonal reproduction going on. This is depending on the mean phenotype or on the phenotypic covariance matrix. And it's like the transitions. So this is like the part of clonality that's like a simple transition. And then there are parts of clonality multiplied basically by one minus rho. Basic by one minus rho, that are like sexual reproduction because they have to do with the mean genotype and the additive genetic covariance. So, rho's having this job of sort of partitioning things. And then, I guess we could also think about the recursion for genotype. This is just all the different stages, the genotypes of all the stages that contribute to this genotype, and then this is where selection is acting. That's a gradient. Okay, so we won't worry about that too much. So, this is cool, and I would So, this is cool, and I would even venture to say, kind of spicy. But now we're going to take out almost all the spice so we can do an analytical approximation. So, let's do, so vanilla, but we love vanilla, but still somewhat vanilla right now. Here's the simplest life history that has both colonial and sexual reproduction. A single stage block, it does both. Here's the fitness aspect of it, because here we have selection, it's on survival. And it's a simple sort of Gaussian survival where the further. Where the further your mean phenotype is from the optimum, the lower your probability of survival. We're going to track for the rest of the talk the amount of clonal reproduction as R sub C, which is the relative amount or the proportion of reproduction that's clonal versus total. And you get these fairly simple equations for the change in phenotype and genotype. And we're going to just look at them numerically for a sec. So here's again that lack history. And I'm just going to make a comparison, this is a figure from our own 2017 paper. From our own 2017 paper, of no clonality versus some clonality. You know, row sub C times, sorry, R sub C times row 0.5. On the top is the mean genotype and phenotype. On the bottom is the population size. Here's generations. And what we're doing here is we're starting the population with a phenotype of zero. And the optimum theta is three. So they're far away. And this is deterministic. And Charles Darwin was correct because natural selection does indeed work. And so, of course, everybody goes to three. It doesn't matter if you're doing sexual reproduction. Doesn't matter if you're doing sexual reproduction or clonal, you get there. Clonal reproduction, here's no clonality, pure and sexual. Does that? Here's the genotype in solid and the phenotype dash. You notice that with clonal reproduction, the two things spread, right? They spread out a bit. They eventually join up. The approach to equilibrium is slower. So clonality is slowing the evolution towards the optimum. But because the organisms are passing on part. The organisms are passing on part of their phenotype, they're also getting hammered less by selection. So, selection is weaker doing this, but it's also weaker doing hammering the population size. So, initially, a large number, and they're really far away from the optimum in the population size of planets, and then it recovers as evolution happens. Clonality is the stash line. It goes down not as far and recovers more quickly. So, clonality is providing a demographic advantage, even though this is a transient advantage. Transient advantage. This is a disadvantage for the equilibrium, right? But of course, this is deterministic. Nobody's going extinct. It doesn't matter how low you get. But in real life, right, I don't even know what that number is. It's very small. You could easily go extinct and add any of these numbers. So the question is, you know, what happens when we add stochasticity? So to do that, oh, so this is just summarizing. So to do that, we looked at individual-based simulations, four-time simulations, following sort of classic. Following sort of classic evolutionary biology simulation stuff from Burger and Lynch and Holt it all. And there's a lot of details here. It's a single polygenic trade with 10 loci. We've tried with more loci. Once you've got 10, you're fine. The details are in the 2017 paper. But what I want to point out is we're going to follow two different kinds of changes in the optimum phenotype. One that's a single step change, boom, and another one where the optimum phenotype keeps changing and changing and changing. Okay, so that's, and we're going to contrast those two things. So that's, and we're going to contrast those two things. So, first, the results for the one-step change. To orient you, it's the probability of persistence. This is the number of simulation runs out of a proportion of simulation runs, I think, out of 400, that don't go extinct. And here's the difference in, here's the size of the step, the single step change, delta theta. Obviously, if delta theta is really small, everybody survives all the time. If it's really big, everybody goes extinct all the time. And the question is, what happens as you vary either? What happens as you vary either the proportion of colonial reproduction, R sub C, or that association parameter, rho, here from 0 to 1? And the arrows are just to help me orient. This is the arrow of increasing R sub C and increasing rho. What you see is as you increase either of these, you increase population persistence. So this is just recapitulating what we saw analytically, showing that in the stochastic case, we see the same thing. So that's cool. So, and that kind of So, and that kind of makes sense to us, right? A single-step change is basically depending on standing variation. If a population has enough standing variation, that demographic advantage is going to get them over that dip of initially being really, really poorly adapted. So the cool thing, though, is that when we look at continuous change, we see the complete opposite. Also, probably not surprising. So, here's this a little more complicated. Here's the probability of persistence, this is the rate of change. Persistence, this is the rate of change of the optimum. And down here, there was a reason why I put this here for a different talk, but this is the amount of evolutionary lag, the difference between the current, the mean, and the optimum. So negative numbers is more and more and more lag. And now the arrows still give the direction of increase for either R sub C or rho, and you see probability persistence going down, lag getting worse and worse. Things get worse and worse with more clone out there. So it's bad. So we see D. It's bad. So we see decreased persistence, greater evolutionary lag with more clonal infection or a higher association. And this also should make sense just sort of intuitively: is when you continue to change that optimum continuously, what you're doing is you're depending on, eventually, on de novo variation. And in these simulations, obviously the clonal reproduction has much fewer, much fewer, much less clonal variation because of the lack of recombination, also the way mutation works in them, and because of the phenotypic matching. Because of the phenotypic matching with higher rho, you're getting less random environmental noise in the phenotype, which here you might want. Okay, so if we ask the question, what's going to happen to these various partially clonal organisms under rapid environmental change, I think our model gives us some intuition about the importance of two things. The scale of change. Does the population experience that change as a single sharp transition or not? Single sharp transitions could be like the jump to a new host. Be like the jump to a new host or something like that, right? That depends on things like the generation time and the timing things. The other, I think, big takeaway is the amount of phenotypic matching between organisms and their clonal offspring. How faithful is that? That depends on things like the kind of clonal reproduction. Is it something that develops goes through a single cell, develops a parthenogenic, is it fission, which includes like a lot of parental tissue? Like a lot of parental tissue. So that's important. But the other thing is, and I didn't really talk about this at all, is the genetic underpinning of the trait itself, right? So that could be a very important part of this. So I've got a little bit of time left, and I'm going to quickly talk about some extensions we did recently that just came out late last year in a paper looking at spatial structure in the same sort of situation. So if we imagine, again, a partially clonal organism living somewhere, there are parts of where it lives, let's say this dark circle. Let's say this dark circle. I love it. This is so good. You know, it's like this is land, maybe it's a hill. And in here, the mean phenotype is close to the optimum for that place, and they're very well adapted. Oh, that's great. But if that same mean phenotype travels out here, this is this arrow got a little shortened. If they're out here and there's a different optimum, they're way off. And so we see a spatial pattern of maladaptation that's just basically analogous to. That's just basically analogous to a temporal pattern of maladaptation that we see in evolutionary rescue. This has been modeled lots of times. The reason that I got interested in this is there's this interesting association between invasive species and clonal reproduction and clonal spread. Here's two examples. This is Bressilaria, which is an invasive seaweed, which I think the genus name changed recently, but it is like all over South America. All over South America, for example. It's a serious invasive. This looks like a meadow or something, it's really pretty. That's a body of water. That's Salvinia molesta, which is, the name is sort of indicative, it's an invasive clonal, I think it's, it's not a plant. It's a, well, I think it's, it's an, it's like an algae. I can't remember the kind of organ. It's obviously a kind of plant. Anyway, it's, that could be a single clump. I mean, when it gets into a body of water, it just. I mean, when it gets into a body of water, it just spreads. So, we were interested in this idea from that. Now, we're going to do a really simple 2D model. I'm going to go through it real quick. And we're just, the order of events is migration of juveniles. Here's the selection piece in survival to adulthood. It's the same kind of selection as before. Distance from the optimum. And then after that, we have reproduction. So that's the order. And we're following the same sort of notation as before. Before, and again, we can do a transition matrix. It's important here to note that we're no longer having stages, but now the different nodes of our transitions are actually places, the deeds. And we can do the recursions for mean, phenotype, and genotype using that same, a version of that same machinery that we developed before. But I just want to give you some, again, analytical results and a little bit of simulation results. So here's the very symmetric case: the two dems. The very symmetric case. The two dems migrate at equal rates to each other, and both clonal and sexual offspring migrate at the same rates. We've broken symmetry in some other examples, but I'm only showing this here. Here's final population size, and here's mean genotype and phenotype normalized to the maximum. And these are the numbers in Deem 2. So, Deem 2 is the maladaptive or the syncede, or becomes the synceem. It hasn't. Becomes a sync deem, it has an optimum of whatever delta theta gives, and deem one has an optimum of zero. And so we start off well adapted to that central place, and we start migrating into the sink. What happens? Well, up to a certain point, you're fine if it's not that different. And then there's sort of a critical value of theta where they're so different that the population crashes and it can't adapt. And what we're seeing here is that as we increase that clonality, it's able to deal with larger and larger. Deal with larger and larger differences between the two of them. It's that same demographic advantage again happening, but in space rather than time. Genotype and phenotype is a little messy, but remember before we saw that phenotype and genotype separate under this model, right, when we have clonality? That's what's happening here. A black line is sex. So this is where, you know, it adapts as well as it can. It sort of stops. And then as we increase clonality, we get better adaptation. We get better adaptation, at least by the phenotype, to the optimum. So, we wanted to look at the stochastic version of this. We did the same sort of individual-based model, four-time simulations on the two deans. This is probability of persistence again with the difference and now in theta in space. And as you increase clomar reproduction and the association parameter up to a point, you get better and better persistence. You see, the lines are getting closer and closer, though. Are getting closer and closer, though. Once you go to completely clonal, when you lose all sex, you sink back down. People have seen that in lots of different models where you need a little bit of sexual reproduction, because if you don't have any sexual reproduction, you start to get into issues. There's a nice paper that's with your simulation paper by Basin et al. that appeared in biological invasions that finds basically the same result. Their models are a little different than ours. And it's funny because, well, not funny. I mean, they find the flip between point. They find the flip between 0.99 and 1. So, I mean, it's really like right there. Okay. So, let's just sort of summarize real quick. So, greater amounts of clonality under this spatial adaptation also permit adaptations to greater differences in spatial optima. So, and also then when we looked at the simulations and included stochasticity of random stochasticity, genetic stochasticity with mutation. Genetics, stochasticity with mutations and stuff. Increased clonal reproduction and increased phenotypic association increase the probability of adaptation as long as it's not completely clonal, as long as it has a small amount of sexual reproduction. And this paralleled basically the findings for the abrupt time shift in the optimum phenotype that we saw. So in this time, here we're caught in space. And I think this is a possible additional explanation for why many partially Explanation for why many partially clonal organisms are so good in invading new habitats. It's obviously complementing traditional explanations about avoiding the LEFX and reproductive assurance and all those things. And the time is fine because I can do my acknowledgements. This is work done with Bob Holt in my Garfield. And Carlos Fernandez was an undergraduate, a math undergraduate at the University of Kansas and our funding sources. Thank you very much. I'm going to do one question. One question. What do you think would happen if you looked at all of these circles that you drew for the spatial structure of the parameters and not just jumped from the top to the bottom? Because I'm guessing it would be the analog of the gradual changing environment here. So, we have actually just started our project. So, Bob Holt has a grad student and we're meeting Wednesday. We've been working on this. Wednesday, and we've been working on it. So, I think the obvious thing is to do continuous change, and that's what we're working on next. And I predict that we will see the analog of what we saw in time. So, thank you. That's a great question.
