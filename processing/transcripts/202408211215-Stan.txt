Stan is going to talk about the quantum operators of Maxner random variables. Thank you, Professor Stan. Thank you very much. I would like to thank the organizers, and I would like to apologize for not being able to give this talk in person in Oaxaca. This is a joint work with Professors Obata and Yoshida. And okay, so let me see how. Okay, so let me see how I go to them. Okay, and the outline of the talk is the following. So, first, we'll present the ground about the quantum operators and the number operator. Then, we'll speak about representing linear operators in terms of the multiplication operator by x and the differentiation operator d. And then, the main topic of this talk is to show the position to the composition of the quantum operators for the Meissner random variables. Meissner random variables. And in the end, we'll describe very briefly the random variables whose annihilation operator is a linear combination of translation operators. Okay, so this is the background. So we start, I present the background in the multi-dimensional case, but I will, my talk, my results will be only in the first, in the one-dimensional case. So we start with a finite family of real-valued random variables. Of real-valued random variables x1, x2, xd, defined on this probability space omega fp. And we assume that these random variables have finite moments of all order, which means that for all p greater than zero and for all i between one and d, the expectation of the absolute value of xi to the power p is finite. Then, for all non-negative integers n, we consider the space fn of all random variables. Of all random variables that can be written as polynomials in these random variables x2, x1, x2, xd, where p is a polynomial with complex coefficients of total degree less than or equal to n. Now, this each space f n is a vector space, and if we increase the number n, then the space f n is increasing. So we have f0, which is the So you have F0, which is the space of polynomials of degree zero, constant polynomials, can be identified with a complex field. We call it the vacuum space. Nev0 is contained in F1, containing F2, and so on. And because we made assumptions that these random variables have finite moments of all order, all the spaces Fn are contained in the space L2 of omega and P. Moreover, because we are considering Because we are considering only finitely many random variables, x1, x2, xd. Each space fn is a finite-dimensional subspace of L2, and being a finite-dimensional subspace, it is a closed subspace of L2. So we can orthogonalize these spaces and define g0 to be F0. And for all n greater than or equal to 1, we define Gn as the orthogonal complement of Fn minus 1. orthogonal complement of Fn minus 1 into Fn, which is denoted by this circle minus. Now the space Gn is called the N's homogeneous chaos space generated by the random variables X1, X2, XD. And every polynomial, every random variable from Gn is called a homogeneous polynomial random variable of degree n. Now we identify each random variable Xi with the multiplication. xi with the multiplication operator that maps a polynomial in x1, x2, xd into the polynomial xi times p of x1, x2, xd. So the domain of these multiplications operators by xi is considered to be the space f of all random variables that are polynomials in x1, x2, xd. So viewing xi as a multiplication operator, we have this lemma due to This lemma due to Professors Accardi and Nanny in 2002, which says that if we apply this multiplication operator by Xi to the end homogeneous K of space Gn, then this is orthogonal to all the homogeneous spaces GK, except three of them, eventually three of them, namely Gn minus one, Gn, and Gn plus one. Now, for all non-negative integers n, we define the orthogonal projection Pn with bar of L2 of omega n P onto its closed actually finite dimensional subspace Gn. And we denote by Pn without the bar, the restriction of this orthogonal projection to the space F, where F is the union of all the spaces Fn, where if F is the space of all random variables that are. Is the space of all random variables that are polynomials in x1, x2, xd. And we denote also by i the identity of the space f. Now for each i between 1 and d, we can write the multiplication operator by xi as in the following way. We can compose with the identity of f to the left and with the identity of f to the right. And then we replace the identity by the summation of all the projections Pm in the left and in the right. Projections Pm in the left and in the right by also by summation of all the projections Pn. And if we distribute from both left and right, then we obtain that Xi is the double sum indexed after M and N of operators of the following form, Pm composed with Xi composed with Tm. Now, because of the lemma of Accardian nanny, we can see that this in this double sum, whenever the absolute value of m minus Whenever the absolute value of m minus n is greater than or equal to 2, this composition p m x i p n is equal to 0. So the only terms that survive in this double sum are those for which the absolute value of m minus n is less than or equal to 1. That means if we fix n, m has only three choices. n can be n plus 1, n, or n minus 1. And we separate these three cases in the next slide. So we have xi. The next slide, so we have xi. Here is the sum of the operators when m is equal to m plus one. Here is the case when the sum of the operators in which m is equal to n. And here is the sum of the operators in which m is n minus 1. And we give a name to each of these three operators, three sum operators. We define a plus i to be the summation of p m plus 1 x i pn, the first one here. xip n, the first one here, a0i to be the summation of p n xip n, and a minus i to be the last one, summation of p n minus 1 x i p n. Now, because you see the first operator that applies here is p n, and the last one is p n plus 1, we can see that if we apply a plus i to any homogeneous k space g n, then the result will be containing g n plus 1. So, in other words, containing g n plus 1. So in other words, A plus I maps a homogenous polynomial random variable of degree n into a homogenous polynomial random variable of degree n plus 1. So because it increases the degree, a plus i is called a creation operator. On the other hand, A0 i maps g n into g n, so it doesn't change the degree of a homogeneous polynomial random variable. So we call it a preservation operator. And A minus I is mapping Gn into G n. Is mapping g n into g n minus one, so it decreases the degree of a homogeneous polynomial random variable by one unit, so it is called an annihilation operator. Together, these families of operators a plus i, a0 i, and a minus i, indexed after all i between 1 and d, are called the joint quantum operators generated by g by x1, x2, xd. And then this identity that we have here becomes the Becomes the quantum decomposition of the so the multiplication operator by xi can be written as a sum of the creation of index i plus preservation of index i plus annihilation of index i. And again, the domain of all the operators involved in equation nine is considered to be the space f of all random variables that are polynomials in x1, x2, xd. There are some nice duality among this. There are some nice duality among these operators. It's a weak form of duality because equations 10 and 11 are not true for all f and g in L2. Maybe they are not even in the domain of the operators, but are true for sure for f and g polynomials in x1, x2, xd. So for all f and g that are polynomials in x1, x2, xd, we have the inner product a plus i f with g is the inner product of f with a minus i g. And we say that a plus i is Said that A plus I is the polynomial dual or the polynomial adjoint of the annihilation operator A minus I. On the other hand, A0IF inner product to G is the same as F inner product with A0IG. So we say that A0I is polynomially self-dual. Okay, now we can split the preservation operator into two halves and attach one half to the creation operator and the other half to the Operator and the other half to the annihilation operator, and we obtain this what we call the semi-quantum operators, which are defined as ui equals a minus i. This is the semi-annihilation operator is a minus i plus one half a0 i, and vi is a plus i plus one half a0i. In this way, this decomposition, quantum decomposition becomes the semi-quantum decomposition, which is xi as a multiplication operator is u. As a multiplication operator, is ui plus vi. And we still have, because a plus i is the polynomial dual of a minus i and a0i is the dual of itself, we still have that the semi-creation operator vi is the polynomial dual of the semi-annihilation operator ui. And finally, we define the number operator, which is again defined on the space f of all polynomials in x1, x2, x3 into itself. Into itself. It's a linear operator such that when we restrict it to each homogenous K of space GN, it becomes n times the identity of that space. That means every homogeneous polynomial random variable is an eigenvector for the number operator corresponding to the eigenvalue n, which is its degree. So, in other words, the number operator is keeping track of the degree of a homomorphic. track of the degree of a homogeneous polynomial random variable and probably that could be a reason a good reason why we call it the number operator if we want to express it in terms of the projections that were presented before we write it like this n equals summation of n pn okay and we have some universal commutator rules if we have for any i between one and d the commutator Between 1 and D, the commutator between the number operator in the creation operator A plus I is A plus I. Now, if we apply the, take the polynomial dual in both sides of equation 18, we see that the commutator between A minus I and the number operator is A minus I. Equation 20 tells us that the number operator commutes with all the preservation operators. And finally, replacing xi here by A plus I plus A minus I plus A0i and using this. plus a0 i and using these formulas 18 19 and 20 we can see that the commutator between n and xi is the difference of the creation a plus i minus a minus i we can add one half a zero i and subtract one half n zero i and we can rewrite this as the difference of the semi-creation and semi-annihilation operator vi minus ui and if we replace vi by x minus ui because ui plus vi is xi then we obtain that Xi, then we obtain that the commutator between n and xi is xi minus 2 ui and this will be this the last equation here will be used later. Okay, so now if we have if d equals one, if we have one that means we have only one random variable, then there is no need to carry the index i. We have one multiplication by x, and we have one creation, a plus one. A plus, one preservation A0, and one annihilation A minus. In this case, Fn is the space of polynomials in X of degree almost 10. And algebraically, this Fn is equal to Fn minus 1 plus C Xn. So that means the co-dimension of algebraic co-dimension of Fn minus 1 in Fn is 1, which means the dimension of the orthogonal complement. The dimension of the orthogonal complement g n of n minus 1 into fn is at most one. And if this g n is not the null space, then it has dimension one. So therefore, there exists and is unique a polynomial fn of x, which has the leading coefficient one in g n, and we call this polynomial the n's monic orthogonal polynomial. Then it is well known that And it is well known that these monocortogonal polynomials satisfy the three-term request relation, x times fn of x is fn plus one of x plus alpha n fn of x plus omega n fn minus one of x. So x fn of x is a linear combination of the three orthogonal polynomials fn plus one, fn and fn minus one, because the coefficient of x to the power n plus one in the left is one, and f n, f n, f n minus one do not contain. f n f n minus one do not contain the term x to the m plus one the coefficient and of fn plus one of x to the n plus one in the right must be one but fn plus one is already monic so this the coefficient here of fn plus one is one here so it's one times fn plus one of x and the other coefficients we do not know and we call alpha n and omega n they are called the zego-acobe or the zegio parameters Or yakovize parameters of x. Now, if we compare these three terms equation 23 and 22, we can see that the creation operator A plus applied to the n's monikortogonal polynomial Fn must be Fn plus 1 of X. The preservation A0 applied to Fn must be alpha n Fn of X. And the annihilation applied to Fn is omega n Fn minus 1 of X. And it is not hard to see that the square of the L2 norm. See that the square of the L2 norm of fn is the product of the omegas, omega 1, omega 2, omega n. And from this relation, inductively, we can see that no omega n can be negative. Okay. Now we have this decomposition that we are interested in. So let me explain to you. So if we fix an integer k. If we fix an integer k and we consider a linear operator from the so this result is true also in the multi-dimensional case, but we focus on only the one-dimensional case. So right now we have only one random variable x. So t is the space, a linear operator defined on the space of all polynomials in x into itself, such that t maps the space of polynomials of degree at most 10 into the space of polynomials of degree at most 10 plus k. Polynomials of degree almost n plus k. Then, if we have such a linear operator, then there exists and is unique a sequence of polynomials n of x, which we identify with the multiplication operators that they generate, such that for all non-negative integers, n, a n has degree at most n plus k, and t can be written as summation of a n of x. of n of x d to the power n, where this is the classic differentiation operator that maps x n into n x n to the n minus 1. Now, there is no problem with the convergence of this series in equation 26 because this identity, okay, the domain of the operators involved in equation 26 is the space of all polynomials in x. Once we differentiate an operate a polynomial more More than its degree. So, if we apply the differentiation to a power that is higher than the degree of the polynomial, then the result will be zero. So, for each polynomial in the series in the right applied to f, after a while, we are adding just zero terms. And in this equation, always the multiplication by n of x are placed to the left of the differentiation operator. And because we think of x as like the position operator, As like the position operator and D as the momentum operator, we call such a decomposition the position momentum decomposition of t and okay so the purpose of this talk is to understand this decomposition for the Meissner random variables and again these coefficients are unique so the Meissner random variables were introduced in 1934 by Meissner and there have been many Meissner, and there have been many papers written by many mathematicians about them. So, the Meissner random variable is a random variable that has finite moments of all orders, and the Z-Guacobi parameters alpha n are linear in n, so they are of the form alpha n plus alpha zero, while the omega n are quadratic in n without a constant term, so they are of the form beta n squared plus t minus beta n. Here, alpha zero, alpha, beta, and t are. Alpha 0, alpha, beta, and t are real numbers such that, remember that no omega n is allowed to be negative. So either beta is greater than or equal to 0 and t is greater than or equal to 0, or there is also a possibility when beta is negative, then you see this formula cannot hold for all n because the quadratic term will dominate the linear term after a while. So omega n will become negative. We don't want this to happen. So at a certain moment, if beta is negative, we want omega. If beta is negative, we want omega n to become zero. And for this reason, if beta is less than zero, t has to be a negative integer of beta. There are six types of Meisner-Random variables. So up to rescaling and translation, they reduce to the Gaussian Poisson, one of these Gaussian Poisson, Pascal or negative binomial random variables. Random variables, gamma distributed random variables, two parameter hyperbolic seeker random variables, and when beta is less than zero, okay, after rescaling the translation, they become the binomial random variables. Now, in terms of the commutator from these formulas, let me also check my time. Yeah, in terms of the commutators, we can see that the commutator between the semi-annihilation operator Between the semi-annihilation operator and x, if x is a Meichner random variable, that's a linear combination of the multiplication by x, the number operator, and the identity. And the coefficients are alpha over 2. The coefficient of n is 4 beta minus alpha squared over 2, and the coefficient of identity is 2t minus alpha alpha 0 over 2. Where again, alpha, alpha 0, beta, and t are from this form of the Zegua Aquabi parameters. Zegu Aquabi parameters. Now we can denote the opposite of the numerator here, alpha squared minus 4 beta by delta, capital delta, and we can call this the discriminant or the Meissner random variable. And we denote the coefficient here of i, the numerator, tau 2t minus alpha alpha 0. We also introduce a little delta, which is a complex radical of delta, capital delta. Delta, capital Delta. So it is possible that the discriminant capital Delta is negative, then in that case, little delta is a complex number, is a purely imaginary complex number. So then with this notation, we have that the commutator between u and x is alpha over 2x minus capital delta over 2n plus tau over 2 times identity. And there are two cases. The first case is when this delta This delta, capital delta, or little delta, is equal to zero. So if this is zero, the number operator disappears from the commutator. And then the commutator between u and x is a very simple linear combination between the multiplication between x and i. Well, we call such random variables one Meichno random variable, why? Because they are described by one commutator. Okay, and the one Max Norando variable. And the one maximum random variable reduce are reducing after shifting a translation to a Gaussian or to a gamma distributed random variable. If the discriminant is not zero, okay, so if delta is not zero, then we commute both sides of equation 31 one more times with x. Okay, so when you commute one more times, you see the commutator between x and x is zero. And x is zero, between identity and x is zero, so it remains minus delta over two nx. But remember that the commutator between the number operator and x is x minus two u n. So we call such random variables two Mexican random variables, why? Because they are described by a double commutator, a sequence of iterated or nested commutator ux axis minus delta over 2x minus 2u. And we are going to, so we would like to find the position momentum, the composition of the Meissner class, but of the quantum operator of the Meiner class. But before we go there, the first step will be to find the position momentum, the composition of the semi-quantum before we find the quantum one. So let the position moment to the composition of the semi-annihilation u be summation of n of xd to the power n. We know that, so we want to discover these coefficients. So we want to discover these coefficients. The first case, when the discriminant is zero, remember that we have the commutator between u and x is alpha 2x plus tau over 2i, but we can replace u here by the summation of n x d to the power n, and then we commute with x. Now, here, when you do the compute this commutator, we use Leibniz commutator rule, which says that when you mute the composition of operators with another operator, you have to commute one operator at a time on the To commute one operator at a time on the position on which it is, of course, the multiplication by n of x and x they commute, this commutator is zero, and then the commutator between d to the power n and x is not hard to see that this is n times d to the n minus one. So no, equation 35 gives us two position moment to decomposition for ux, for the commutator ux. In the left, we have just, we can write this alpha over 2x plus tau over 2 identity. Tower two identity in the left composite with d to the power zero, the differentiation of the power zero, which is the identity, while in the right we have this another decomposition. Because of the uniqueness of the coefficients of the decomposition, we obtained that for n equal, if we look at the coefficient of d to the power zero, which is this one in the left, and in the right is one a one x, we obtained that a one of x has to be alpha over two x plus tau over two. Over 2x plus tau over 2. While there is no d to the power n with n greater than or equal to 1 in the left, that means all the coefficients n of x with n greater than or equal to 2 are 0. Okay? So, and a0 of x is the only one that we cannot get from the commutator, but a0 of x is, in fact, the semi-annihilation applied to one, which is a minus plus one half a0 applies to one. The annihilation operator kills the vacuum. The constant polynomial one, so remains one half a0, one, which is one half alpha zero. So now we have all the coefficients. We have a one, we have a n, for n greater than or equal to two, we have a zero. So we have that the semi-annihilation operator is alpha zero over two i plus alpha over two x plus tau over two d. That's the decomposition of the semi-annihilation operator. Now, since v is the semi-creation is x minus u. semi-creation is x minus u because u plus v is x. We simply subtract x minus this equation 36, the right side of 36, and we obtain the decomposition of the semi-creation operator, which is x minus alpha 0 over 2i minus 1 half alpha x plus tau i d. This is again in the case when the discriminant is 0, okay, which contains the gamma and the Gaussian random variables. But if the discriminant is not zero, then we have to use the double. Then we have to use the double commutator that we have here. Equation 33 equals this. So we have to, so double commutator replace u by its decomposition. Now we commute, we do the inner commutator first by applying the Lyman's commutator rule. So we get n n of x d n minus 1x. And we replace here x minus 2u. This is the formula for the u. So U. So then we remain here with one commutator. We again have to apply the commutator linear commutator rule for the commutator n a n x d n minus 1 x. And again, x commutes with a n of x. So it remains just the commutator between dn minus 1 x, which is n minus 1 dn minus 2. And here we distribute and separate first the coefficient of the identity, which is d to the 0 minus delta. is d to the zero minus delta over two x minus two a zero and then when we distribute minus with minus becomes plus the two cancel so remains delta plus summation with n starting from one n of x d to the n here in the left we make the change of variable n goes to n minus two and we obtain that in the left we obtain this sum and in the right to obtain this sum and remember that the coefficients are unique so we identify for each n the coefficient n the coefficient we write the equality of the coefficient of d to the power n from the left with the coefficient of d to the power n from the right first for n equals zero we obtain the coefficient of identity is this in the right and here we have zero plus two zero plus one a2 of x and for n greater than equal to one we just have these coefficients n of x in the right so only the a0 of x has an extra term compared with the n for n compared with the a n for n greater than or equal to one. And we obtain this recursive relation a n plus two of x is the delta over n plus two times n plus one n of x minus one half. This is the Kronecker symbol delta n zero x because for a zero we have an extra term. And that's easy to solve. This recursive relation is not hard to solve. So a n plus two is obtained in terms of a n. So we obtain in the end that the even index coefficients a Even index coefficients a to n of x have this formula, delta to the n over 2n factorial a0 of x minus 1/2x, and a to n plus 1 of x is delta to the power n over 2n plus 1 factorial a1 of x. And now we are going to replace capital delta by little delta squared, because little delta was a complex radical of delta. And we can write that the composition of the semi-annihilation u, separating the even part. Separating the even part from the odd part here, and we replace each of them a2n and a2n plus 1 by their formula. But then we observe that this summation of d to the power 2n over 2n factorial, and here we can put delta to the 2n, can be obtained from the translation operator. So for each complex number, we consider the translation operator tau c that maps f into f defined by tau c f of x equals. defined by tau c f of x equals f of x plus c. And from the Taylor formula, using the Taylor formula, it's not hard to see that t delta can be written operatorially as summation from n equals 0 to infinity, delta to the power n and factorial d to the power n. So that's writing the Taylor formula in an operatorial way. So this is the exponential of delta times the differentiation operator. And similarly, t to the minus delta is the exponential. Similarly, t to the minus delta is the exponential of minus delta d. Now, if we add equations 47 and 48, then the odd power cancel, and we get the summation of the even powers that we need here. If we subtract 47 and 48, then the even power cancel and we obtain the summation of the what powers here. And so, using this formula, we can see that the summation of the even powers in which we have replaced capital delta. We have replaced delta capital delta by little delta square is in fact one half translation by delta plus translation by minus delta, which we can call cosine hyperbolic of delta d. And the summation of the odd powers is one half t delta minus t minus delta, which is sine hyperbolic of delta d. And replacing here these sums, we obtain this formula for the semi-annihilation operator, which is u equals can be written in terms of the translation by. Can be written in terms of the translation by delta t minus delta identity, and we have also multiplication by x. And then we have the semi-creation v, which is x minus u, simply x, and replace u by this. So equation 52 will give us the formula for the semi-creation operator for the Meisner class, okay, but in terms of the translations operators. Okay. Okay. So once we have achieved the composition for the semi-annihilation and semi-creation, we can go to the next step, which would be to find the position going to the composition of the number operator. And remember that the number operator commuting with x is x minus 2u. That's a universal commutation relationship. So let the decomposition of the number operator be summation of n of x d2. operator be summation of n of x d to the power n actually a zero of x is zero why because the number operator applied to one one is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue which is is degree zero so the number operator applied to one is zero which means that a0 of x is zero so this summation can be taken from one so now we replace n by its decomposition here in the commutator and replace u but what by And replace u by what we've just found before. We have the decomposition of u. So here we commute n with x again using Leibniz commutator rule. So we get n a n of x d to the power or n minus 1 because the commutator between d to the power n and x is n d n minus 1. And here we have x minus twice u. We replace u by the formula that we had before. And now And now we identify the coefficients of d to the power n from the left with the corresponding coefficients of d to the power n from the right to find the coefficients a n of x for the number operator. And it turns out, after we do this identification, that a2n plus 1 of x has this formula, x minus alpha 0, delta to the 2n over 2n plus 1 factorial. And a2n is minus 1 over delta, delta to the 2n minus 1 over 2n factorial. Over 2n factorial alpha x plus tau. And in this moment, we have the decomposition for the number operator. The number operator looks like this formula 58. And again, we can replace the summation of delta to the 2m plus 1d to the 2m plus 1, 2m plus 1 factorial, and the summation of the even part in terms of the translation operators. So you have the number operator for the Meissner class has this formula 59. That's the number of operators. So, now once we have the composition for the number of operators, we can finally find in the last step the composition for the quantum operators. For A0, it's very easy to find it because if we look at the Zeguakobi parameters of the Meissner class, you see they are alpha n plus alpha zero, that can be written operatorially that A0. Operatorially, that A0, the preservation operator, is alpha times the number operator plus alpha zero times identity. So it has a very simple formula in terms of the number operator, but we already know the decomposition for the number operator from here. Okay, so simply we replace the number operator by its formula in terms of the translation, and we have the preservation for the Meisner class is this 61. And then And then, since the semi-annihilation u is a minus plus one half a zero, we know that the composition for u, we know that the composition for a zero, we can automatically find the decomposition for a minus. And so we can write a minus is u minus one half a zero. And we can replace u from what we had before. What is it? So let me see. We equation 51. And we can replace n. And we can replace n from by equation 59. And this will be the decomposition of the this will be the formula for the annihilation operator written in terms of the translation operators. And similarly, since v is a plus plus one half a0, we have that a plus is v minus one half a0. And we know the formula for a v, we computed it before. The formula for a zero, we have it here. So there's the We have it here. So that's the formula for the creation operator. Okay. And now one more thing. So these are the formulas that we wanted to find, but let's make the following observation. You see, if beta is equal to zero, if the parameter beta is equal to zero, then this last term in equation 63 disappears completely. So we obtain that A minus is a. So we obtain that A minus is a linear combination of the translation by delta, translation by minus delta, and identity, which is translation by the zero vector. So when for beta equals zero, we have that A minus is a linear combination of T delta, T minus, delta, and identity, which we can write it like this. A minus is a constant C1 T delta plus a constant C2 T minus delta plus C3 translation by 0 if we press the identity. And here C1 plus C2. And here C1 plus C2 plus C3 is equal to 0. So now we can ask the following questions. Okay? So this formula leads us to this question. Can we find all random variables having finite moments of all orders such that its annihilation operator is of the form A minus is a linear combination of translation operator summation of Ci T d T D I and the and And because the annihilation operator strictly decreases the degree of a polynomial, so it maps, for example, x to the power n into a polynomial of degree at most n minus 1. It is absolutely necessary that the summation of all these coefficients to be zero, because when you apply, you can look at the a minus applied to x to the power n, and you look at the coefficient of x to the power n in the right, in order to be zero, you must have the summation of all these. must have the summation of all these coefficients here must be zero like we had here and the uh so we answer this question and the answer is the following the random variables whose annihilation operator is a linear combination of translation operators are in fact of this form lambda1 y1 plus lambda2 y2 plus lambda p yp where lambda1 lambda2 lambda p are real numbers and y1 y2 yp are independent shifted and rescaled Independent, shifted, and rescaled Poisson random variables. So basically, after rescaling a translation, the random variables whose annihilation operator is a linear combination of translation operators must be linear combinations of independent Poisson random variables. And this paper appeared now is in one line ready, so it will appear in the number. So, it will appear in the number of the Ida Kupi dedicated to the memory of Professor Parta Sarati. Thank you very much. We thank the speaker now. So, are there any questions? Can you go back to the parametrization of beta and t? Beta and what? And t? You have some. Yeah, yeah. Parametrization. Okay, so please say it again. Which slide do you like to see? Would you like to see? There. Yeah. The second in a condition is a little bit strange for me to because if we Because if beta is zero, is smaller than zero and this annulates, then omega will be negative. No, no, what happened? That's a good question. What happened? So you see, so at the beginning, t is large enough, you know, such that the first omegas are will be positive, yes? But after a while, this equation cannot hold for all n because why? The limit as n goes to infinity of this expression is what? Negative. Expression is what negative infinity, yeah. But at there exists a certain moment, a certain capital N for which omega capital N will become zero. You see, you can solve this equation, beta n squared plus t minus beta n equals zero. Okay, so once the omega becomes zero, if you look at this formula, you see, once one of the omegas are equal to zero, okay, all these expectations become what? Okay, all these expectations become what? All these products become zero. Then there is t cannot be any element. No, no, yes, t has to be a negative integer multiple of beta. That's why we said here t belongs to minus beta times a certain natural number. You can solve this equation. So beta n squared plus t minus beta n equals zero. minus beta equals n equals zero. You can divide both sides by n, and you obtain that t minus beta equals equal minus beta n, from which you get t equals beta times one minus n. Okay? Is that okay? No, it's a good question. So so you must force this omega to be zero at a certain moment. And it doesn't matter whether the other omegas will be will. Omegas will be will be negative because the L to norm already this corresponds to a random variable that has a finite support. Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you very much. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Do we have any other questions? Okay, let's thank the speaker now, and we are grateful for the speakers today. Thank you. We end the Uh thank you. We end the debate today.
