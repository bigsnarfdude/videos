Well, thank you for this invitation. I wish I could be there, but I can't be at two places at once more than not most of the time anyway. So I'm going to be reporting briefly on three or even four projects, all connected with the local and global England's correspondences, mostly about function fields. Which is mostly about function fields and the advantage of working with function fields. Well, there are two advantages that I discovered working with function fields. First of all, that function fields, you don't have to worry about Piadic Hodge theory, which is for me a great comfort, especially the way the global theory has been developing around Pietakov's theory recently. And secondly, Theory recently, and secondly, that one has geometric methods that one can use to surprising effect. So, let me see if I can. All right. So, some of you may have already seen this. So please, I'm sorry. I apologize for that. So, what is the local Langlands conjecture? Maybe it's not a surprise since I've already used this slide more than once. The point I would like to make is that there are several local Langlands. The point I would like to make is that there are several local Anglans conjectures, and if you like, the conjecture is that they all say the same thing. So I will explain what I mean by that. It is a little bit strange, maybe, not to see anybody, but I'll to be talking to myself in my office. But that's the way it is. All right, so here's a notation. G is a connected reductive group over a local. Connected reductive group over a local non-Archimedean field, although at some point it's going to be over a function field. The residue field is of characteristic p. And I'm going to denote pi of g over f, the set of irreducible admissible representations with coefficients in some algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, which is either going to be the complex numbers or the algebraic closure of the eletic numbers. And this notation. And notation for the Langlands parameters, I think of it in this form with the V group representation at an element n of the Lie algebra of the dual group, satisfying the usual relations, which I don't write. And the set of equivalence classes of L parameters is denoted with a phi. And in much of this theory, one works with semi-simple language parameters. If you saw the talks of Vincent Lafourg and Somme Chuet, then you know what I mean by that. This is only the semi-simple part of a Langlands parameter. If it's contained in a proper parabolic, it's contained in a Levy subgroup. And again, up to conjugacy. And again, up to conjugacy. And I put an SS to denote the semi-simple L parameters. All right. So here's a conjecture. That is, to say, I'll put it in three parts. There is a canonical parameterization from the equivalence classes of representations of G of F to the equivalence classes of Langlands parameters and then some. And then some conditions that must be satisfied in order for this to be considered a Langlands parameterization. The L packet, that is to say, defined artificially as the fiber over an L point phi in the parameter space, is finite and then it's also non-empty. So in particular, every parameter is in the image of some. In the image of some, some uh so I haven't given all the conditions, it should be a semi-simple Frobenius and so on. But every parameter, it's certainly the irreducible parameters, which are contained in no proper parabolic subgroup, should have a fiber. So the problem is, all this says is there's a bijection. Doesn't say anything about it. So let me state some of the usual properties. Usual properties. It should be given by class field theory. If G is a torus, it should be compatible with most of the transformations you can imagine. If you have an isomorphism of fields that acts on both sides, that should be compatible. Twist by a character on one side should be the twist by some. Some appropriate version of a character on the other side takes contragredients to contragredients, it's compatible with central isogenies and products and so on. These are not necessarily easy to prove in the cases where a correspondence has been constructed. Also essential that it should be compatible with normalized parabolic induction. So, in particular, for For spherical representations, for unramified representations, the Langlands correspondence should be the Satake correspondence. But it doesn't get anywhere near a characterization of L because it doesn't say anything about supercuspital representations. And most of what I'll have to say is about supercuspital representations. All right, you can also ask for there to be compatible. Ask for there to be compatible if you have a theory of automorphic L functions, well then that means you have automorphic L functions on the side pi, L and epsilon factors on the side pi, and also L and epsilon factors on the side phi for the Galois parameters. So, whatever theory you have, you can ask that you get the same answer on both sides. Certainly, that's true. Certainly, that's true. To have a theory of automorphic del functions, I won't say what's meant by that. But one thing for sure is that it should give you the same, the L and epsilon factors should be the same, the L factors for spherical representations. You know what they should be. So that's one normalization. It should also be compatible with twisted endoscopic. Compatible with twisted endoscopic transfer, and in particular with cyclic base change. So, cyclic base change on the Galois side means restriction to the V group of a subgroup of the V group of finite index. And on the other side, if you are lucky enough to have a cyclic base change, meaningful, which is an identity of twisted characters, then these should also. Characters, then these should also be giving you the same answer. And finally, local global compatibility. That means if somehow you have a way to assign Galois, global Galois parameters to automorphic representations, then the local parametrization should be compatible with that. All right. It's well known, and this is. Well, known, and this is near the beginning of the story, that point one, if you look at the case of the tensor product representation for GLN cross GLM, plus some of the earlier conditions, then NER showed that this was enough to characterize the local Langlands correspondence. And so one has several, one has in several ways constructed parameterizations for. Parameterizations for GLN and prove that they do satisfy this compatibility with L and epsilon factors and the other conditions. And therefore, one can say with some confidence that one knows the local language correspondence for GLN. Point one is not going to get you very far for E8, but that's, well, maybe at least as far as anybody knows, maybe there's something. Maybe there's something. And in principle, point two can be checked in characteristic zero, where one does know how to define cyclic base change, at least in some ad hoc way. One has the twisted stable trace formula. So that can be applied. But the original conditions are unknown for general G. When I say general G, I mean really. general G, I mean really exceptional groups and not even all the exceptional groups, but there's not a general proof that applies. There are individual proofs for classical groups and now for G2, but they're still conditions B and C are still in general not known. And specifically for the constructions. For the constructions that have been given recently. All right. As you know, I was unable, unfortunately, to attend most of this week's talk, so I don't know what was said about the local correspondence in the talks about the Laforgue and Schuey for function fields. But there is a semi-simple local. Local parametrization constructed by Généré La Forg for local fields of positive characteristic and by Fauge and Schulze more recently for all local, non-Archimedean local fields. And it's known that these are compatible with the global Compatible with the global parameterization for global function fields. This was proved some years ago by Genesti and La Forg for their parameterization, and Daniel Lee Wuerta recently proved this for the Fog-Schulze parameterization. Finiteness of L packets and surjectivity are known in principle, at least, for classical groups of these. Classical groups of these for this parameterization and probably for G2, but not in general. When I say that, there is now by Gan and Savin, not to confuse Savin with Sawin, whose name is on the last line. Ganon and Savan have constructed a local correspondence for G2, but it has not been proved that it's the same. Been proved that it's the same as the one of Jeanesse de la Forgue or Farg Schulze. So, but it probably can be proved with some additional work. Now, my project with Gan and Will Sawin does shed some light on point B, which is the finiteness of L packets, although it doesn't resolve the question. Are there any questions before I get started? Because I'm going to. I get started because I'm going to be slowing down at this point. Just all right. Let me just say there's another partial parameterization due to Kaletha a few years ago. Using the construction of JKU, JKU constructed large classes of Large classes of supercuspital representations known to include all supercuspitals. If P is not too small, P doesn't divide the order of the Vau group for G, but it's a theorem of Finson. And the domain of Caletta's parameterization is the set of regular and non-singular supercuspital representations of any G of F. I won't. I won't recall the definitions of these, but they include many of the representations that I'll be discussing momentarily. And Vincent, Kaleth, and Spice proved character formulas that implied that this parametrization, this candidate local correspondence, is compatible with endoscopic transfer and characterizes the parametrization uniquely. The parametrization uniquely, except for small p. Where are these? They haven't proved the formula. So, question, big question. Is this parameterization the same as Faub Schulze or Janeste Laforge? I missed the message saying that the schedule had changed for Wednesday, so I only caught the second half of. Wednesday, so I only caught the second half of NER's talk, but I understand that he reported on results along these lines for classical groups, at least for pietic fields. And these methods are based on one way or another on explicit comparison, either by character identities or by L function. Considerations by comparison with GLN. So there are partial results known about this. I'm not sure what the latest results are. Now, let me ask a question about how one would obtain results for piadic fields from the kind of results I'm about to describe for fields of positive characteristics. Fields of positive characteristic. So suppose we have two local fields that are n close in the sense that they are that they are the integer rings modulo of certain powers of the certain power of the maximal ideals are isomorphic as rings. Then some time ago, Denine showed that if you consider the v group parameters of the corresponding depth, then they're in bijection. In bijection. Now, if G is a split, a connected group and you take the standard congruent subgroup of level the rth power of the maximal ideal, I don't know what that K R of F, and let this, I don't know whether you see the cursor or not, I don't see one. If you let the, if you define the Hecke. you let the if you define the the hecca hecca algebras to be of level r to be the uh hecca algebras relative to these congruent subgroups for f or f sharp then uh kajdan with refinement by ganapati showed that if f sharp and f are r close then they're the irreducible representations of g of f and of g of f sharp of depth F sharp of depth r, depth at most r, are also in bijection. So here's a conjecture from my paper with Gan and Sawen. If n is sufficiently large compared to r, then this diagram commutes. You take the genesse de la Fogue correspondence, which for in characteristic P, which, so F is now in characteristic. Which so f is now in characteristic p and f sharp is in characteristic zero. I guess I could also put the fog-Schulze correspondence that would be sufficient, in fact. So the Falk-Schulze correspondences for the two fields are compatible with respect to the Kajdan-Derin identification for close local fields. So there's a challenge. Prove this conjecture and find a uniform bound for n in terms of r. For n in terms of r, I think n equals r is plausible or split groups. Here's a question related to the challenge. A version of cyclic base change is known by the trace formula for a G of F when F is piadic based on it can be constructed using the simple The simplified version of the trace formula in La Besse's book. Is the Schulze parameterization compatible with cyclic base change? Same question for endoscopic transfer. And a question, final question. Can the finiteness of, if you can prove the finiteness of L packets for local fields of equal characteristic, can you use this to prove? This is to prove the same finiteness for piadic fields. Well, that seems to be, if you know that the conjecture, it seems likely. Is there any other way to prove the finiteness of all packets over p-adic fields in general for general groups? All right. Here is an application of potential automorphy. Potential automorphy. This is a naive strategy for proving this finiteness or surjectivity, actually. So suppose you have a parameter. You want to prove surjectivity. You want to prove that it is in the image of the local correspondence. So first, you find a global field with a place who's where the local is. Who's where the localization, where the completion is your given local field? Take a finite field of large characteristic and a surjective map of the Galois group of K to the dual group of G over the points of the dual group over this finite field, such that the local parameter, so this is a row bar because it's a it's a A row bar because it's a holomorphism to the group to points over a finite field. And you want the restriction of rho bar to the decomposition group at V to be your given parameter. That can be done, by the way. That is actually something that can be done very nicely. Then you lift it to row. By the way, F, this F. Rho, by the way, F, this F has a large characteristic, it's L different from P, doesn't interfere with the P. Then you lift rho bar to some representation with values in the vit vectors of F, the integers of some eladic number field, with Zariski-dense image. That can also be done. Now you prove that the restriction. The restriction of ρ to the Galois group of some finite Gao extension of K comes from an automorphic representation. So here we're assuming we have a parameterization of cospital automorphic representations, as in the work of Vincent Lafourg. This can also be done. This is what's done in my paper with Berkeley Carl. Paper with Buckler Kari and Thorne. All this can be done up to this point. Now, here's where things get complicated. Now you want to use the twisted trace formula. You take the decomposition group. So when you've realized this over this field K prime, you have most likely lost everything you knew about the About the restriction. So, rho prime can be unramified at the place dividing v. You've lost your original phi. But now, if you descend it to an automorphic representation, well, this rho prime is invariant under the Galois group of k prime over k. So, if this were G Ln, you can use solvable descent or cyclic descent. Descent or cyclic descent to descend pi prime to an automorphic representation over the fixed field of the decomposition group, decomposition groups being solvable. So now, and if you can do that, then your original phi is exactly the parameter attached to the descended representation at the place v. Okay, this strategy has actually been applied in one case. But for number fields, not for function fields. So, in my paper with Tari and Thorne, if suppose f is piadic and g is g2, then this strategy yields a bijection between generic supercuspital representations of g2 over f and irreducible parameters. Now, this result has been. The result has been superseded by a complete local anglance correspondence for G2 by Gen and Savin. But their methods are very different. Their methods are purely automorphic, whereas ours make use of, I should say that this step three is based on modular lifting. So that's that. So that's that is the goes back that uses that's a variant for groups over function fields of the Taylor-Wiles method. So that's that's that's a completely different approach. All right. So just say a word about this. The construction of the parameterization of this parameter is based on the exceptional theta correspondence. Theta correspondence of G2 with PGSP6 and a whole lot of work by people listed over the past 30 years or so. The first three steps are basically the same as in our paper with Berkeley. And this works because we don't, and the cyclic descent is possible because we don't work over G2, where cyclic descent is not known in general. We work over GL7 and then we can apply this. We can apply the same proof as the proof of the local Langlands correspondence for GLN. There's a missing, there's an extra step that one doesn't get for groups other than G2. This is an argument based on poles of L functions due to Hundley and Liu. And it probably works over function fields of characteristic greater than three. But why would this not necessarily work in general? Well, Work in general? Well, descent means we take a sequence of subfields of K prime, where each step we have a cyclic field of prime order, and L is the fixed field of the decomposition group. We're identifying a stable twisted trace for the group over the larger field with a stable trace for the group over the smaller. Trace for the group over the smaller field. But if we don't know multiplicity, one twisted trace can vanish. And if there are infinitely many supercuspitals with the same parameter, descent may fail. But I'm working with Buzzer Plessis, Thorne, and Kaletha to try to overcome these obstacles. Now, let me say some, let me return, the rest of the talk is going to be for function fields. For function fields. So you've already, if you were attended Avan Sander Forges' talks and Song Shui's talks, you will have seen these results. So suppose you have, let's say g is split semi-symbol. It's certainly not necessary, but it's going to, we're going to assume that in the future over the function field k of the curve y. Y and let A0G be the cusp of the automorphic representations, and the GSS be semi-simple homomorphisms from the Galois group to the Latic points of the dual group. And the Fogg's theorem is that there is a parameterization by semi-simple parameters that is compatible with the Satake parameter. Compatible with the satake parameterization at unramified places. All right, so there's a misprint. There should not be an X in this name. With the above hypotheses, the local, so the restriction of the global parameter to the local V group, semi-simplified, depends. Semi-simplified depends not on the globalization k, not on the global field k, not on the global automorphic representation, only on the local data. Moreover, it's compatible with parabolic induction in the obvious sense. So if you have an irreducible representation of a group over the field of Laurent series over a finite field, then you can define a semi-simple parameter. Semi-simple parameter. So we have their parameterization. That's a semi-simple parameterization of any representation of G of F. Now, suppose you take a representation, a linear representation of the dual group, sigma, then, and suppose, and so suppose it's... Suppose, and so suppose it's ramified. Suppose pi is ramified at some finite set of primes s of the field. Now, if you compose the parameter with sigma, then you get a homomorphism to GLN, but a homomorphism from GLN to GLN from the Galois group unramified outside of set S is precisely a semi-simple L-adic local system on, which denote L pi sig. Denote L pi sigma on the curve with those points removed, some affine curve. Now, Didin's V2 tells us that each irreducible sum and of L of pi sigma is punctually pure up to a twist by a character of the Galois group of the finite field. The finite field. So, up to the twist, which we ignore until the last part of this talk, where it plays an important role, the eigenvalues of the Frobenius at any place, W, including the ramified places, you choose a Frobenius, they are V numbers, VQ numbers of various weights. That is to say, they are algebraic numbers, all of whose complex embeddings. Embeddings are equal to a certain power of q, q to the one-half. All right, so this allows us to define the notion of purity of a representation of the group G of F. If for one or any faithful homomorphism representation sigma, all the eigenvalues have the same weight of the Frobenius. At this specific place, Q. I'm not sure what this Q is doing there. So, the representation, yeah, for Provenius, Q is the order of the residue field of F. So, if all the eigenvalues have the same weight, then you say the representation is pure. Now, if G is not equal to G L N, if G is equal to G Ln, all supercuscal representation. G is equal to G L, then all supercussible representations are pure. And in fact, the corresponding representations are always irreducible. So here's the main theorem with Gan and Sawen. Let pi be a pure supercuspital representation of G of F. And suppose pi is compactly induced from a compact open subgroup of G. We know that this is true of P. We know that this is true if P doesn't divide the order of the value by Finson. Suppose, moreover, that Q is bigger than 3, and this is probably not essential, then the parameter is not unramified, which means that the restriction to the inertia group is not trivial. Oh, here, this is an old slide because this has been proved for quasi-split. Because this has been proved for quasi-split G as well. So this is, so it doesn't have to be split. In fact, it's true for any reductive, any quasi-split reductive group. All right. So this, what does this imply? So let's assume that P doesn't divide the order of the vile group. Because L is compatible with parabolic induction, we Compatible with parabolic induction, we conclude that if pi is pure and its Langlands parameter, that is to say the one defined by Genestia La Fog or Faux Schultz, is unramified, then it is an irreducible constituent of an unramified principal series. So I don't know any other way to prove this. And I don't know, for example, I don't think it's known that for p-adic fields that this P-iadic fields, that this is that this follows from the construction of a Falken-Schulze. This has not been established for the Falk-Schulze parameterization for pi-adic fields in general. So in particular, there are not infinitely many supercuspitals with unramified, with a given, with a given unramified parameter. Yes, because yes, with trivial parameters or Trivial parameter, or because the trivial parameter is pure. So if it's pure, then this corollary implies. All right. Now I introduce a notion of incorrigible representations. Assume that local and global stable, cyclic stable base change over function fields works as in Labes's book, and I and I think there's Book, and I think there's hope that this will be available in the next few years. The work of Bertrand Nemer, especially. So, then we can say that an incorrigible, we can define a representation to be incorrigible if it's supercus little, and such that no matter how many times you apply cyclic base change, at the end, you're always going to have a supercuspital number. And here I show. And here I should say that every proof of the local language correspondence for GLN, the first step is to show that there is no such, there is no incorrigible representation for GLN. This was first proved by Eniar using his numerical correspondence, and it was proved by Schulze using nearby cycles. So corollary, no pure super Corollary, no pure supercuspole representation under our hypotheses is incorrigible. All right, so here's the, here's, this is the, this is what I just said. So this is the key step in the proof for GLN. We can say some more by the same methods. Suppose It's a pure supercaspal and it's also compactly induced from an open compact subgroup that is sufficiently small, then it's not, then L of pi is not only ramified, it's wildly ramified. So for example, any subgroup of the principal congruence subgroup is sufficiently small of the integer points is sufficiently small. I want to emphasize that this does not tell us what the restriction to the inertia group is. It just says that it's not trivial. Now, the supercospitals that are not pure have Langlands parameters with row n with n not equal to zero. Now, this is a, this is, this should, I should say, conjecturally. This should, I should say, conjecturally. I will say something more about that, but they should have conjectured Langlands parameters with non-trivial n. And then we would expect that the pair satisfies purity of the monodromy weight filtration. That is to say, for any sigma, any linear representation of the dual group, first of all, the eigenvalues for bringing us are all Q numbers of integer weight. Numbers of integer weight. Here we better assume that the group G is semi-simple, otherwise, there could be some uniform twist by a character of the Galois group of the finite field. Furthermore, the subspace of eigenvalues of weight less than or equal to a given integer is invariant under the Under the Langlands parameter. And most importantly, N is as non-trivial as possible. It induces an isomorphism between corresponding pieces on either side. There is a W, which is a middle weight, and the ith power of N induces an isomorphism between the corresponding rated pieces. Between the corresponding rated pieces. All right. Now, the semi-simple parameter is semi-simple, that means there is no n, but not every semi-simple parameter can be completed to one satisfying purity of monoromy wave filtration. For example, suppose the composition of rho with the linear representation. Of rho with the with the linear representation sigma as two distinct weights, a and a prime. And if rho, well, if rho can be completed to a rho n satisfying purity, then a and a prime must have the same parity. So we prove any supercussible pi, not necessarily pure, the semi-simple parameter can be completed to a pair that satisfies purity of the monoforming weight filtration. Purity of the monotony weight filtration. So for supercospital, or for that matter, for discrete series pi, we can define this to be the full language parameter. So I should say that this, since I prepared this slide, this has been generalized to all discrete series representations of any Any opiadic quasi-split group. Now, here's the argument. The other, in addition to being able to apply the theory of weights to a function field, when you're working with function fields, there is a final element, or I guess a first and initial element, namely the function field of P1. function field of P1. So we're going to prove these theorems, we prove these theorems by globalization over P1. So choose a Borel subgroup and the opposite Borel. And let's let I0 be the Iwohore subgroup. Remember this is, let's just, let's, for simplicity, let's assume that G is split, although this is not necessary. Although this is not necessary, uh, to denote the Iwahori subgroup corresponding to B and I infinity plus be the pro-unipotent radical of the Ivo Hori corresponding to B minus. We construct a cusp of automorphic representation with four properties. So remember, P1, the P1, the places of the field K correspond to Galois orbits of points of P1 over the algebraic closure. Well, but they're already the points over the ground field, K. So inside the points over the ground field, there are also the points different from zero and infinity. So at every point other than zero infinity over the ground field, we The ground field, we choose our cuspital automorphic representation to have our given pi. This is a super cuspital, and we want to prove it's a pure supercuspital. We want to prove that it has a ramified parameter. Outside the points over the ground field, we want pi to be unramified. At infinity, it has a fixed vector under Under the pro P radical of our subgroup. And at zero, it contains a vector corresponding under to also fixed by the prop unipotent radical, but it's also transforms under a certain character. Under a certain character of the Iwohori. All right. So we've imposed conditions at all the places of over the, or all the rational points, all the K-rational points. At the outside of the K-rational points, it's unramified. So suppose you can construct this. I'll explain how in a bit. So then suppose L of pi is unramified. Because the parameter is pure, one can see by Janine's result that for any faithful sigma, the elliotic local system on P1 minus the rational points extends to a punctually pure local system on Gm. Local system on GM. Moreover, our hypotheses, that's the purity. Okay, here this. Let me just explain. Because it's pure, there's no room for unipotent monodromy at the points, at the rational points, at these points where the parameter has been established to be pure. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to get away with this. So, this argument breaks down if we don't assume that pi is pure. But, moreover, our hypotheses at zero infinity imply that the ramification. Hypotheses at zero infinity imply that the ramification is tame. Well, so what we have is a tame local system or a local system on GM with tame ramification at the poles. So it can only be a sum of local systems induced from characters of finite order of the tame fundamental group, but we know what that is. So we write it, we check. But we have, we, but. But no matter what the character at zero is, no matter what the character at zero is, we have the same parameters at every point in every invertible element of k. And we get a contradiction because we can calculate explicitly. Explicitly. All right, now here's how we construct these. We've constructed by Poincaré series. This is an adaptation of the argument of the paper of Gan and L'Omélie. So we suppose that you assume that pi is compactly induced from the group of integral points, maximum compact, and choose a matrix coefficient supported in that group, which we can do. That group, which we can do. Then we construct a Poincaré series. And with as follows, well, we have our chosen matrix coefficient at the points of gm of k, the characteristic function of the integral elements outside the maximal compact outside at The maximal compact outside at the non-rational points of the P1. At infinity, we pick, well, we pick what we have to pick. It has to be invariant under this I infinity plus. So we pick the characteristic function and at zero, we pose the necessary condition. Now, the point is that what could go wrong? Well, this could sum to zero, but because of the support conditions, It doesn't. At one, only the element one contributes. And then you set pi to be the representation generated by this piece of phi, and it has all the properties. In general, well, one has to choose if pi is compactly induced from a group other than the integral points, then we have to choose the local groups. At zero infinity carefully. All right, the wild ramification. We get, it's a similar argument. We get a non-vanishing Poincaré series, but because it's compactly induced from a small subgroup, we can add an additional condition. We can assume that it's unramified outside infinity. So then we get a local system on A1. But the previous theorem. But the previous theorem tells us that the parameter of pi is ramified. And there are no tamely ramified local systems on A1, so it must be wild. So that's the qualitative results. And for mixed supercospitals, we need to globalize. And at this point, we don't need any. Globalize, and at this point, we don't need any other. We can take any base curve, it doesn't matter. So we can choose any curve we want, but we want to know that when you compose the parameter with the adjoint representation, that the corresponding local system is irreducible. And for that, we globalize by choosing pi. Pi so x to be the parameter of interest and pi so y to be the Klustermann representation representation considered in the paper of Heinlo, Ingo, and Jun. And for that, it's known to be irreducible. And that's why we have a restriction on the characteristic. So then, because it's irreducible, it's an irreducible parameter, then one gets Then one gets purity of the monogrowing weight filtration. And that's so that's the so since it has a complete, since it, the semi-simple parameter is the parameter of a local system that satisfies purity of monitoring weight filtration, we have automatically completion with that property. Okay, I am going to skip this. I am going to skip this temporarily because I'm running out of time. I'm going to skip to more recent work with Chubataro. So this is a global application. Here is a partial result in the direction of the Ramanujan conjecture. Conjecture, which was stated briefly at the end of, well, part of it, the Arthur conjecture stated at the end of Pencil de Frog's talk, the one I did see today. Let K be any function field over a finite field of characteristic P, and G a connected simple group over K, or simplicity. For simplicity. Pi a cuspidal automorphic representation. There's an analogous result for semi-simple groups, but it's a little bit more complicated. Suppose there's one place, V, where the local component is generic and unramified, and moreover, the group is unramified, quasi-split, but not. I quasi-split, but not the unitary group in two n plus one variables. All right. Suppose there's another place where pi u is tempered, for example, a discrete series. And then we have some restrictions for these particular types, p greater than two or p greater than three. Then for every place w at which pi is under. W at which pi is unramified and g of a kw is unramified quasi-split, the local component is tempered. All right. We cannot say this at ramified places, and I'll explain why in a moment. So, this is our result in the direction of the Raminishi conjecture, but we do have to make these two hypotheses. Have to make these two hypotheses. We also know that it's not true that every cospital automorphic representation is globally everywhere tempered. But if it's everywhere generic, then it should be. If it's globally generic, it's expected to be. Well, here, it's enough for it to be generic at one place and then tempered at another place. Here is a picture of the proof from our paper. Um, what is going on? Um, well, this here's the idea, then I'll show you the picture again. So we choose an irreducible representation of the L group of the so again, say of the dual group, for example, and we assume, so that means that we have an L addic local system as before. Local system, as before, on the curve. For most g, we can take tau to be the adjoint representation. Now, here is what Didin's Vei2 actually says. It says that L pi tau is a sum of indexed by a finite sum, of course, by characters of Of the Galois group of the constant field. So the point is that there can be eladic characters of the Galois group that are not integer powers of the norm, corresponding to integer powers of the norm. So you can just construct them L adically. They have nothing to do with one another for different L's. And this equivalence relation means up. And this equivalence relation means up to a power of the absolute value. And then, so from my paper with Gan and Solan, we proved that the so we proved that the parameter Parameter of a tempered of a discrete series representation satisfies purity of the monodromy weight filtration. So since we've assumed that G is simple rather than reductive, there is only one, first of all, there's only one L pi tau chi and then because Because we know the determinant is trivial, only the trivial chi contributes. So, in other words, this is a puncture, so that says that the Latic local system has integral Frobenius weights. That is to say that the absolute value, the eigenvalues of Frobenius are all Q numbers, Q powers of Q, of powers of Q to the one-half. Powers of q to the one half. All right. Okay, so this is what now. This proof, I should say, this proof, I said it, but this is already mentioned in the part that I skipped. This fact that it's the temper that this what I just said depends on a globalization result of a Basau faces. All right. All right, so now what we need to do is characterize the parameters of generic unitary representations whose Frobenius weights, generic unitary spherical representations whose Frobenius weights, whose Satake parameters, appropriately normalized, are Q numbers. But by the classification of the unitary dual by Barbash and Chubutaru, the only possible integral for Benius weight is zero. So that's at the chosen place v. So we have a place where all the integral, all the irreducible sumands are locally pure of weight zero, but because it's A pure of weight zero, but because it's their sum ads are punctually pure, that means it's true at every unramified place. So that means that at any unramified place, the local parameter is tempered. So let me go back to this picture. So this is a, we're assuming that some, this is for F4. We're assuming that some we have some We have some weights. These are these Frobenius weights, they're all half-integral, and these are the coroots. But we have in the classification of the unitary spherical dual, generic unitary spherical dual, we get an inequality, which immediately tells us that three of the weights are zero and the other one is less than one. So it's either one half or zero, but then we've got another. Got another inequality that shows that it's not possible. And the argument is all like that. So I have only a few minutes left, so I didn't have time to talk about the base change result with Bukhla, Effeng, Kare, and Thorne, but I should say that we use a We don't. Where do I have that? Yes. Yes. We use a globalization theorem. So the globalization theorem is based on an automorphic globalization theorem. Suppose we have some, we want to globalize a representation. We want to globalize a supercussible representation. To globalize a super-cussbible representation, you want to find a cussboard automorphic representation with an additional property who's such that the parameter, the Zariski closure of the parameter is the whole L group. And this was proved based on what we needed to prove is that we can globalize so that it is supercuspital. That it is supercuspital, a given supercuspital at one place, Steinberg at another place, and that already, because of the purity of the monodromy weight filtration, this allows us to we know that the Mumford-Tate group belongs to a finite set, and then an approximation argument eliminates all but the whole jihad. So I think I. So, I think I will stop here. And thank you again for inviting me. Do we have questions? In your slide on the kind of parameterization, actually, could you go back to that just a moment? On the parameterization, which one? Calatus parameterization of yeah, that's uh yeah, that's gonna be a long way, yeah. Yeah, yeah, you're Yeah. Yeah, here. You seem to be saying that all supercuspitals are regular and non-singular. Oh, definitely not. Definitely not. Yeah, okay. Definitely not. No, no, no. This is a partial, I said, a partial parameterization. Yeah. I was just confused by this includes all super spiders. It's not referring to the super disputes in the sentence. Right, right, right. Well, I mean, right, right, right. Right, right, right. No, the right. The JKU. I mean, this is instruction is exhaustive, right? Right, that's what I mean. Right, thank you so much. Yeah, right. Other questions? Hello? Yeah, yeah. Oh, it's a very nice talk that you gave with so many broad components. With so many broad components. But I was curious about the tau appearing with the functoriality function that you mentioned, it could be the adjoint or pretty much a little bit more general. But I can imagine you would have some restrictions to which representation it can be. I don't know if you could elaborate. So, you mean at the end in the work with Chubataru? Or? Yeah, there was a. Yeah, there was a L tau pi or pi tau. Oh, I can just move back and forth. How about that? I didn't know that you could do that. All right. So, sorry. Here, you mean? So, so, okay, so this tau is used to impose some inequalities on the Equalities on the Satake parameters. So we know, well, actually, they're not inequalities, they're equalities. They have to be half integers. So of course, if you take powers of this, of a given tau, then you get lots of different half integers. We want to get the simplest kind of restriction because we want to show that if the That if it's not tempered, then the unitary spherical generic representation is excluded, or unitary generic representations with those such parameters are excluded by the classification. So in most cases, it's enough to take the adjoint representation. That does it. But in a few cases of orthogonal groups, you need also some spin representation. Also, some spin representations. And in the case of even odd unitary groups, it doesn't, there is, you cannot exclude. You cannot use, find any tau that will keep you completely away from the complementary series. Complementary series. So that's so this is the tau is a way that we choose tau in order to apply the classification. Okay, thank you. Any further questions? If not, then let's thank the speaker again.
