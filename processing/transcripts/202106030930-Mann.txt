Thanks. So it's yeah, I see everybody's Chaslov, Yarma, Samadhi, and Faye are all here. Okay. Okay, so thank you. It's been an interesting session so far. And I know there are pent-up questions waiting to be asked, but what we've been doing in this Be asked, but what we've been doing in this meeting is asking people to say what they think the most important next step is in the work they're doing or how they see their work fitting into the broader picture of understanding the theme of the meeting, gravity and the quantum, that quantum foundations. So, why don't we begin with you, Samahi? Can you hear me? Yep. Yeah. Okay, great. So, um, right, so and please, sorry, Samadhi, like it's about a minute. It's not a long exposition. I'll try not to. Yes. You might hear some thunder because it's thundering very loudly outside right now. The monsoon has started. So, yes, so I think that one of the things That one of the things that is very appealing about this particular approach of growing causal sets in this causal way is that you have an explicit model for quantum gravity where you're talking about covariant observables and you're talking about how to construct these covariant observables in a well-defined way in which you can do that. And we're also addressing that second horn. So it's these. Addressing that second horn. So it's these two horns that I talked about. The second horn, which is at least, and even that if that horn we don't have the full answers to all the questions about quantum measure theory, we're trying to answer it or trying to ask questions that do not depend on an external observer, which you, of course, do not have in quantum cosmology. So to me, these two things being features of this approach are very, very important. And I think the next step will be to really progress towards more physical. To really progress towards more physically interesting models, but of course, it's a technically very hard question. And those who people who have potential inputs and ideas on how to proceed, think about the mathematics, that's always helpful. So let me leave it at that. I think it's under one minute. Okay, that's great. Thanks. So we'll go anti-clockwise on my screen, which makes Chaslov next. Which makes Chaslov next. Okay, hi, everybody again. So maybe let me start with an observation in many articles concerning the problem of the intersection between gravity and quantum theory. You may read: it is well known, or it's obvious that there is contradiction. That there is a contradiction between the general relativity and quantum theory. And I was never convinced, and it was always ad hoc appear to me. And I think what we are right now doing is trying to convince ourselves that there is no contradiction. But we are learning. This is a learning process where we have to understand what it means, like event. Maybe event is not always localized. And cannot be defined. And cannot be identified with a point in space-time, or maybe causal order doesn't need to be definite, and so on. So, we are actually trying somehow to glue general relativity in quantum theory without changing anything, but not doing quantum gravity. That's what I want to understand. Like we are opening the door, and with this, I mean with a quantum reference frame in which we use all the knowledge, just like. In which we use all the knowledge, just like Marcus asked, about general relativity and all the knowledge about quantum theory, and try then to think operationally what would this mean having superposition of classical space-times. And I'm somehow optimistic that we will do this. However, there is a big chunk of remaining problems which is addressed by the quantum. Problems which is addressed by the quantum theories of gravity, and that's what when we go beyond this approximation, that even a well-defined space-time might have some, let's say, fluctuations or it cannot be perceived as that. And so, and this was also, I think Esteban said the other day, what if we have some kind of fluctuations of the metric? And I don't think this is the best maybe notion. Think this is the best, maybe, notion at the end, but what I want to say is this is what is missing already now. I don't know what is the best notion, and so can we formulate quantum equivalence principle even if we have a full creation of the match? All these things are still beyond the method that we are doing. And I think this is maybe the next step. And this doesn't seem to rely only on understanding the classical GR and quantum. And quantum theory has kind of superpositional classical situations. There must be a new element coming. Okay, thank you. And Faye? Yes, thank you, Rob. Well, Sumati said everything I wanted to say, really. And in some sense, my talk doesn't address at all the question of. Causal set quantum gravity, but of course, if the argument holds water, then it gives motivation for basing a theory of quantum gravity on causal sets. So Sumiti is right. I endorse what she says is one of the, if not the major frontier in causal set quantum gravity at the moment, which is to build more physical models, quantum models of causal set growth. Models of causal set growth in the framework of the path integral. So, the quantum measure theory technology is another thing you could call it is the path integral. So it's a path integral-based foundation. We're not only trying to create a theory of quantum gravity, but we're at the same time trying to produce. Trying to produce lay the foundations of a histories-based, a pass integral-based approach, framework for quantum theories in general. So that would not just apply to quantum gravity, but to say quantum theory in a fixed space-time background. So, yeah, I'll leave it there. Thank you. Okay, thank you. And then, Yorma. Okay, thank you. And then Yorma. If you work in the analog space-time paradigm, there are two obvious technical problems and then this one sociological problem. The first technical problem is you need to get the mapping between your relativistic space-time and your analog space-time right. And the second is then when you measure something in your analog system, you want to minimize the effect that don't Minimize the effect that don't map to a relativistic space-time. You only want to measure the things that do map to a relativistic space-time. And the sociological issue is once you've done this, can you convince people that you have done something of interest? I've heard lots of argument to the effect that if you are sure that your relativistic space-time theory is right, why don't you just put it on a computer and the computer will Computer, and the computer will tell you what's happening at the endpoint of Hawking reparation or something like that. And the best answer to that that I know is physics is supposed to be an experimental science. Okay, I gather you conclude. All right, so we can now open it up for questions, and I'll start as the chair. As the chair. Actually, I have lots of questions for all people. I don't know what to go first. So I'll ask the one: well, I have a sort of a smaller one for Sumati and Faye, namely, where does space-time dimension come into this? It seems like it's being assumed, but the bigger question for at least three-quarters of you is: on the one hand, the causal set thing looks like it is. Looks like it is assuming a form of, I almost call it rigid causality. You want A before, you know, A, then B, then C. Whereas, you know, in Chaslov's approach and others, we want indefinite causal order. I mean, is it reasonable at this stage to put the two together and think of indefinitely causal ordered sets? Could one make sense of that? But I'd like a quick answer to the dimension thing. Dimension thing. Okay, so let me quickly answer the dimension and just say a few words about the second one as well. So, in fact, you don't assume anything about dimension. You don't assume even whether it's a manifold-like object. So, in the space of past finite causal sets, which is a sample space, everything is possible. So, one of the things that you expect from causal sets, we're very ambitious. We want to get dimension out as well. So, it's only when you have. So, it's only when you have, when you look at sprinklings, when you look at the continuum approximation that you start off with some particular dimension, et cetera. So, dimension is something we expect to get out of the dynamics. That's very ambitious, I know. And that's so just to answer that quickly. But the other thing is that I disagree that the causal structure, causal, there's no indefinite causal order because, from that, I assume you mean that you can't superpose two things that are. You can't superpose two things that are different, have different causal order, which you can definitely do. That's the whole point of these events could have very different causal sets. So that causal structure is not rigid in any sense, except in a particular history, of course, that's it. But you can, just like you add space-times in a path integral, that's the same way that you add causal sets. Okay, so I guess I misunderstood. So you really are adding A, then B, then A. Adding A then B then C superposed with B then A then C. And is that right? It's the thing that the important thing is that if they're in fact distinct causal sets, in other words, in distinct causal structures, then you would distinguish them. But if it's just a relabeling, then of course you don't care. So that's what a covariant That's what a covariant object that you would construct is something that doesn't care about the relabelings. You know, you say, call this event one, event two, event three, then you change the labeling. It shouldn't matter. But that physical, the physical poset that you have, though, the poset that you have, the structure, the order theoretic structure, if it's distinct, then yes, you will add those things together. Yeah, I agree with what Summit. Yeah, I agree with what Sumati said. So just to answer Rob, it depends what you mean by A and B and C. So if you mean by A some vast macroscopic thing, you know, involving a pointer and particles and labs, and that's one question. Whereas if you mean by A, merely a By a merely a causal set element, then Somati's point is the answer I would give. So there's no, if I think of a chain of causal set elements, just three of them, totally ordered, then it doesn't matter what you call the elements. That's the same causal set and will appear once in the path interval. Rob, are we also allowed to post questions? Because I have now a question which is really related to what has been said. You are muted. You're muted. Sorry, yeah, you're a bit hard to hear. Yeah, so why don't you go ahead? We have two in the queue. So you go ahead and then we'll do Lucienne and then Max. CN and then max. So here is what I would like to understand: what you said. Imagine that we don't go into this macroscopic, but let's say we also don't go to the elements of the causal set, which I still don't know operationally what would be, but something in between. Let's say we have three atoms, and then I have an atom A that is excite, that is first in a ground state, then excited, and then it lets send a photon to atom B, which I can distinguish. To atom B, which I can distinguish what is A and B because they are different atoms. And then B get excited, then D excited, and send the proton again. Now, can I, in a causal set, superpose this situation, each atom is just get exciting, de-exciting, and send a photon such that I have in one amplitude, A sends the photon to B, and then it goes away, maybe to C. And in the other one, B sends the phone. And in the other one, B sends the photon to A and then it goes to C. It's very like a Junius quantum switch kind of setup. Is this something which is microscopic still, but on an atomic level that is allowed or considered by the causal set? I think that's not precise enough for us to answer. So the idea is that in the causal set sum over history, Set sum over histories, you sum over all causal sets. And if there are other things in the theory, I mean, I think if you want to add other fields and particle trajectories on top of the causal set, for example, then you would sum over all of those two. So I think, I mean, the thing, the sort of thing you have in mind, I'm not sure how to phrase it in this. How to phrase it in this sum over histories language, but essentially, anything that you have a sort of kinematical space of possible histories, which is every absolutely everything that can happen, all the causal sets that can happen, and all decorations on them of whatever sorts of decorations might be needed, fields, particle trajectories, as chains. Chains, sort of linear orders within the causal set, for example, you know, coloured red or something. So you have that, the first thing that you have to do is specify that kinematical space. That's just the set of histories that your sum over histories sums over. I mean, that's part of physics. To discover that is not easy. That's part of physics. It's a sort of rather neglected aspect of physics that, you know, that's part of the struggle of. That's part of the struggle of building a theory, of creating a new theory. So, once you've decided on that, then your sum over histories sums over them all. Each one has an amplitude, and your sum over histories sums over them all. We need to get to the other questions. So, Lucienne, please go ahead. Yeah, hi. So, I think so. This question is primarily to Chaslav, although I think there's a broader question that. Although I think there's a broader question that other people might want to think about as well. So, as you mentioned, Shaslav, I have some work on a quantum equivalence principle as well. And the approaches are similar in spirit, although the main technical difference, I think, is that I have, rather than using a particle to have a reference frame, I use a sort of quantum coordinate system that labels points on a manifold. On a manifold, or provides a way of identifying points between different manifolds. For me, the motivation of thinking about this was to see if you could do something similar to what Einstein did with the equivalence principle. So for Einstein, he described the equivalence principle as the happiest thought of his life, 'cause this is the starting point, uh the conceptual breakthrough that was necessary to get to the theory of uh general relativity. Get to the theory of general relativity. And so, my question is whether you can envisage the quantum Einstein equivalence principle that you outlined as playing a role similar to that. And then the broader question that maybe other members of the panel could weigh in on is: is there some sort of other principles that you can see in this sort of programme? Can see in the sort of programs that you look at that might play a role like the equivalence principle did for constructing general relativity, but instead for constructing a theory of quantum gravity. So there's that sort of sort of, you know, is there some sort of idea that is potentially as powerful as that idea? So maybe just chast that first, because okay. Yeah thanks. And I mean you you you specified actually this road. Specified actually this road to quantum gravity, which I think the principle, some kind of a formulation of quantum equivalence principle, should serve as this kind of basic principle. Okay, so the idea of a equivalence principle is that, well, there is, we have some, locally we can find flat Minkowski or like flatness, let me say. flatness that you say what is the most general um what is the most general structure that is compatible compatible with the fact the space-time is locally flat oh it's a curved spacetime so that that's how i understand you can from the local picture extend to something more interesting and maybe in that way it is a basic principle of general A basic principle of general things. Of course, there is a dynamical part, which I'm not talking now. Now, what it seems that we don't need to stop there because if you can prove the same statement about the flatness of quantum local within the quantum local reference frame, then it means that there is even more than that. More than that, what is the most general quantum structure that is compatible with this? Well, superposition of gravitational fields of space-times. Now, of course, this is easy to say than to say, okay, I give you quantum theory and I give you flatness, local flatness, build me the superposition of quantum space-times. But it seems maybe possible. What is not clear to me is exactly. Not clear to me, it's exactly a point that I, in the opening statement, made, namely, that this may help us to say that the most general structure is superposition of classical space-times. But what if these classicals are not classical and not really classical? They have some fluctuations, which I also don't think is the most fundamental, because otherwise Heisenberg answered to the relation would be the most fundamental thing in quantum theory. But this is the part. Part of that we don't cover right now, and I'm not quite sure how to do it. That's all. Okay, thanks. You asked for other comments from the panel. Is that still relevant? Does anybody else want to say anything? Samadhi, go ahead. Yeah, so perhaps I mean to ask Mr. Perhaps I need to ask Mr. I'm sorry, I can't, I don't know how to pronounce the name, but Zaslav is at the yeah. So I mean, so I'm trying to understand what you mean by a classical superposition of gravity, of space-times, because the only classical superposition that makes sense to me is of linear systems like electromagnetism or Electromagnetism, or you know, of gravity waves because it's a linear system, but it's a classical superposition, it's not a quantum superposition of classical objects. So I'm sure I understand what you mean by this. I'm talking about superposition of classical things. So the best understand, but maybe I state it differently. So it should be superposition of classical space-times, like superposition of. Space-times like superposition of GR solutions, and the best analogue that I can provide is something which I mentioned briefly in the talk: is really if you have a if you think about coherent states in phase space, they are the most classical objects, the minimal wave packets. Now, then two coherent states that are apart from each other in space-time on a distance, the center of this coherence, if it is. Center of this coherence, if it is the distance larger than the double uncertainty of these coherent states, which are kind of spheres in the center, then they are orthogonal. And so what we describe right now is really superposition of these coherent states where we ignore these uncertainties. We treat them as points in the phase space, but nevertheless, we can still treat them as a superposition of these points. And we have to go beyond that. Have to go beyond that eventually, yeah. Sorry, just because in a non-linear theory, you don't have the same ability to do the things that you can in a linear theory. So, I'm just curious what these coherent states really are. These coherent states, in my view, okay, that's very good, because quantum electron dynamics is linear, and so on. These coherent states, in my opinion, would be really full, like whatever the solution. Full, like whatever the solution of GR is, and I will put the cat on that. And now you can say, What does it mean? Well, it means, for example, a field that is produced by some distribution of masses. And then I would say this cat is orthogonal to another cat if I can distinguish them microscopically through the different configurations. Different configuration of space-time. Now, you can ask me how this evolves dynamically. Okay, because GR is a non-linear field. And I would not know how to tell you, except that I would, in each amplitude, evolve like a classical solution of GR, whatever the evolution is. At the end, I will superpose that. This is not a full theory, definitely. But this will cure this non-linearity. Will cure this non-linearity. Okay, Faye, did you want to say something in response to this? I wanted to respond to Lucien's question about the equivalent. Yeah, please go ahead. Try to be brief because we've got two more questions I'd like to get in before we have to close off. Okay, I'll try and be brief. That will make me sound very dogmatic, though. But that's not how I feel. So I don't understand. I don't understand. I mean, I understand the equivalence principle differently. I do understand its role in the development of GR, but I would say that we don't, now that we know what GR is, I would say that the equivalence principle is subsumed in a larger feature of GR, which is that it's Lorentz invariant, that there's local Lorentz invariance, and that space-time is a Lorentzian geometry. In general, I suppose I'm leery of principles. Of principles, and sometimes principles only become clear once in kind of retrospect. So, for me, it's more the guiding ideas that I think lead help me think about different directions in my research. They're more like, I don't know, struggles or dichotomies, and they're several in causal set theory, obviously. In causal set theory. Obviously, there's the discrete continuum dichotomy. Causal sets has come down completely on the side of discreteness fundamentally, although the continuum, of course, must emerge. So there is that struggle. Then there's being versus becoming, which I don't have time to say anything about. But I suppose one thing which I think is really crucial to causal sex in particular is locality versus non-locality. So I said that Lorentz. So I said that Lorentzian geometry is verging on the non-local, even if it's not exactly non-local. It's really very close to being non-local. And going discrete tips it over into being completely non-local. So of course, so causal sets are non-local. Let me just make that bold statement. But we know that the physics we need to recover, general relativity in particular, is local. So causal sets have to be. Causal sets have to be, they have to recover locality whilst being non-local. And that's an enormous, that's something that we bear in mind all the time. And that's a guiding kind of framing thought that's always there when we're thinking about causal sex. That's a great question. Okay, the others have been waiting quite patiently. Max, can you go ahead, please? Can you go ahead, please? Thank you. Yes. I'd like to ask a quick question about matter, in particular, maybe in the causal set approaches, where the motivation is that if you view at the end maybe the causal set as something like a background, you would like to have something on the background to describe some experiment. Or previously, we had this idea of atoms and signaling between atoms. So I would like to hear your take on or what. Take on or what the current status is of including matter on causal sets, and maybe also in particular from the point of view of this causal set growth. So what is the perspective there? You've asked a hard question, and it's related very much to what Faith said about non-locality and the fact that we don't have. And the fact that we don't have tangent spaces sitting at every point in our on the causal set. The tangent space is something that's there and naturally there in a manifold, and it's not naturally there in a causal set. So trying to construct something where you put tensors and vectors and things is very hard, but we do know how to do, talk about scalar fields. And so scalar fields, in fact, there's this entire prescription that came out of. Prescription that came out of looking at how to quantize scalar fields and causal sets, and this SG prescription, which you know, Soken Johnston vacuum, which you're, of course, aware of, and trying to think of quantum field theory itself in a completely different way. So I think as far as scalar fields go, I think there are potentially interesting phenomenological things that you can try to think of on curved backgrounds. Curved backgrounds, but like I said, putting anything more complicated than a scalar field is hard. And the question, of course, is that whether you can go back to the Klutzer-Klein idea of geometry giving rise to gauge fields and so on. And again, I mean, these are ideas that unfortunately, or you know, for good reason, haven't been fleshed out in detail, but they're ideas still that perhaps these are the, at least the directions that one can pursue to see how matters. Can pursue to see how matter can come out. Fame, please fill in. Yep, there's not much to add to that in the brief time. So what somebody said is about Pluto's decline theory is there is a hope, or that's, I don't know what, a possibility that causal sets could be everything and you don't need to decorate them, you don't need to add any other ingredients fundamentally that one can. Ingredients fundamentally that one can get gauge fields from Kalutzaklein reductions, one can get fermions as gravitational geons. And really, there's only one sort of substance, and those are these fundamental units of reality, the causal set elements. That's a possibility. It's not something that, yeah, I mean, yeah, we're not very far along the road to realizing that. Road to realizing that possibility. But then, as somebody says, we can put scalar fields on a causal set background, a la quantum fields in curved space-time. And as far as putting matter into a growth model, yeah, not much has been done about that. Ian Jubb, who is here, has thought about maybe adding particles to a growth model. So, as well as growing a causal set, you have a particle trajectory, which is. Trajectory which is which is growing along with the causal set. So, but I don't think any, I mean, I know he's done some work on it, but I'm not sure that any of that was published. Would you say that it's necessary in order to make contact or in order to attempt these questions that were raised about the indefinite causal order in a causal set framework to have this notion of particles or fields on a causal set, and maybe also to have an. And maybe also to have a nice notion of growth and evolution there. That's a good question: whether we could address these questions within vanilla-flavored causal set theory with no decorations. It's sort of there, you know, as some Matisse says, it's part of the path integral is over all causal sets. So, you know, it includes all different causal structures. Different causal structures in that sense, all different causal orders. So, yeah, whether one to address the kinds of questions that which are slightly different, I think, from that have been discussed at this meeting. It seems like you would have to add things on top of the causal set because to take an operational approach, you need to have some notion of a box or a system that which That which, yeah, the plain causal set with no decorations doesn't most would struggle to accommodate. Okay, I think we're almost, well, we actually are a little bit over time, but Sugato has been waiting very patiently, so I'll have that as the last question. Sugato, please go ahead. So, I actually had two questions: one for Kaslau and one for Faye. Somebody, maybe let me just. Maybe let me just quickly make them brief. So, Kaslav, so I'm trying to understand who does that unitary transformation, the one which is taking to the local inertia. Is it to be understood just as like a mathematical device or like locally, you can take a freely falling lift in the classical case? Or so, can you elaborate on that slide? Yeah, I think it's the same. You can take a freely falling lift if you are freely falling in a If you are freely falling in a superposition of space-time, that's the claim of the principle, and that's what with these quantum reference frames we could show in this regime. You will not know whether you fall freely in a superposition of gravitational fields, so you fall freely in a well-defined, or you are far away from any other star. It's inertial frame. And physically, this will be freely falling. Yeah, right, right, right. And in practice, And in practice, you would do that. So, I mean, so every observer would just jump to its local, I mean, wherever you are, you would jump according to that in your local freely falling deep. Is that you should jump in something very small? Okay, okay, okay, okay, exactly. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Right, okay, thanks. Yeah, yeah, that clarifies. It's the core of the thing, and thanks for the question. And thanks for the question. Exactly. Thanks. And to Fi, I just wanted to ask the relation, so this discrete kind of variable, discrete set that you have data set from which things are, the continuous GR is to emerge. So this is, are you thinking of this in like a RG like philosophy? Like that this discrete That this discrete data set is something like a Planck scale thing, and then GR is coming in a continuum limit. Is that the philosophy here? So roughly, except I wouldn't use the phrase continuum limit. So it's a continuum approximation, just as a fluid description is a continuum approximation to a molecular description. So there's a function Description. So there's a finite number of molecules, but nevertheless, there's a continuum description, a continuum approximation in terms of the fluid. So it's like that. So it's the assumption that is the beginning of the argument that there is a finite amount. You can phrase it in many ways. One is that in a finite region, finite space-time volume, region of finite space-time volume, in a GR space. Time, volume, energy or space-time. That the physical data that underlies that is discrete. It's fine. There's a finite amount of data, finite number of degrees of freedom, if you like, a finite dimensional Hilbert space, if you like. So it's really finite. That's the starting assumption. I mean, one can say, no, my theory of quantum gravity is not like that. It gives me an infinite amount of physics. Infinite amount of physical data from which I can then recover my GR space-time. Then, our argument doesn't apply. If that's the kind of theory that you're contemplating, then the theory doesn't apply to that. It just applies to a theory where you assume that there is a finite amount of physical data underpinning a finite space-time volume, a region of finite space-time. Time volume, a region of finite space-time volume in the recovered continuum. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you. We will have to end here. Let's thank all of the speakers again for their participation in both the panel and their all very interesting presentations.
