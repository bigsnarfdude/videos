I'm really glad to be here. Alright, so we're spending all day proving theorems about graphs. Wouldn't it be great if our theorems applied not only to graphs, but to pretty much everything? I'm going to show you why something like that is true actually. So you have an arbitrary space, some surface, like this one here, and we want to disc. This one here, and we want to discretize it, represent it by a graph. Well, there is an obvious, many obvious ways to do it, but one of them is pick a bunch of points, not too close, not too far, cover your space with points, and then join them if they are nearby to form a graph. So we have translated our space into a graph, and then we want to do graph theorem graph. Do graph theory on graph, but what kind of graph theory should we do? So, for example, I could study the chromatic number, but maybe I'll figure out that my graph has chromatic number two, and you do a similar graph, and it has chromatic number 17. So, I haven't proved anything about the space, only about my choice of graph. That's awful. But there is a kind of graph theory that actually the answers do not depend on your choice of graph, and that this is. And that this is what I'm going to introduce: coarse graph theory that has this property. So, yeah, don't get me wrong, I'm not going to do applied mathematics. The spaces we will apply this theory to include graphs themselves. So, when I said we will apply to everything, including graphs, there are some very interesting things there, a new perspective, even if you're just interested in graphs. All right, so how do we get our machine? Do we get our machinery? How does this theory look like? We're going to borrow a lot of ideas from Gromov's perspective. This is now very standard stuff in geometric topology and group theory. It started in the 80s and it really has had a huge impact. Whole new areas have formed. So Gromov's idea was: we're going to study groups. We think of them as metric spaces. We represent them as scale graphs. Scaly graphs, some graphs already there. Groups give us metric spaces. And then we look at these metric spaces from far away so as to capture the large-scale picture, the important information, and not the local details. All right, so the central notion in this perspective is the notion of quasi-isometry that tells us that two spaces, two metric spaces, for example two graphs, I think of a graph as a metric space with a graph distance. Asymmetric space with a graph distance. So, quasi isometry tells us when two spaces look similar seen from far away. Okay, what is a quasi isometry? I have two metric spaces, x and y, so this is a typo, and I have an arbitrary mapping between them. Not continuous, not injective or anything, arbitrarily mapped. What is a type or? It's kind of air. The age is nonsense. Just two spaces, X and Y, with their metrics. And a map between these two spaces. And this map should somehow respect distances. And this is what this inequality says. The distance in the pre-image should be comparable to the distance in the image. So I'm allowed to expand by a multiplicative constant, and I'm allowed to add or subtract. Allowed to add or subtract an additive error as well. So M for multiplicative error and A for additive error. Right, and then I also want that the image covers pretty much all of the map covers pretty much all of the target space Y. So for every point, so this is X, this is Y. X, this is Y, the map goes this way, and every point here is a bounded distance from some image of F. Maybe it's not in the image, but there will be a point, a distance at most, my additive error there. So it is almost surjective. Subjective after this additive error. All right, let's see some examples. You have R, the real line, and you. And you have the integers in it, both with their Euclidean metric. So, this is the identity from Z into R is a quasi-isometry where the multiplicative error does not exist. M is one and the additive error is one or a half. So, much more interesting example I really Much more interesting example, and really the example showing you that this is a very good notion. Cayley graphs. So this is a Cayley graph of the group z square. The vertices of the graph are just the elements of the group, and an edge means multiplication with a generated. Do we remember when you press start or record? Record? I've pressed record. You did? Just make sure because people want to hear that. I just wanted to make sure. Right, so the vertices are the elements of the group, and I have chosen generators, the standard ones in this case. And edge means multiplication with the generator. Now I could choose a different, I could expand or alter my generating set. I could also add this generator, and then I would get this edge. These edges as well. And I could add the generator 117, and I would get some very long edges. But all this, no matter how I choose the genetic set, the Cayley graphs, these graphs I get are quasi isometric to each other. You can take the identity map, and then in this new graph, This new graph, the multiplicative constant is about 17, a bit more, but they are really similar. Seen from far away, they are the same. So that's already great for the group theories. If you represent a group by a graph, the cho you don't want the choice of generators to matter. You want to prove theorems that but if they hold for one graph, they hold for any graph quasisometric to it. Quasisometric to it. Okay, now back to our starting point. There is a way to discretize any metric space that is invariant of the quasi-isometry, that really the choices don't matter. And such a way is as follows. So this is X, my space. I pick this set of points. Of points and discrete subset of X with the property that my points are well separated. I choose some error R, some real number. I want all my points to be this far from each other, and I And I want them to cover more or less the whole space. So for every other point, so any other point that I didn't choose is within distance r from my set, from some point in the set. And then I form a giraffe. And then I form a graph on this set U, where I connect to points if and only if their distance is at most 3R, say the constant is not too important. I could put 17 there, but I cannot put 3 halves. So the theorem is. So, the theorem is for observation: whatever space you start with, if you construct a graph this way, it's going to be quasi-isometric to the original space. And therefore, because quasi-isometry is an equivalence relation, if somebody else chooses another set of points like this and forms a different graph, the two graphs will be quasi-isometric to each other. They will be equivalent. Each other. They will be equivalent from the point of view of course graph theory. Any questions so far? Is the minimum constant difficult? I'm not sure. I did this exercise long ago. Maybe anything better, larger than two would do, but three definitely is fine. All right, now so we So we can represent, this is good news already, we can represent any metric space with a graph. So graphs have the power to represent anything in the world of metric space. This is really huge generality. And if you prove theorems that do not depend on the, you know, are invariant on the quasi-symmetry on graphs, you have proved something about metric spaces. So what kind of questions could we study? So, what kind of questions could we study on graphs then that are invariant under quasi-isometry? This is a variant of colouring, of graph coloring. It's actually coloring, but not proper coloring, coloring with a metric flavor. It was introduced by Gromov in a slightly different formulation. A graph or space has a symptomic dimension at most some number k if it can be colored with k plus 1 colors. Such that each monochromatic R near component, I will explain, has a bounded diameter, bound depending on R. So when I say R near component, I mean two points, two vertices are in the same R near component, if I can reach them by jumps of length of motion. them by jumps of length of most R paths of length of most R. Is that clear? So you have a bunch of vertices but you can reach all of them from each other with jumps of length at most R. And if it is monochromatic, it it needs to have bounded diameter. All right. So All right. So, for example, let me prove to you that the plane has asymptotic dimension at most two. I need to provide such a coloring, and I do it in the I do the standard brick wall pattern. And then I color with three colors like that. So each brick here has the points in this brick have the same colour, and whatever R you give me, I can specify a larger maybe F of R so that the monochromatic R near components. In this example, it is just components, the monochromatic components have bounded diameter. And as you increase your R, I can also increase the width of my. I can also increase the width of my bricks and make it happen. All right, so the plane has asymptotic dimension 2, and then we can ask about all planar graphs. And this is actually the equation that started it all in this paper by Fujibara and Papazovnu. They proved the four-color theorem, the coarse four-color theorem. Every lanar graph can be colored with four colors. Four colours. Just have a question. That way you run. You want the K colour. You tell me R before you do the K colour, the K plus one colour? You don't want the K plus one colour that works for all choices of R? So K, the number of colors is fixed, and for every R, there is a bound on the diameter f of R so that I can color. So that the colouring depends on R. I could answer there's a K plus one coloring, such that for every R, everything of radius does. Everything in previous diamond the R job graph is probably down No, we are considering R Arnier components. So when R is huge, these two guys become the same Rnier component. If I fix the colouring and increase R, components will start joining up. Yeah, they do. So everything will be joined, all the red ones will be joined. Yeah. This is the difference. So as you increase. So as you increase R I really have to increase besides to push this would push away monochromatic stuff from each other. All right, so this paper proves the coarse four color theorem. Any planar graph can be colored with at most four colors for every R, but it's not optimal, they conjectured, and some people in the audience. People in the audience with co-authors in this great paper proved the optimal that you can do it actually with three colors. Every planar graph is coarsely three colorable. This is a deep result. And it's not, the proof is not, it's interesting both in the geometry aspect and graph theoretic aspect. So you have three widths in there, it's really substantial structural graph theorem there. Good. Good. And many, more, many, many more results. All right, now, why do we care about asymptotic dimensions? So, Gromov introduced it as a coarse analog of the classical topological dimension. It really generalizes a classical notion of dimension. And it's also very consequential. So, this is a spectacular application of asymptotic dimension. If you have any group whose Kaylee graphs Group whose scale graphs have finite asymptotic dimension, then your group satisfies the biggest conjecture, biggest open conjecture about groups. I cannot even tell you what it says. None of us probably would understand the statement, but the point is just bounding the asymptotic dimension, but by coloring, you can prove the conjecture. I mean, for those there are groups that do not. There are groups that do not have infinite asymptotic dimension, actually. Any group that embeds expander graphs has infinite asymptotic dimension, as Gromov proved, and constructed actually such groups. But yeah, this is really very nice. It shows that the notion is very consequential. Okay, there is something of a similar flavor in combinatorics. If a graph embeds into L1 with bounded multiplicative. With bounded multiplicative distortion, then a version of the Max Flow Min-Cut theorem for multi-commodity flows holds. And there is a very well-known conjecture, a really lovely problem, whether every planar graph satisfies this, whether every planar graph embeds in the L1 with bounded distortion. All right, a very nice result because for Auto. A very nice result because for outer planar it's true. Right, so this has a similar flavor. I have some problem on my group or graph. I embed the object I'm interested in into something nicer that has very nice geometry, where I can do algebra, like Hilbert space or L1. Then it tells me something about my other project. Good. So here I learned something I want to. Here, I learned something. I want to mention something I learned from James here. If you have a hereditary graph class with bounded asymptotic dimension that forbids an induced Berlin graph, then your family is chi-bounded. I'm not really an expert in coloring, but I find this fascinating. This application of coarse coloring of asymptotic dimension to graph coloring. To graph colouring. All right, so yeah, I've told you how to phrase one notion of graph theory, coloring, in a coarsed language. We translate from coloring to asymptotic dimension. Now, if we go back to Gromov's, where all this started, where Gromov introduced this asymptotic dimension, that's almost 200 pages where many, many notions have been given code. Many, many notions have been given coarse analogues, like simple connectedness, homology, and so on. So we have done it successfully with one notion, with coloring. We can imitate and try to translate all our notions in a coarse language, or at least some of them. So, yeah, let's try to do the same with other graph theoretic notions. Okay, so I said this was 200 pages. So I said this was 200 pages, and Gromov makes this statement about it: that there are no theorems, just I'm using problems. This is probably an understatement, but anyway, I can claim the same. And in that respect, I think we have improved over growth. All right, so what other notions can we translate to the course setup? The next notion that Yeah, it's very elementary, very well studied. Graph minus. Let's look for a course analog of graph minus. And yeah, this can be defined as follows. What is a standard graph minor? You have branch sets, so connected sets of vertices, connected subgraphs, and edges crossing. So this is a model. Government problem. So, this is a model of a K4 minor and some bigger graph. And now I define a FAT RFAT minor the same way, except I want any two branch sets to be distance at least R. So this distance is at least R. So in particular, this cannot be an edge anymore. This has to be a longer path of length at least R. R. And I don't just want branch sets to be far apart. I want this path to be r far from that path. This distance is also at least r. If I find this abstraction, I say that k4 is an alpha minor of my original graph. So yeah, so everything, any two sets are I call them, by the way, these branch paths. So any two branch sets or branch paths are distance at least are, except of course for the obvious restriction that this branch path needs to be distance zero from its incident paths. Okay, so this is the definition. Can we prove something about it? And yes, this is a simple thing we can prove that parallels a classical Parallels a classical graph theoretic statement. We know that a graph is a forest if and only if it has no K3 minor, no cycle as a minor. Now we're going to generalize it. We'll prove that G is quasi-isometric. Remember my quasi-isometry I defined at the beginning, is quasi-isometric to a forest if and only if it does not have a fat K3 minor or does not have any. Minor or does not have an asymptotic K3 minor, asymptotic having something as an asymptotic. I have a graph as an asymptotic minor if I have it as a non-fat minor for every arm, arbitrarily large. Alright, so this is something I would like to sketch the proof of. So this only makes sense quickly then. In this formulation, yes, yeah, thank you, thank you for asking this. Everything I say makes sense for both finite and infinite graphs, but if it's finite it needs to be a family of graphs. Finite, it needs to be a family of graphs. It does not make sense to consider a single finite graph because it's quasi-sometric to a point. Make the additive error equal to the diameter of your finite graph. But if you have a growing sequence of graphs, everything makes sense. And all the techniques, all the proofs do not care really if if you're talking about a sequence of finite graphs or an infinite graph or a more general space. The proof can be copied verbative usually. So, yes, throughout this proof, think of G either as an infinite graph or as an element in a sequence of larger and larger graphs. And we want to prove this with uniform constants. So I'm going to sketch one direction, namely that if you don't have an asymptotic K3 minor, then you're quasiymetric to a tree. So we have our large graph. We pick an origin, an arbitrary vertex, and we layer the graph according to the distance from the origin. So in the first layer, I have the graph. So the in the first layer I have the neighbors of the of the origin, then I have the vertices at distance two, distance three, and so on. And my first claim is so I'm going to be looking at the the R near components or the K near components. Components within each layer. Within each layer, I consider the set, I decompose it into its near components. So remember, these are vertices that I can reach each other with little jumps, bounded size. The size depends on the R. Let's say it's 10 times R. All right, so flame one within each layer Each such component has uniformly bounded diameter. So there is a bound of the diameter that does not depend on the height or on the graph, only depends on this R, in my assumption. The whole graph metric, yeah. I'm not restricting the metric here. That's a good point. I'm considering that the metric. I'm considering that the metric inherited by the whole graph. All right, let's prove this. So if it's false, then there is some really huge, very large diameter k-near components. So this is huge. So we can pick two points that are really far from each other. Okay, now from these points that are really far from each other, let's draw straight paths to the origin. Geodesics. My construction that's possible, like in the picture, everybody here has a neighbor downstairs and so on, and I can reach the origin with the geodesic. Alright, now this already starts looking like a fat cycle. You know, these two points are far away, this is far. If this is not far, if this is close, Far, if this is close, it cannot happen because we are within bounded distance from the origin. Everything is within bounded distance from the origin, so it only becomes interesting when you are really far away. All right, now, how do I form my FAT K3? It's is here. I take an initial part of this geodesic and an initial part of that geodesic. The initial part of that geodesic of length about of order r or some constant times r. So these were really far apart. I was assuming, you know, the diameter is huge, it's a million r. So this is really far, and this is 10 r. So these guys are far away, they're good candidates for branch sets. And I need one more branch set, and I can get it somewhere in the middle here. Or I could even go down here. Or I could even go down here. There are many places where I could get. And then I could also get some paths, branch paths. This would be a branch path. So these two guys might meet at some point. This is the more general picture. This is a branch path, and I can have two other branch paths up there. So this completes claim one. And my second and final claim is by collapsing each such component, such a box. For a vertex, we obtain a tree. In other words, if you think of these boxes as vertices, the graph you see here is a tree. Now, how could Now, how could that fail? It can only fail if somebody in a layer sends edges to at least two guys in the layer below. Right, you see this? If everybody only sends one edge down, then we see a tree here, r rooted here, and you know, grows like that. But yeah, this is the only obstruction from a tree. This is the only abstraction from a tree. Oh, I should mention here, this is not possible because these are distinct k-near components, but in particular, they are distance at least this constant from each other. No direct edges. All right. And all edges go between subsequent layers. There are, of course, no jumps because these are the distant layers. Okay, now, what if we see this picture? Okay, now what if we see this picture happen? We find a fat cycle, a fat K3. We're going to play a similar game with before. So this this could go also up, but then you will eventually reach something like this up there, right? Later layers, right? Yeah, I made it simply like whenever I you look at a component in some layer, it has only one neighbor downstairs. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's actually a graph neighbour or a distant side neighbor? Sorry? That's actually a graph neighbour or a distant side job. That's a graph neighbor. That's a graph neighbor. Alright. So what do I do in this case? I'm claiming so first of all, these two vertices and therefore these two vertices are far apart about this part. Are far apart, about this far. Otherwise, these two guys would be one component. They're far away, and so there is a long path. There is a long path here for lecting frames that I cannot shorten. And I'm claiming I can actually choose this path to avoid whatever is downstairs, to stay in the layers above. In the layers above. And then again, I take such a geodesic and such a geodesic, and I'm going to find similarly a FAT K3. It's very similar. Again, I will pick an initial part of this path and of this path, a branch edge, branch path like that. Transpath like that. Here is a little bit tricky. If this blue path was straight, I could say, okay, just pick the middle part, and this would be my FAT K3. But this path could be terribly wiggly. And so I need a trick there. I need to somehow find something in the middle. And from there, rather than using my blue path, I need to. Rather than using my blue path, I need to draw a straight geodesic, draw another geodesic pair, and you know, there are some details there, but it works. This proves that nobody sends two edges down, and therefore, my claim is true: that if I collapse each component to the vertex, I get a tree. And then, the quasi-geometry construct is the obvious thing: the tree. Construct is the obvious thing. The tree is that tree, and I map every vertex here to that node of my tree. This is bounded error because of claim one, or this is bounded diameter. So, yeah, by mapping all those vertices to this vertex of my tree, I'm fine. I'm doing an additive error. Check. Any questions? All right, we have proved a theorem that parallels graph fundamental graph theoretic result. If you avoid K3 as a minor, your quasi isometric to something that has no K3, that is a forest. And yeah, obviously we would like to generalize it. What if I replace K3 with any fixed finite graph? This is This is a very natural question, having seen this, and we conjectured it in our paper. So, for every finite graph H, if your space, which could be a metric space, an infinite graph, a sequence of finite graphs, whatever, doesn't really matter, if your space does not have H as an asymptotic minor, so arbitrarily large copies of H as fat minors, then it is quasi symmetric. Then it is quasiometric to a graph, avoiding that minor in good old graph theory terms. Right, so yeah, natural conjecture to make given the previous result and proof. Unfortunately, it's false. More on that in a couple of slides. So okay, we we were trying to to to build up some machinery to study this. So what machinery do we use for graph minors? What machinery do we use for graph minors? Let's try to build some simple tools. And we thought the simplest tool in graph theory is Menger's theorem. So let's try to reformulate it in geometric language. We came up with this formulation. Let me draw a picture. What does classical Menger say? You have two sets of vertices in a graph, then either you can find many paths, many disjoint paths connecting them, or an obvious reason why this is not possible, namely a cut consisting of fewer vertices. So, how would we rephrase this in geometric language? Same statement, except we want this. We want these paths to be not just disjoint but far away, as far as we want. Some constant D. And the obstruction what would the obstruct be? It would be, so if you want three paths, but there is a pair of sets of small diameter, relatively small diameter, that separates the graph. Graph like this, then you are hopeless because if you are looking for three paths, two of them would have to pass through one of these little sites and then there would be small distance between them. So yeah, the obvious thing to consider, to conjecture is that if you don't have this obstruction, then it works, then you can find your paths that are far away from each other. And we were very generous with how large this could be. You know how large this could be. We said, okay, we want this to be distance five, say. What if no two balls of diameter a million separate? Obviously, this should be true, right? We want them to be five apart from each other and no two balls of radius a million or a billion separate. Come on, how can this fail? Well, actually it fails. It's true for two paths. That's a substantial That's a substantial thing to prove, but it fails in general already for if you want three paths and just want them to be distance three apart. Okay, so we made this conjecture independently and almost simultaneously, it was made by Albertson, Huyne, Jacobs, Schnapp and Paul Wollen, who is here, and who also proved the K equals two case. Also, proved the k equals two case, the two path case. And the counterexample is by three people who are here. And this is the counterexample. It's a binary tree that grows for some layers. And then at the bottom, you join the bottom layer with this long path. And you have some extra paths as in the picture. All the dotted paths are really long. And the two sides, S and T. Sides S and T, you're trying to connect, are you know, they both contain this common vertex, and then the rest of S is here and the rest of T there. So it looks like this. And we're trying to find three paths from here to there. So one path is obviously just this point, okay? We want to expand it with two paths. With two paths that stay away from each other and from this point. And well, the graph is three connected, so you can't find three paths. You know, the two paths would go over each other like that. So you can't find these two paths, but the problem is they're near, they're distance two from each other. And you can try to move one path somewhere further away, but you will always have these shortcuts. You cannot avoid this. These shortcuts, you cannot avoid these shortcuts. Okay, now back to the previous conjecture. I said it is false. It was disproved by some people here: James, Freddy, and Rosberg here, and Robert Hickey, Patampo, who is not. And Robert Hitting, who is not. They beat on the previous counterexample. So the graph H, yeah, the counterexample, the graph H is rather large and the space contains a copy of this. And the point is, you know, when trying to find H as a FAD minor, at some point you are trying to find three branch paths going like that. Branch paths going like that, and it's not possible, and yet you cannot find a quasi-ezometry that collapses all this, that avoids stops it being reconnected. Okay. Right, so there are now, you know, the conjectures are false, but this raises more questions than it solves. In particular, we don't know how complicated such an example has to be. Has to be. Could it be that it's true for all planar graphs? Some people here believe not, and I'm not saying, I'm not really that optimistic. It's true, but yeah, we can explore how complicated such an H should be for which graphs are good in this respect, which graphs satisfy the conjecture. Well, we know some very little graphs, and the most complicated graph we know. Complicated graph we know that satisfies the conjecture is K4, and that's Paul's talk after me. But that's the most complicated graph we know satisfies the conjecture. Okay, here is a novel problem yet unpublished. You have a graph H and you just subdivide an H. Take K. Take K4 and subdivide on H. And suppose some other bigger graph or family of graphs, H, does not have the subdivided H prime as a minor. Is it quasi isometric to a graph that doesn't have H as a minor? Yeah, the simplest, I think, question of this form you could ask at the moment. And I'm asking it for a reason. If it's true, If it's true, then it proves that it implies that whether a graph H satisfies the conjecture or not only depends on the topological type of H. So subdivisions and contractions of edges do not affect whether your graph is good. And yeah, this is, I mean, it's really simple. It should be possible to answer one way or the other. And if true, yeah, it would give you. And if true, yeah, it would give something quite nice. Is one of these asymptotic miners? No, no, no asymptotic miners, not asymptotic minus. The only core stuff is here, just plain old miners. Okay, another remaining question really interesting. Another remaining question, really interesting, is: can we get a coarse version of Kuratovsky's theorem? So we know that for some graphs H, the conjecture is false, but what about the Kuratovsky graphs? So this would be great if it's true, because it would characterize the class of graphs quasi-isometric to a planar graph. That's a class interesting on its own. Geometric group theorists are interested in it in particular. So, yeah, it's a very nice class. Graph that are quasi-symmetric to a planar graph. And is it true that, you know, this analog of Kuratovsky? One direction is clear because quasi-zometries preserve asymptotic minors. So a graph that's quasi-sometric to the planar graph cannot have a Kuratovsky asymptotic minor. The other direction is the interesting one. One. Here is something weaker. Suppose, okay, we know that if a graph is planar and you contract some edges, it can only become more planar. Now, what if the graph is quasi-planar, quasi-isymmetrical planar graph, and you contract some edges? It should also only be more quasi-planar. But is it true? So if that's true, it implies this, because contracting edges cannot fatten any minus. If you have a fat Koratovsky graph after contracting, you had it before. Contracting reduces the fatness. So yeah, it's an easier step towards this very interesting thing. It feels obvious somehow. Okay. Okay, uh we could approach the problem from the opposite direction. So the quantifiers there or that you can try on it. With the same I don't insist on that, but you know, I'm happy enough if you can do 2M to A here, but you know, if it deteriorates a little, then maybe it must deteriorate again and again. The most natural way to state this make G is infinite. Make g is infinite and erased, and I just say quasi-symmetric. I've stated this in the open problems on the overly file. Okay, so yeah, why I'm interested in asymptotic minors in this kind of conjecture? We have the graph minor theorem, we know if you have a proper minor. Theorem, we know if you have a proper minor clause class, you can express it in terms of its excluded minors by the Robertson-Simmer theorem. It's finitely many, that's all great. And we do something analogous in the course setup and characterize, describe classes of metric spaces in terms of forbidden asymptotic minus. And so, yeah, I'm starting to think in that direction, this is very preliminary, very trivial. Let's look at a nice class. Look at the nice class. What does NICE mean closed under quasi-isometry, of course? Maybe some more nice properties closed under contractions, edge contractions, maybe. And here is a little observation. If you have such a very nice class, for example, the class of lanar graphs, closed under union, distributed union, minor subdivision okay, subdivision is superfluous. Okay, subdivisions is super fluid. Yeah. A subdivision, sorry, subdivisions, not contraction. Close under subdivisions, that's true for planar graphs. And then consider the graphs quasi-zometric to those. And suppose that this class, let's say the quasi-planar graphs, are nice enough that you can describe them in terms of forbidden asymptotic minus. Minus. So let's assume, okay, the class of quasi-planar graphs. The graph is quasi-planar if and only if it doesn't have an asymptotic k5, k3, 3, or these other five graphs. Suppose you can prove that there is a set X of obstructions, asymptotic obstructions. Then actually this set X must be K five and K three three. I think I should erase this. So in the special case, if we can prove that quasi-planar curves are characterized by several forbidden asymptotic minors, then these asymptotic minors must be K5 and K33. Yeah, I'm stating this here. All right. What how else can we try to save our false conjectures? We know, you know, the counterexample, both here and there, the smallest value of R where it fails is 3. And one can prove that actually, if it worked for 3, 3 is a very important value. So if a space does not have a 3 fat K5 minor, then it's quasi-isometric. Sorry, the other way around. If a space does not have a 17-fat K5 minor, it's quasi-isometric to something that doesn't have a 3-FAT K5 minor. But you cannot reduce from 3 to 2. The ideas take powers of the graph. Powers reduce the fatness from 17. The fatness from 17 down to 3, but cannot reduce it anymore. So, both questions remain open when r equals 2. r is the distance I want my paths to be here. So, in other words, induced paths, anti-complete paths, or the fatness. I'm forbidding the fatness of a minor, I'm forbidding. I'm forbidding. So, yeah, this is open. There is important progress though for bounded degree graphs. It has been in the course Manger has been proved by Henry, Sergey, Hussier, Steiner, and Turkot, and independently by Carlin Orhon and Lochstanff. How else can we try to save the conjectures? We can restrict X for X. For example, I don't know whether the cost manga is true for planar graphs. This question, whether the host graph is planar, is it true? Sounds much more believable. Okay, here is another way we can try to say cost measure. So, what does it say again? Either there are many paths far apart. Many paths far apart from each other, or little balls that meet all the paths. Okay, so we have translated some of the graph theoretic language in a geometric language. We are talking about distances, but maybe we have forgotten to translate all words from graphs to geometry. What if we replace paths with quasi-geodesics? So, this is not just a place. So, this is not just playing with words. So, what's the problem? When you are trying to prove something about cost about minors, a problem is that when you contract an edge, you reduce distances. When you delete one, you increase distances. So, when you are trying to do induction on edges, for example, everything fails. And so, okay, here we said deleting the Deleting two small sets does not separate, but maybe it destroys the geometry too much. So maybe we should relax what we're asking for and say deleting two small sets not only does not separate, but it does not change distances too much. You can still find a path that's maybe not as short as before, as the shortest path before, but you lose up to some. Shortest path before, but you lose up to some constant. So, here, for example, if you delete this one set of small, very small diameter, even zero diameter, all distances explode. Before I had this very short path from S to T, and if I remove this ball, everything becomes far apart. And I have some ideas, you know. Have some ideas how one could actually try to prove this. Okay, so okay, we have a slide. Yeah. So the radius L should be the same as the L positive? Okay, it would be more natural maybe to change it to a different constant, but the point is. Uh the point is maybe the radius should depend on the the how it was the most the point is if you're very generous with one of the constants then you you may as well take them to be equal. Yes. Okay, it's like here is like the constant the constant in the definition of quasi-isometry. So I'm allowed to expand distances by a factor of L. Expand distances by a factor of L and maybe also by an additive L. You mentioned doing course manager for plane address with R equals 2 I don't know if it's not possible. Yeah, I think it's not. Okay. So you just take many disjoint paths and not too many pairs of them can have edges between them. Is that what you're doing? I think that's I don't know our theorem. Okay, so we coursified some of some notions, minors, manger. We could try to do the same with anything related to graphics. So, you know, what is sitting here? So, you know, while sitting here in this workshop, for example, whenever somebody presents something, I say, Oh, is there a geometric version? And you can do it, you know, with many other notions. An example is the COP number. I posed this in the open problems. You can define it just like the classical COP number, but now both COPS and Trover can jump up to distance K in one step w when they are on the move. When they are on the move. And so suppose you have some bound of the Koch number for some kind of space, like trees, planar graphs. And suppose that you look at a graph which is quasi-isometric to such a space where you know the cop number. Like we know that planar graphs have cop number at most three. What if you're quasi-isometric to a planar graph? Then I'm conjecturing that if you increase k in. If you increase k enough compared to these constants, then still three cups suffice. I asked it for trees and some people here said they have a positive answer, so we can be optimistic. Was there news on this one as well? Finettable. Sorry? Finettable. You know how to p do a bounded number. A bounded number. Okay. Yeah, three may be too optimistic. Okay. Good. Alright, you can go on and try to translate other parts of graph theory in the coarse language. For example, what does it mean for a space to be coarsely K-connected? You would want to do something like this, maybe not just K-points separate. Just k points separate, but how many balls you need to separate. It's not clear how to do it. And perhaps a course analog of tangles could do this. It sounds very promising, just take the definition of tangle and say now we don't remove k vertices, we remove k balls and repeat the rest of the definition. Does it give us a helpful theory? Does it give us a helpful theory? And does it come hand in hand with an analogous theory of coarse 3 decompositions? You can also talk about coarse separator theorems like Lippen-Tarjan style. I have some idea there. You can ask me later if you want. Coarse digraphs, I think nobody has touched the question yet. It may be worth it because Cayley graphs are actually digraphs. Actually, digraphs. So, maybe if you prove something new there, it would be interesting to the geometric group theorists. All right, thank you very much. Yes, so let's say you have a space that doesn't have a space. That has a forbidden asymptotic minor, no asymptotic K5, then whenever there is a constant K such that for each cover of your space with balls of diameter this K, you cover your space with little balls of this diameter, and you consider the intersection graph of these balls, then it satisfies Lippen-Targent. You can find a small separator. Small separator in the size of the in the number of these bolts and you need to play with K, otherwise you can take and expand it, you know, cover it with K. Yeah, maybe I will organize my thoughts. That kind of might be more sensitive to how you choose to cover. So yeah, the conjecture. So, yeah, the conjecture would be case-only sensitive to the quasi-zometric constants. Maybe the right way to phrase it is, oh, sorry, yeah, no, forget about asymptotic minors. You have a quasi-linear graph, say, something quasi-zometric to a graph from a family where we have little larger. Then, can you find a constant k depending on the quasi-zometric constant? So with course there's a multiplicative error and an additive error. And uh for these theorems, for the sort of easy cases of your fat minor conjecture, you don't need any multiplicative error. You can do that. That's right, we know that for some very simple graphs, you don't even need, for example, in the in the theorem I proved about quasi-trees, the proof I sketched here, you don't need the multiplicative error, you can make it one. Error, you can make it one. Yeah. Do we really need multiplicative error in the definition of quasi-omic cosmology? Maybe we'll get some insight from all stock later. I don't know an example where we need it. Will you KD graphs, for instance? Do they really need the multi-print? So the volcanic graphs? They do need the multiplicative. It's false without the data. They don't need the additive. It's false without the multi-print? So what would be the statement? The statement whether two Kaylee graphs have bounded additive distortion. Yeah, it's false. Just the. So it's weird that it works for graphs. Is it just a bounded graph? Or maybe these are just two small graphs. Okay, so now, probably inadvertently, we have an extra long break in which we can prove some of these ugly conjectures. I mean, I'll be conjecture since then. That's fine.
