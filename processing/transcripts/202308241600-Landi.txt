Should I start from the beginning? Okay, I will just re-thank the organizers for rearing me here. Okay. Okay, I can go. And so, this is some work that I'm doing with Paolo and Chiara Pagani. Kierapagani. And the alternative title was an ITIA sequence for braided Lie algebras. So a lot of the first part will resonate with the first part of Larisa, where all this construction will get twisted or braided by some R matrix. So the okay. Okay, so no. This one. So a suitable class of gauge transformation. And the point is that to make them act on connections. So there has been in the past a lot of work on gauge transformation here and there, but here there are some natural structures, in particular a natural way to construct connections and Connections and then classes of gauge transformation with an explicit action. To get the bigger classes of these objects, we tried braiding them via a triangular structure. I'll tell you later what is a triangular structure. And so the sequence of bred algebra, whose splitting will be a connection. So it's slightly different from what Flarisa was. Different from what Flarisa was doing before. And if you, so there will be two classes of examples. One will be a family of instantons, like self-duality, self-dual connections on a four-sphere, or a theta four sphere. And then another class is via some sort of soldering of the sequence to the Sequence to the analog of tangent band, this will lead to a very nice way to construct a Levy-Shivita connection on this theta sphere. Here is a little bit in the future. One can construct a V large branch-v lomomorphism and then chem simon terms. One of the dreams is that one would up Is that one would upgrade this to cyclic homology, but this won't be here today. And maybe part of this could be put in a op-algebraid version. This will be the dual of the gauge groupoid, which is associated to a principal bundle. So you just dualize many of the structures, and so one can construct a bio. And so, one can construct a bisection of this of algebra. And these are a way to talk about gauge transformation. So, like it happens classically, there is a group isomorphism between gauge transformation and bisections. Okay, so the classical sequence, just to say what I'm talking about here. So, you have a principal bundle and then you have a sequence of groups. And then you have a sequence of groups, automorphisms, automorphisms. And you see, my hand shakes a lot, so I will just do something else. So there is at the level of groups, we have the automorphisms of the bundle, the automorphism and vertical ones, so the one which are the identity over the base, and they cover the diffeomorphisms. At the level of derivations, we have vector fields on the base. On the base, equivariant vector fields on the total space of the bundle, and vertical and equivariant vector fields. This will be infinitesimal gauge transformation. I will show later how do they act on a connection. And the connection is a way to split this sequence. So to lift the vector fields. So you just lift the vector fields, and this is a way to give a connection. Connection. Now we want to do it dually and because we want to get rid of the commutativity of the functions. So now I start with an off algebra H. This will be the analog of the structure group, the dual version. Then I have an algebra A. This will be the algebra of function on the total space of the bundle. And there is now a co-action of H on A. Of H on A, the dual of an action, which is written in that Swedler notation, which is very, very convenient. And the sub-algebra of co-invariance, this will be the algebra of functions over the base. So the inclusion B into A is a candidate for a principal structure, but you need, of course, some principality condition. And the principality condition at this level is expressed. Condition on this level is expressed by the fact that you have an isomorphism between the fibrid product and then the algebra and H. And so it's written explicitly like this. So you ask that this is an isomorphism. So if H is the function over a group, A are the function over the total space, and B are the function over the Bayes space, this is the dual version of asking that the or action. Of asking that the or action is principal, free transitive over on the fiber. So, this is really a very natural way to dualize this thing. So, in this context, I also wanted to dualize the notion of gauge transformation. So, classically, there are at least two ways to give the group of gauge transformations. The group of gauge transformation. So, these will be maps from the total space of the bundle into your group, which are equivariant, which are equivariant for the adjoint action of the group on itself. Or you may take algebra, algebra, sorry, bundle maps, so which preserve the which are equivariant with respect to the action of your group G. So, you have a right action of the group G on P. Of the group G on P, and they preserve the base, so this will be the vertical, the vertical one. And here is the way to dualize them. This is still classical and it's written in a way that can be generalized to the case in which the algebra are not commutative. So A is a function over P, B are function over the quotient space, H is functions over G. H is functions over G. And then dually, you may think of these gauge transformational maps from H into A. So you have to invert the arrow. Before you were going from P into the group, now you have to invert the arrow. And here is a way to give the equivariance the condition that they are equivariant. Delta V, you remember this was the coaction of H on the, so the action, let's say, of the structure. So, the action, let's say, of the structure group on the total space of the bundle, and add is the action of the group on itself, the adjoint action. Or similarly, one can construct algebra, one can give them as an algebra map from A into A with the same kind of equivariance, but now we are just going from A into A, so you have to use twice the coaxial and then the identity of. And then the identity over the base, because again, these are vertical objects. So the non-commutative case is really formally the same. So B into A is a, well, fractively flat is a technical condition. Of Galois extension, then you take all the automorphism of the bundle. So you need an algebra maps which are equivalent. Equivalent. And if you ask them to be algebra map, they are automatically invertible. And this is the inverse. You can really construct automatically the inverse. Brzezinski versus Saskeri Pagani is that it's not clear yet what is the right version of this thing because you may, if you ask them to be algebra map, then you may. map then you may lose part of them algebra map in a non-commutative version is a bit uh complicated you may get too little uh of a set which is little martinetis hoping but was it pierre martinetis hoping there was it Was he talking to us or to somebody? Okay, so he was he was so this is Pierre Pierre Phantom that is looking a ghost. You have a ghost. Oh ship, I hear a ghost. On the other hand, you may uh you may ask, so you don't need to ask that they are invertible if they are algebra map, they are automatically invertible. They are automatically invertible. On the other hand, you may ask that they are invertible without asking them to be algebra map. That's what Thomas did. But then you get a huge thing. It's too much. It's too big. So you need something in the between. So too big versus too small. So you need something in between. By the way, before I just give you more details, there is a bunch of examples. That these things that I'm saying can be applied. The mono bundle over the quantum SU2 or the SU2 bundle over S4 theta, so this instanton bundle, all these orthogonal bundles over the even theta sphere, and there are some other examples for the Q geometry. For the Q geometry, for instance, projective spaces. So we want to get something which is, instead of being a group, an opalgebra. So instead of having a group of gauge transformation, an opalgebra of gauge transformation. But the group is infinite-dimensional. So function over an infinite dimensional group, it's of course a complicated object. It may be easier to go from an automorphism to derivative. From automorphisms to derivation, so infinitesimal gauge transformations rather than the full group. And so that's what I want to talk about. And in particular, starting from an Atea sequence of Brady-Dele algebra of derivation, which would be the Braded analog at the very beginning. So the analog of this sequence here, which is This sequence here, which is associated to any principal. So, I will, like I said, I will just show you that these are gauge transformations, but you may think of them as equivariant maps, which now go into the Lie algebra of the structure group. And so, which are equivariant now with respect to the action of the group G on its Lie algebra. And then, of course, this is a Lie algebra by. This is a Lie algebra by pointwise, like since the outPG is a group, this is Lie algebra. Okay, so the braiding. The bredding is done by asking that the construction is equivariant with respect to an external if you want symmetry. So there is k, which is an op algebra. K, which is an off-algebra, and we look for of Galois extensions. H is the structure of algebra, okay? Then we have another algebra, another of algebra, K, which acts on this sequence. So there is an action on A and it does not disturb H. And so that's the compatibility between the two the action of K and The action of k and the coaction of h. The coaxial is expressed into the zero one. I was using the Swidler notation to write down the coax. So that object is really the coax of K of A. And here is just K of the coax on A. Okay? So, and okay, so in general, so K is. So, K is quasi-triangular if there exists a universal R matrix which has a few properties. So, first of all, the coproduct on, this is on K is just gets the coproduct, the opposite co-product that's related to the previous one by this matrix R. This is the inverse. And there are some. And there are some requirements on these magnitudes. For instance, there is this requirement here which make sense so that you have a good representation theory. And in fact, this also implies that your R is a solution of the quantum Yanbacher equation. So this object, of course, is a very important object and there's a lot of nice property. The particular case in which the inverse is just the flip of R, you Of R, you call it the triangular. And I'll mention why triangular plays a role here. And I will use this notation. So R is an element in K. So there is one leg and there is a second leg. Okay, so this is the first leg and this is the second leg. Now, you want to make sense of Brady-De-Lis algebra. I told you Brady-De-Lis algebras of derivatives. De Lie algebras of derivations. So a Brad de Lie algebra will be just K module G, I mean a space which carries an action of K, and there is a bilinear map, which is equivariant. Okay. So again, now K1 and K2 is just the breaking of the coproduct on K into pieces. So then you represent K on the bracket, and then you want to. on the on the bracket and then you ask this this is equivariance it's bred anti-symmetric i mean larissa this morning she also also also was flipping things by the degree you were writing minus one to the here the flipping is done with respect to the r matrix and then break the jacobi identity which is a nice way to say that you have a derivation of the bracket anytime you pass through you Anytime you pass through, you need to put an extra R. The problem is that if K is a quasi-triangular, this is complicated. It's really complicated to work out, at least it's not so easy. So that's why you need to, well, one way out is to restrict K to B triangle. If K is triangular, then this is a very nice. That is a very nice theory. So, you have a theory of bred Lie algebras. The class of examples for triangular is not empty, like I show you in a moment. First of all, it comprises all these Atita examples and also these Jordanian twists, which have been used in theories on the quantum spaces. On the quantum spaces, they are triangle. Okay, so I have now a K equivariant of Galois extension. Kr is triangular. So I take all braided derivations. Again, when I just want to take a derivative here, U is just the Leibniz rule up to R. I mean, when you flip. R. I mean, when you flip things, I'm going through. U is going through A. So the little price to pay is that you have to put an R, R R. In fact, this is R inverse, this is the way I'm writing here. So these are the and these are the derivations. You ask them to be equivariant. You remember that I wrote the equivariance for F. I'm writing. The equivariance for f, I'm writing here the equivalence for a derivation, so it's a map, and and then you have those which are vertical. Those which are vertical are the ones that kill B. B was the base space algebra. It's a sub-algebra of the total space algebra. So, when you just restrict these things to B, you get zero. So, this will be 30. And And so here is what I will call an ATIA sequence of Bredo de Riageo, and then I will tell what is up there. So the derivations are told you already. The vertical derivations are told you already. Now these are equivariant. So they restrict to derivation over the derivation on the subalgebra. The derivation on the sub-algebra on the sub-algebra B. That's exactly what I was writing here. So the equivalent and the braided and equivariant, the vertical ones. And then since this is H equivariant, you restrict them to the sub-algebra. So this is the sequence. In general, this sequence is not exact. So it's not exact at this level. Is not exact at this level. This is clearly a sub-algebra, and there is a projection up here. But it's clear at this level, it is not necessarily exact. So, there are one has to work out if when it's exact or when it's not exact and then do something. So, let me just tell you the general schema, which also will resonate with some Lee Reinhardt pair that we're mentioning in the first. At one in the first day. So KR is a triangle of algebra. So you get, we want an SAT sequence of K Brederdeli algebras, GPT. I mean, the notation is a little bit awkward, but for some reason. B was then the algebra function over the base. So we ask that B T is a Bradley-Reinhardt pair. So this means that. So, this means that the t acts as the breadth of the derivations over b, and for what this world you can identify t with the breadth of the derivation, at least for this talk. But then, t is a b module, so you can multiply the relation with the functions, and then there are compatibility between the two. Between the two fractions. So the derivation. So if you act on a product, you get a braided derivation. And then, I mean, if you are just acting with the module structure, here you just have to pass through. I mean, X or B is okay, and then you have to pass through. So, from what I'm saying, a connection of A connection on this sequence is just a splitting. A splitting, so it's a B-module map. So it's a way to lift vector field over the base to vector field over the total space. I will give you explicit examples of this lift. So it's a way to split the sequence. So from So, from t to p, and then you go back to the identity when you compose with pi. There is also a vertical projection, so you're going from p into the g, which is one minus one minus, you project down and you go up again. And so, this will be the vertical here. The curvature is just the amount by which rho of omega. Rho of omega fail to be Brady-Deli algebra morphism. So, in general, if you just take the commutator, the Brade of the Commutator, and you lift it, and then you just take the commutator of the commutator of the lift. There is no reason why this is zero. In fact, it's not zero when the structure is non-trivial. So, you have a non-trivial curvature. You may think of it as a A thing of it as a g value departed two form on t and you can also write and I will call it basic basis because because it's yeah it's zero and there is any entries is uh is vertical so this is the basic but there is also what I call a special curvature I did not invent the name I read it in a paper by Teleman well basically Well, basically, I could have come up with, but I don't know why I call it special. So I said, okay, let's go just to distinguish. So you can think of it as now a two-form, which is on the total space algebra. Again, it has values in the Lie algebra G. It's nice because you get a structured regression. So, pretty much like it happens classically, you have an exterior. You have an exterior derivative, just you have to be careful when you pass through. You have a common letter one formula. I won't write down the details, okay? But it needs actually a little bit of thinking how to define this object, and then you get this thing. Okay, there is Bianca identity, there is not a Bianca identity. So is a Bianca will be. A beanged end will be that object on the left-hand side is equal to zero. In general, this is not true. In general, you get something on the right-hand side, which is really the sum of two commutators. So classically, these two commutators are individually zero. Now they are not individually zero. You may think that they combine, but that's not the case in general. So you need Case in general, so you need another, you need a third things to do some kind of Jagobi identity. Jagobi identity is there. We have Jagobi identity for the bracket and we have Jagobi identity for the bracket on the forms. But that's so in general, then you get these two pieces and they do not cancel. If the connection is If the connection is equivariant, so it means that you don't, omega does not see K. I mean, the coins, the equivariance, or you may call it the invariance. If K is group-like, so it's a group which acts on something and leaves this something alone. If K is a primitive, then on the right-hand side is zero. So the Lie algebra of something is equal to zero or the integral form, the group of something is equal. The group of something is equal to the something. So, one needs a suitable interpretation. So, it's a little bit delicate in general, this thing. And so, one needs a suitable interpretation of this fact, which probably at this point I will skip. I only mentioned that one way to do it is via some chromology, and it's called actually the Calabi pseudo-chromology. Pseudo-chromology. But so one is a pseudo-interpretation of the Kerversion. But since on the right-hand side is actually a sum of two computers, still one can go quite far in many things. So, but okay, so let me go on and tell you what is then the action of the group of gauge transformation. So, of course, here. So, of course, here we know in general that connections, all of them, is an affine space modeled on some vector space. And so, here is an affine space which is modeled on B module map from the total, sorry, from the base space into the Lie algebra, the vertical Lie algebra. So, if a rho is a connection and eta is any such map, then the sum is a connection. map and the sum is a connection because when you apply pi pi of eta is equal to zero since eta is vertical the element in g in the Lie algebra g they are mapped to zero so pi of eta is equal to zero so you get exactly the same property for rho and rho prime that pi of them is equal and the vert the vector fields on the dollar step The vector fields on the data space, the derivation of the data space, they act on this space of connection in a very natural way. So, y will be any such derivation. Y delta y rho of x is that expression. It's some sort of lead derivative. It's a lead derivative where you have just to be a little bit careful when you pass through. You see, r acting on a rho and r acting on pi. So, when you just, since you are. All pi. So when you just, since you are flipping row through x, sorry, there is, oh, sorry, y. I'm going y through row. I'm going with y through row, so I need a okay. And in particular, for vertical elements, that's the rule. But that's exactly what we do. I mean, in the, I mean, Larissa was writing these things in coordinates, but this is. things in coordinates, but this is really the lead derivative of a vector field with the values of the connection. So this will be a vertical vector field and so is the lead derivative. And in fact, this is G is really a Bradley Lee algebra. So if you compose them via the bracket, you get the delta of the bracket. You can also You can also work out what is the way that a curvature transform. And this will be the way that a curvature will transform. But here I'm again a little bit cheating. There is some extra term in general. So if rho is equivariant, then there are no extra terms. So if rho is not equivalent, there are extra terms. So in general, we have to take care. Extra terms, so in general, we have to take care of these extra terms. But again, it's something that is under control to some extent. Okay, that's the Calabi pseudo-chomology that I was talking about. Maybe I will just skip. The only thing is that the Bianca is written as a homology condition. So maybe I'll skip this part and if somebody is interested, I can. Somebody's interested, I can talk privately. Okay, and in terms of this, in terms of these objects, I mean, you have to classify sequences with this pseudo-comology, which is a very complicated object in general. So, okay, let me just skip this thing. Briefly, before I give you the class of examples, how one can construct the whale To the whale, the Chernvale map and the Chern-Simon classes. So if you have a map 5, which goes from any copies of G into B, B is the function over the space of the base space, which are symmetric. I mean, again, you have to take care when you just flip two elements, and which intertwine the representation, the adjoint representation. The adjoint representation of P on G. So we are talking here about invariant algebra over the Lie algebra. Then you construct this object here. So this is the curvature. This is the curvature. Then you some suitable anti-symmetry. Then you take this F, any such, sorry, this is my. Sorry, this must be five in the way I'm writing here. And so I get this object. So this is a bread of the B value of the 2Q form on T. It is closed because of the Bianca identity. Even if the Bianca identity is not satisfied in the sense of being zero, since this object here is just kills the commutators, so the extra terms are not there. So this is a closed form and it If you change connections, then the two connections they differ by an exact form. So the homology class, the homology class is the same. So if you take all such five as before, put them together, and then you take the Sevalik homology of the Lee-Reynard pair. Bernard pair, vector field over the base and function over the base. Okay, then you get the linear map from the invariant into this homology. And you see, and when you put it back to P, then this map is exact. So it's not exact on the base space, but it's exact on the dotted space. This is what happened also classically. You have a principal band, and then you have a And then you have a two-form, even the curvature, let's say the trace of the curvature. Let's say the curvature is not exact over the base space, but when you think of it as a two-form on the total space, it's exact. And so, and what is here is Sherm Simon. I mean, there are these classes which are Sherm-Simon, and you can write them, some of them at least explicitly. This is the classis of examples for which this construction works. So examples which come from the theta deformations. So here I've written it only for two torus. So you have two vector fields which commute and you construct that drinkful twist. That Drinfeld twist, and this is the corresponding R matrix. And then there is also this more sophisticated twist, which leads, for instance, to Kappa-Minkowski. While the previous one leads to this theta manifold, and you may take it f to be more general. You can take n. I think Richard Gene construct it in more general cases. You can take n. More general cases, you can take any of those and you can use them to deform the algebras in into non-commutative algebra. If you start for the classical, you can deform to a non-commutative, or if you can iterate the process. So, let me show you explicit, a little bit explicitly. Explicit a little bit explicitly the case of S for theta. So I construct generators of P mu, which are labeled by the weight of the action of H1 and H2. So these are the eigenvalues of the action of H1 and H2 on these generators. They commute up to a phase. So this is the non-commutative torus, or maybe something more general. Be something more general, or it could be, in fact, any even-dimensional sphere. And now the derivation are generated by five. The bundle is not trivial. And so you cannot find four exactly four generators. But there are five. And so these are bred derivations of the function over S4. The function over S for theta. And in fact, this is the rule, the Breda derivation rule. When you go through, you get an extra face, and you verify that they are tangent to the sphere. So they preserve the sphere relation, and they are not independent. Okay, so there are five, but So there are five, but you have this relation. So the fact that they are not independent, so you need five is a little bit, I mean, it would be so much better to have only four, and then you can take the dual basis and so on. But that's not too bad. Like I will show you in a moment. It's not too bad. In the classical limit, we are taking really, I mean, you take the usual derivative, partial derivative, and then you remove the part which is along the normal. So the Louisville vector. Normal. So the Louvre vector field, and you remove that part. You just do a little bit of playing around, in particular, the fact that these vector fields can be written as a combination of the commutators. So the commutators here, rather than lifting H, I will lift the commutators in the sequence that are in a. In the sequence that in a moment I will write down. One nice thing to observe is that these bred of the commutators, which are 10, they close the Bred Lie algebra of SO5 theta. Okay, so classically they will theta will be one, sorry, will be zero. And so here, that's the rule. The rule that you have. So you have a really algebra. So you have a really algebra of symmetry, everything will be symmetric under this function. So the derivations, the derivations that I just constructed, another copy of the same derivative, another copy of the same Lie algebra, of the same SO5 theta, because now the one in the middle, when they reset pi, they are on the base space. On the base space. When there is no pi, they are on the total space. So you need an extra copy of them. And then there is a natural projection. That's why I'm using the commutator. This was a short end for the commutator rather than the five generators. And here is the horizontal lift. Here is the connection. Here is the connection. So you lift these five derivations, two combinations of these things here with the B. And this is done in such a manner that we take pi, you get exactly the identity. Pi of rho, pi of this. And I was showing before that I was showing before that the commutators will give you back H. will give you back h and so you get exactly that this is uh this is a this is a this is a connection it's a connection for that uh for that uh sequence if you uh okay you can work out the the vertical projections you can in fact you may even think that the vertical the vertical The vertical projections are really the generators of the vertical algebra, and that things is also exactly the curvature. It's a little bit difficult to imagine, but this curvature, sorry, this connection is associated with Lie algebra in SO4 theta. For theta, one form, and this one form is anti-self dual. So it's an instant in the sense that the curvature star of the curvature is equal to actually anti minus f. So this requires a little bit of requires a little bit of work, but anybody who's interested, I will be happy to talk more. So there is a connection, one form. So something which goes So, something which goes into the lyage of SO4 theta, I said something completely wrong. I said something completely wrong. And nobody, nobody. I said something obliquely wrong. The Liage is the Liage of SU2 because I'm talking about the bundle S seven over S4. So it's the Liage over of SU2. Oh, you are not listening to it. Listening to it. I said, sorry, I'm a bit the bundle is S7 or S4. The such group is SU2. I did not, I never mentioned SU2, so you are excused. So I never mentioned SU2. But this is on the total space, classically, you have P S7 on S4 with SU2 as a structure group. So the one form is a one form on the total space of the bundle. form on the total space of the bundle P with values in the Lyager of SU2, SU2, classical SU2. So these so these things here, which as a vector field, is just living on the total space of the bundle. And then you have that the out there are vertical vector field, but the But the connection that I'm talking about is a connection which is valued in the Liagre of SU2, because this is a bundle whose, there is an action of SU2 on S7, and the invariant of this algebra is S4. Is in the following example where the orthogonal group will be the fiber. Okay. Okay. Can we erase that part from so there is there is a connection one form? It is anti-anti-self dual. And there is another nice aspect. This connection is invariant under the action of SO theta five. Theta 5. But if you go into the Bradlet conformal transformations, so if you take SO theta 5, 1, so the SO theta 5 is a subalgebra, and this leaves the connection invariant. The extra five generators, they give new connections. Since this is infinitesimal, you are really constructing the tangent space at the The space at the basic connection, the anti-self-dual connection. And this is five-dimensional because we have five, five. So the moduli space of these things, like it happens classically, is five. You can go beyond what I'm doing here and construct characteristic classes a la con churn con and the first churn con. First share corner churn number will be zero, and the second corner share number will be minus one. And this is really in this sense is an instanton. Like at the end, we would say, what is an instant on? It's a complex rank two vector bundle on S4 with an anti-self-dual connection. Here is a complex rank two vector bundle on S4. vector bundle on S4 theta with an anti-linear connection, with an anti-self-dual connection. I can go up to four, right? Yeah. But I will be careful. No, don't worry. We can repeat the same thing here, taking now the sorry, okay, here is the other class of Of bundle, which got to be confusing. So SO theta 2n plus 1. And then H here is SO theta 2n. So this is a quantum subgroup of SO theta 2n plus 1. And then you can take the coinvariance and then you get an even-dimensional theta sphere. Theta here is now a Theta here is now a 10 plus one times 10 plus 1 anti-symmetric matrix. So if you n is the defining matrix of SO theta 10 plus 1 and M is those of the sub-algebra, then there is a collection which is of a subgroup type. Okay? So this bracket is supposed to be This bracket is supposed to be after the tensor product. So, this bracket here does not belong there. It's after the tensor product. It's n tensor m001. So, I'm writing like that where I'm summing over b. I can do exactly what I did for the other bundle. I can construct derivations on SO2 and theta. On SO2N theta, and I can construct the derivation on SO theta 2n plus 1. I gave a sequence and I have a splitting, a splitting which is formally like that. Now there will be more indices. Okay? So this will be now this will be the generator over the base. There will be 2n of those. And formally, Formula is exactly like that. No, okay. But here, so I'm lifting vector field from the base to the dollar space. But one wants to do, for instance, a linear connections, the covariant derivative along x of y, like Larissa was doing this morning. Like Larissa was doing this morning. So it's not obvious how to do it because you have two vector fields over the base, and then you may lift one, and then somehow you want to act on the second. But how do you act on the second? You cannot lift also the second. Because then there must be something, an extra structure. There must be what is classically called the soldering. So this is your principal bundle that you may think of them as. Bundle that you may think of them as the bundle of orthonormal frames. Okay? And then you have to solve, you have to solve the tangent space to the total space of the bundle. What happens here? So you want to think of vector fields. Let me use classical names. I mean, vector fields are now braided derivation. So you want to think of a vector field as a section of a bar. As a section of a bundle which is associated to your principal bundle. And this is the notion of co, it's almost the notion of cotens or product. Again, I'm cheating a little bit here, okay? Just a little bit to make it life a little bit easier. So you need a core representation of your such a group, of your orthogonal group. So let's say the fundamental one. Okay? Then there is a co-author. Okay, then there is a coction of your M, which was SO2N, on this space. And again, it's a matrix kind of thing. So you have a basis of V and so what is then an associate bundle? Classically, the section of an associate bundle are the same thing as Eguillarian maps from the total space of the bundle into the representation into V, which are Eguillar. Into V, which are equivariant. Here is the equivariance. So take any element in the product, which is the tensor product of something in the algebra and something in V, sum over A. So you want that, this is, so you want to act on the function part, and then you want to act on the vector part, and you want them to be the same. I'm cheating a little bit here, just because you really need a tilde here, you have to change it. Nearly need a tilde here, you have to change slightly this gap. Then you look at the things, and there are exactly two n plus one solution of this condition. These are just now the sum module of sections. From general theory, this is some associate bundle, and also this will be the section of this associate bundle. What is really nice is that this bundle. Really nice is that this bundle, you may think of it as the tangent bundle to the sphere SO2 and theta, in the sense that these objects here are in one-one correspondence with the derivations of S2 and theta, which I wrote before. So, as a module, there is a module identification. How I do that? So So these are the solutions. Phi of I is equal to NIA tensor EA. N was the was the matrix which is on the dotted space of the bundle and EA was the basis of V. So those objects here are not independent. So there is a relation. So this is a good thing because they cannot be all independent. They cannot be all independent. And this is really the fact that n dagger n, one of the components is equal to zero. So I wanted to identify them with derivations. Here I changed this Latin notation to mark the difference. So I wrote something similar before. So these are u, j are the functions over the base space, and these are the derivations. How do I define them? How do I identify them? Identify them. I can construct, since this is a section of an associate bundle, this bundle is projected. I can also construct the projection. Here is the projection. So these are just the 2n first column of the matrix N. They are orthonormal. This is the projection. This projection, you work out, is exactly that object up there. object up there one minus delta delta delta is the normal direction so you are removing the normal direction so you are constructing the tangent space and in fact you can really see explicitly that the column of p are the derivation that i wrote before so you have a module map isomorphism and here is the way to construct the linear To construct the linear connection, I want to take the linear, the covariant derivative of a vector field y along x. Okay? And it must be linear in x when I multiply, let's say, on the left. And then with y, there was the anchor map in the talk. So you have to, you have an act. So if you have here some b there are two components, one when you act on b and one when you act on on b and when when you act on y so you take y you transform it to function over the total space of the bundle now you can act with the lift this is the lead derivative you feel act with the lift and you show that if this was equivariant this is again equivalent so you take the inverse image of this that's the definition what is really i mean this formula is classical so somebody must have seen signal so somebody must have seen this formula this is the the covariant derivative of the derivation ti along the derivation ti of tj is just ti dot u j I have to be careful because I mean left and right the minus sign the minus sign is such that this is torsion less the torsion of these things is zero this formula is classical This formula is classical. I had never seen it as usually when I write them in component. But this is half of the torsion. It's half of the torsion. It's exactly these things here. And so when you sum and you use the combination relation on T, you get exactly zero. So this is the Levy-Shivita connection. The Levi-She-Vita connection? Oh, not yet, because we. Oh, not yet, because we also need a metric. But there is a national metric. So, torsion equals zero. There is a national metric. The metric is written up there. You see, these i are not independent. So you need an extra piece. And the extra piece, you work out t i t j, which is g t i t j, is that object over there. Over there, d i star j minus u i u j and you work out to that metric, and you work out that the connection is metric. So, this is the Larry Shivita connection. You work out the curvature. I mean, just in the usual sense, you have to, I mean, I'm writing here the flip, I'm writing here with lambda, okay? Because this is the riffle twist. So this is the. Driftl twist. So, this is the actual when I pass through, I have some extra extra factor, and I work out it, and then it's exactly somehow classical. The metric, the metric, and then there are these two pieces here. I J acting on L is J L is I L, and then with a suitable coefficient. There is also Ricci, there is an L. Is also rich. There is a natural dual basis. There is a natural dual basis theta l on ti is such again. You get this extra term. It cannot be delta because the bundle is not trivial. It cannot be that. Then you work out Ricci. And then you work out Richie and you get 2n minus 1. And then you work out scalar, g to the minus 1 of theta l and 2n minus 1 2n, which is the classical result. So this is the Result. So this is the Riemann geometry. Sorry, the Riemannian geometry of this quantum theta to n sphere. Okay, so okay. There are one of the things that I just want to mention this. There are non-commutative principal bundles over a point, which are not trivial in this context. So one makes sense of these what are called Galois objects and. And the theory of these Galois objects, and also the gauge trans so the gauge theory of these objects is also quite interesting. And these are finite-dimensional objects, so they may be used for matrix model. Okay, so these are some, there is this beautiful example due to TAFT, which is really nice. I just to mention that non-commutative principal bundle over a point. Summing up, for a non-commutative principle bundle, we worked out. Principle bundle, we worked out classes of infinitesimal gauge transformation, bred derivations of algebra or bred derivations. We construct the natural Levy-Shivida connection on the even theta spheres with all the Riemannian geometry. Potentially, I mean, we are working on this, potentially there is extremely, well, we have something on this, but We have something on this, but in okay, this is in the future. In the present, it's just that I thank you. One minute. You want this questions from the audience? I have a question. If you can hear me, yeah, Jacob. Hear me? Yes. Yeah, yeah, go ahead. So, so, uh, maybe this is not a central question to your talk, but uh, you mentioned about this uh SU2 instantons over the this non-commutative S4. And then do we know about the moduli space of this unit charge instantons? Because you mentioned it is five-dimensional, and in the classical case, it is an open ball. Do we have some similar picture here? Um, yes. Yes, there is a similar construction. There is, you see, now it's more complicated. You have non-commutative families of inside. So these are connections which are labeled by a family which is non-commutative. These make up a ball, and the boundary in some sense of this ball is S40. This is works very well. It works very very well and we don't have ever. I can give you the reference. This was done only somehow for the incident of charge minus. More generally, it's complicated. It's complicated when the chair number is higher than one, it's more complicated. It's more complicated, even classical, right? So it's complicated. I cannot, I don't have a full answer to that. A full answer to that. I don't know if this answers your at least partial your question. Partial, yes. Okay. Thank you. Sure. Thanks. So, more questions? There's no question from Zoom if Zoom. Go ahead if someone has a question. Yeah, I have one question. Hi, Johnny. Hi, Nasoo. Yeah, hi, yeah. So, yeah, indeed, there is a classical result due to, I believe, Narasiman and Ramana. Believe in Narasiman and Ramanan about universal connections. You know, there are these universal connections over Grasmanians. I mean, so imagine you are talking about GLN and this sort of thing. Then they show that any connection actually on any vector bundle is a pullback of universal connection. So this is, I mean, the deal is to construct this map from your space into a graph. Into a Grassmannians, and then you show that the connection, which can be anything, is the so I'm thinking it might be useful to think about at least in these special cases, maybe for quantum spheres and this sort of, you know, quantum homogeneous spaces, some simple examples to prove something like that, because nothing like that has been attempted. Apart from the fact that we did some work in that direction, we did some work in that direction so at least so so the grassmanian grasmanian 4.2 and the uh quadric the which quadric is it the some names quadric uh can it goes exactly in that direction so you know this s for theta is s for theta is some are the real slides of some quadric in the in the grassmannian g uh uh for gr for two if i GR42, if I remember correctly, the next person. So, at least in that example, it's done. Sorry, in this example, it's done. Okay, very nice. Yeah, yeah, that's yeah, so with Lucho and this. The paper with Lucho and Verisho. The papers with Lucha. Right, right. Okay, very nice. That's a very nice result. Very nice. Okay. Thanks, Ms. Yeah. Anybody else from Zoom? Anybody else from Zoom that wants to make a question? Yes, Jani, can you hear me? Yes, can you hear me? Okay, it's almost midnight here. Oh, thanks. Ludrick, you are sweet. I mean, midnight, and you are listening to my talk. Okay. You're not sleeping, you are listening to my talk. Okay. No, my question is: if there should be some spectral triples also in the spaces, maybe twisted, I don't know, maybe in the sense. know maybe in this sense in which on which level on which uh on your spheres on your spheres on s40 there is a spectral table this was yeah yeah but this was constructed 22 years ago okay okay no but also on this principal bundles and also methods on the principal bundle there is some beautiful work by um meslam um code and water they did some kind of uh so so they took some So they took something along the fiber and they put it with one on the base. So there is some work on that direction, yes. Okay, okay. So then... Which also resonates with some work that you did along. You did the Taurus part, right? Okay, yes. So, but this is a little bit more sophisticated. It's a little bit more sophisticated. I know what you think. I know what you see. Yeah. Okay, okay. So then one can make it even upgrade it to spectral triples and to star. What about star structure here? Everything is okay. You had it. Oh, there is an. Oh, yeah. You mean delta J star L? Yeah, I didn't put a star on the index. This was really a star on the generators. So there are, but it was a, it was tough. The star structure, it was tough, but it's there. Okay. Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Ludovic. Go to sleep. No, thanks. More questions from Zoom? So we thank the speaker again and have a break for
