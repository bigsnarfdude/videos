Oh, pretty nice too. So I'm going to speak about some quite recent work with Roman Dubosque about regularization by noise for rough differential equations. So this is now quite a rather well-known problem that for if you take a standard OD and you try to solve You try to solve it, and if B your B here is not regular enough, you don't have uniqueness. Now, I'm gonna focus myself on uniqueness today. Whereas when you add an additive perturbation here, it's called DW here, you can regain uniqueness using the fine property of The fine property of what I will call the noise. And most of the work about regularization by noise for OD have been done in this additive setting. We'll focus ourselves on the multiplicative setting, saying that the diffusion parameter is not the identity, but some function. Some function, I will specify the condition later on. So, of course, there have been for the Brunian motion or for semi-martingale, when W is a semi-martingale or Brunian motion, there have been a lot of work on that setting, saying that B can be taken really, really regular, for example. Regular, for example, sense. And here I want to focus myself on Davy notion of uniqueness or path-by-path notion of uniqueness, meaning that almost surely the random body is well posed. Of course, this poses a problem because A problem because you need a rough path theory, you need to make sense of this equation almost surely, which requires rough path theory and we'll show how to deal with that on regularization by notes. Let me focus first, so remind you what happened in the additive case. So, in the additive case, when sigma is equal to the identity, there are The identity. There are several work on that notion of uniqueness, and especially the work of Davy when he was able to take a Taw or Pronian motion. Several other works. I'd like to mention the work by Galeratti and Kubilini, which says that almost all, for the notion of almost all, which is quite strong. Quite standard. Almost all B having solar flubularity, almost all W rigorize in this equation so that it has solutions. And of course, you can think of a whole set of additive perturbations. Let me also. Let me also mention a word by Shaposhnikov and Rege that it is relevant to focus on that kind of uniqueness since it is different of strong uniqueness in the ODE setting, in the SD setting. Okay, in the additive case, a general procedure to solve that is Is to make a small change of variable and to solve rather than to solve the whole ODE or the whole SD or random SD or so on, to focus on the second one, which allows us to focus on the average field, meaning that to focus on the space. Meaning that to focus on the space-time regularity of this operator TWB, which is the average field along the noise, and here you see how the noise will act on B and perhaps recognize the bit B and you will gain some derivatives by losing a bit of time. Okay, of course, in the multiplicative setting, Setting, there is lots of work for Sama Martingales, but very few works in a rough pass setting. For example, when you want to take W to be a fraction of Bernard motion, there is really, really not so many works. Actually, there are three. And I will present you the different works. Different works. So, the first work about regularization by noise in the multiplicative setting and let's say path-by-path uniqueness is due to Davy and it's a slight extension of his previous work. And it mostly works in a setting when you can take the differential coefficient. The differential coefficient as a t3 and having as in the additive case b only bounded. But it uses tools which are not really available in a raw pass setting, meaning a Gersanov transform. Of course, you could use a Gerzanov transform for fractional Boonian motion. And then he used a Tien theorem for the Konogorov equation. For the Kolnogorov equation associated to the equation without the drift, without B, which is really not possible to have in a Rothbard setting. Then there is another work due to Atre, Bar and Shekar in 2017. And here And here they use a trick which is they are reducing the multiplicative SDE to an additive one using a L'Anperci transform, a rough Long-Perci transform. So it works for all H greater than one-fourth in the fractional Boon motion setting, but they have a rather Rather an hypothetis on sigma, which reduces a lot the scope of their work, is a sigma minus one. So sigma should be invertible. And we'll see in the following that this is not a bad hypothesis, but it should also be conservative, meaning that sigma minus one. Sigma minus one is a gradient of something. And this is not the scope of what we expect. And while we were finishing this work with Romain, there was another work by Dariotis and Gesell, Pierre Rensk, which focuses on exactly the same stuff. They happen to have pretty much the same. Happen to have pretty much the same results as us with really different techniques. So they are using stochastic Zune lemma and additive translation of the solution and they manage to have a continuous change flow. And see that one of the key hypotheses is that sigma should be strictly elliptic. Sigma should be strictly elliptic. Okay, so we are able with Roma to work in a rather more general setting. So we are able to work in a geometric in sorry, we are able to work with. Sorry, we are able to work with a Gaussian Rof path rather than just fractional Bronyon motion. And what we ask is that the path of the rough path, so the first path, is locally non-determinism. Meaning that you cannot predict somehow the way it will work just by looking at the Just by looking at the path. And of course, the fraction of Bernial motion is a locally non-determinism of index 2H, and we'll see at the end how it relates to previous works that I presented. So our main theorem is that we can We can regularize. So, if you take sigma to be strictly elliptic plus lots of derivatives, then you can take B to be only 3 over 2 minus 1 over alpha regular for alpha being the index of non local non- Local non-determinism. In the case of the fractional variant motion case, if you take, remember that alpha is equal to 2h, so you can you always have something better than LibShit's continuous. Okay, for those For those who are familiar with this literature, you should expect to have one minus one over alpha instead of three half minus one over alpha. So we're losing one half of regularity here due to the techniques we are using. But on the opposite, we are gaining something, which is that our summary. That our semi-flow is locally Lipschitz continuous and not only continuous. So, in the five, ten minutes I still have, I would like to explain you the machinery we use to prove such a theorem and to see where we are losing and where we are gaining things. Where we are gaining things. So the idea is we have three ingredients to manage to prove this. We first do a flow transformation on the equation, but a more interesting one than the L'Onperti transform done by a previous work. And then we identify a precise Precise, um, a precise uh criterion for space-time regularity of the average field, which will come for the full transformation. And then we will use Malyavin calculus for rough paths to prove that we actually have this for Gaussian rough path. So let me just mention the flu transform. Mentioned the flow transform and the flow transformation. And this is an idea coming from Reden Schultz in the rough setting, but it's just where I found it. But this idea comes from a lot of things. You can find this, you can find it already in Kunita. And the idea is the following: if you take the flow of the standard rough differential equation, so here I'm working in the sense of Davy notion of a solution of rough differential equation. So, if you take this and you consider this average field, so it's nearly exactly the same transformation. Nearly exactly the same transformation as before in the additive case, because in the additive case, the flow is just x plus noise, and here you have the identity, and here you have x plus noise. So it's exactly the same transformation as in the additive setting, but it's a bit more difficult when sigma is not identity. So if you take this transformation, if you look at this Look at this average field still, averaged by the flow, then a solution of the OD, the random OD or coming from using this average field, is exactly a solution of this equation by a Foul-Transformation. Transformation. So, this is our first result, and it's only a rough, only done in a rough setting. And we really had to prove this. There was something missing in Ridal and Choisso about that, that it's exactly the same notion of solution, just solving the OD driven by the... Driven by the average field or the raw differential equation with both terms. So of course, this gives us a restriction so that we need to differentiate the flow. So somehow we need some regularity on the diffusion coefficient that should not be really useful. Really useful if we do not use a flow transform. But the nice thing with this approach is that it allows us to identify exactly the same operator as before. So the average operator now along the flow and not just along the path. And to then mimic all the techniques done before, also use Also, use non-linear young calculus and so on to solve this OD. Okay, but of course now comes the problem that we have identified the an averaging operator, but we need to see how to How to gain some regularity in this setting. And this is done by using some Maliavin calculus. And the reason is the following. So if you take again the flow and if you consider this last line, all the other things are just hypothesis, but the last line is more or less. Line is more or less all what we need: is that we need somehow an integration by part formula or conditional integration by part formula, meaning that if you take the an f and you with all the derivatives that you want, and you consider it along the flow with the flow transform. The flow with the flow transform as done before, then this quantity is controlled by the infinity norm of f t minus s to the power beta alpha over 2, where alpha is the index of non-determinism. So you see again that it's going to be h in the fractional Bonnian motion setting, and something which is uniform in S and X. Form in S and X somehow. So when you have this integration by part formula, then you have the space-time regularity of the noise. And of course, since we are using some Common Graph theorem, you are losing a bit. This I must say, yeah. Oh, of course, this is only in the L infinity norm setting, somehow. And if you want to do it to have more regularity on the average field, then you need to replace. Then you need to replace in the previous thing this derivative here by all those fields here, which is so a minus one here is missing, which is which makes the computation a bit boring, I must say. But if you can control this, then you You gain enough regularity of your average field, and you will have exactly able to use the machinery using in regularization by noise techniques. So we have to focus on the integration by part formula like that. And what I must say is. What I must say is that we need two things. We need this conditional expectation because the way to prove this that this allows us to regain regularity is to use a martingale transform, a martingale decomposition and some BDG inequality or as mauve inequality, depending on what is the regularity. regularity the integrability of G so and this is crucial that you have the conditioning first and the second thing is that when you see such integration by part formula you you think about Maliovannel calculus and this is exactly what we've done so but Done. So, but let me mention that due to all those terms, again, we need some regularity on sigma. And last but not least, how to obtain such a thing. So, as I said, Marianne calculus is the nice tool to do that. Tool to do that to have some integration by part formula. So we use a lot of Malian calculus for RDE in a Gaussian pathetic. This is a work due to Sami, which is in the audience, I think. And as I say, as I mentioned, we need to. We need to use conditional bounds. So the condition in here is crucial. So we had to redo lots of things because it was not done, even though it was not so difficult to adapt all the proof. And in this setting, we are losing because we are sadly asking sigma to be C infinity B to have a better computer. To have a better computation, of course, this is not optimal in this setting. I think C4, C5, C, P plus 5 should be enough. So thank you very much for your attention. Are there any quick questions in the audience? Sammy, he has one. Does somebody else have a question? All right, Sami, sure. Only I'm the only one. Yeah, your use of BDD is a little bit mysterious to me. I must have missed something. For me, there's no marking aid. No, as I said, you need to do, let's say, a martingale. Let's say Martingale decomposition, meaning that you take your average operator and you first consider it conditional to some previous time. And then it gives you actually a marking gate.
