Some people, so you should feel free to interrupt in case there's something I could say to clarify the discussion. Okay, now of course my pen doesn't work. Let's see. Sorry. I just checked. All right, there we go. Cool. Okay, so I just like to, so the P. I just like to, so the P widths, I think, are a bit take a bit of time to get the definition in your head right. So I'll try to give some idea of what is going on here. So I think everyone knows that if you have a, say you have a compact Riemannian manifold, you can define the eigenvalues by using this min-max characterization, right? So you look at p-dimensional subspaces of, say, W12, the technical details. W12, the technical details don't matter. And then, right, you take the soup over that of the Dirch Lay energy or the Rayleigh quotient, Rayleigh quotient. I learned recently. I've been saying it wrong all these years. And so, and then you would take the infimum over the p-dimensional subspaces. Okay. And so, right, everyone knows that if you do this, then you arrive at the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues, right? So you. Values, right? So you the okay. So I'm not going to say exactly how that works, but I think everyone knows how this works. Okay, so the idea of the p-widths is, well, it goes back to this work of Gromov. And Gromov said, well, you know, this functional, this is sort of a Gromov observed that this is really a much more general sort of thing that you could try to do. And you. And you realize that there's some kind of, well, up to some scaling, because if you multiply u by a constant, right, a non-zero constant, the Rayleigh quotient doesn't change. And so you could really view this as some kind of like infinite dimensional projective space. And you're doing something topological. Okay, so I don't really want to see. I don't really, you know, I don't really want to say what that means because I don't think people here are topologists. And I think that for most, if you're not a topologist, you don't like the words infinite dimensional projective space. If you are, you're a super happy, but okay. So just for an analyst, I'm just going to say what, if you kind of follow Gromov's story, where you arrive. Okay. And so this idea goes back to Gronk. This idea goes back to Gromov, but then Guth and Markez and Neves made really important contributions to here. So you usually might say this was developed by these four people. So we have this quantity, which I'll call the p width. Okay. And okay. It's again, it's a min-max type quantity, right? You're taking the inf over p-dimensional things, and then you're taking the soup over. Things, and then you're taking the soup over those things. And here, well, okay, I haven't been very precise, right? You have to actually, you know, you have to, I don't think I can say anything that's very useful to give you the precise definitions, but just to give you the idea, you take like a, you have your manifold, and you look at the here, this would be, for example, a one-dimensional of hypersurface. Of hypersurface, right? So you take your sphere and you sweep it out by hyperspheres, right? And so that's an example of a one-dimensional family. And so a two-dimensional family might be you sweep it out, but you allow the direction you're sweeping out to rotate. So if you take S2, you can find a three-dimensional family where you rotate, where you sweep out, but you also rotate the direction you're sweeping out. Okay. And so, like, formally, this results. And so, like formally, this resembles, I mean, I'm not saying this is the same thing as the eigenvalues, but formally, this resembles the Rayleigh quotient min-max characterization of the eigenvalues. So that kind of, that's clear, kind of just the, there's just a vague formal sense. And so, okay, I haven't defined what it means to be a p-dimensional family of hypersurfaces, and I won't do that, but you can give a nice definition, which kind of it mimics the Rayleigh quotient. Okay, so the confusion here is there's no linear, there's no like, there's no linear. Linear, there's no like there's no linearity, right? So you can't just look at p-dimensional subspaces, so you use p-dimensionality in some topological sense, okay. And so, I mean, you know, in a classic drama fashion, this is a curious definition, but if it, you know, if I made such a definition, it would be completely useless and nobody would care. But if drama makes such a definition, you can hope that it actually leads to interesting mathematics, right? And so, indeed, And so, indeed, it turns out that just like this, you should think of this as the eigen. I'll say this again in a second. This is sort of like the eigenvalues, right? This is the Rayleigh quotient definition of the eigenvalues. Then you can equally well find the eigenfunctions. Okay, so here, of course, the things are much more nonlinear and more geometric. So we get something that's sort of different. So, we get something that's sort of different. And so, okay, so we have, let me just slow down. And so, we have our closed n plus one dimensional manifold. There's some dimensional restriction. You could say, you could say you could remove this if you allow a singular set, but whatever. And so for each integer p, p, for some reason, people call these the eigenvalues indexed by integer p. Usually no one indexed the eigenvalues by p. I don't know. So, but p is the index. So, but p is the index set, and so then for each p, we get essentially loosely speaking, we get omega p is a minimal hypersurface. Okay, and so minimal just means if you vary it slightly, the area doesn't increase to first order, right? It's a critical point of the area function, right? Just like eigenvalues are critical points of the Rayleigh quotient. So the exact statement is a bit more complicated because these minimal hypersurfaces could come with integer multiplicity. Okay, so what you get is you get this nice picture up here. So maybe you get two, maybe for some given integer p, the p wave. Given integer p, the p width is attained by two minimal surfaces, two disjoint minimal surfaces, but they have they are supposed to come with some integer multiples. So, this is kind of a like this is a geometric property, which, well, it turns out that this is sort of unavoidable and it complicates the theory quite a bit. I won't talk about this too much. But, okay, so I'll just say that a big interest, right? A big interest, right? So, well, you know, maybe people here are more analysts and less geometers, but in case you're a geometer, well, there's an old question about, so, for example, in a Riemannian manifold, are there infinitely many geodesics, closed geodesics, right? And so, minimal surfaces are kind of the higher dimensional analog of a geodesic, and from one point of view. And in particular, the theory of the p-widths, it's not straightforward, but it does lead. It's not straightforward, but it does lead to resolution of so what you might call Yao's conjecture. So, that in any n-dimensional n plus one-dimensional manifold below, at least below this dimension restriction, there's infinitely many distinct minimal surfaces, minimal hypersurfaces. Let's just say hypersurfaces. So, these p-widths turned out, I mean, this is not just like a, well, if you care about. Well, if you care about minimal services, this is not just a sort of an idle theory. It turns out to have been incredibly powerful and yet useful. And there's been a lot of work from this. Okay, are there questions here? Okay, I don't see any questions, but in case there are. So I first want to talk a bit about the analogy. So, right, I sort of said, like, I sort of said, like, the eigenvalues come from this min-max of, you know, min-max of the Rayleigh quotient. And then the p-widths come from some min-max of area. Right. And so just the analogy turns out to be quite nice. So, you know, the p-widths, you should just think in your head is these are the same as eigenvalues. Eigen functions are the minimal surfaces. Are the minimal surfaces. And then something that's quite amazing is that actually these p-widths satisfy a vial law. So I think everyone knows that you get some vial law of this form for the eigenvalues. Hopefully I got it correct. And so basically for large p, the behavior of the eigenvalue is completely determined by just the volume and the dimension and the some power of p. And so, of course, And so, of course, when I write Twiddle, I mean if you divide, you divide, and then the limit is one. So it's quite a strong asymptotic behavior. So this is like the first, the top order behavior of lambda p. And so on the p-width side, it was proven that a similar via law holds, right? So the volume and the dimension and p completely determine. And p completely determine the high frequency behavior of the p widths. All right, and so just I'll come back to this later, but there's a funny thing here, which is that you'll notice that this constant is like depends only on the dimension, but it's unknown. Right, so the I'll say this in a minute, but essentially, right, once you know the vial law holds with some constant, then you just need to compute the constant for some example. Let's say you use the torus, right? This is the classical, the classical thing you do in some analysis, some PDE class. I don't know when you learned this, but then you look at the torus, you compute how the high frequency eigenvalues on the torus behave, then the constant pops out. And so I'll say this again in a minute, but there's no exact But there's no examples until now of any manifold where the high-frequency p-widths are known. So, all right. So, the problem is nonlinear. It turns out to be harder to determine what the p-widths are. And maybe this is my next slide. Oh, yeah. Okay. So, the following questions kind of come up, especially if you look at the use of the p-widths to study the existence of minimal surfaces. The existence of minimal surfaces. So, okay, for let's say for a nice ambient manifold like the sphere, torus, right, et cetera, what are the p-widths, right? This is the geometric analog of asking, like, what are the minimal surfaces? Or sorry, what are the eigenvalues? Nice, Riemannian. And so this problem is, I mean, I think people are still studying it, but there's many, many results, right? So there's many, many manifolds where you can completely determine the spectrum, not even just the high frequency limit, right? You completely know everything. And so for P widths, well, basically what's known is for S3 and S2, for P. S2 for p, I think less than or equal to seven, you know what the p widths are, right? But that's very far from all, I mean, that's very far from all positive integers. And so, okay. And so it's sort of a related question. This is, this is a priori an easier question, is remember that the Lyakimovich, Marquez, and Neves proved that the p-widths satisfy a via law. And so if you knew the p-widths of some example for each dimension, you could compute this constant. Could compute this constant, and so, but all right, for the Laplacian, it's very easy. Um, but here you don't know what this constant is. Okay, and so then, well, relevant for this talk is the surface case, right? So, you know, when the ambient manifold is a surface, so two-dimensional manifold. And so, um, just to go back, right, you'll notice that I excluded. You'll notice that I excluded n equals two. So, so that you know, I made no claims about this. So, so things are a bit surprisingly worse on a surface. Usually in this sort of business, the lower dimensional things should be easier and higher dimensional things should be harder. But here, something funny happens on the surface, and that's kind of the thing I'd like to talk about. Okay. Okay, so let me tell you what's Okay, so let me tell you what's true on a surface. So, the theory developed by Omgren and Pitts, and so Omgren and Pitts basically is the theory going from omega p to minimal surface. Right, so you can think of this as the analog of, well, like you need some sort of compactness theory for H1 or W12, then you need elliptic regularity, and et cetera, right? So that's how you construct the eigenvalues. I mean, okay, there's other proofs. Eigenvalues. I mean, okay, there's other proofs, I guess, but I think the best analog is kind of the direct existence proof. So you construct the eigenvalues on Riemannian manifold. And for the nonlinear problem, this is quite hard, but it's been resolved quite some time ago by Amgern and Pitts. And so what Amgern and Pitts produce on a surface, it turns out sort of due to, well, I think it's actually a geometric. I think there's actually a geometric reason, but. I think there's actually a geometric reason, but basically, you could say, due to a sort of a defect of how they handle isolated points, Omgren and Pitts produce a geodesic net that attains the p-widths. Okay, so remember that, so a minimal surface in two dimensions is a geodesic, right? So it's the same thing, this dimension. But it turns out that the p-widths that you're getting might have some singular points. Might have some singular points where things come together. So geodesics are meeting, right? And so, well, there's some balancing condition, right? So sort of the directions have to add up to zero. You can't have this picture is wrong. But the balancing conditions alone don't necessarily mean that it's just the same thing as like an immersed geodesic where they cross through each other. And here's, you know, I always, I always get confused. Here's, you know, I always get confused about this, but here's an example. So notice that you could take the triple junction is the simplest example. But you could, you could, you might complain that, oh, this triple junction, maybe it has odd number. That seems, that's something you could really rule out. But if you take two copies and rotate a bit, you get now a genuine, even, like even number of rays that are balanced, but not a geodesic. And so then if you start playing around. And so then, if you start playing around with dimension counting, you realize that most of the time, these examples, like generically, these examples are not straight lines crossing, but they're just rays. Okay. Is that okay? Any questions here? Okay. And so, what I would like to talk about is sort of improvement of that theorem. And this is with Christos, who is. And this is with Christos, who is either here or has abandoned me, probably for the best. And so the first result is the following. So if you have a surface, then indeed you get the same statement as in Omgren Pitts, right? So this was like the n equals three, the n plus one equals, sorry, n plus one equals three. Then you got the Then you got the p-widths attained by smooth embedded minimal surfaces, maybe with multiplicity. Okay. And so here, oh, I'm sorry. Here, well, you can give examples, and it's clear that there. And it's clear that there's no hope that you find embedded geodesics. But what we prove is that you find immersed geodesics that attain the p-widths. And so, yeah, okay. So this kind of comes, this sort of puts the n equals two theory on equal footing. And so I should say that in the very low frequency regime, this was pre- Very low frequency regime, this was previously known. And so in certain, you know, in general, when P is one, and Christos gave a proof using phase transitions, which I'm, you know, that's, I suppose, get to singularities in P D. And so that's we're getting there, right? So it's okay. Okay. And so then by using this theorem and some other work, Christos and I proved the following result. So we proved that the p-widths of the round sphere. The p-widths of the round sphere, right? So, are attained by some number of great circles. Okay, right, and where, okay, you can compute explicitly what, how many great circles you need, okay. And so, in particular, we can compute the constant in the biolog on a surface. the constant in the bio law on a surface right so you still don't know a like you know you you don't know it on on a three manifold but you now it's it's it's known on a surface okay so um i'll probably spend most of my time uh remaining talking about the the first result which is the the the fact that you get geodesics The fact that you get geodesics, not geodesic nets. And then, if I have time at the end, I'll say a bit about this result. Okay, so finally, if you haven't lost all the analysts, we're going to at least get to a bit of analysis, hopefully. And so this is the theorem that I'd like to talk about. And so the The steps of the proof is first, okay, we're going to use the sort of you might call Alan Kahn phase transition regularization. Okay, and so here there's this semi-linear PE, and I'll say a bit more about this later. And this regularizes the problem in a nice way that lets you have like improved control over these P widths. Okay. And so I'll say this later, but you can have a theory of the P width. But you can have a theory of the oh sorry you produced so there's a theory of p widths here okay and so then if we want to get geodesics instead of nets so then we need we it reduces well not trivially but it reduces to the study of of alancon on r2 so entire solutions and so Summitions. And so, what you need to analyze is that the tangent cone at infinity to such an object. Okay. And so once you have that, then you can quite directly go from the small scale to the original scale by using some previous work of Jin Chen sort of curvature estimates in this situation. So I won't talk anymore about that, but using their curvature estimates, you can transfer information from small to big. Transfer information from small to big, okay. So, right, I mean, this entire solution is understanding the very small regime because you zoom in, right? And so, you zoom in to get an entire solution, but that's determining the local behavior and you need to transfer this out. Okay, and so then to me, the most interesting part of this whole business is This whole business is the appearance of the sign-Gordon equation. And this is another work of Jun Chen, Liu and Wei. And so you need to choose, so I'm always writing it like this, where W prime, I haven't said exactly what this is, but normally in the Alan Kahn business, you take W prime to be just a double well potential. I think most people are familiar with this. There's a picture on the next slide. But based on the work of Based on the work of Liu and Wei, it turns out that if you choose the sign-Gordon equation, and as many people know, that's completely integrable, then you can control the things that you look at in two in a much better way. Okay, so that's the general sketch, and let me say a bit more. Okay, so just the drive-by. You know, the drive-by Alan Kahn discussion. So, right, you take your double well potential. So, there's two low points, one point in the middle. Um, your energy looks like this, and the solutions satisfy this PD. And so this is, I said this before, but you regularize the p-width. So p-widths, remember, are supposed to be corresponding minimal surfaces, and they're supposed to be the analog of the eigenfunctions. And so, here you imagine that you smear out these minimal. Imagine that you smear out these minimal surfaces. So, like if my minimal surface was sigma p, then I have some smeared-out version where the function is concentrating along the sigma p. And the advantage, you know, this is the advantage versus Omgren Pitts is that, right, these solve a PDE, right? And so in Omgren Pitts, you And so in Omgren pits, you approximate the minimal surfaces by other objects, but they don't really solve a PDE. This is like when you prove the mountain pass theorem, you look nearby the critical point or the thing you think is a critical point, and you want to perturb it via the flow or something like this. But the nearby things don't satisfy a PDE. And so in this setting, you sort of construct a canonical approximation, which is this Alan-Kahn solution. And it solves a PDE, and it has a Morse index control. Index control as I mentioned in the last talk. And so, all right, so there's a long story here. But the limit has the same properties or better as in the Omni-Pitt setting. And so sometimes the limiting happens in a nicer manner. And this goes back to the work of Jin Chen and Kele Wong. And Christos and I also used this in our previous work on this problem. Okay, so if you Okay, so if you aren't familiar with Alan Khan, this maybe is too fast, but I think many people here know a bit about this. And so because the Morse index is P, say, there's going to be at most P places where the Morse index is going bad, is non-zero locally. And so away from these P points, so there's just P, let's say the Morse index was three, there's three balls. Was three. There's three balls, maybe, where things are not controlled. And away from this, you're stable. And the one-way curvature estimates tell you that the limit outside of these points is a nice geodesic, embedded. So there's no crossing, there's no net points. And the point, the thing that you're concerned about is precisely these points. So here's the Here's where I'm claiming that it's about singularity formation in geometric PDs. I think that's fair, but maybe some of you will disagree. And so, as epsilon is going to zero, the PDs, you're losing the ellipticity of the PDE. And so at these concentration points, well, it turns out that you get some sort of little thing pinching off. There's a singularity forming. And so if you zoom in, which is, I guess, common when studying. Is, I guess, common when studying singularities forming in PD, then you get an entire solution to like Laplacian u equals W prime. Okay? Okay. So earlier work, so by work of Tonegawa and Wang Wei here, there's a tangent cone at infinity. So these, you can think of U as being concentrated near. Can think of u as being concentrated near some lines at infinity, and it's a balanced ray. It's a balanced union of rays. But again, like I said, this is the bad picture, right? We want to rule this out in order to avoid geodesic nets. And so we want to say that it's actually like a, we'd like to say that it was a union of lines. Like, that's a good picture. This is good. This is bad. Okay, and so the key result here really comes from the work of Liu and Wei. And so we need to understand that the tangent cone at infinity is a union of lines, not a union of rays. And so for general potential, this is, I think, still an open problem. And probably it's not true, although maybe that's. Maybe that's a bold claim. And so, right, we use the sine-Gordon potential. And so, the theorem that Liu and Wei prove is that indeed the tangent content infinity is given by a union of lines. And so, okay, I'm sort of selling them a bit short because actually they prove much more. So, they completely classify the things that you get, and they prove that they're non-degenerate in a very strong sense. But for the point of view of our work, But for the point of view of our work, we don't really need these results. I think there are applications of those results in other directions. But for us, we just focus on this thing. Okay, so, and like I said, the key is that this is an integrable PDE. And so I think that there's several people here who are much more an expert than I am. And so the, I think in my, let me just. Let me just going to give a brief sketch of how you might use the integrability. And so you can define the formulas don't, I mean, you don't pay attention to the formulas, but you can define sort of a connection on the trivial two-dimensional complex bundle over R2. And it turns out that this leads to the following sort of system of ODEs. So this is like the parallel section ODE. This is like a parallel section ODE. And so the point is that the signed-Gordon equation is a compatibility condition for this ODE. So I think this is familiar to many people. And so then the general game is to analyze the relationship between the solution and the behavior of this phi function. And in my three minutes. My three-minute spiel about this. If you just have the trivial solution, then if you just study this ODE, you get solutions which grow in one direction and decay in the other direction and two linearly independent. And this is familiar if you have like a, in general, you kind of expect that something grows and something decays. And so if you have sort of a non-trivial solution, this is the example of Of one end. So you can imagine that this is the solution which corresponds to the line, the vertical line through the origin. Okay. And so here, well, you can find a bound state. Okay, so you can find a solution to this sort of like auxiliary ODE system where it decays at both directions. Directions. And the key, well, at least for us, I think if you really use the full mechanism of inverse scattering, you say more refined information than this. But the key for us, this is very simplistic, is that the bound states know the directions of the end. And so you can find a bound state in this direction, well, where there's a free parameter in your OD system. And the direction of the parameter is. And that the direction of the parameter is related to the direction of the end. Okay, so just the vague sense. So if you look at the bound state, so bound states mean that you decay in both directions, right? So in a certain sense, then the bound states are exactly related to the ends of your entire solution. Okay. Entire solution. Okay. And so the theorem that Liu and Wei proved tells you the following. And so, okay, there's a precise statement. But basically, bound states precisely correspond. Each bound state corresponds to an end and the opposite end in the other direction. So this tells you that you get an end. That gives you a bound state. Then that tells you also the other end must be in the list of ends. So that implies the tangent cone. So, so that implies the tangent conus lines. Okay. So, um, oh, yeah, okay. So, okay, so are there any questions about that? I went a little bit fast, but this was just the vague sense of how you use integrability to show that you get immersed geodesics rather than geodesic nets. GIDSignets. Okay, so there's no questions. So let me just finally close with talking about how you apply this to the p-widths of S2. And so I claim that the p-widths of the round sphere are given by this function. And so when I by phase transition methods, this is the theorem I just proved. Proved. Proved, right? This theorem tells you that omega p is achieved by geodesics. Okay, geodesics on the round sphere are simple, they're just equatorial circles, right? So that already tells you quite a bit that the p widths are 2 pi times an integer, right? There's just some number of circles, but you don't know how many, right? So the question is this: the question comes down to how many circles per k. And so. And so, okay, remember this is a min of a max problem. And so you can bound it above by constructing some family, right? Because if you construct a family where you control the max, then the min is strictly less, okay, or less than or equal to, right? And so you can use homogeneous polynomials, so the zero sets of homogeneous polynomials. So, the zero sets of homogeneous polynomials. And you can, it turns out that this gives you the sharp bound. And there's some, Larry Guth has a lot, is very interested in this sort of, this is observation maybe of Gromov or Guth. And so Larry Guth told us a lot about how it's very surprising in some situations that polynomials are giving you the sharp bound here. So there's a whole, there's a very interesting discussion about the unreasonable effectiveness of polynomials in this setting. So polynomials are. This setting. So polynomials are sharp here, but you just need to prove that the bigger than or equal to sign. Okay. And so this, I mean, I don't have time to give this justice, but this goes back to work of Aix, who did the p-width for p less than or equal to seven. But we go further, you have to get all the way to infinity. And so the first step is to perturb to an ellipsoid so that, okay. So, that, okay, there's on an ellipsoid, there's many closed geodesics, but most of them are very long, right? So, on the ellipsoid, there's three geodesics. If you slice the ellipsoid with the coordinate planes, you have three simple closed-embedded geodesics. And otherwise, you have these geodesics, which sort of approximate those, but they wind around many times. This is classical. It goes back to Morse, at least. And so, we have to be very careful. And we choose the geodesic so that these geodesics form an arithmetic. Geodesics form an arithmetic sequence, right? So that's quite important. And then, okay, we apply min-max. And so it turns out by counting, if you can show that the omega p are strictly increasing, then everything works. Okay, so then sort of like, right, we need to prove, we need to prove that omega p is not too small. And so if you count, okay, this is an exercise in counting. If you know that these are the options. If you know that these are the options for the geodesics you're getting, and then omega p is strictly increasing, you see that this root like floor of root p comes out. And so the strict increasingness of omega p, this is a, this boils down, okay, I'm out of time, but this boils down to a fact from Morse theory, right? And so something called Lushnick Schneerlman results. And so that's quite a technical discussion, so I don't have time to say how we do that. To say how we do that. But I'll just remark that sort of you need to use Angren Pitts instead of Alan Kahn. So we use various work to compare the theories. So that part turns out to be kind of complicated. But all right, thanks very much. I'll stop here. Okay. Thank you for a very interesting talk and very nicely presented, Redels. Are there questions? Hi, Audience. Congratulations. Very nice result. Thank you. Yeah. Out, thank you. Yeah, so I saw one question actually the last slide. So, so we take Alan Khan, right? You take a limit, but in the process of the limit, the index will lose, right? You may lose. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. So how do you overcome this difficulty? Yeah, so no, so that's, I think that that's a really interesting open question. So actually, in our paper, there's some conjectures about the, so like, you, you. the so like you you have your you know you have your alan kahn and then in the limit you get some geodesic right and so i think so okay the simplest picture you could get is the following it's like this figure eight yeah um and so like uh and i guess this is sort of what's discussed in christos's paper and so i think let's say alan kahn has index one yeah oh Yeah, oh, where did it go? So, right, then the natural conjecture is that this geodesic has index zero, right? Because you've eaten up an index. So, the thing that I think is easy to prove is that if you think of this geodesic as like, if you think of it as something with a fixed endpoint, so two loops, that thing has index zero. That's easy to prove, I think, you know, by standard Alan Kahn theory. Standard Alan Kahn theory. But what's difficult, and I don't really know how to do, is that the actual immersed geodesic has index zero. It seems like that should follow from the non-degeneracy result. I mean, I think you can imagine how such a result would go. But it's not clear to us exactly how to prove that at the moment. So, and yeah, sorry, go ahead. So, actually, this is a relation. So, can you define? This relationship. So, can you define like a kind of a non-degeneracy for this geodesis for this net? Yes. So we can, but I'm not sure that what, like, so we have to study the space of geodesic nets to do this. I'm not, I mean, this may or may not be relevant. Like, I haven't thought hard enough about the Alan Kahn side. con side so the i i don't know if that is the same thing like i i think i think that's a really interesting question i think that if you could do this for example then you could like you should in theory be able to avoid this step of the proof right so i like i think ideally you can you should be able to say like alancon produces immersed geodesics and then there's some index And then there's some index based on the index and nullity of the geodesics, along with some information of the crossing. And this index should equal the Allen Kahn index. And I think that should be doable, but so far, it seems difficult. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, it's time for the next talk. So let's thank Oris. For the next talk, so let's thank Oris again and then we'll.
