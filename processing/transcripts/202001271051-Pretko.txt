Thank you for the invitation to speak here. I'm Michael Predkel from the University of Colorado. And like most of the speakers here, I'm going to be talking about fractons. No surprise there. But I'm going to try to take it in a slightly different direction from many of the other talks. So a lot of the talks at this conference are focusing on the more abstract mathematical side of fractons, which makes sense. This is a mathematical research station after all. But I thought it's important to counterbalance that with a talk focusing on just how realistic. Focusing on just how realistic are fractons and what are the prospects for bringing this field into closer contact with experimental reality. So, this is going to be a fairly broad talk. It's going to feature some work by me and a lot of work by other people. Hopefully, I've cited it all correctly. So, like DOM, I'm going to start out with a quick introduction to fractons. My introduction is going to be a little bit shorter and a little less historical, but I just want to get everybody on the same page with a few basic introductory facts about With a few basic introductory facts about fractons. So, my working definition of a fracton goes something like this: A fracton is a type of emergent quasi-particle excitation found in various condensed matter settings, which features a set of severe restrictions on its mobility. Specifically, a fracton is a particle which is unable to move by itself. If you consider an isolated fracton with no other particles around, I'm supposed to be using green, right? If you consider an isolated fracton with no other particles around, Fracton with no other particles around, there's no process which can take this fracton from one location to another location. Nevertheless, if you combine fractons to form certain types of bound states, for example a dipolar bound state in certain situations, the resulting composite object is often free to move around the system. And this unusual type of mobility structure is usually encoded in a new type of conservation law, which is prevalent in fracon systems, which often takes the form of higher moment charge conservation law. Of higher moment charge conservation laws, such as the conservation of dipole moment, or also the closely related subsystem conservation laws. So, this is my general working definition of what a fracton is. I know that many people have a slightly more restrictive definition of a fracton. Some people like to think of fractons only in the context of gapped long-range entangled spin systems. But for me personally, that definition is a bit too restrictive. As I'll try to emphasize today, I consider the fracton phenomenon to be fairly broad and to be found in To be fairly broad and to be found in a wide variety of physical settings. Okay, if you go to two general, would you consider a quark as a fracton too? No, I would not. Why? Because it's sort of waiting into your definition of quarks. I mean, because they're not, then because they're not really isolatable. You want a fracton to be something you can get alone by itself, and then it hasn't, and then it can't move once it's by itself. I mean, a quark, it's locked together. I mean, it can only move in bound states, but it sort of can only exist in the bound state. I don't know enough about cork glue and plasma to comment on that, but I'm happy to chat about it later. Okay. So what sort of physical setting should we be looking in in order to actually find fractons? Well, historically, the first place where fractons were encountered was in the context of certain exactly solvable quantum spin-liquid models. There was an early example due to Claudia Shimon and a very famous fractal example due to our own Zhanghuan. Famous fractal example due to our own Zhang Wanha. And these models were very important as proof of principle to establish that fractons make sense as a concept. One downside to these early models was that they were very, very complicated, involved a lot of multi-spin interactions, which made these models not very amenable to material realization. I'll come back to that point in just a minute. Slightly later, it was shown by me and Leo Razahowski that fractons have a much more concrete down-to-earth physical realization. Concrete down-to-earth physical realization as the topological defects of ordinary two-dimensional crystals. If you consider the dislocation and disclination defects of 2D solids, these type of defects have precisely the restricted mobility that we expect for fractons. And so in that sense, the first realization of fracton physics was really sitting under our nose for many decades and we just didn't realize it. Now, while fractons do exist in these systems to the extent that disclinations exist in a solid, there also is a problem in this kind of In a solid, there also is a problem in this context as well, which is that while the fractons are present, they're extremely energetically costly to try and separate them out. And actually, in the thermodynamic limit, it's not really possible to get an isolated fracton in this system. And so that makes our life very difficult if we wanted to isolate a fracton and manipulate it in any practical way. But despite these difficulties in getting in touch with experiments, the field of fractons has generated a whole lot of interest over the years, over these past couple of years. Over these past couple of years, for various reasons. I'll just tell you some reasons which have been interesting to me personally. Fractons exhibit a wide variety of unusual phenomenology, which we don't expect to see in other situations. For example, fractons can exhibit non-ergodic behavior, even in the absence of any sort of disorder in the system. Perhaps even more surprisingly, fractons can exhibit gravitational behavior in the sense of a universal attractive force between fractons. And perhaps most interestingly to many people, Most interestingly, to many people, there's the potential that the restricted mobility of fractons could somehow be harnessed for the purposes of quantum information storage. Although I would argue, and there's been some promising proposals along that direction, although I'd argue we still have a long way to go before we actually really practically know how to manipulate fractons for this purpose. But the question now becomes, well, where do we, oh sorry, skip the slide. So fractons are also interesting because of their many deep connections with various other fields in physics, such as range of elasticity. Such as changing from elasticity theory to higher RTIs, holographic behavior, and many other topics as well. So, fractons are really very interesting from a theoretical perspective. But if you go outside of this room of fracton experts right here, there's a lot of people in physics who would consider fractons to be just some theoretical curiosity, you know, some cute little Sudoku puzzle for theoretical physicists to work on, but not having anything to do with reality. And so, if we want to take fractons to the next stage and make it a To the next stage and make it a legitimate subfield of condensed matter physics, I think there's an important set of questions which we as theorists need to answer in order to bring the field into closer contact with experiments. First of all, can we construct simpler spin models for realizing fracton physics, which actually connect with some real physical materials? What new platforms are available for studying fracton physics, preferably ones which have fractons at a finite energy? And let's say you had fractons. And let's say you had fractons in your hands. What experimental signatures should you look for in order to tell that you actually have really gotten a fracton? So I'm going to try to touch briefly on all three of these questions during this talk. Of course, I'm not going to answer any of them fully. I may not answer some of them even well, but I think there's been some progress that's been made on answering some of these questions. Also, just as a bonus question for the smarter quantum information people in the room, I think there's a lot of work that needs to be done on once we actually have fractured. Once we actually have fractons, what do we actually do with them? I mean, how do we actually practically manipulate them for the purposes of quantum information storage? So here is my outline for the rest of this talk. So I already went through the introduction. Next, I'm going to briefly talk about some progress in constructing simpler spin-liquid models. Then I'll talk about some of the experimental diagnostics for fracton phases. And finally, I'm going to talk about just a couple of new platforms which have recently been discovered for research. Which have recently been discovered for realizing fracton physics. So, let's start in the spin-liquid context, which historically was where fractons first arose. So, as I mentioned earlier, fractons have been encountered in a wide variety of exactly solvable spin-liquid models, such as the Shimon model in Haas Code, and also the famous X-Cube model, Duke de Sager and others. And these models were all very instructive in terms of building up some theoretical understanding of what fractons are and what they do. Of what fractons are and what they do, but they had the undesirable feature that they all feature very complicated multi-spin beyond nearest neighbor interactions, which means that it is very unlikely that any of these models are going to be realized as is in any material system. But all hope is not lost here. There's been progress towards making simpler spin models, which do have some potential for being realized in experiments. Now, there's been a lot of work done on this, and I'm only going to give some sampling of a few things. And I'm only going to give some sampling of a few things which I have found particularly exciting, so please forgive me if I've missed your particular work. One advance, important advance, came in 2017 from Kit Slagel and Jung Kim, both of whom are here, that fracton physics can be realized in a model which features only nearest neighbor two-spin interactions on this three-dimensional honeycomb-based type of lattice. Now, to the best of my knowledge, this model also does not have some specific material realization in mind. Material realization in mind, but as proof of principle, it showed that fractons do not intrinsically require all these complicated multi-spin interactions which characterize the earliest models. So in this sense, the ingredients necessary for forming fracton phases are not necessarily any more complicated than the ingredients necessary for ordinary spin-liquid phases. Now, an even more recent development, which I personally found very exciting, came from this group out of Okinawa, where they showed that fracton physics can arise out of a Practon physics can arise out of a nearest neighbor model on the breathing pyrochlor lattice. It's sort of a spin-ice-like model. Breathing here essentially just means there's no symmetry between the two different types of tetrahedra on this pyrochlor lattice. And using only two spin-nearest neighborhood interactions, they showed that this system can actually be driven from a regular spin-ice phase into a fracton-type spin-ice phase. But the non-trivial secret extra ingredient they had to add here was the presence of strong. add here was the presence of strong Zhalosinsky-Maria interactions between spins. And importantly, they were able to identify a certain class of euterbium-based pyrochlor compounds as potential candidates for hosting fracton physics. Now, there hasn't been any concrete experimental results in that direction just yet, but what's important is that if experiments do start coming out on any of these materials, these systems feature a pretty clear experimental diagnostic. A pretty clear experimental diagnostic which we can look for to tell that we actually have encountered fracton physics. So I'm going to use that as the cheap segue into my next section on experimental diagnost. So are those models like for that particular model? Is that like a gapped or gapless? Gapless, sorry, I should have said that. So this is a, yeah, it's one of the U1 fracton models. And that's going to be important for this next part. So now I want to talk about how could you actually tell if you had fractons? Actually, tell if you had fractons sitting in your experiment? And this area is a little bit underdeveloped to my taste, but today I'll talk about two things that we actually do know. At least for the gapless fracton phases, we can observe certain pinchpoint singularities which provide very clear smoking gun evidence for U1 fracton behavior. And generically, fracton phases seem to exhibit glassy dynamics or in some cases localization without. Or, in some cases, localization without the presence of disorder in the system. So, those are about the two best ones that we know. There have been a couple of other signatures which have either been proposed or suggested, some correlation function diagnostics. In certain special circumstances, you can get a quantizal conductance, so that's very far from generic, so I don't really count that as one of the main ones. I also personally think there's probably some signature to be found in the dynamic spin structure factor, although that's never actually been calculated for any of these models. Calculated for any of these models. But for right now, let's focus on the things that we do know, such as pinch point singularities. Now, for those of you who are familiar with the theory of spin liquids, you'll know that pinch point singularities are an important tool for diagnosing various types of U1 spin liquid phases, such as these pyrochlorous spin-ice materials, which feature an emergent U1 gauge theory. In this case, it's an ordinary conventional Coulomb U1 gauge theory. And what you find in these systems is that if you count And what you find in these systems is that if you calculate the spin-spin correlation functions, they map onto correlation functions of the emergent electric field in this system. This is not the physical electric field, this is the emergent electric field. And many of these correlation functions feature a characteristic angular singularity of this sine 2 theta form, which looks something like this, where this correlation function changes sine a determined number of times as you go around this singular point. Around this singular point. And these pinch point singularities have been put to very good use. They've actually been found in experiment on some Titanate materials using polarized neutron scattering data. Using this data, they were able to measure spin-spin correlation functions, and they see precisely these pinch points, which is a good indication that you've actually realized a spin ice. Now, you can carry through the same game for the U1 fracton phases. So, as many of you know already, the U1. So, as many of you know already, the U1 fracton phases can be well described by symmetric tensor gauge theories, where the gauge or the gauge field is now a symmetric tensor object instead of a vector potential. And we also have corresponding tensor electric field and tensor magnetic field. So, for example, we can consider the simplest type of tensor gauge theory, which features a double divergence Gauss's law acting on a scalar value charge. And this weird Gauss's law immediately gives rise. Gauss's law immediately gives rise to two separate conservation laws, both conservation of charge and conservation of dipole moment, which is essentially what leads to the fracton behavior of this system. Now, you can carry through a couple of lines of algebra, which we did, all members of this group, you can calculate the electric field correlators of this tensor gauge theory, which in turn will determine the spin-spin correlators of your underlying spin model. And what we found, this is Found, this is largely some insight due to Sager, is that these electric field correlators carry this characteristic sine 4θ singularity, which looks a little bit like this. So whereas the conventional spin ice phases carry pinch point singularities with a two-fold symmetry pattern, the rank II U1 spin liquids have pinch point singularities with a four-fold symmetry pattern. And similarly, if you went up to rank three tensor gauge theories, you get even higher symmetry patterns than this. Patterns in this. And indeed, if we go back to this breathing pyrochlor model out of Okinawa, they did some numerics on it and they found that it exhibits precisely the expected four-fold pinch point structure. So that's good to know that this system is actually exhibiting the fracton behavior that we expect. Can I ask you a stupid question? I don't know much about Spinnichlis, but is there a belief that it's the only thing that leads to this four-fold entry-point singularities or are there other There are currently no other known mechanisms for generating this four-fold pinch point structure. So, I mean, it's not impossible that there could be one, but there's no known one currently. But at the moment, there's a similar sort of the classical model. What's that? This is a classical algorithm. What's that? Classical static color. Yeah, yeah. So this actually will hold for, I mean, the general idea behind these pinch points works for either. The general idea behind these pinch points works for either quantum or classical spin liquids. I believe all the experimental data for the ordinary spin liquids is in the classical case, and in this case as well. But so yeah, you can just look at classical, I mean, the thermal correlators in these systems. In the spin ice case, electric field, electric field correlator, spin-spin correlator. Right. So here this tensor tensor electric field is also a spin-off. So, it's also a spin operator here. Yes, yes. So, the emergent electric field also maps onto one of the microscopic spin operators. And so, there's some complicated structure factor which will map the elements of this tensor onto the spins on the pyrochlor lattice. But yeah, all the spin-spin correlators will map directly onto these electric field correlators. But for regular spin-ice, the pinch points disappear for quantum spin ice because then the collations decay as one over r quartic. Mm-hmm. And in in this fractal case, you expect that also the quantum case would have these pinch points? So, I mean, in the so in the quantum case, you're right, there's a different, there's a different scaling. There's a decay factor, but there still is some singularity that you can see. I mean, it has a singularity at it has a singularity at the origin, like near r equals zero. I think so. I mean, maybe I'm getting this wrong, but I think for a break I think for regular quantum spinners I think that they they just mirror I mean they are no pin points anymore. Okay. Because it's like basically dipolar in in three plus one dimensions and then they don't have to milk. Oh you're talking about with uh I mean long range interactions between the spins. No. Or just short range. Okay. I mean you can talk about it if you want to. Okay, yeah, that would be good to talk about it. But if you look at a dynamical correlated quantum model, we have some structure there. It's not the same as the usual, you know, it all comes from just Gauss's local control. It all comes from just Gauss's law constraint. Right. But at fire frequency, maybe it's some structure. It's not the same mid-point. Did you still do the equal timing thing for quantum? It would still frequency. No, if you don't, if you basically integrate, like the classical correlations, if you basically would, if you take time correlation. My memory, but I might be wrong, is that if you take My memory that I might be wrong is that if you calculate the equal time operations for classical spin ice, you get one over oxygen. Yes. And if you just do the same thing for quantum, those pinch points disappear. Yes, sir. So you have to look at the fire frequency response. Yeah, then you would see the substructure there. Okay. But it's not here, of course. This is the static quantities. Yeah. But yeah, I'd be interested to hear more about that afterwards. All right. So another key signal. Alright, so another key signature for fracton physics is found in their non-ergotic behavior at finite temperature. So a fractons at zero temperature can just remain locked in place forever. But once you go up to finite temperature, you have the problem that a fracton can move around by interacting with a bath of thermally excited dipoles. And in three dimensions, at least, it was shown that this mechanism can eventually cause a fracton system to reach thermal equilibrium. However, that approach is a very important thing to do. Thermal equilibrium. However, that approach to equilibrium is very, very slow. It's actually a logarithmically slow relaxation to equilibrium. So, this is a manifestation of classy dynamics or asymptotic MDL, even in the presence, even without the presence of disorder. This is some work led by Avanav Brem, and John Wena is here too. Now, in certain special systems, such as Haas code, the relaxation is even slower than that. So the relaxation time is not just exponential, but actually super exponential. Just exponential, but actually super exponential in the inverse temperature. So, at low temperatures, a system can maintain a memory of its initial conditions for ridiculously long times, older than the age of the universe, if you like. And so, while it's not technically a perfect memory, it is a perfect memory for all practical intents and purposes. Now, in lower dimensions, even weirder things can happen. So, in certain special fracton systems, at least, fractons in one dimensions can maintain a permanent memory of their initial. Dimensions can maintain a permanent memory of their initial conditions. So, this is some work done in collaboration with Shri Abai, who's a grad student at Boulder, and also Rahul Nankishore, where we constructed a minimal model for fracton time evolution in one dimension in the form of a random unitary circuit. So, random unitary circuits are useful because of the most generic form of time evolution, which only have this uh whatever structure you give to it. And in this case, the structure we were giving to it uh was uh conservation of charge and dipole moment in order to simulate the physics of fractons. In order to simulate the physics of fractons. And in this first model, which was a minimal model using three-side gates, what we found was that the model actually maintained a permanent memory of its initial conditions. If you put a fracton at some particular location, it would remember that location out to arbitrarily late times, which you can measure by the expectation value that the fracton is at that position. Now, it was pointed out to us later by another group that By some other group, by another group, that this perfect localization actually does not persist all the way to arbitrarily long-range interactions. And so it actually only lasts when you have nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor interactions. But once you go out to third-nearest neighbor interactions, the perfect localization begins to break down. And in that case, you get back into the regime of just slow thermalization or glassy dynamics. But in either case, fractons are generically very, very slow to reach thermal equilibrium. So, in the last part of this talk, I want to talk about just a couple of new platforms which have been proposed for realizing fracton physics. So I'm a little short on time, but I'm just going to give you sort of a schematic overview of some of these ideas. So the first one is you can actually find fracton behavior by looking at the motion of holes doped into an anti-ferromagnetic background. This is some work in collaboration with John Seuss. In collaboration with John Seuss, who's a postdoc at Columbia. And we sort of revisited an older fact, an older known fact, which is that if you consider the motion of a hole moving through an icing antiferromagnetic background, it's actually very hard for that hole to move around because every time the hole moves, it creates a bunch of energetically costly spin misalignments. And that's very analogous to the fact that when a fracton moves, it has to create an energetically costly dipole behind it. Dipole behind it. But if you look at a bound state of two holes, this dipole of holes can actually move around the system freely without any energy cost whatsoever. And so this closely mimics the behavior of fracton physics. And just to see how well that analogy holds up, we can model this with a schematic toy model. So this toy model features fermions F, which represent the holes, and also bosons B, which represent the spin-flip excitations, or Magnons. Flip excitations or Magnons. And what's notable about this model is that in the fermion hopping term, every time a fermion hops, it has to either create or destroy a spin-flip excitation. And if you analyze this model perturbatively and some of the parameters of this theory, what you find is that the dipoles move at second order in perturbation theory, whereas the single holes move only at sixth order in perturbation theory. So the upshot is that this is not true, perfect fracton behavior in this system, but nevertheless. Behavior in this system, but nevertheless, there is a broad parametric regime between second and sixth order and perturbation theory where approximate fracton behavior holds. And it turns out that that's enough to actually see some interesting fracton phenomenology. For example, you can show that the gravitational attraction between fractons continues to hold in an approximate setting as long as the fracton behavior is not violated too strongly. So, as long as you only have weak violations of fracton behavior, the particles in the system will still attract. The particles in the system will still attract each other. And indeed, in this case, we showed that the gravitational attraction between fractons maps onto the well-known Magnon-mediated attraction between holes in a whole-doked antiferromagnet, which has been proposed as a potential source of pairing glue for the formation of superconductivity in whole-doked antiferromagnets. Can you show that it does not phase separate? So in some cases, it actually might. So that's one of the features of this we're probably a little unsure of. Of this, we're probably a little unsure of is that depending on the interactions, in some of these situations, you can get short-range attraction and long-range repulsion, in which case the system actually will phase separate. So, that depends on some more details of the specific model you're considering. There it breaks down. So, yeah. So, that's another source in which it breaks down. So, already in the nearest neighbor model, fract time behavior breaks down at sixth order in perturbation theory. It's sixth order in perturbation theory. The model, the fractal behavior, will also break down if you add in next nearest neighbor hopping. So then it becomes a quantitative question: which is stronger, sixth order in nearest neighbor or first order in second nearest neighbor. And that depends on which type of system you're considering. So, right, so it's maybe too strong of a claim to try and say anything quantitative about the relationship between superconductivity and hold-off antiferromagnets and fracton physics. Magnets and fracton physics. But it is nice to know that there's some sort of connection between these two types of systems. All right, the next realization of fractons, which I want to mention, which has just sort of gotten started more recently, is imposing fracton behavior via the presence of a linear potential. So if you have a linear potential, which grows as x, and you crank up the strength of that potential enough, then conservation of energy is basically going. Then, conservation of energy is basically going to dictate that you have conservation of dipole moment if the potential term is dominating over the kinetic term in the system. To the best of my knowledge, I believe the first time this connection between linear potentials and fractons was first put into the literature was in this PNAS out of Caltech. And they showed that with the presence of a strong enough linear potential, you actually can get non-ergotic behavior. The same type of non-ergotic behavior that we expect in fracton systems. Furthermore, this idea of connecting Furthermore, this idea of connecting fractons to linear potentials is one of, I think, one of the low-hanging fruits for making contact with experiments, since there are already some experimental results using ultra-cold atoms in tilted lattices, where they had a weak, some results out of Princeton, where they had a weak linear potential, and they showed that even in the presence of a weak linear potential, you can already get things like slow sub-diffusive behavior. So, this isn't in the regime yet where we can actually experimentally see. Regime yet, where we can actually experimentally see fracton behavior, but it's a step in that direction. Along the same lines, there's some work I did in collaboration with Sharia Pai, where we showed that you can also get fracton behavior via an internal linear potential. Instead of imposing an external linear potential, you can just consider the linear potential that comes from confinement in one dimension. And we showed is that various 1D confining models. 1D confining models can be mapped fairly exactly onto fracton Hamiltonian. And this is nice because many of these 1D confining models are already known to exhibit various non-ergotic features, such as localization and quantum many-body scars. And furthermore, confining models also have a potential of being simulated in cold atom systems. So I consider linear potentials to be one of the very promising areas for connection with experiment in the coming years. Years. Finally, and I promise this is the last thing, I'll keep this short and fun. So, another area where fractons might be realized is in the context of electric circuits. So, in the past couple of years, there's been a lot of progress on simulating topological phases just using ordinary classical electric circuits. So, if you hook up this lattice of capacitors and inductors in just the right way, it can give rise to a sort of electrical topological insulator, which features Topological insulator, which features these robust electrical modes flowing around the edge of the system. So, a natural question to ask is: can we use classical electric circuits to also simulate the behavior of reptons? And the answer turns out to be yes. I'm not going to go into too much gory detail, but the basic idea is that the circuit element which you really need to make this work is a transformer. And the reason for that is that a transformer has the ability to induce the current in a second wall. Induce a current in a second wire based off of the current flowing through one wire. And if you choose the windings in this transformer appropriately, you can make it so that there's perfect counterflow between these two wires, which makes it very easy to construct a dipole-conserving circuit, which I did in some work. So in this circuit, I'll just sort of schematically describe it. I have a lattice here of capacitors, which are intended to store the charge of the system. Intended to store the charge of the system. And connecting these capacitors are these transformers. And the role that the transformers are playing is they're ensuring that any flow of charge from 2 to 1 is counterbalanced by an equal and opposite flow going from 2 to 3. And the result is that the dipole moment of charge in this circuit is conserved. And there's a very simple diagnostic which you can use to make sure the dipole actually is being conserved in this system by looking at the steady state of. By looking at the steady state of the charge distribution or voltage distribution across these capacitors. So let's say I start with all the charge on one of the capacitors. Well, at late times, if there weren't these transformers in the way, you would expect that all the charge would become equally distributed over all of the capacitors. But in the presence of dipole conservation imposed via these transformers, what you get is that the length time charge configuration actually has this characteristic linear form, where it increases linear. Linear form, where it increases linearly from one capacitor to the next. And that turns out to be the minimum energy configuration consistent with dipole conservation. That's just a nice sanity check that the circuit which we designed to have dipole conservation actually does exhibit dipole conservation in the end. And this opens up what I think are a lot of interesting new directions. For example, can we use quantum superconducting circuits in order to directly simulate the more familiar The more familiar quantum fracton models. Also, there are various analogies between electric circuits and other types of physical platforms. For example, if you recall your freshman electromagnetism, there's a nice analogy between circuits and mechanical systems. So can we construct mechanical fractons in some sense? This is also partially inspired by this work by Vitelli on making mechanical topological insulators. I think there's going to be some possibility of simulating. I think there's going to be some possibility of simulating fractons in photonic systems. And also, there's a connection between circuits and hydraulics. I don't really know what to do with that information right now, but I don't think hydraulic fractons are out of the question. So let's just keep it on the table. Okay, so I think I want to end now with this summary that fractons are kind of on the cusp of experimental realization. And I expect that they probably will be realized within the next couple of years, decade. It's difficult to make those predictions. It's difficult to make those predictions. But fractons are just starting to be experimentally realized. And we're going to start to, we as theorists, really start to need, really need to start hammering out some more experimental diagnostics to keep experimentalists interested in this and give them some guidance on what they actually need to look for. And I think it's also going to be a very useful program to consider what other new platforms do we have for fracton physics, which might be more amenable to. Physics, which might be more amenable to experimental realization. And at the end of the day, what we want to do is we want to take fractons from being something which formerly were something completely in fantasy land and make them into something you can really hold in the palm of your hand. So with that, I will thank you for your attention. So in your picture singularity, So in your pincher singularity, if you want to get a six-fold symmetry, do you need a tensor three? Three-fold tensor? If I remember this correctly, three-fold has, sorry, rank three tensor has an eight-fold symmetry. So I think it's only powers of two. Sager, rank three is eight-fold. Am I remembering that correctly? Yeah. So how did you get six-folds? I don't know how to get sixfolds. classical version of platforms, the circuits, the hydro. Do we expect similar signature for like dynamics or workplace? So that's a really good question. So I've been a little bit cheating here where I came up with sort of an ad hoc diagnostic for dipole conservation in this case for this electronic. In this case, for this electric circuit, one thing that makes this very hard is that it's not quantized to charge anymore in this classical circuit. And so you can't talk about one fracton remaining localized anymore. That one fracton can just sort of ooze out. I mean, there's no quantization of charge in this particular system. Now, the game would change entirely if we could actually implement this in some superconducting quantum circuit, quantum dots, and actually work with quantized charge. But if you don't have quantization of charge, I think that. Have quantization of charge, I think that the metrics you need to look for are different. So, in this case, I came up with one, you know, just an ad hoc one, just to satisfy the purpose. I've been trying to think about ways that you could look for signatures of gravitational physics in these circuits, but at the moment I don't really have something particularly convincing. But back to a comment about the quarks, I just say a few words. Usually, when we say how can we see deconfined quarks, there are two ways. One is that we go to high temperature plates, which we move out on a common basis. And in the case what Michael talked, perhaps we are still exploring the common phase at zero temperature and even though there's a restrained mobility, but we still can see fragments at Fractal means at zero temperature. Is that right? Yeah. Well, in a quark case, either you need to go to high temperature, it's not quantum, it's high temperature plasma one way. The other way is I look at the domain rule. In certain cases of pure gauge theory with certain domain rule, actually you can see deconfined quarks in one lower dimension. So perhaps we switch to the definition. Perhaps we speak to the definition you have, quark is not fractal, but once you get into the quark gluon plasma, I mean the quark becomes deconfined and mobile. Is that the way? Yes. Okay. Yes. But high temperature. I see. Yeah. And the other way is that actually, suppose we take a pure Young-Mills gait theory with some topological terms. Actually, you can see some high quarks and a 2 plus 1 dwarf or a 3 plus 1 d forks theory. You will see there are some. Theory. You will see there is some 2 plus 1 d TQ of T. That TQ of T has some anions, and the anions actually is a decompile quarks. Where the Wilson minus 2 plus 1d ends on 2 plus 1D will have the decompiant quarks. So there's two ways. In the second case, actually, you can see this quarks at the low dimensions and by zero temperature. In the first case, you need to go to high temperature. That's two ways, then. It depends on your definition. Perhaps cost may. Definition, perhaps cost may or may not be maybe according to some definitions that's all I probably have an answer to your question, but can you go about your antiferromagnet in halts? So there is this mobility that you get in high-electron perturbation theory, right? Is it at this point conceptually even useful to think about fractons? Can you just say that this? Supposed to think about fractons, can you just say that these are very heavy effects of mass holes? Yeah, I mean, the reason why I say that it's useful to think about it in the fracton language is because certain aspects of fracton behavior still survive. I mean, the part that I think is interesting is that they still attract each other. And it depends on some details, as I was discussing earlier, whether there could be some extra repulsion in the system which wins out. But the fact that But the fact that the particles tend to move, they want to move together a lot more than they want to move by themselves, it does lead to this gravitational behavior. And I'm not sure what else it leads to other than, well, if you have an isolated hole, it should presumably also take a while for it to reach thermal equilibrium as well. But that's the sense in which I think it's useful to view it through a fracton lens. So when this Gauss law is just energetic and a little bit broken, there is still something that allows us to do it. Still, something that allows us to distinguish. Yeah. Say that there is a limit somehow close to the fractal phase. Yeah, exactly. So most of the stuff closer to reality was based in some way or related to the Perkin U1 gauge theories, right? Only one of them was. So the pinch points is based off of U1 gauge theories. This theory. Uh this theory isn't gauged at all. And then uh yeah, this theory is also not gauged. And then I don't even know what to call this one, this is fun with fractons. But maybe like this more general class model, is there any chance, well definitely not the classical ones, even the quantum ones, of still having like a quantum memory with these fractons-like things? Even in the gauge theories, right? That's a good question. I don't know. I mean, like I said, in this case, I think there is the potential that we actually could somehow make We actually could somehow make quantum versions of these circuits, in which case I think, sure. I mean, there should be a way to store quantum memory in this case. The other ones, probably not. There's probably no sort of phase coherence you can maintain. And then in your random circuit model, that's like a classical memory it maintains? Or is it Basically, yeah, there's no there's n it's not any phase information that's stored. Do you know anything where it's like a quantum memory in these not lettuce models? These not Latinas model, not like Unispin model. Yeah, but that's I could say it's not my area of expertise. Did you think about the partner version of that rank to spinize models behavior in the block connect the the model the the spin the classical spin model that leads to this random essential random voltage of the spin ice model. Ranger module of the spin ice model. So do I have thoughts on like how to make it quantum? Uh not not off the top of my head. No. Because um for the usual spin ice, right, the the hygiene variable maps to electric field and the transverse part gives you this quantum dynamics, right? So that's why you know essentially the say x and y component x like e to the i Component acts like E to the I vector potential. On the other hand, the Z component acts like the electric field. So they are connected. That's the way one dialogue is constant. In this case, I just glanced at the paper. Looks like they are using all components, X, Y, Z component, the classical screen, to represent this manifold that gives you this control. So, what you need to So, what you need to do is to introduce some degree of freedom that actually acts like a magnetic field as a vector potential. Because the only thing they have is essentially a vector field. So, do you think about this? I haven't thought about it, no. For the questions, thank you to the co and also all of us. Nicole, and also all the speakers of the morning. So we have
