All right, for our final talk this morning, we have Jia Ching who will tell us about asymptotic and metabolic Einstein. Yeah, thank you very much. Thanks to organizers for the invitation. I really enjoyed the meeting so far. It's a great place. So I'm going to talk about symmetric hyperbolic and stand manifold. Manifold. So it's good that simple hyperbolic manifold has been introduced several times. I'm going to do a little bit of detailed work to clarify some things. So for that, I'm going to start with the definition again. But I'll pay attention to the regularity a little bit more because I'm going to cover the regularity results. out. To introduce a CK alpha conformally compact manifold, I need to introduce the principle the manifold is something that with the interior smooth and the boundary of a regularity CK1 plus alpha to facilitate the CK alpha conformity compact metric. And defining function that we're going to have That we're going to have the regularity CK plus one alpha, and then those are properties to define the boundary and then non-degenerate at boundary for the row to be defined function. So now conformally compact manifold with specific regularity. So again, we're going to assume the manifold has a CK1. CK1, CK plus 1 alpha boundary. I think this is something that is not very satisfactory in the sense that the definition is somehow extrinsic. That if you talk about the remaining manifold here, then you are adding some extra things. It caused a lot of trouble to when we consider, say, compactness issues about about those manifolds. Those manifolds. So, in a way, we'll deal with this. But now, I'm still going to use this definition. It's going to be posed as some boundaries and with regularities. And the compactifier with the defining function then is sent to the closure with regularity specified here. So, this is CK plus 1, not C. Sorry for the M typo. All right, so that's the Alright, so that's the conformity compact of CK alpha. Then for any compact conformity compact manifold, it's good that look at the compactified metric, then induce a metric on the boundary. And because when you vary the defining functions, really you're getting this conformal class, therefore you're getting a conformal You're getting a conformal infinity, a conformal boundary, there's a conformal structure on the boundary associated with this conformal compact manifold. That's sort of a nice and in many ways the motivation for me that coming from conformal geometry to take this as a good way to study conformal geometry, turn that into possibly study the remaining geometries. Javi's so conformally compact enzyme. I want to clarify some terminology first. So we heard people saying conformally compact energy. Of course, I also will specify the regularities. We're also going to interest in love time the symptotic herbotic. Symptotic herbolatic in this case are very similar to the symptotic flat. It's not just To be simply flat, it's not just ask the curvature co-signet one, it's actually asked to be conformally compact first. Then you have this condition on the boundary, and you also have a symptomic herbordic nstrank. Okay, so the so if you have a symptomic herbal n stand, then you can derive, you can get a so-called geodesicity defined by. A so-called George density-defined function that can put the metric in the canonical form in the neighborhood of infinity. So that's very nice. If you do this and assume the metric is Einstein, Fragment Graham observed this expansion up to certain place. Let me say a little bit more about the expansion. So before the So before the first of all, there's only even terms up to the T of N this mentioned by Clause in both cases. But G of N, the G n is for the even dimension and H, they are trace free. Trace-free or trace became a curvature, the trace curvature. And the n is R for G n is trace-free. So the traceless part of the G of N is going to be now local in the sense that it's not going to be given by curvatures of G hat. So it's defined, sort of determined by the global behavior of the G plus, not just by nearby behaviors. Just by nearby behaviors. Next divergence free. This formal expansion is formal expansion determines only by t hat and then the non-local term. And it's just interesting that if you look at the expansions in the even dimension, you have this log term. So therefore, the h, the coefficient, becomes what they called abstraction tensor. Abstraction tensor. So, this is if you expect the Enstant matrix to be conformally compact, smoothly conformally compact, then we would expect the expansion to be no log terms. So that's why when you have H0, then you will not have any log terms. So, I will just call this expansion in some terminology. Say polyformed is in the Polyhomogeneous in the five and gram sense. Okay, but of course, polyhomogeneous can be even more general, but I'll do this. Okay, so let me just clarify the regularity problems. So you assume that your manifold is CK alpha conformally compact assembly. And you're assuming that you have a smooth representative. Assuming that you have a smooth representative of the boundary conformal structure, then you ask: can we always get this polyformal genus smooth as Fatman-Graham observed? So that's the regularity issue you can articulate. So if you do this, then of course the CK alpha, the initial regularity, first of all, you need whether or not you need, or possibly minimum ones that you would like. Minimum ones that you would like? Hi. Okay. Just a question. Yes. Expander, because I'm not familiar with it. How many regularities? I mean, a couple of hours of the term, as I said. How many regularities do you require for... Yeah, I'm doing formal one at this point. Formal one means I'm assuming smooth language. No, no, it's no, I mean it's G these coefficients G2 and so on. They're defined by G bar, as I said. By g bar, as I said, and there are some operators in g bar. Like, I mean, are the differential, I mean, like the map from G hat to the power. Oh, those are all curvatures. Curvatures are also derivatives. Stereotypes also, of course, high order. So, my question is: how much regularity do you require to add for computing builds coefficients? Well, it depends on the order, I'm guessing. It's the k order or 2k with even, it's gonna be 2k minus 2 or 2k plus 2. Right? So the curvature, then the derivative of curvature. So the plus some very valuable. Yeah, yes. Yes. Yes. Um, okay. So that the it's it's very nice that uh Couchet delay B Skinner. Lay B scanner 2005 give a very nice result. So suppose its starting point is C2, then up to C2 alpha call of different morphism, then you get the Five Man gram expansion. So that's very nice. But of course, there is little things, technical things that you would like to see whether or not it can be improved, which is the C2 here. Which is C2 here, that you are getting C2 alpha color if you're morphism. So that's supposed to be only support the C1 alpha structure. So in other words, you're going to alternate the C2 structure boundary if you only do C2 alpha. So that's something we're going to improve as a starting point for me to do the regularity. Date and then I will use this opportunity to derive local estimate than going to full compactness result. So let me start with this. Indeed, you can get rid of the C2, but the issue, I'm glad that it's mostly just calculus. So we'll be able to, hopefully, I'll be able to say it very okay. Okay. Sorry, can I ask the question? Maybe it's the same question as Yasao said. So the boundary is to me completely surprising. The boundary is only C2. No, no, no, the boundary. You see, the boundary, the structure is C2, and the boundary has a representative smooth. I see infinity smooth. Yeah, bounds. I should have it smooth. Okay, I saw it. You assume boundary is smooth. Okay. But the structure is starting point is only. Structure is starting point is only C2 or C1 plus alpha. Yes. So the conclusion of this issue really is also related to the use of terminology, conformally compact N-stand and the symptomic harmonic N-stand. In in C one alpha case, it's already caused some trouble. C two case has no trouble. C2Ks have no trouble. I'll tell you a little bit more. This is what I mean by mostly calculus. It's good that when you have this regularity, the temperature indeed goes to negative one in a pretty good rate. So it's very good. All right. So what's the problem? Why I say it's just a calculus. So if you calculate the curvature for the G plus, For the G plus, in terms of the G bar, the compactified one, and we assume compactified is C1, alpha, or C2. If it's C2, will be so nice. Remember, the rho has a C2 alpha. Rho is C2 alpha. So the first term that indicates how the curvature. But then we need to control the rest of the terms, especially when the T far does not have enough regularity. For example, if the G far For example, in the G5 C2 that we started for the crucial and delay and Lee and Skinner started, if the curvature is good, at least continues, then this equation is very general, very good to even take boundary values. Right? So that boundary value will force this term. This term, the norm of the d row with the g bar vector is equal to one, if set by n sign equation. This part is n sign. So therefore, if it's a g2, that's why I'm saying when you g2, then the conformally compact n-stand is synthetic, synthetic hard body n-stand. Remember, synthetic hard body doesn't require conformally compact. So the other direction is always automatic. So C2 is okay. So C2 is okay. C2, there's no confusion for both. But C1 alpha, it's the issue here. You cannot take the boundary value right away. So I'm going to solve this issue, I say technical issue a little bit. So you cannot do that, but we do some work. So of course, this is about C2 case. So C1 alpha case, the statement is that you can. The statement is that you cannot look at the scalar curvature of g bar at the boundary. But if you time the row square, then you would like to say how we can do it. In fact, you expect that to be zero at boundary. And in fact, we can do even more that just multiply row is enough to make it become zero at the boundary, even though it does not automatically seem. If you have that, then you are getting the Einstein conditions. The Einstein equations implies that this conformal complication will have totally geodesic boundaries. So the second, the hashing of the row is the zero boundary. Okay, so how are we going to do that to get around with this non-regular issues? So, if you look at the curvature formulas, so the second one, Ricci and right, so you multiply rho square, you multiply rho square, then you'll get the regularity. So, now the issue is that I'm going to use the regularity of this term to imply regularity of the matrix. So, that is the need harmonic coordinate. But this one is harmonic coordinate with boundary, it's done early. Early detergent. I think Michael Anderson also used this. So, whenever you have a point on a boundary, you can have a domain, a neighborhood where you can have the harmonic coordinate with coordinate on boundary given by boundary coordinate, choice of boundary coordinate. So, if you do that, then I'm going to write the matrix in the Z coordinate and matrix in the theta coordinate, the original coordinate. Coordinate, the original coordinate. And then just calculation that for the matrix Z coordinate, if you take it to root with respect to theta, second order, and multiply rho square, it's all going to be zero. Okay, which will imply the this is going to be zero and this is going to be zero. Then that solves the issue. Because if you go back to the curvature formula, then the last one tells you. Then the last one tells you that if this term is zero, then naturally this term is going to be called one. So it's symptomatic hybrid. So the Einstein implies symptomic hyperbolic, even this regularity. Okay, so once you know that C is symptomatic hypotenuse, you do a similar thing. You're going to, let me skip this tech fish because I'm worried about it about timing. So once you have that, then you can look at the second. At the second equation, multiplied with rho. And then, because of the symptomatic hyperbolic is already known, then we know that the curvature, this curvature is good, C alpha. Just modify rows would enough make this C alpha. Then again, apply the calculation in the harmonic coordinate, you can also get the curvature. First of all, the matrix, then the curvature, time row. row and it's regular at the zero at the boundary. So that solves the issue that you can only require C1 alpha to say that Einstein equation at the boundary implies it's going to be symptomic abolic. Okay, so that clarifies some often technically technically confusing that people use different terminologies and all right so what what's Alright, so what's even more significant is that now you can use this decay that we got and the starting defining function has the property. Now you can change the coordinate so that the row becomes almost Jodesic, almost in the sense that to a certain order. I'm not going to To cause anything for regularity, getting some defined function where if you multiply row square to the compatify to complify, then the matrix will locally look like this. So this part is what we know from the boundary. Okay, so this became the starting point for both. Point for both two groups of people. One I mentioned Crushet and four people, and the other two people is Biquai and Kirsty. They actually started from here. Assuming that you have this, then you do the regularity issue. Okay? Next, what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the route most. Take the route most likely, most similar to Picquois and Frasique. But the idea is most the same. For cliché and for people, they find the to use the Einstein equation to do regularity, you need, of course, to choose a better coordinate. And we did it with the global neighborhood of the boundary. And what we do is we do the. And what we're going to do is we're going to do just like BQA and Fresh League to do local to do local. Okay. So to do local, I'm going to use the language a little bit different from the quiet. I take from the starting point from the Mobus chart introduced by Zhang Li. I think that's a beautiful way to treat the symptomic hyperbolic. When he tried to do these. When he tried to do the so-called Fredhoin theory for symptotic hyperbolic manifold. In other words, do some analysis on symptotic hyperbolic manifold. And then how do we say, how do we use the symptomic hyperbolicity? The way to do that is to look at the Mobius chart, particularly in Mobius chart at boundary. So I'm going to focus on the boundary mobile chart. So, look at the half-space model, and there's a region that I'm going to so that's the region I will denote by A, H, and the size. That's the That's the parameter space that I want to have. Okay, remember, we are often more interested in the boundary at infinity with respect to the Hubbard metric for this region. So that's how I denote the partial zero as the boundary at infinity for this. Okay, you see that in including metric, but the upper body metric is really spound at the increase. Make sure this real is found at the beginning. So, to get the mobile chart, we first start with background parametrization. So suppose this is the manifold, and this is the boundary, and the point, then you have good parametrization, and you And you like to say somehow there's region I can parametrize by region from the hub of body space. So suppose you have this as a background coordinate where the theta is from the u into some theta u in Rn. So that's a chart. And then I'm going to use the I'm going to use the capital theta to be the theta and rho. Rho is a defined function. And that will be some domain in the xn plus 1 to the rn plus 1 plus. Okay, so I guess the image is going to be omega. This is omega cross zero epsilon. Itself. If that's the as with the boundary, see the boundary, the boundary at infinity. So this is the background coordinate chart. Okay. Then I want to define the somehow somehow more nicer the Somehow, more nicer, the region will call that the Z at the point hat with size R. It's the movie chart in this manifold. I want to, so this is defined to be the capital C inverse of the theta rho from the omega promise. Sorry. Sorry, I'll do that. I want to be a little bit more. This is coordinate. So I want this theta away from theta hat is size R and I want the row to be also R so that they have some size. By the way, I'm going to use this as a normal colon date. So normal calling anyway, respect to G-hat. Okay, so because I want to have a notion of a size of such coordinate and the size at this point determined by the g-hat. So g hat is choosing, then I have the sense of size. Have the sense of size, and that's where you get the size. It's okay. And then I have the parametrization. I'm using the phi. And the B stands for the boundary or movies boundary movies boundary. And P hat and R and define to be the theta inverse of Uh the hat is the p is p is the coordinate of p hat. Then there's r and then I'm using x then there's r y now this is the parametrization from a h one to z p hat r Okay, so this can be small, very small, but this one is a fixed. Then that depends on choice of R to look at this movie's chart or movies parametrization, a boundary movie's parametrization. Okay, so Okay, so the NEMA Zhang Li was able to establish is the key to set up the stage to do the analysis. That what do you mean by symptomic hypervoltic precisely means that if you use this mobile parameterization pullback G plus to this region, then it's very close to Hypervoltic metric. So, what Giang Li need to establish the fractal theory is to do the parametrics. And to do parametrics, you split into chart. There's an interior movie chart, then there's a finite boundary movie chart. When you are in the boundary movie chart, it's very close to hyperbolic. Therefore, there's a way to do the parametrics. And that's the way. And that's the way generally get the parametrics and get the analysis going to establish at least the flat home theories. Okay, but for us, I'll tell you that this is not enough. We would like to have some weighted estimate. And then the way to do that is going to change this reference metric. So you're going to choose better reference metric instead. So, you're going to choose a better reference metric instead of a hyperbolic metric. Okay, so you ask the regularity of the boundary metric that will be involved, right, to get a better reference metric. Okay, cool. So, let's do the first iteration. So, for the homogeneous for them to get the polyhomogeneous smoothness, then there is just the iteration. Then there is just the iteration. Okay, you get a bad estimate assuming the boundary regularity is good enough. So allow you to do iteratively. Then you have to change the reference metric to get better estimate. I'll tell you more. You will be more clear about what do I mean I need a better reference to get better weight while the weight is involved. Evolved just in a minute. So, for example, the first iteration is to replace the eight Hubble metric by this, which is better fit for this G plus. Therefore, you are getting not only the control, but you're getting control with the weight. Okay, with weight. So, this is the sort of first step. And then, next one, of course, is trying to use the Einstein equation. And to use the Einstein equation, here is something that, so-called the harmonic boundary. I'll give this name, but I think the harmonic is there. This is harmonic boundary movers contraction. So, not only the boundary movers, but you ask to be. But you ask to be your parametrization to be harmonic in order to use the enzyme equation. So, therefore, the harmonic map or diffeomorphism is in addition to fallback this of G pass, you will need this harmonic map between these two spaces where the manifold is giving. The manifold is giving us S. Sorry, this is model Y. This is A. This is the AH1. So you look at the pullback by the Mobile parametrization of G plus, and you look at it's close to the H tilde plus that we as a reference metric we mentioned. And they are very close. Even in the weighted norm, they're very close. The weighted norm, they're very close. So, therefore, very nice that there's a lot of detail in the clouche and four people's paper to tell you how to construct such map, which is harmonic, not only harmonic, but also diffeomorphism. We found that a very good way to make it a diffeomorphism is to. To have a different morphism, is you're looking for a vector field instead of this map. So you think of this map is moving by a vector field. So you're looking for the vector field so that this at H to be harmonic. And it turns out there is exactly a result in or using the elliptic equation on symptomatic hyperbolic space. Space. So, in terms of the estimate and the existence, so perturbation theories. So, they got this harmonic map, harmonic tupheomorphism. So, we have this chart. The argument in the Biqua and Coast League is similar. Okay, so I think this is very significant. In a way that if we are looking back at that theories about Einstein manifolds, right, the harmonic chart is very important. And the compactness of a harmonic matrix very much depends on the behavior of harmonic videos and things like that. Now we have harmonic coordinate. This time the change is the The change is the nature that if you look at the local behavior, your reference metric is including a metric. That's why you can call it a model coordinate. And it's a local nature. But for symptomatic hyperbole case, especially for the boundary module chart, in terms of the non-compact metric, the symptomic hyperbole metric, it's actually a very large region. Right? It's a very large region. But it's because of its But it's because of it, it's more or less cosharmotic. So you can get this harmonic coordinate. Now the target, the target is no longer the target is no longer Euclidean metric, but it's the syntax harmonic metric. But you get this harmonic coordinate, boundary movements coordinate, okay, with the size, size control. Size size controlled by size key. Okay? You may call that harmonic readers if you want. All right. So let's look at the linearization first, then I'll tell you the Einstein equation, or more precisely, the so-called gauge Einstein equation. So for the linearization, the operator is going to be The operator is going to be each knowledge operator plus 2n, and it is bounded in this space we are looking at, and it's invertible where the weight is between 0 and that is invertible. So this is the Lippet theory established at least from early work of the Graham and Lee. Graham and Lee, and then Li had notes on the federal theory on the Syngotic House volume. Manifold has very detailed discussion about this. So the weight, in other words, you want to use the weighted estimate. Okay, so of course, in comparison to previous regularity work, for example, Anderson Mike Anderson is some regularity. Anderson is some regulated work for example, particularly in four dimensions, where he wanted to do it on the compact, meaning compact with boundary. But if you want to do compact, then the matrix is conformally Einstein. And in four dimension, of course, you can say it's Bach flat. So the Bach equation instead of the Einstein equation. So then you can do the fourth order elliptic theories on the manifold with boundary. That's fine. But you lose something. Fine, but you lose something. I think it's better to go with the Einstein equation and on the non-compact settings with the weighted estimate. Okay, I'll tell you how to translate this to you a little bit in just all right. So therefore, let's look at the pullback of Therefore, let's look at the pullback of the verbiage hymnization, then the harmonic maps. Then you look at this metric on this domain, then satisfy Einstein equation, translate into the G2TA ij, satisfy this gauge Einstein equation. And then gauge Einstein equation now you can do linearization. Do neuralization. That's the mineralization. Now, since the matrix G tilde is very close to hyperbolic, so this is that's why the mineralization is somehow can be expected to be the dominant phenomenon. Because where you, right, even though it's non-linear, but the non-linearity is small because. Non-linearity is small because you are already close to the upper body. Okay, so you'll get a regularity, for example, you'll get a regularity here. The Bay Einstein equation, by Gaj Einstein equation. Now, look at the gauge einstein equation. Here, I'm using this tensor field, which is really the so-called non-linear La Passing, which is zero when your map is harmonic. So, therefore, the gate. So, therefore, the gauge ensign equation is the enzyme equation when you're using this harmonic. All right. So, but I want to say, so I'm going to state it in the so-called Ipson regularity formalism. And so, when you have R small, so that the very close to the operatic, then not only you get the regularity, but you actually get estimate. But you actually get an estimate. It's a C2 alpha estimate up to the boundary. Okay, so a size small will cost you more and size not small will be good. So this is Ipsum regularity that people familiar with the compactness study of compactness of things that often Ipsum regularity is the key crucial analytical. Crucial analytical ingredient. Okay, so you get the extra recognition. This time is that you look at the picture here. Okay, how do I control the symptomatic hyperbolic or symptomatic hyperbolicity? Now, interior is another story that I'm not doing anything to that, right? But neo-boundary, how do you say this structure, symptomatic hypotenuse structure is controlled? Spectrum is controlled. It's controlled through the harmonic boundary logos chart. This chart could be very small, but within its chart, it's very much controlled. Okay, the estimate up to boundary. And this theorem also tells you you could define asymmetrical probabilistic. Asymmetrical harpublicity intrinsically because at this point, this chart and this smooth structure all here, smooth structure and the chart is all here. Only the map will carry the smooth structure to the boundary. Right? And the boundary chart, then if you have, so what I'm going to say is that this That this, if you know a little bit about this, I'll say, Chigromov theories, right? If you have a chart somehow stabilized, then you actually get the convergence for the manifold. So if you have a finite chart stabilized, then you actually get the compactness. Okay, very similar story to what interior or Interior or contact without boundary case or the pointed case where you have a exhaustion process. So the issue is really what I want to say is, okay, sorry. Let me give you some hint of this estimate and this regularity. So how things go together. So, first of all, Together. So, first of all, there is an extension lemma back to even Gappa and Homander, and used in the Anderson Crushet's work on the proof of the polyhomogeneity, is that you can always extend with a boundary without loss regularity. This even for tensor case. Okay, so you have a boundary values which has regularity k. Values which has regularity k minus j alpha, and then you can have extension of u. Okay, so you give it the data here, you can extend there. You can keep the regularity CK alpha and then you can take the root to respect to rho, which is y in this case. So this y to the j here. Okay, you can this extension. This extension just to This engine just to show that you don't have to lose any regularities. Very similar to the situation that I just worked on with calculus, that if you look at the raw case power of these boundary values, the term as a whole has better regularity as separate factors. That's what I'm saying there. But this already opposes. But this already observed by the Girlbaker from under this is one thing. Second thing is the sorry, I must, yeah, this number here. This is a number of Zhang Li. It tells you how do you translate between the weighted holder space and the holder space for regularity up to boundary. So you have enough weight. So, you can have enough weight that you can go into the map that are including regularity up to boundary. This is again a calculus lemma, but it's very important to realize that if you do the regularity with the weight from the Einstein equation on the unbounded region, then if you have enough weight, if you choose a better reference metric to get enough weight, then this enough weight will force. Then, this enough weight will facilitate you to get the estimate that up to the boundary, up to the boundary. Okay, so there's two ingredients I want to say to support, or to really is the part of the regularity or the Ibsung estimate that I'm using here. Okay, I want to state the initial compactness statement. This is really just putting things. Just putting things together in a very naive way. So, suppose you have a family of a symptomatic harbor-Einstein matrix, and suppose the boundary is compact with certain regularities in terms of cheaper move. Assuming the there might be a constant on the conformal infinity bounded from below by some positive numbers, and assuming you don't have. And assuming you don't have interior issues, I'm assuming you have no interior issues. Then, really, it's about the size of the harmonic boundary coordinate. If you have uniform normal bound, then you will have compactness. Okay, so okay, you may ask that: do we get anything from here? Ask that do we get anything from here? So, yes. Okay, I'll finish soon. Sorry. So, now I want to say we can guess something. Something here is that, first of all, we have this very strong non-collapsing property. So, if you have a lower bound on the Yamabi on the conformal infinity, that really gives you the lower bound on the volume group. So, that non-classing problem. So, that non-collapsing properties. But also, that this gives you a very strong rigidity that immediately, that if the Yamabi of the boundary is the same as the sphere, then immediately by the rigidity part of the B-shop gromove, you get the rigidity. So, because of that, if your MRP is very close to the round sphere, then you get compactness. Because you don't have any, just based on the rigidity of the B. Just based on the rigidity of the beach of Gromo, that you don't have any non-trivial bubbles. And therefore, the consequence of this compactness that you can prove something stronger than the rigidity of hyperbolic is that what the solution Graham need for the perturbation is actually globally unique. Globally unique by some sort of implicit function theory, right? But globally unique. Theory, right? But global unique is some sort of rigidity. So, this is the conclusion we had. This is John Work of F Chen Ho Yixing, Jing Shao San Engming. Thank you. I'm stopped here.
