Okay, first of all, thanks to the organizer for giving me a chance to talk here. In this talk, we are concerned with a classical problem in hydrodynamic stability. In hydrodynamic stability, the stability of laminar flow at a high Linus number. Now, let me give some classical examples of laminar flows and the plane-quiet flow, Y-CLO zero, which describes the laminar flow between two plates in relative motion and plane. And plain Possibly flow, one minus y squared, which describes the laminar flow between two fixed parallel planes and also the piper Poissoi flow. These laminar flow are steady solutions of the Navy-Stokes equation, so the momentum equation. And what else do we is Is divergence-free, and here we impose the non-sleep boundary condition on the boundary. And then u is the viscosity coefficient very small and reciprocal to Leynos number because Leynos number is large. Okay. So we first look at linear stability. Linear stability. So I consider the linearized Levi-Stokes equation along the laminar flow. Here, L nu, L capital L nu is the linearized operator. Then we solve the eigenvalue problem. Lend is the eigenvalue. U is the eigenfunction. So we say that the system is linearly stable if the real part of the eigenvalues are non- Values are non-positive, otherwise unstable. So now the plane quite flow is linearly stable for any Leynos number proved by Remenor. And plain Posoi follow is linearly stable for Leynos number less than 5772 numerically proved by. Numerically proved by Ostag. Okay. And it's linearly unstable for highly known number proved by Grignet at all. And in a recent joint work with Chen and Wei, we can prove that the pipe-soilflow is linearly stable at a high linear number regime. Here are long-standing conditions. Here a long-standing conjecture is piper-pozoier flow is linearly stable for any Leynos number. So for the for the low Leynos number, so in this case, it's very easy. So now the main trouble is for the median Leynos number. So I think in this case, maybe we needed to approve with the Prove with numeric. Okay. So for nonlinear stability, to understand the transition mechanism of laminar flow, and Jefferson et al. proposed the transition slash hot problem. So that is given unknown exit, maybe a banach space. Exit maybe a banach space, find a beta which may depend on the node. Such that if here u0 is the perturbation, so the x node of the perturbation is much smaller, much smaller than i minus beta. Then the following is a stable. So here, the beta is a so-called transition slash hot. Slash hot. So, about this problem, there are many important progress recently. For example, for the 3D quite flow in this domain without the boundary. So here, the space Y belongs to whole space, not an interval. So Bajosi and et al. proved that if X is a Jeffrey class, X is a Jeffrey class, then beta is less than one. And if X is the Sobeliff space, H n, n big enough, then beta less than three half. And in joint work with we, we can prove that beta is less than one as long as X is H2, so we have space. And even with the boundary effect, because Even with the boundary effect, because when the viscosity is very small, the boundary effect is a very important mechanism leading to instability. So even with the boundary effect, so we can also prove that the transition threshold is also less than one. Okay. And in listener pre-premint, joint with 10. Pre-print joint with 10, Ding, and Ling is here. And for the 3D print posterior follow, we can also prove beta is less than 7 or 4. So, but we believe that this result should not be optimal. By astronomical analysis, the optimal result should be three half, not seven. Three half, notice seven and of four. Okay. Now we come back to our problem in this talk. So in this talk, we will consider general monotone shear flow, UY zero. And U belongs to H3 space, H3, and U is strictly monotone. Then we consider the linearized. They consider a linearized 2D narrow spoxing system along this flow in this finite channel. So the string-wise direction is periodic and the y is in a finite interval. So this is linearized equation and AU is a linearized operator. And the DNU is the And the DNU is the domain of this operator. And the P is the array Henhor's projection. In two dimensions, we would like to use the vorticity and the formulation. So we introduce the vorticity and the string function phi. Omega is the vorticity and phi is string function with the following relationship. So Laplace phi equals to omega and we is minus partial phi and partial. is minus partial phi and the partial x partial x phi then the linearized in terms of what tested the linearized the level stock system can be written as as the follows as the follows so here here because we impose the non-sleeper boundary condition so the partial x phi and the partial y phi have vanishes on the on the boundary okay so here is l nu is so is linearized So it's a linearized operator. So for this operator, so this is a non-self non-self adjoint operator. Also, it's a non-local operator. So this is this is non-local part. So technically, I think this part is the main trouble, non-local part. So we are considered with four in three problems. Three problems: linear stability and linear waste damping, and linear enhanced dissipation. So, the later two mechanisms play a crucial role in the transition threshold problem. So, now what's the use of the damping? So, here we consider the linearized 2D OLA equation along the pipe flow. So, in this case, the linearized equation. In this case, the linearized equation is just a transport equation because you can look at because the second directive equal to zero when uy equal to y. So in this case, the linearized equation is just a transport equation. So we can get a solution by a characteristic method. So for any For any LP, any LP node is conservable for a vortexing, right? Because this is just a translation. But all found that velocity will decay to zero as t tends to infinity. So this phenomenon is so-called in with stamping, which is an analog of Is an analog of Landau damping in plasma fiscus. And then now, what's the enhanced dissipation? So here we consider that in the right Nervous Fox equation along the quadrant. So here, this is diffusion convection equation. So without a convection term, so this is just actually. So, this is just a heat equation. So, the diffusion rate should be Î¼. But with the covection turn, so the diffusion, the decay rate becomes one-third. So, this decay rate is much faster than the diffusion rate. So, this phenomenon is so-called enhanced dissipation. So we so now we want to establish similar results for general molecule share flow. So the first result is so the first result we needed to prove the linear stability. So we introduce two notation m mu is defined the infinite real part of learn. London is the eigenvalue. Then is the eigenvalue of the Nu. And in the subspace, M eu is the infinite real part. In the subspace, here we assume the average of V in X equal to zero. So this is a subspace of so so usually M E U is bigger than bigger than M M U. So join the winds letter and the way. So we can prove the following, the linear stability. We assume that LE, this operator has no impending eigenvalue or eigenvalues. So this operator is, in fact, it's just the linearized operator for all I patient. For the O-LI patient. So we can come back. So this is the Come back. So, this is the right operator for the Navy Stocks equation. So, without this term, so equal if nu equals zero, so the so the L E nu becomes L E L E. So, L capital L E is the minimalized operator. So, that means if the flow is stable for the all our equation, then the flow is also stable for the stable for for the for the narrow spox equation so so this is this the absorption that means the flow is stable for the all our equation then uh if the with cost t is very small then we can prove the following special gap special gap m e m nu is bigger than c nu and m e nu is bigger than c nu one third one third so this in particular this means the particular this means this this implies linear stinear stability okay so now we give some remarks so in fact the linear step linear stability for concave monotone shear flow has been proved by OMOC and Helfer so if the flow is monotone and concave then the linearized operator LE has no Operator LE has no embedding eigenvalues or eigenvalues. So that means our result is weaker than the LMAC and Helf's result for about linear stability. So here the spectral gap estimate, MENU is bigger than CNU one-third corresponds to the enhanced dissipation phenomenon. So because here, because MENU is in a substance. Because amino is in a subspace, okay. So this special gap is corresponds to the enhanced dissipation phenomenon. So here, this theorem will just give the stability and the spectral gap. So we don't give the dynamical estimate. So the next result is about the enhanced dissipation. So we ask the same assumption. Then Then omega is a solution of linearized the Navstock's equation. And the initial data, omega zero, belongs to this space. So in a y direction, it h1 and the x-direction is h minus one. And we also assume the average equal to zero in x. Okay. Then we have the following uniform estimate. Uniform estimates on the velocity. So here the decay rate. So here the velocity L2 node, the L2 know, the decay rate is new one of three. So this gives enhanced dissipation. So in fact, I think we can also here enhanced dissipation is for velocity. I think we can also prove a similar result for the vorticity, follow vorticity. Follow a testing. So, and similar estimates have been established for the neural rise and neural stocks assist along the quite a fellow, quite a fellow. In this work, I think many follow this paper joint with the Chen, Li, and the Wei. Okay, so and these estimates play a crucial in non-linear stability. Low in non-linear stability of credit flow. Okay, the third result is the invisible damping estimate. So here we take because the uy is independent of x, so we can take a flat transport in x and alpha is the alpha is the frequency in a wave number in x. number in X. So, and for R not equal to zero, we can define the Lady operator R alpha. This is the Rayleigh operator, okay? So now for each alpha, alpha is bigger than one. So we assume R alpha has no inbanding eigenvalues or eigenvalues. So this also means that the overall follow if the follow is a stable. The following is stable for the patient. And we assume the initial data belongs to H1. And this is the compatible conditions on the initial data. Then we can prove this is the right hand side is the L2 node of velocity because here's partial y file. Alpha is like a partial partial x file because here so we take a chance flat transform in the flex transfer in the in x direction in the x direction for the l2 node is bounded by so this way gives the the the the decay estimator in time also the enhanced dissipation estimator so here the dissipation rate depends on alpha so alpha is bigger than the dissipation rate is bigger okay uh so uh when mu equals So when mu equal to zero, the university damping estimator was proved in this work because here is the 2D allied patient, in the right 2D allied patients. And here, the decline estimate for alpha phi should not be optimal. The optimal estimate should be 1 plus t minus 2, not minus 1, not minus 1. Minus one, not minus one. So, but okay. So, here we prove this result for the non-sleeper boundary condition. Of course, this estimate is also true for the never-sleeper boundary conditions, never sleeper boundary. Now, I give some I give some key ideas about our proof. So, the key ingredient is to solve osmophyte equations. Osmophy equation. So, this is a first-order ODE equations. But this is, so this turn is without this turn is just a lady equation. Lady equation. So, this turn is not as Is not as regular perturbation, it's a singular perturbation. So, okay, so this is the P is the string function. So, the PC and the partial y percent vanish on the boundary. And the lambda is a complex number. So, the key ingredient is to solve this osmo fail equation. So, the key point is to establish. point is to establish resolvent estimates, resolving estimates. So with the resolvent estimates, we can use the LaBlas transform, use LaBlas transform to get semi-group estimates. So the key point is to establish dissolvent estimates. Okay, so if alpha lambda i bigger than so this is the special gap. So this is the special So, this is the spectral gap. So, new one-third. Then we have the following resolve and L2 node of stream function. This means the L2 node of velocity bounded by these guys. So for the right hand side is H minus 1, L2, and H1. So, in particular, when F equal to zero, that means the old Somophy equation has only trivial solution. Trivial solution, so which implies the linear stability and the spectral gap, spectral gap, okay? Because here alpha lambda is bigger than this guy. So this implies M e new is bigger than C new one third. Okay. So a key idea introduced by this work is that This work is that we first solve the osmophyte equation with the narrow slipper boundary condition. This is the narrow boundary condition. This is inhomogeneous automobile failure equation. Then, because this condition, there's not so the second step is to match the boundary condition, the match boundary via constructing boundary correctors. The boundary correctors. So, what is the main advantage of this method? So, first, first, due to the favorable boundary condition, because here is the non-slipper boundary condition. So, we can use the energy method to solve this inhomogeneous field equation. And because near the boundary and Near the boundary and also near the boundary. So, the main trouble is this non-local term, lower, so lower out of the tone. So, near the boundary, this term is compared the second this term is a small perturbation. So, let me to construct the boundary collector, we can also solve this equation. also solve the this equation is enough we can we can remove remove the lower of the 10 so so this if we make a late extension near the near the boundary because u y is strictly uh uh strictly model so near the boundary is like a linear function so if we make a tiny extension near the boundary so this is just this is a so this equation it can be reduced to It can be reduced to an error equation. So then we can use the error function to construct the boundary correctors. So this is the main advantages of this method. So this is the resolvent estimates with the narrow slipper boundary condition. So for the H belongs to H minus 1, L2 and H1. H1 so here we just give a formal prediction via scaling and analysis. So here the index looks very complex, but in fact this index is very natural by the scaling analysis. For example, we consider the osmo field equation in abundant layer of all the data. So in this inner layer, we have the the layer we have the the the first the new partial y square w is uh is order of new delta minus two and the listing is all the alpha delta is alpha so these two terms should be have the same scale which gives the delta equals uh gives uh this this number this number so so so so in the inner layer the solution behaves as follows so is as follows so alpha delta w equals alpha because delta equals to this number so alpha times new this number so this is equals to this number new one third and equals f so because f belongs to h l2 so this gives this resolve and the estimates so so so so here So here, F, when F belongs to L2, so this gives, so these all exponents I think can be can be predicted by the scaling analysis. So the rigorous proof, we needed to divide many, many case. The following three cases are relatively easy. Are relatively easy. The first case, new alpha squared is bigger than one. In this case, the whiskest is dominant. And the alpha is the wave number is very big. So in this case, the non-local turn could be field as a perturbation. So it's also easy. And the third case is the lambda is far away from the range. So in this case, So this turn is if lambda is learned the real part is far away from the range of u so so this turn is no non-degenerated so we can also give a good estimates. So these three cases are relatively easy. So the most difficult case is the following and alpha is alpha And alpha is alpha is bounded and the lambda R belongs to a neighborhood of the range of U. And here M2 is equals this number. So in this case, our goal is to show that the H1 node of PZ is bounded by the H1 node of F. So in this case, we can not use the perturbation argument. Perturbation argument. So, so and if we follow for the plain persuasive flow, also for the common roof flow, we can use a good structure of this flow. But for general monotone flow, we have no special structure. So, we cannot use the perturbation argument to prove this. So, our idea. So, our idea is to use the compactness method. So, we assume the conclusion is not true. It's not true. Then, we find a sequence, sequence, sequence of solution of Osma failed the equation. And H1 known is bounded of the Precian, and H1 know of F1 is smaller than one of n, one of n. So then we take a sub-sequence, take a sub-sequence. Take a subsequence, take a subsequence. So the PN is weakly convergence to P, and the Fn is strongly convergence to zero in H1 norm. And the UN is convergence to U minus London. So the main point to conclude our contradiction, the main point is to prove two things. The first thing is to prove that we can convert. improve the weaker convergence to the strong convergence. So here is the weakly convergence in H1 norm. We can prove the Pacific is a strongly convergence to the Pacific in the H1 norm. So for this, the key point is get our ellipse regularity estimates. So the proof. Estimates so so the proof is similar to the limiting assumption principle in introduced in this paper and the second thing is true is proof the lambda is an imbanding eigenvalue of alpha this really operator really operator this means the definition of the embedding eigenvalue so the embedding eigenvalue so the solution satisfy at least the integral integral integral equations integral equations so uh because we assume that the the linearized operator has no embedding eigenvalues so and the only argument that we can prove the position is a convergence position in the h1 node so that's we conclude our contradiction so then we can Contradiction, so then we can complete our sorry. So, my time is okay. So, so because I have no time, I yes. This is the proof about this proof in Benny Eggland. So, finally, just to match the boundary collision. Match boundary condition. So, we needed to solve the homogeneous osmo field equation with this boundary condition. So, then we can decompose the solution, the three parts. W1, W2 is linearly independent solution of this homogeneous osmo field equation. And then this here, the coefficient C1, C2 are. the coefficient c1 c2 are determined by the the determined by the the the the the solution of now the solution for the now sleeper boundary condition okay so uh so we uh we so so uh to solve the inhomogeneous a homogeneous or some of the equation so here so this term uh we we remove this term so then we can only find the Can only find the two approach made solution WA1. Here, AI is an every function. So, the first two terms is, I think, it's an area type equation. So, we use the early function to approximate these equations. So, this WA1, WA2 is approximate solution. And we needed to introduce error. So, the error equation. So, this is WA. Error equation. So this is W E1 and WE2 is the error equation. So the error solves this inhomogeneous orthomo field equation and with the narrow slipper boundary condition. So in the first step, we have solved the inhomogeneous orthoma field equation with the non-slipper, non-sleeper bond equation. So we can use the results established in the first step. Established in the first step. So then we can prove the error is small compared with the approach-made solution. Then we complete the proof. So, okay, I will stop here. Thanks for your attention.
