Talking about the mechanics and geometry of growing dishes. Thank you very much. First, I want to thank the organizers and for your conference and it's a gross choice. What I want to tell you about is recent work that we did on the mechanics of tissues and in particular how growth is carbon mechanics. The work was recent work has mostly been done in postdoc or the hospital. Now, talking about mechanics of tissue, there are essentially two ways to look at the problem. One is to say a tissue is a material like any other material. So I would do what we would do in continuum mechanics. I would use a completely microscopic approach and try to see which of the known types of materials I can produce. So that's what we did some time ago. I will give you a brief summary of that because it's Brief summary of that because it's how to do it to introduce a few ideas that I will get after this. The other way to do it is to start from a microscopic or a macroscopic description of cells. And the model that I will use is a vertex model that you already saw here. And try to do that, try to constrain that into a more microscopic description of the mechanical process. So that's where I want to go. Essentially, in the first microscopic approach, I want to show you. Microscopic approach: I want to show you that many tissues can be considered as active discoelastic materials. And in the second part, I want to show you that if you look at nonlinear elasticity, the tissue is what's called a tixotropic loop. And I'll tell you afterwards when it comes. So let me go to my macroscopic approach. Essentially, what I want to show you is that tissues can be liquid, and the experiment that I like was made in The experiment that I like was made in Lyon in France. You see it here, these are two spheroids that are essentially spherical because they have an isotropic surface tension, as liquid drops are. And for many purposes, they can be constructed as drops of cells. The experiment which is here, they take two of these ferroids, they push them against one another, and they fuse. They fuse by making this peanut shape, which is essentially what you would expect when you take two drops of oil in water and force them. For boiling water and force them to go together. Except this goes very slow, and the experimental drop of oil is extremely hard to do because it goes extremely fast. And there's more to it, so I talked about the surface tension. What you can do is measure the size of the neck here, and you use the formula obtained in capillarity in the early twentieth century, which is written here. So the square of the size goes linearly with time, and what you which is what you also have here. Which you also have here, and what you measure is a ratio between the interfacial tension and the viscosity. There are other ways to measure the interfacial tension, and you can get the viscosity of tissues. It's very high, for those who don't know it, it's like 10 times the viscosity of water. Of course, tissues are not as simple as oil drops. One of the reasons for that is that cell divide and cell dies, so I want to take into account cell division and cell death. Take into account cell division and cell death. In the conservation equation, I will introduce a cell division rate and the cell death rate. The problem is that these quantities depend on a lot of things, and in particular, they depend on the mechanics of the tissue. What I will call the growth rate, which is the difference between cell division and cell death, decreases if you increase pressure in most cases. So at very low pressure, the cells are happy and then they are it, and then if you increase pressure, they And then, if you just pressure, they die more and more. And you reach a point where they become equal, which we call the homeostatic state. This is the steady state of the tissue, where as many cells divide as cells die. Now, as I said, what I want to discuss is the coupling between Crohn's and mechanics. Now, there are two effects that I want to mention. The first one is that it can orient the division by stress. Orient cell division by stress, and there is this very nice experiment that was made a long time ago now in the team of Matthew Pierre who's taking an elastic sheet and putting cells on them and pulling on the sheet and cells devise. So let's see what this small movie is saying. Cells devise all metaphysic places perpetually pull. The way I will describe that is I will introduce a direction, T, which is the polarity of the cells. Now you want to. Cells. Now you want the two directions P and minus P to be equivalent. So there is this orientation on hematic cancer that transmits that. And what I will say is that the matic cancer is a spontaneous orientation of the cell plus a term due to the stress. And I will assume that this is linear. So if I pull and the signs are correct, actually if I pull the plus sign here, I will orient it for the stress. So that's one effect. The second effect is that when cells divide, they have to push their neighbors. And when they push their neighbors, the total force that they should exert is zero. There are two ways to do that. You can do it isotropically, also the finite pressure. But there is a direction. So you cannot exert a force. Otherwise, the force wouldn't be zero. So you have to exert two forces in opposite directions, which is a force backward. Now if you Now, if you start from the elasticity of the cells, so individual cells have an elastic functions, you can put all these effects together, and I won't go through that. What you end up in the end is what I will call in the language of materials people a constitutive equation that relates the stress in the tissue to the velocity gradient. So, if you forget this term, this is kind of a Maxwell model. Maxwell model. At short times, the tissue is solid, and essentially, the elasticity is that of the cells. Then the stress relaxes and the tissue becomes liquid. And there is an extra term. The extra term is proportional to the spontaneous order of the cells. There are several other petrons in this room. I work a lot on active systems. And this is exactly the type of stress that you get for active fluids. So I have the viscoelasticity here, and I have the active fluid. And I have the activity here. For me, a system is active only if it consumes energy at the scale of each of its components. The cells need nutrients and consume energy, so I'm not surprised to find that. So it's interesting to look at the orders of magnitude. So there is a viscoelastic relaxation time, which has an ANC expression which is here. But if you look at this, it tells you that it's of the order of the cell division time. So cell division in this post-self. For cell division, this process relaxes stress. It relaxes stress because I said that the cell division rate is cut open for pressure on the tissue. Then there is an active stress that comes from the dipole moments of the cells identified. So that's kind of clear. So the only thing I want to show you is experiments that show you that tissues are indeed active. These experiments were done at the group of Pascal Silver 1. the group of Pascal Silberzon and Pasciti Curie, that are kind of the same experiment done in two different ways. The first one is they put a on a plastic, they made a lane where cells are deer and they are confined on this lane. So it's a band of cells like this. The cells are active. So this is a cut of the lane. The lane is very long in this direction. If you look here, the cells are parallel to the action. Now what you see here is that in the middle Here is that in the middle, spontaneously the cells stir and are no longer perpendicular to the parallel to the edge. So there is a gradient of orientation. I told you that the active stress was proportional partly to my orientation tensor. So there is a gradient of stress, gradient of stress induces. So without any external force, you see that this tissue flows, it's kind of shear, it goes up here, it goes down here. It goes down here. Maybe the most spectacular thing of this experiment. I played with him. This is a time scale. You see hours here. The velocities are micrometers per hour. So if you want to see that, you have to wait for a very long time. Otherwise, you don't see anything. It can be, I was going to say, it could be even worse than that. You take the same cell, but you plate them now on a very large surface. There are low-constant flows. There are local spontaneous flows. So, what's plotted in here is not the velocity, it's the vorticity. It tells you how the fluid rotates properly. It's red when it's positive, it's blue when it's negative. So, there is an array of vortices, so array of areas that turn in this direction, an array of areas that turn in the opposite direction, which is what you have in the turbulent flow. This kind of states that we call active turbulence, it has nothing to do with the turbulence you know, because if you can. Do is a turbulence you know because if you calculate the Reynolds number, it's 10 to the minus 5 or 10 to the minus 6. And to see turbulence, you have to go 10 to the 5 or something like this. Still, this is disordered, and you see a random chaotic flow, both chaotic in space and time, for a tissue which is the same as this. Okay, so that's my first description. So the tissue for me is a viscoelastic active fluid. If you wait long enough that you do experiment at longer time than the At longer time than the cell division time itself. So, what I want to do is start from a microscopic model, so I won't go to the full microscopic model because it's far too complicated. What I will describe here is only two-dimensional systems, so it's PT or tissues. This is pictures of the wing list of Trosophilia at various stages of development that come from. Come from has done. And what they did is they label surfaces of the cells. And you see that if you look from the apical size, you have this kind of networks of tiding of the blade by cells that look like polygons. So the idea of this vertex model is to describe a cell by a polygon. So I point out the vertices and I draw a line outside. And then we look how the geometry of the topic is. Geometry or the topology like this tiling evolves with tiling. It's not obvious that you can do that, because the cells have a string, of course, they are three-dimensional, so they have a height perpendicular to this plane. There are very naive models that tell you that if they are pretty flat, looking at the leftover surface is almost enough. The thickness doesn't vary too much. In the general case, there is no direct demonstration that we could go from there. But you need a But you need a law on how the styling will deform. The law is simple, it's Newton's law. You want to write equilibrium both of each of the vertices and all of the edges here. And if you write that, you can see as a function of time and debris. A very convenient way to do it is to write what people call an effective energy pseudo-work of things like this, which when you minimize it, Which, when you minimize it with respect to all the degrees of freedom, so the degrees of freedom that define this network, you will find force balance at each point. This energy, which is the one that everybody uses, tells you that the cells have a preferred area, that I call A naught, and then it will relax to the preferred area because there is a stiffness here, and they have a preferred parameter, and it will relax to the preferred parameter. Is a preferred parameter. Positive modulus. So that's the forces which are binary cells, and I let them evolve. And the easy thing that you can do is, I won't worry about the dynamics for a moment, and I will ask what is the minimum of its energy. But there are two parameters which are important. Please vary as a frontier parameter, and with that, you can make a dimensionless number, which I call the shape ratio, which is the perimeter, which is the length, and I have to divide by the... Which is the length, and I have to divide by the square root of the area to make another length. If the perimeter is large, and that's kind of intuitive, larger than a critical value, so that's the critical value of that, the sides are elongated, and you always find shape that goes turn those. And there are many, many, many of these shapes, and they are compatible with the time. It means you have many terms of physics, I would say the ground state is extremely degenerated. Is extremely degenerated. If you apply forces on that, you jump from one of these states to another one, it costs zero energy. So, this is what I will call the soft cell. If you go to smaller parameters, there is no way you can find something that minimizes the two terms at the same time. Put the two terms equals to zero at the same time. So, you have to find a component between the two. It's frustrating if you want to use the fast. Is frustrated if you want to use a fancy work. And it's easy to see that if you have a given parameter, the more isotropic the cell is, the better. And the best you can do is hexacon. So the ground state is the lattice of hexagon. And there is a transition between the two. And the transition between the two has this number has its fancy value, which is almost 4. To say it's first of all, this transition between this soft solid and the hot, I would call that a hot solid, is exactly We call that a hot solid, is exactly the same transition that Munita Das was talking about yesterday night. It's a rigidity transition. Second thing is in this state, all terms are zero, so there is no internal stress in the cell. In here, the two terms are positive, so the cell itself is under stress. It cannot minimize the two terms at the same time. I will impose on you some slightly more technical stuff just to tell you how we can. Technical stuff, just to tell you how we do it, and then I show you results. So, the way we do it is we do it exactly like people do when they do solid elasticity. Somebody showed that yesterday. You start from a reference state, and then you see how the tissue deforms from this reference state. The reference state that I take is a tissue at times t equals zero. And then I map that onto the real state, and that defines a tensor which is called the metric tensor. The metric tensor is just one plus of H. Tensor is just one plus a deformation of the tissue. So this metric tensor measures elasticity, measures elasticity, and if it varies with time, the tissue flows. However, this is not the only thing that you can do. There are what people call topological transitions. One of them, which is easy to see, is cell division. You cut a cell in two, and then you let it to equilibrate. Here you change the reference state. Because you start from one cell, you go to two cells, and you change the topology. To cells, and you change the topology. So, these topological transitions occur in reference state. The elasticity is defined in real state. That's what I measure from the deformation. Now, there are three types of this topological transition. There's cell division, there's cell death, and there's also this rearrangement of neighbors, where if you look at these four cells, these two are neighbors, I shrink this, I expand it in the other direction. These two were neighbors and we become these two become neighbors in this configuration. So that's what people call a T1 process. So essentially what I'm telling you is that I measure elasticity in real space from this tensor G. I measure topological transition in the reference state. And I need a tensor to do that. I define the tensor. So I have an edge pair that I call delta x. It's a product of the component of this tensor, and I sum over all the edges. Over all the edges. This is a tensor that tells me how isotropic the cell is and what's its sizing impact in the reference. So that's how I describe you. I told you in the beginning, my first part, that if the growth is coupled to mechanics that fluidizes the tissue, it's fluid at long times. It still exists here, and it's true for any of these transitions. Transitions, the way I would introduce them fully coupled to mechanics. So, if I start from this hexagonal lattice that I showed you, if I introduce all these transitions, cell division, cell death, or T1 transition, the tissue will solve. Now, this is even more technical. We cheat, so I want to be honest, I tell you how we cheat. We don't use a parameter, which is a sum of the lengths of all the edges of a cell. We use what we call the generalized perimeter. We use what we call the generalized perimeter, which is the sum of the square of the lenses. Now you can convince yourself that at least if you are close to the spontaneous area or spontaneous perimeter, it's not different. It's just a mean spice. If you are far, it's a little bit different. The only reason we do that is that it's very convenient to express everything in terms of the two tensors that I showed you. That the area is just a determinant of the quota tensor that. Square root of that, and the parameter is the generalized parameter, it's a trace of the properties. So, if I do that, I can describe all the properties of the tissue with these two tensors. Modulo achieves, there is a free factor here which is not exactly constant. Numerical simulations up to 10 or 50% is about constant. And I can write the energy function of my tensor. So, this is area minus area squared. This is the perimeter. Square. This is the parameter minus the parameter squared. And this is the area in the torque space. Now, if you know the energy, you can calculate the stress. I told you that G is like the deformation, so the derivative of the energy with respect to the deformation is the stress. It's a little bit messy, but it's expressed in terms of the tensors. And there is also a field which is conjugate to Q, which operates in the Operates in the reference state. Now, my story of soft and hard-solid still works with this definition. So, I have to change the shape parameter because now both quantities are square of an axis. Parameter divided by the area, and the transition occurs on the C. That's only statics. I never told you how the balls are moves. Which forms or moves. So I need dynamic equations now. The problem is, if you want to get dynamic equations that the size of the set, you would have to take all kinds of complicated processes. And at least I don't know how to do that. And if I would like to cross-grade from very microscopic to there, I would need to write very complicated expressions at the microscopic level. And that would be nowhere. So the way we do it is we use So the way we do it is we use the procedure that was devised by Onzager in 1932 or something like this. What Hansager does is he writes the energy consumed per unit time. So I take the energy that I had before, I take the derivative with respect to time. So there is a term in dq dt, kind of by definition, this is the conjugate field. There is a term in dtg. This is the term in the velocity gradient. This is the term in the velocity gradient, and in the precipitation, this is the stress. And then there's a term associated to noise effect on what to discuss. And what Andago tells you, he says, this is a flux, this is a force, this is a flux, this is a force, and the fluxes are proportional to the forces. I can even simplify more. The way I simplify more is that elastic relaxation is very fast, which means if I slightly deform a cell in less than a minute or seconds even, it will relax with its mechanical. It will relax with its mechanical, non-mechanical equilibrium. And then dtg is zero. So I will assume that I can ignore that. So I ignore the short-kind deformation. And the only term that I'm left with is mu nu dtg mu nu. So I say that this is proportional to mu. So it looks simple, except that this is a tensor, this is a tensor. Also, object that allows me to write that there are proportions. Allows me to write that they are proportional. It's a tensor with four indices. And the only thing I can do is guess the shape of this tensor. I only have one tensor that I can use, which is Q. And the only tensor I can make is this. There are two quantities here. Each one is a time scale. And it's essentially the time scale of the topological processes that I showed you. And then there is a dimensionless number here that I call H. And that tells you what's the relative. And that tells you what's the relative proportion of the three topological states that I showed you. There's one simple case. Yeah, go ahead. In the tensor, I mean, are you assuming, what kind of symmetries are you assuming? Are you allowing, for example, is there a constituent relationship between stress and strain? This is hidden in there. The only thing I'm assuming, it has to be to respect rotational symmetry, translational symmetry, and things like that. But even that may not necessarily be true. You can have non-reciprocal interactions, you could have blah blah blah blah blah. Reciprocal interactions is associated with time reversal symmetry. And this is when I use a Dagger procedure, there's this symmetry between coefficients, and I kind of assume that this there is no reciprocal interaction, right? All the rest is kind of the most general thing that I can do. It's kind of the most general thing that I can write. Yes? So, why G doesn't enter this camera? Oh, that's an interesting question. What she's saying, sorry, I'm translating it into another language, that I'm cheating you because there is not only one tensor which is Q, there is another tensor which is G. Essentially, G is associated with the Lasticity, and what I want to see is the effect of these topological transitions. Transitions. So you can write all the terms like this, where you substitute one of the Q's by one G, it takes a page, and it's impossible to use all of them, so then you have to decide what's more relevant. And to me, this is more relevant because this is what characterizes the topological display. So this ignores the fact that a change in metric can give the pneumatic tensile part. So changing so that's related to what I said just before. What I said just before, that I assume that elasticity relaxes infinitely fast. So if it relaxes infinitely fast, sigma is zero, and that tells me how g changes when I define Q. G is directly related to Q by a very complicated rule that I could calculate if I. The other subtleties that it may not be able to relapse in into Q but we can talk about that very far. So Uh okay, we can talk about anything. But like one point with the vertex function, which is kind of confuses me, is that so in reality, you know, like you actually have two different cells with two different membranes. Yes. Right, and you could imagine that you have shears between them, which could do other things. Some of that's not coming up in this. So this is what I would call the microscopic distribution. Well so but but lots of people write the dynamic of the vertex for all the interfection on each other. I don't want to know where the dissipation comes from. I say dissipation is there, and I will hide this behind the symmetry. But can't I imagine then that, for example, you actually have active forces that give our systems? You can have one cell from spinning relative to another? There's all sorts of other things. Well, there are. And I want to talk about it. Okay, uh so I added another term. I want to introduce active forces. Activity comes a fact that saves us some energy. And I again use my symmetry argument. This is a tensor, gamma, the Gamma, the consumption of energy is a scalar. So the most naive term that I could put is something proportional to Q. And this hides all kinds of things. And I agree that I'm not able to calculate this from microscopic problems. However, I can calculate the cell division rate. And the cell division rate, the growth rate, is just one over Q dtq. I just take the total area. Just take the total area, I divide by the area of the cells, so this is the number of cells, and then I calculate one over the entities. So that's what the cell division rate is. So I have a direct interpretation of my gamma zero, which is a cell division rate if I forget the coupling to mechanics. I tell two more things. This one, with this, you can put the tissue in a box and you can look at steady state, so I can calculate. You can look at steady state, so I can calculate the homeostatic pressure. This is what's here. So that's the homeostatic pressure, and the parameter that I choose is the activity of the cells. How much would they divide if they were by themselves and not interacting with the elements? If I take a hot solid, a soft solid, I have a continuous curve. So the more the cells divide, the more they push, and the pressure should increase. If I take a hard solid, Hard solid, if I go to low values of gamma naught, this is negative. Because the homeostatic pressure is negative. People know about that. People have maybe not measured the extrapolated towards negative pressure. First of all, in your book of statistical physics, the first page tells you that the pressure is positive, but for an equilibrium system, so it's not an equilibrium system. And what compensates is the fact that that's high. So there is no rule whether it should be positive or negative. Whether it should be positive or negative. What this tells you is that if you want to see that, you need to take something that looks like a hot solid, and you have to go to very small values of your product. Let me go to what I announced. What's the reality of a tissue like this? So what we did, the simplest thing that you can do is you apply a simple shear. So I fix a shear rate gamma dollar. There is a deformation which I impose. There is a deformation which I impose at each point, which is gamma dot times t, which is elastic deformation. By procedures that I showed you earlier, I know how to calculate the stress. And I plot the stress, so I let the tissue equilibrate, I apply the C-array, and I plot the stress as a function of time. So I don't apply it as a function of time, I plot it as a function of gamma dot times T. As gamma dot is constant, it's the same thing. It's the same thing. So here is the curve that I find. Sigma, so I apply a shear, so I then have a shear rate. At very high values of gamma dot, you also have a shear, a normal size difference, which we have to lay a little bit more to show. At very low values of gamma, this is for the hard solid, sigma is proportional to gamma, it's a normal solid, the tissue is solid, and I define the shear modulus here, which is the same one as. Here, which is the same one as I calculated before, so everything is okay. But then the stress increases, goes to a maximum, and goes to a content line, which means that if I wait at a very long time, even in the presence of this gamma dot, there is a homeostatic state where the tissue is under stress and I can measure the properties equation. If gamma dot is small, on this curves here, sigma is reporting. Curves here. Sigma is proportional to the unadult, which means the tissue is liquid at long time. So it's solid at your time, liquid at long time, so I think G2. And of course, there's only one time scale in my model, which is what I call H1. So the relaxation time I will show you is a messy function of H1. This is what happens here. If I increase gamma dot, the tissue becomes a shear stealing fluid, which means the more I increase gamma. Which means the more I increase gamma dots, the less viscous it is. It's like the overwhelming by a very strong stress. The viscosity decreases at the large viscous. And in this case, so this case is where there is no cell division, there are only these T1 processes. It goes like gamma dot to the one-third. If I introduce cell division, I get a different exponent, but otherwise everything is the same. And the fact that positive or just stress variants. Passively, or just stress variance with time, is what's called a T-shirt in Fluvin. So I'm not very good in rheology, but I know one other system that does that. If you take an entangle very dense polynomial solutions, per the stress of constant gamma plot as a function of gamma, you also have a maximum and then it relaxes. If you put too strong, the antagonist of this method, then the tissue flows. So it's kind of the same picture that we have here. So that's when I assume that the tissue... So that's when I assumed that the tissue was solid. Uh when it's a soft solid, I told you that the shear modulus is zero. So it means that it should start to be small here. It doesn't go like gamma, it goes like gamma squared. What you can calculate, I told you that the cells are elongated, you can calculate the orientation of the cells. The orientation is proportional to gamma. Then you have something which is oriental, so uni-axial. So uniaxial, and if you use uniaxial as STCD, you'll find that this should be gamma squared, which is what we find. All the rest is the same. Difference in high values. Just last plot, maybe you like rheology better like this. We also looked at experiments for each year at finite frequencies like this. So this is G prime and G double prime as a function of omega. As a function of omega, we can only do it for a hard solid. So a soft solid, the modulus is exactly zero, so there's nothing to do. And that's exactly a matrix model. Tissue from this approach is the same than the one I had in my first description. I find a matrix model. This is also active. The fact that I could send divisions make the tissue active and I should be reactive. Well, that's where we are with these things. Maybe I should stop here. Um maybe I should stop here and let you ask questions if they are asking. Thank you very much. I'm struggling a bit with the fact that you that from the fact that uh sorry, I'm struggling a bit with the I have an impression that uh maybe that uh you sort of assume Yeah, I sort of assume that actually perform that type of behavior, and therefore then the rest follows that. But I because I would say that. So why would I use content? No, I would make sense that it's more like a mean stress fluid rather than knowing that. So okay, I wanted to say that. So uh one I think I think the another macroscopic microscopic behavior Microscopic detail that I know is when I was called, I call that plastic fluid. These are the fluid you have in geophysics. If you have low stress, they don't flow. If you apply a huge stress, they flow. And there's a critical value called the Yelts class. When we did the first story that I told you, we did numerical simulations and we were expecting to find that. Expecting to find that. So, if you, the way the simulations were done is you grow a tissue until it's chromeostatic state, then you look, and then you can change cell division and cell death, but you keep the chronostatic state. You put zero cell division and zero cell death, so you grow the tissue, you put zero cell division and zero cell death, there's a beautiful misfest. If you put a tiny amount of cell division on cell best, Tiny amount of cell division on salt best, which almost immediately. But there is a more precise simulation that was done by John Ruth four years later. Finds the same thing, and what he shows you is that it's visceralizing after time until you reach the plateau that you would have produced with it. Somehow, anything I know tells you that as long as the tissue divides enough, that's extremely, extremely weak. Extremely extremely weak. That's weak is here. So I didn't. I was expecting also to find a distress. I won't show you that I said for months. There is a deep stress. If the deal stress doesn't show up, at least it's consistent with this problem. So, yes and no. If I look at short time, If I look at short times, ultimately we find the elastic computers that we know and what it is. Now you would criticize my way of doing this on Zagreb formulation. This is a simple thing that I get. My guess, and it could be the same if I put, if I take into account the previous question, my guess is the exponent here would be better. I mean, you can even calculate the exponent. You can even calculate the exponent of the p-factor exactly as a one-time transition score. I would say I'm not sure there's anything general with that, and we haven't checked it. Some of the experiments, like the experiments that I showed in the beginning by Paulo Lieu and his group, were saying that the experiments were better featured if you said that the tissue was in the food. So, that I was expecting. Now, if you use a Use a different model and find a different exposure. I don't have any proof. This is the simplest thing I can do that respects images. That's what you were saying, but I don't want to describe local LST symptoms. But have we measured actual epithelial cell rheology? Yes and no, but so. So, Stéphane Descrois is interested in the intestine. The intestine is a tube of cells and it has its peristalic motion compared to what's in there. And lots of people claim that, and there's a lot of cell differentiation in the intestine. There's this whole story of crypts, and the stem cells are at the bottom, and they move up, and they differentiate. And they claim that the fact that you put peristaltic stress on the tissue is coupled with the differentiation of the cells. So, actually, she's not the only one. So she's not the only one, so there are many, many people who try to stretch intestinal cells. So the way they do it, it's here, it's not very easy for me to explain. This gives you the size of what they call a tissue stretcher, which is a very fancy name. It's nothing else you sketch here. You take the tissue and work out. Um it's a little bit different because there is you could use tissue on a substrate. You know, you try to control adhesion proteins and things like this. Protein, this is the case. And then you measure how the cells orient. And so, if you measure how the cells orient, it means that they are anisotropic and that it's a subsolid or the shear modulus doesn't exist in this point. We calculated them, and what it tells you is that there are two regimes for modules of the. Poisson modulus of the substrate, because if you put on the substrate like this, it changes the action in the other direction. The Poisson modulus, the Poisson matinus is smaller than some clinical value sense-oriented perpendicular. Sense is easy, or just a stretching angle of perplexity. If it's larger, you find this more term which is here. As a critical, there is an angle, finite angle of orientation. So the U size of the So they use cells of the intestine, which were actually something wrong. They use cells that mimic the behavior of the intestine, which are called cacotu cells. And for these, we're always in the regime where the angle is by a cut. They haven't made any mechanical measurements on that. We're trying to push as a way to do that. Mentioned that outside of your talk that there can be geometrical frustration that keeps the packing from progressing to its ground state. So I was wondering, when you go to the hydrodynamic limit, if there's a way of maybe adding some heterogeneity and mechanical properties of the tissue. There's a very nice stuff that you can do, which is a very nice key. You can do, which is a very nice key. You can calculate the real gross weight. Because in my model, all my topological transitions are coupled to mechanics. There's a coupling between mechanics and cores, and you could expect that the sensitivity and its mechanics. So we did that, we took a free tissue and we also. So if there's no fluctuation, what you find is gamma is gamma zero, which is just the active cell. But if you take a hard solid where you have residual internal stresses, you find that the static region rate is gamma zero minus something, and this is the energy to frustrate the state. So that's the most naive way to see it. It's hidden in the calculation that I showed you one month. That's the way to see it, which tells you explicitly what I said in the beginning, that subdivision was capable to V. Subdivision with capital to the records. Perfect time. Thank you, Charles.
