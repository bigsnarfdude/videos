Current situation occurs in D-diminal region. Given a time-dependent PDE, Ut equals LU plus F, with suitable initial and boundary conditions, the PDE is well posed. The variables X and T are defined in D dimensional region times a temporal interval. Also, the solution evolves in one Hilbert space, H. So the Eural way of solving this The Euro way of solving this kind of PDE is a semi-discrete method or method of lie. The steps are as follows. Discretizing the spectral variables using spectral method or other method. Then PDE reduces to one ODE systems. For the resulting ODE systems, we could apply finite difference or exponential integrator or time-splitting methods. Methods and so let's look at a spectrum method. The main idea is using one orthonormal basis function, phi n, lies in the same solution space to form a finite sum denoted by u bigger. This is a nearby solution to approximate the exact solution. So once its coefficients, u n hat t is calculated, then the nearby solution is obtained. nearby solution is obtained. So one way of determining its coefficient is Galaxy method. So now let's denote the resulting ODE systems by U prime equals epsilon U plus F. Note that epsilon in the magnetic color is called discretization matrix. Each element of it is written into one inner product, L F N F. So once P D is given, then L is fixed. is given, then L is fixed. So what we can to exploit is just the basis function and its inner product to get a better spectral method. So in this meaning, basis function and its inner product determine the whole spectral method and the vital property of the resulting ODE systems. So this is the whole process absorb time-dependent PDE. Similar to one demonic case. Similar to one demon case for the partial differential operator of first order with respect to XL, let's define its discretization matrix called the differentiation matrix denoted by DL. The superscript L stands for the L variable. So, okay, for the spectral method, in one diminutive case, Marcus and Ariel have summarized the five requirements. Summarize the five requirements to measure the practically efficient spectrum method. So, in multivariate setting, we would like to follow the same requirements, but explain them in multivariate settings. So, requirement one stability. The resulting ODE must be uniformly well-posed, including stability. So, according to Lax equivalence theorem, for well-posed PDE with a consistent PDE with a consistent projection, then stability is equivalent to convergence. So, in this meaning, stability is a non-negotiable factor. So, now it converges. How about the speed of convergence? That's requirement to fast convergence. So, if f is analytic in the closed unit ball, then there exists a polynomial p approximating f with the exponential order. Order. Let's come to requirement three: fast expansion. Of course, we hope to calculate its coefficients f and hat quickly. Requirement four, easy algebra. So for the resulting ODE systems, we could apply finite difference, exponential integrator, and these methods to solve ODE systems. So it's inevitable to calculate matrix vector multiplication. matrix vector multiplication, epsilon HO, matrix exponential, e to power 2 delta t epsilon. We hope there are some special methods or algorithms for both of them. So the last one is also very important, which is the preservation of structure. So HPDE arising in physical field has its own physical structure. So here we are interested in two structures. One is diffuser, given one diffuser. Given one diffusion equation, discretize it in the spectral space using spectral method, then its coefficient hat or u hat t can be written into e to power 2 t epsilon hat u. Now, this epsilon in red color is our discretization matrix, which enjoins the form in the above formula, written in red color. L is from 1 to d. L is from 1 to D, D L star. Star stands for the conjugate transpose D L. So once the DL is a secure Hermitian, then the discretization is a Hermitian semi-negative. In this meaning, HATUT is decreasingly monotically. So this is called diffusion in physical field. The other one is called the preservation of mass. Called the preservation of mass. For linear Schroding equation, this equation discretizes it. Similarly, using spectral method, then hat U T equals E to pi R to I t epsilon, hat U0. Okay, of course, epsilon still, our discretization matrix having the form in the above formula written in red color. F is unitary, V is diagonal. If D L is. If DL is a secure Hermitian, then the discretization matrix epsilon is a Hermitian. So, as we have known, its matrix exponential is unitary. So, in this meaning, the two norm is kept invariantly. So, this is called preservation of one mass. So, now Q commission structure can preserve the structure, okay, can preserve the structures like diffuse. Can preserve the structures like diffusion or mass. So we're wondering what else advantages has it. So now, so if our discretization matrix is secure commission structure or just so we can say that secure complicity meets three requirements. We have summarized five requirements. Meets three requirements immediate. For example, requirement five, we have explained it. Requirement five, we have explained it in the previous slide. Requirement one: if epsilon is a secure condition, then its metrics exponential is unitary, then Laxe equivalence tells us both convergence and stability can be obtained. So requirement for easy algebra. So if epsilon is a secure condition, then there's some special algorithm to calculate its matrix exponential. So moreover, the first order Moreover, the first order differential operator is itself secure symmetric, subject to these conditions. So it's reasonable to discretize the operator into secure commission structure. So what are other remaining two requirements? Requirement two. So in this case, we would like to use analytic basis function, approximate analytic function with exponential order. So the last requirement, fasting expansion. Requirement FASIC expansion? It depends on the concrete form of the basis. So we will figure out in the following contents. So now, considering secure complicity has so many advantages, so one legitimate question is, which of normal basis discretizes the operator into secure commission structure? So the first thought, of course, is your basis. Yes, it's okay. It's valid. It's okay, it's valid. So, how about the orthogonal polynomial? No, it's a discretization matrix, it's just a triangular. So, let's let me summarize or let's summarize the systems of d equals one. Periodic problem, omega equals zero to two pi, fair basis, no problem. For Cauchy problem, infinite interval, area and markers have presented a unit. Presented a unified framework for the T systems, which is tri-diagonal skew Hermitian, followed by many specific systems. How about the infinity interval? When it comes to zero-degree clad problem, minus one to one are a proposed W systems, which has the form. One orthogonal fraction multiplies the square root of its weight function. So, know that there is one. So know that there's one restriction for the W systems. Its weight function must be zero at the end two points, such that W minus one equals W1 equals zero. Okay, one typical example is ultraspheric polynomial multiplies the square root of its weight function. So now how about multivariate region? So using tensor product, we could extend. Product, we could extend the systems of D equals one into some specific multivariate domains. For example, fuel basis to torus T D, T systems to R D, W system to parallel pipes. So next question. How about other domains like ball, triangle, petrohedral, simplex? Could we seek or construct secure information W systems for them? So in So, in this talk, we are only interested in the ball, the domain ball. So, a natural way is to seek or look for those orthogonal ball polynomials. First thing, let's check if they have the secure commission structure. So now, before it comes to orthogonal ball polynomial, so let me define spherical harmonic polynomial on the spherical surface. So, it's a little complicated. This is a function of two variables. This is a function of two variables. Sin function multiplies a Jacobi polynomial with cosine variables with trigonometric function. Now, with this basis, orthogonal polynomial is a product of Jacobi polynomial and spherical harmonic polynomial. So the corresponding weight function is 1 minus norm squared to power 2 mu. So unfortunately, it's not valid in our It's not valid in our case. So, what we can do is just to look for other possibilities. So, we have found the other Zanaik polynomial proposed by a physicist Zanaik in 1934, just for d equals one, extended to the complex plane by Owochi called the disk polynomial. Okay, it has a form. A Jacobi polynomial with a super With the super parameters 0, 1 multiplied by trigonometric function. Sadly, it's not our choice. But wait, this is Jacobi polynomial. According to the one-dimensional W systems, could we just replace the purple term, the term in the purple color, by the one-dimensional W system? So we are not sure this is a new basis function. We will check if it's our option. It's our option. So, this is the theme of the talk. For in the D-Deminobo, we would like to construct or seek one new basis function, enjoying secure cognition structure for the differential agent operators. Also, we would like to study five requirements of the resulting multivariate spectrum method. So, this is our aim. Now, let's Now let's consider the bowl. Analytic functions in the bowl obey zero boundary conditions. So this condition inherits from the one-dimensional W systems, such that F1 theta equals zero denotes the space by AB. So now, as I have introduced, the form of the basis function enjoys one dimensional W system denoted by phi n tilde multiplied by the field. phi n tilde multiplies the trigger dominant function. Now tilde phi n is one orthogonal polynomial multiplies the square root of its weight function. Okay, as I have introduced in the motivation to get a better spectral method, what we can exploit is the basis function and its inner product. Now we have chosen the basis function. How about the inner product? So one obvious way One obvious way is using the last formula as our inner product with the weight function R. So, in our paper, there is one general theorem to prove this is not valid, not suitable in our case. So, which inner product should we choose? The next one. Only take this one. The weight function is one. This is better. Under this inner product for d equals two, For d equals 2, let us define the concrete form of the basis function. P n tilde is orthonormal Jacobi polynomial multiplied the square root of its weight function and trigonometric function. So here it is. As we have known, the two parameters of Jacob polynomial were supposed to be larger than minus one. However, according to the restriction of one dimensional WC, One diminal W systems, the weight function must be zero. So in this case, let's change them to the positive. Alpha, beta, both of them are positive. Then W function is zeros. So under the inner product, using the basis function, we could have secure information structure for those operators. We know that we have these conditions, positive. Have these conditions, positive alpha and beta. However, this condition introduces a new problem. Now, let's go back to our basis function. Okay, the basis function is zero at i equals one and i equals zero. Okay, in this, in other words, the basis function is only suitable for to approximate those functions f being zero at i equals one and r equals zero. Okay, the situation is not. zero. Okay, the situation is not inconsistent with our assumption. We only assumed f approximating function is zero at i equals one, not at the origin. So, okay, what can we do? How about the convergence at i equals zero? One remedy is proper orthogonal splitting is introduced. Split F, so let's define it: split F into F naught, F1. F naught, F1. So we have assumed F is zero at I equals one. Now the first condition is all of them are zero at I equals one. So the second condition is our definition is let's leave the message of F at F naught. So F naught zero equals F zero. F1 zero is zero. Now in this case, F1, the function, so is, okay, our basis function is suitable for suitable. function is suitable to approximate f1 this function because f1 is zero at r equal to zero and one so in addition we have considered the physical structure especially the preservation of mass in the schroding equation so we'd like keep the norm invariantly or invariable so let's make f naught and f1 orthogonal so So the practical scheme is choose two functions, F naught tilde, F1 tilde. Obey the above two conditions using just one single step, a gram schmitch to make them to be orthogonal. So one reasonable choice is F naught tilde is just one minus R F zero sit. Look at that. If I equals one, this is zero, no problem. If I equals zero, yes, F zero z. zero yes f0 seed is just f naught tilde zero seed so f1 tilde is just the remainder f minus f naught tilde so pOS suggests us to approximate f separately split f into f naught f1 they are orthogonal then using the just trigonometric function to approximate f naught and our new basis function And our new basis function is for F1. Their coefficients can be calculated by these two formula, just integrals. Now, let us summarize what we have obtained. Positive alpha beta leads to scale symmetric, but bad convergence at R equals zero. The remedy is a POS. So combining both of them, requirement one is satisfied. So now, So now we would like to use the analytical basis function to approximate the analytical approximated function. So now let's choose alpha beta even integers because we have used, especially in the one-dimensional W system, square root exists. So let's choose alpha beta even integers. Then we will have the exponential order. So we have requirement two. So we still have three requirements. So now let's just jump to requirement. Now let's just jump to requirement for fast algebra. So considering we have approximate F separatedly, so consider fast algebra separatedly. For F1, through these transaction parameters, I just show the concrete structure. DR is a differentiation matrix. Okay, look at that. It's a skew symmetric. Note that I is an undetected matrix. undetected matrix with the dimension 2m plus 1 and all these values a1 b0 a2 b1 are just scalar values and it's semi-separable massively spast d theta is just a diagonal matrix so in this case fast algebra can be obtained so how about f naught we just use the trigonometric to approximate f naught so d theta is a diagonal of course it's secure formation A diagonal, of course, it's secure formation. For dr, it's just a one times one, just a scalar value whose real part can be calculated by the formula. So now we have the fast algebra. So next one is requirement file. If the system could preserve those structures which we are interested in. So let's compile, let's put everything together. It's called compiled differentiation matrices. Differentiation matrices, epsilon R and epsilon theta. So epsilon R D is a scalar value, D R is a square sign matrix, which appears in the previous slide. So epsilon theta is just a diagonal matrix, which is, yes, of course, Q commission. So also we are interested in the differential operator of second order. So this is with respect to R denoted by big R for theta. By big R for theta denoted by theta. Okay, R is still symmetric and its last largest egg values is bounded. Theta is symmetric and the negative semi-definite. So now let's put them into the Furing equation. So this is the standard definition for the stability. So the condition is satisfied. So the method is stable, but disapprobivity might be lost. might be lost. So how about a linear Schroding equation? R plus theta is symmetric, then multiplied by the imaginary number is still secure formation. Then its matrix exponential is unit, which means stability and unitarity are preserved. So, okay, we still have two computational issues. Requirement three, how about their coefficients? The their coefficients. Now we have approximate f separatedly, split it into f naught and f1. For f0, we just use a trigonometric function. So using fft to calculate it. So how about the coefficients of f1, fm and hat? There are two integrals. One is theta integral using fft. R integral, let's use just orthogonal polynomials, the fast algorithms for orthogonal polynomials. For orthogonal polynomials. Okay, so the last one is the construction of differentiation matrices. So note that all those AMBM are just the scalar values can be calculated using this formula regressively and just once. So until now, we have analyzed everything of d equals 2. How about the general d diminished unit ball? Let's call it a general. Unitable. Let's call it generalized zonite functions. So the basis function has formed the WC terms and multiplied by trigonometric function. Okay, split F into F naught and F1. Calculate their coefficients by these two formula. Okay, for the angular variables using F. Variables using FFT and for R, DR is still semi-separable. Okay, so this is a massive disparity, and there are some good algorithms for matrix vector multiplication and matrix exponential. So now let's just jump to numerical experiments. For d equals 2, this is our test function f i theta 1 minus i r to make sure f1 theta is 0. Split it. one theta is zero split it into f naught f1 f circle k approximates f naught f n k is for f1 so here we are interested in the coefficients of f1 denoted by f n k hat however there are two sub indices that's rearranging into one index just fq hat also we are interested in the errors uh denoted by or call it by e by or call it by E infinity E2 calculated at these discrete points m equals 6. So there are more experiments in our paper, but here I only chose three of them. Okay, so first thing, let's show the alpha beta equals two, so to make sure the analytic basis function, but no POS. So how about the convergence? The left wing. convergence. The left figure we plotted the coefficients of F1 scaled by Q to power 2, 1 quarter, and the middle one is scaled by Q. So it's evident the decay rate of the coefficients is about Q to the power 2 minus a quarter. So in the right figure, the errors are depicted. So the dot line denotes E2. E to the solid line is for E infinity. So their behavior are not good. So next example, let's choose just alpha beta equals one. So there's no, so the basis factor is not analytic. But let's introduce POS, means let's split F into F naught and F1. Okay, similar to the previous slide. So the left figure is F, the coefficients of F1 scaled by F1. coefficients of F1 scaled by Q to power 2 a quarter scaled by Q so it doesn't very well so the in the right figure the E to n E infinity it converges a little but go tends to flat so after 70 terms so still not good last example let's put everything together with the energy Together with the analytical basis function and POS. In the left figure, it's the logarithmic of the coefficients for F1. So yeah, it's evident. It goes or decays very fast exponentially. In the right figure, the dotted line is E2, solid line is E infinity. So yeah, it behaves very good. When we choose very good when we choose t equals 77 the order minus minus i 10 to 10 to power to minus i 9 can be obtained so it works very very well and based on the chosen basis function and inner product so for the resulting multivariate spectrum method these five requirements can be obtained okay in this talk we have Okay, in this talk, we have constructed one of normal bases in the unit pool enjoying screw commission differentiation metrics also satisfy the five requirements. So being the last speaker, I would like to congratulate you for the success of the workshop. So that's all for now. Thanks for your attention. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Jean Salvador. Do we have one question? Yes, Max. Thank you for the talk, Kinera Jean. Do you think that this could be extended to annuli, so annuli or spherical shells, de-dimensional spherical shells where the radius is going from A to B rather than zero? I'm very sorry. I'm very sorry. I can hear you, but I'm not very clear. Microphone seems to be here. Sorry? Marcus, don't repeat. And it doesn't work. Can you hear me now? Can you hear me, Jim? No, you couldn't much color. I think aneurysm would be easier than the sphere. Because you don't have the problem of dog. The problem of the sphere is that the mapping from Cartesian to poral coordinates is simple. And when you have an ambulance, another question. Another questions from somebody who volunteer to come here? Yeah, yeah. Okay, so Jean, thank you again. Okay, thank you, thank you. I hear you clearly, Karina. Thank you, thank you, thank you very much. Very sorry, Michael Stee was one of this victim, so very sorry that you are not in person. Okay, everyone, so I would like pain all of you, and I have no doubts, but it's so nice because all of you are so interested in our research and open-minded and friendly. Thank you for this. I don't know that we will meet in very similar groups somehow. Good, some other thank you. Okay, so now we have coffee and liquid lounge and interview us from the back. Sorry, yes, that is a host. Yeah, follow up. Not to not follow up. Very modern. Very modern. Follow up. Send me people sitting. To see open the birthplace, please tell me. Oh, yes, for what? For what can you decide on this?
