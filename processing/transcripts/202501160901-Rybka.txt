Excellent, my microphone. Okay, thank you very much. And thank you for inviting me here. So, I'm Grey Ripkan from the University of Washington, Seattle. I've been asked to tell you about prospects for axion detection. I am adding in the laboratory because there's a lot of astrophysics that I don't really know. We've heard some about it, we'll hear some more, but I'm going to stick to laboratory, you know, ground-based direct detection, if you will. Anyway, you will have told us there are axions out there. The truth is out there, and we simply need to raise our eyes to the sky and see. Our eyes to the sky to see. Okay, Wayne? Right, so the experimental challenge of the string axiverse at first to me was that at least maybe this is out of date, is to say, well, yes, there's plenty of axions in string theory. The mass could be anything. Really, the coupling could be anything. And that's what I came. You know, maybe what I believed six months ago, but I understand. It's not only in Donnie's paper, and then Jacob had talked, even shared a plot like this, but maybe you're. Like this, maybe you're telling me nano EV to milliEV is where we ought to be looking. In which case, I've got some good news for you, because that's kind of where it's maybe the better prospects. So let's get into it. Right, so from, I don't know if I even count this as the experimentalist perspective, but in the end there's Lagrangian that you read this off and you say, okay, there is this thing called the axion, it's the A here, and it can couple to photons, and it can couple to the nuclear electric dipole moment. To the nuclear electric dipole moment. You kind of couple to the axial nuclear moment. You're like, okay, this is like protons and neutrons, some mixture of these. And then maybe, maybe electrons, maybe not. I never talk to the axial nuclear moment. To divide these up, these are kind of hard right now. This is very clean. It's also nice. I mean, the axion is light. Photons are massless. It's natural to make axions. Light things go to massless things. It's not so easy to have light things go to massive things. Like things go to massive things. So there's a natural favorite to the left, but there's a lot of interest in the right, and it's kind of growing. And I suppose I should say, who am I aiming this talk at? Because there's a number of people who know this, they know all about the experiments. We go to a lot of phenomenologists that I did along very well with. And you all should just nod off. I decided that there are people who are coming from the string world who are kind of new to axions. I got some questions, like, how did you even detect them? And I was really excited because I was like, oh, I can actually. Them and I was really excited because I was like, oh, I can actually contribute. And so those are the people that I'm talking to. And so you all pay attention, and the others can nod off. And so when I tell you, like, so like you've seen plots like this all the time, and but you start from the beginning, you're like, okay, from an experimentalist perspective, all the plots we make, we put the mass on the x-axis and we put some coupling on the y-axis. And if you know, if you've never, if you've, all you've done is string, then you're like, that needs to be explained, and now I've explained it. There's assumptions built in here because you see all these colors. Built in here because you see all these colored bands, and these are experiments, and astrophysics, and observations, and these, you know, everything except yellow, you know, all these colors are exclusions. And this color is the QCD axion, of which we have these two favorite benchmark models. And some of these are just like, look, this assumes the axion must be some level of QCD axion. Some say any axion-like particle is acceptable, and some say we're assuming the axion is dark. Some say we're assuming we actually have this dark matter, all of dark matter. For example, these. When they draw an exclusion limit, they're assuming 100% dark matter. And so, for the uninitiated, if you're saying, oh, that region's totally excluded, make sure you double check that there's not an assumption built into that experiment. We have to make some compromises so we can share the same, you know, we can put each other on each other's points. Right, and here is my loose organization, and there's more experiments and There's more experiments and experiment types than what I'm going to talk about, but since this is prospects for discovery, I'll probably step on some toes, but there are some things excluded on accident, there's some things excluded on purpose because I see them just too far down the line, and you can only show so much. But we'll talk first, roughly, about experiments that do not require axion to be dark matter, of which there is a limited number, and then we'll move into dark matter axions and sort of work our way through here. And then sort of work our way through them. Right, and I usually leave these out, but since this is for newbies to axions, in the early days, the axion was a, you know, it's like, well, everything's at the weak scale. It's probably MeV, GeV. And so all in the 70s, there were these experiments with accelerators. And the interesting ones to me were the beam dump experiments, which are you shine particles through walls. And so you would take whatever, you know, the beam line at Slack or wherever. The beam line at Slack or wherever, and you'd slam it into a hill. And you dig a hole over here, and you'd put a detector here, and you'd be looking for the axion, which is fairly weakly coupled, to be produced, pass through all this matter, and then reconvert usually into gamma rays. It could be pions at some point, over here. And so these were done and done very well. And so hesitantly, I say, look, axions above EV are excluded, but that's actually a lie, right? If you want, you can have GEV axions as long. GEV axions, as long as you make them much, much more weakly coupled than the QCD axion, it's permitted. Maybe they're given different names. But in my mind, this is just kind of standard accelerated territory and therefore of no interest to me. But just recall our history here of shining light through hills of hills of dirt. Right, moving below EV, we will move into the more modern experiments. Kind of the more modern experiments is now you shine a laser through a brick wall or a hill of dirt. I think they just have a steel plate. And the idea is you have a photon coming in, you have a magnetic field. The axion-photon coupling means that this mixes into an axion. The axion passes through, reconverts into a photon. So you put a laser on one side, you put a brick wall here, you put a detector here, and you know, this is EV-ish photons. You see EV-ish, you're looking for EV-ish photons here. If you see them, that means. Photons here. If you see them, that means there's been conversion and unconversion, reconversion, it's one of those things going through. And this allows you to put, oh, that's supposed to be a G there. Oh, that picture up covered the, all right. So this is axion photon coupling. This is axion mass. And more or less for axions with mass below, you know, well below whatever your photon energy is, you can exclude it. And there's Crows, Alps, or Oscar, excuse me, are had excluded up here. Excuse me, are had excluded up here. The QCD axiom is sadly down here right now. However, there are ideas to improve these. ALPS2 actually has a, the ALPS2 experiment has an initial run, though anything they've released is preliminary, but they have many interesting techniques where they say, LG, you know, why give one photon one chance to turn into an axion? I can have the photon bounce between the mirrors, and so I do enhancement of my axion production, and then Of my axion production, and then time inversion process. If I have mirrors here, I can have the virtual photon bounce between mirrors and increase the phase space for conversion, and so I can increase the conversion rate, increase my sensitivity. And then furthermore, you can say, oh, I can set up an entire resonance with your complete mixing of the axion and photon fields, so that you're not only resonant here and here, but also here. It's very cool. And it pushes you down there. And we'll see where it falls when we get to more of these axion-photon experiments. Yeah, question. Oh, what sets the offset? Yeah, question. What sets the oscillations in the balance on the right-hand side? So here you're getting to where the axion wavelength and the photon wavelength are mismatched. So you get to where there's an interference effect. And so if they end up exactly out of phase across here, then it's a bad. And if they're back to being close to in phase, it's good. Close to in phase, it's good. It kind of falls off that way. Sorry, is the dash line a forecast? The dash line is a forecast. Thank you. I'm going to try and try and remember that because usually I'm really strict about this, but this time I've played a little loser. And so if I don't say it, please call me out because I have a whole thing about people over predict. But the dark stuff on the right is actually an exclusion, some of that or not? So this is true exclusion. This dotted line is a forecast. This dotted line is a forecast. This is weird interference effects from the that makes their prediction, you know, they ran their program and things get what happens. So this is still for us. What is the expected framework for that? They are currently operating a prototype model around here. And then this is still years away. So we can make axions with lasers, but it's like fusion power. Fusion power is great. It works. We can see it all the time. Why bother building on Earth? We've got a perfectly good gravitational fusion device. We've got a perfectly good axion creation device called the Sun. And there are helioscopes. CAST is the most famous one, where you produce. Is the most famous one where you produce axions in the sun? They're now KeV is the favored energy range. You convert them into gamma rays in a magnet and then pick them up and detect them. So it's like light shining through walls, except it's axion shining through space. And it's, I mean, obviously you cap this off, so there's no just regular photons getting. It depends on your axion-photon coupling. It depends on your axion-nucleon coupling. Because the production of the sun is complicated. The production of the sun was complicated. However, they try and take QCD assumptions and subtract this out so we can plot them on the axion-photon plot. So there's our axion-photon plot. Now we're getting into where this yellow band marks the QCD axion. So cast set limits here. We've heard about this, how this is the same thing where your wavelengths are getting mismatched, but you can cut out a larger space by introducing a dielectric to rearrange. Dielectric that to realign your wavelengths. And so using helium-3, they will cut into the QCD range around EV. And then there is a planned experiment called IAXO with an intermediate experiment called Baby IAXO here. I think Baby IAXO is moving ahead. IAXO is still, it takes a very big and very expensive magnet. So in terms of timeline, they always get the timeline of like, okay, if we were allowed to buy the magnet tomorrow, it'll be three years, four years. But the big question. Four years, and but the big question is: when are they allowed to buy the magnet? That's you'll hear that story a lot with axion. Yeah, sorry, I didn't understand something you just said. Do you mean that the cast exclusions secretly depend on the axion-nucleon coupling? It's complicated, but yes, right? So, you have to, so there's, this is a very glib picture where the axion production in the sun is, it all comes from the same thing, right? And you've got photons. And you've got photons, you've got magnetic fields, but you've also got nucleons moving around. And I can't talk intelligently about, I realize Jor could do this, where he would draw the different fusion processes and be like, this one emits axions at this many KeV, and this one does it this many KeV. So it's complicated. Is that a sufficient answer? I mean, the sun's complicated. But so, like, if I haven't multiplied, not the key. Okay, if I haven't multiplied the QCD axion, you may be able to squeeze out of some of these cast points. So I can take you can consider processes in the relation of coupling. Is that what you might consider a concern of purely by considering production through the Faucian coupling and attention through the Foucault coupling? And is that what those lines show? I believe so. So you can also find constraints which are on the product of the axion nucleon and axion proton. The axion nucleon and axion proton coupling, where you're considering these other production channels. You could also interpret these things in a model in a way, which might be sensible to see the aircraft on fresh space. Low masses, high cup weights, it's worth the effort. All right, thank you. So to make sure I'm getting what you're saying, is so this plot that I stole is, you think this one is the ultra-conservative, where you say these are photons made in the sun. Say these are photons made in the sun, they convert in the magnetosphere, and they convert back to photons in the experiment. And so it is truly just GA gamma gamma? Okay, good. Okay, that's then that's okay. That's better than I lied, and it's better than I said. But there are more, so there are more complicated ways of interpreting it because they're all also nuclear production. Right. Okay, so that's what I've got in terms. Okay, so that's what I've got in terms of dark blue is true exclusion from a decade ago. Light blue are forecasts. And then baby IAXO is a project you can imagine going ahead, and IAXO is something that relates to a big map. So that sets your time off. Right. Right, so I'm moving away from experiments that are, you know, produce your own axions. If we assume dark matter is made of axions, then we have an enormous axion source. Things, and now this is my stock, this is my stock wave-like dark matter slide, which you all probably know about this, but which is a small point, am I going back? Sure, sure, one more. Sorry. You know, it's it's notable that you know those green exclusion curves from ADMX and you know other experiments. And other experiments, that you're stopping at the bottom of the yellow band, you're not going into lower components. But there are a bunch of actually reasonably nice structured axial models, QCP axial models, where you live down and below that yellow band. So it's very hard to get models that live above that, but you can definitely get models who live below that. And I know why you're stopping, because you want to go through the... Let's float into this conversation while I get to Halo Scopes. This conversation where I get to Halo scopes. Because then we'll go through the whole detection process, and then I will whine and moan about how hard it is and how much money it costs. And you'd be like, it's going to be fun. But I've got bigger fun is that that space below the yellow band is also an interesting space. Sure, I write down very nice models that said that. Of course. For the QCD action. Yes. Well, right, and we will talk more about those when we get to haloscopes. Um right um so things, and this these are the things I when I when I give this talk to people who are mostly used to WIMPs, I have to kind of ease them into the topic and the notion that WIMPs are particles and axioms of waves. And just the natural, the nature of being sub-EV. And this both comes out in the de Broglie wavelength, but it also comes out in the occupation number. So, in terms of just the raw quantum mechanics, it's WIPS are like, you know, there's one in a coffee cup and there's Here there's one in a coffee cup, and there's here's 10 to the 44 and a coffee cup for an axiom. Actually, that's well, it's a bigger than coffee. It's a lot of coffee. But it's interesting, it's worth remembering here that it's a very different object, like a radio wave. And like a radio wave, you detect them fundamentally like an antenna, is you want to look at frequency versus power plots or number plots. And so you get things like power versus frequency, and when you're looking for an axion, there's always some noise because of these low. Some noise because of these low frequencies, there's always thermal noise, and you end up looking for a bump, a spike. You zoom in, and the structure of this spike characteristically has kinetic information about the axion. So, and this is going to be more or less true for most of these experiments, interpreted in different ways. So, you may ask, why is this field so fun? Why is this field so fun? Why am I going to go just this wide diversity of experiments when in other places there's like, look, you know, we have one accelerator. Can I ask a question? Back on the slide. Back? Yeah, back on. Sure. It says here, measurement of wave dot matter is inherently a quantum measurement. Does that mean a radio antenna is inherently a quantum measurement? Or is this like just jumping on the quantum measurement path I think? Like a radio antenna is not a quantum measurement. Well, I can argue that a radio antenna is a quantum measurement depending on what the back-end electronics are. If your radio antenna, if you've got, like if you're saying, oh, I'm squeezed state receiving with my radio antenna, it is a quantum measurement. That being said, your first statement is true, is that there's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of excitement for quantum measurement, and so just And so just we'd like to talk about the quantum mechanics because that's what the people who would like to hear. But we will, it's actually, I'll get more into, like, there are some things that are truly deep quantum sensing. And so you remind me of that. It's also true. That's right. And so even if you really want to. Yeah, yeah, the quantum the temperature noise could be. The temperature noise could be, you're in the quantum look at that. Yeah, yeah. So, like, it doesn't even have, you're measuring, you're likely measuring something within quantum mechanical origin, right? Like, it's not, even if the signal really is just a classical. But the world is quantum mechanical. Everything is quantum mechanical origin. You're measuring some kind of regime in which the quantum mechanics are actually relevant for natural processes. Yes. And I've absolutely argued that a classic, you know, old-style thing. A classic old-style photo tube is fundamentally, it's measuring the number basis. Isn't that so quantum? So, yes, that's the problem. It's like, yes, the world is quantum, and therefore it's all quoted. But you'll hear about some stuff that just truly counts to quantum sensor. So, I made this plot to explain why there's so many different wild types of axion experiments, because I feel it's so there's some link scales involved. So, if we're saying, look, sub-EV down to nano-EV or below, if I Down to nano EV or below, if I start plotting, okay, what's the Compton wavelength, what's the Broglie wavelength of the axioms, what's the correlation time, and that's this is this is heavily assuming you know isothermal dark matter halo. And then I break sizes up into where, let's see, so this is big, this is like, you know, astrophysical scales, this is microscopic scales, and this is laboratory scales. In kind of our sweet spot here, we're doing a crossing, and so maybe this. And so maybe this, here's a quantum thing: is that you're really caring about the wavelength and whether wavelength is bigger than the apparatus you build, smaller or larger, and that sets that. So it makes the field very fun because there's a lot of different ideas out there. And usually, you know, something that works here is not going to work here. Something that works here is not going to work here. So you'll hear a variety. And indeed, here's a variety back from Snowmass, just getting to be a while ago where we talked about looking at the QCD band. Looking at the QCD band, we labeled it by the mass here, and we kind of suppressed whatever the coupling was. And right now, there's haloscopes touching QCD, there's astrophysics, there's super radiance, and then near-term experiments, you'll hear about these, ADMX, Indian Radio, and then future projects, which is just all over the map. These are good ideas, and there's ideas to reach all parts of the Axion QCD axion parameter space with the classical QCD coupling. Space with the classical CCP couplings. I'm not going to bet on any of these below. And roughly, you know, time kind of goes down here. So the further down they are, maybe the four, the further in the future are. I mean, you can get even wilder if you're looking for scalar, non-pseudo-scalar particles. Probably won't touch on those much. So now I'm going to talk about some of these couplings to prep you for the next slide. So I said the axion-nucleon couplings were perhaps the more. Couplings were perhaps the most more challenging to attack, and these plots maybe capture that in that. So, if I take axion-proton coupling, axion-neutron coupling versus mass, the QCD axion has maybe stricter predictions here than here. But fundamentally, it's astrophysics that's setting any limits up here. And these experiments are not quite there yet. Some are EDM experiments, some are like the torsion balance. Some are like the torsion balance. This is axions, the fifth force. It's a beautiful experiment, and it's just orders and orders and orders of magnitude away from being interesting from the nuclear space. But there's ideas out there on the horizon. The notion being that if I have a nuclear spin in a magnetic field, a dark matter axion field is a perturbation on this. If you get your vectors right, you can induce far more rotation. And this is just like NMR. We know how to build NMR. How to build an R. And so there are notions out there, like Casper and others, that use various combinations of your axion couplings to look for the spontaneous precession of spins caused by dark matter in a magnetic field. And they make the, you know, so those experiments are up here and working their way down here. And they hope to get here next, and then they hope to get it even farther. This is a This is going to be a lot of work to get down here. If you talk to the classic NMR people, you write down the sensitivity you need and they start laughing. But that's just always how you first they laugh and then they gasp and then they applaud, we hope. But this is a long ways off. I could also mention an experimental technique that fits neither here nor there for me is if you like torsion balances like I do and you like NMR, you can try to combine the two. You can try to combine the two and look for axion fields sourced by chunks of spins and combine them. That's the Ariadne experiment. And it hopes to get down here, but it has the same thing where the desired NMR precision is beyond what is technologically available now. But that's just, you know, who say they will advance it. So, and this is some of the best hopes for the low, low, low ultralight masses. So now that I've talked about the language, So now that I've talked about nucleon bounds, we get into the photon bounds, which I feel that's the one that I'm most involved in, ones I talk most about. So remember, axion-photon coupling lives here, axion mass here, QCD axion line here may be our favorite mass ranges here, which is good because we've got experiments poking in here. We've talked about there's those CAST, those helioscope limits, there's the light shining through walls experiments. Is the light shining through walls experiments? So the desired ALPS 2 fits down, up there is kind of the goals. We'll now move into the meat of the matter, the haloscopes that are assuming axioms of dark matter, and narrowly probing the mass range. And with, you know, coming, I will take you way back for those of you string theorists, so back to how I understand this. I remember E and M, I remember Maxwell's equations. I remember EM. I remember Maxwell's equations. It's kind of the last class where everything made sense. And fortunately, we can take that Lagrangian and, with a little tweaking, just say, ah, this is a modification to Maxwell's equations. There's our favorites. There's our, you know, the gradient of the axion matters. That actually usually is small for a slow axion. But here, the time derivative of the axion. So for teaching students, I always like to say, look, so there's a current here, J, and J. And axion coupling times magnetic field times dA dt acts exactly like a current. So if there is dark matter with axion oscillating at its mass, it looks exactly like a current. And so now go back and take every cell phone antenna trick you can and try and redesign it, you know, to pick up that sequence. And I also, in my classes, like to take out this demo where you have two tuning forks and you Tuning forks, and you set them side by side, and you whack one, and you talk about resonant energy transfer, and you snatch it up, and the other one is now ringing. Because even though they're coupled only weakly through the air, because this has exactly the same resonant frequency as that, the coupling becomes very efficient. And then you do the same experiment with moving one of these so it's detuned and show that we do not efficiently transfer energy. So this is resonant energy transfer, and that's what we're relying on in these cables. And that's what we're relying on in these haloscopes. So, and I've labeled here is, you know, which simple harmonic oscillator gets which name. And so, we're tuning this tuning fork, trying to hit that tuning fork there. To go into a little bit more detailed cartoon, you imagine the axiom coming in with a long wavelength. It interacts with the magnetic field here and produces and excites an electromagnetic resonance. I draw this looking like a Feynman diagram to, you know, for the appreciation of the. For the appreciation of the particle physicists who don't like, you know, don't want everything to be a particle, but it's truly: this is a wave, this photon is a wave this big, this virtual photon is a static magnetic field, or all these big things. The size of this cavity, and you've made this cavity so the photons bounce around resonantly, and ideally you've tuned this tuning rod so that this frequency is equal to this mass such that this gets this resonant conversion. And so now you have some number of photons. You have some number of photons coming in here. For us, it's maybe a yakdow watt worth of power, which is not very much. And so you need to amplify it, and amplifying a signal has its own issues with noise, and so you want that to be very quiet, and you digitize it and start making power spectrums. And ideally, you're seeing noise, noise, noise, noise, noise, noise. Bump, that's an axiom, noise, noise, noise. But this only works when your tuning rod is in the right place. And so it ends up being like an old-fashioned AM radio where you're turning a knob and listening. A knob and listening to hear the music here. So this sets the idea for like, you know, what our Platonic ideals for an axion haloscope is bigger cavity volume, the better. More axions inside. More dark matter, the bigger your signal is. Of course, you're constrained by wavelengths, but we can get around those sometimes. Magnetic field, higher magnetic field, more axion conversion. More axion conversion, you want to buy as big a magnet as possible. If you take these together, interestingly enough, the sensitivity goes as B squared V, which is stored energy in the magnet. So you go to the magnet manufacturer and you're like, what's the biggest, baddest, most, you know, largest stored energy magnet you can get? Though there's constraints, of course, about length scales. And you want a highly resonant cavity because once you're on, when you've tuned your cavity to the right axion frequency, the more resonant in your cavity, the better your energy. Cavity, the better your energy conversion, the more efficient it is. The noise, which you don't want to see, is proportional to, well, it's proportional to the temperature, the cavity blackbody radiation. So you want this to be as cold as possible. So you hear me talk about refrigerators. And the amplifier noise needs to be as low as possible. And it ends up, this is where things get really quantum, because it turns out. There's quantum mechanics rules about the minimum amplifier noise you're allowed. So, and just zooming in to show you the mostly to talk about. Show you the mostly to talk about a long time ago, ADMX was the only game in town. These are some of the early experiments here, and then ADMX came along and worked with kind of old school amplifier technology. I mean, we got dilution refrigerators and quantum amplifiers and moved down to here. We are now no longer alone. There's a forest of experiments here, some of which are building up, some of which are simply demonstrations of a particular technology. And so it's got to be quite busy. And there are UV. And there, you can certainly categorize ones that are small scale and just demonstrating one thing in the experiments like ADMX that are trying to hit a particular line. In our case, we've the DFSC benchmark and then cruise across to get our best chance of discovery. But the other experiments that's cruising along up there, that's CABP, that's the Korean group, that there. So, is there a question up there? Yeah, this is Matt Reese over Zoom. Sorry for interrupting. But I want to ask about something here, because my understanding is that you target the DFSC sensitivity, but you assume that the dark matter abundance in our neighborhood is 0.4 GeV per cubic centimeter? 0.45, I think. 0.45, I think, is the number. So, thank you. Yeah, and in the beginning, I mentioned that the y-axis assumes the dark matter density, and this always assumes 100%. Yes, go on. Right. So, that dark matter density in our neighborhood is uncertain by, say, roughly a factor of 2. And so to me, that means that you haven't really excluded the DFSC line at these off there. Because the dark matter abundance in our neighborhood might be 0.2 GeV per centimeter cubed instead of 0.45. So I think the DFSC line is a So I think the DFS scene line is a really good preventable target for multiple reasons. But I'm kind of worried that if ADMX just stops there, then nobody's going to go back and we could just be unlucky with the dark matter bonus happens to be low. So I'm curious what your take is on that. So I 100% agree. And we had a question over here. Maybe this is our time. Because we had another question of saying, look, there's many, many valid models below the FSB. And we can argue whether or not that's true. Can argue whether or not that's true, but I think there's a general push that we ought to go below. And so I will give my comment on this: is that the time it takes to scan, to move our coupling down, goes as fourth root of time, I think, is my scan speed. And so think about it from my perspective. I have my limited lifetime. I would like to discover the axion. I have an experience. I have this experiment as powerful as I can build, and I can either scan wide or scan deep in the experiment that I have. And there's a question of, it's what your priors on where the axion might be and what the dark matter density might be guide you to say, with what I've got, what's the way I can maximize my discovery potential in this run. And so that's. And so that's kind of sets what this is: is that I kind of everyone agrees the DFSZ is a good benchmark to go for, and that is a benchmark that we are just able to achieve with the experiment we have and still cover a visible space in terms of frequency, and that's what we've done. What I would say is that you didn't actually reach the DSLC you mentioned mark if you sort of marginalize over uncertainties in dark matter dominance. Sure, but I've reached KZZ KSVZ at a quarter dark matter density. Of our computer density. The KSDC is much less compelling than the FSDZ. Ah. And my worries, it might be 100 years before anybody tries to repeat this. If you just say it's excluded, people don't pay attention to the fine print. So this really concerns me. Okay, so you think the discovery potential is better if we scanned one quarter of the mass range at twice? No. I guess if we pushed ourselves down to be. I guess if we've pushed ourselves down to be down at the bottom, so at a lower dark matter density, and scanned one quarter of the mass range. Well, I think other people would then take up other parts of the mass range. But I think if you claim the whole frequency range is excluded, I'm worried that just nobody will reject the meeting just instead. Well, I think that's everybody else's mistake then, if they don't check. Can I let you rephrase it? Sure. So you said. Sure, just like this. So, so you say, going deeper with the current technology, the company goes like these quarters, you're not going to bother doing it. So, what would you have to improve in terms of the intended detector technology that you could scan deeper below DFSC at a marginalized dark matter density or at a different D over N and still do it in a reasonable time? How much would you have to improve the detectors to say, Detectors to say, if Max says tomorrow I predict that the dark matter is there, what detector would you need to go back and do it? Right, so that's actually, maybe this is a pushback to say that people won't do the experiment again at better sensitivity, is because to get to higher frequencies, we have to develop better tech detectors. And part of that detector technology improves everything and lets you go back and build experiments that in a finite time can put That in a finite time can push this down. Does that help you feel a little better? And the other thing is that I completely agree. At no point should we ever say, yes, the axion hypothesis is completely excluded because we managed to touch this DFSE line at 0.45 GeV per CC dark matter. So great. I think it might make people feel better if the response tense and the ADMX scan strategy. Like strategy on a 10, 20 year time scale, that there was some idea that someday you go back. And so I think that some of that, the concern there, perhaps on that's part is right, there is this region of the parameter space where the exclusion is set at KSVZ and not at what we've been calling DFSC. And I thought sort of the line there was that actually we're just going to keep going to higher frequencies rather than going. Into higher frequencies rather than going back to that low frequency regime and pushing those points down. And so, so, so, yeah, so now we're now back to, you have a certain amount of time. Where do you believe the axion is? Do you believe it's in this mass range and lower? Or is it in this mass range and higher? And so you pick the best direction you can go. The information that I'm getting right now from people who model. Getting right now from people who model the early universe and saying what mass gives you the right dark matter, is saying ADMX is on the lower end of where you ought to look. And so I'm feeling a lot of pressure to move higher, but that can, you know, sometimes the winds change. I think there are strong and unjustified theory priors in that statement about post-inflation axions, but the inflation axioms, it could be anywhere in this range. Thank you very much. It warms my heart to hear that, actually. Yeah. That actually. Yeah. I was going to ask a related question, which is: you know, the bottom of the reach that you guys have is quite jagged. Are those places where you thought you might have had a signal and you checked further? Yes. Can you, can you, it's a good question. Can you ask when, I'll get some recent data, and like the best thing to do is ask, why is your recent data so jagged and it's fresh? Like, why is your recent data so jagged? And it's fresh in my mind. And I will tell you the story of, like, oh, yeah, somebody fell asleep with controls here. It'll be fun. But please ask that again when I'm like, oh, here's our most recent data, and we can talk about it. Okay, so anyway, thank you, Matt. Is that by no means is this the end, but in general, right now the feeling is to wipe this way and then go back for another pass for some other experiment. And that's, you know. And that's, you know, I'm happy to take input on questions and that decision. Okay, with that, let me talk specifically about ADMX itself. I'm the co-spokesperson, so I'm required to, you know, you need some example experimental and some technical details. It might as well be fine. Here's the collaboration. It is not one of these big neutrino collaborations. It is not two people in a basement. Two people in the basement. That's the sketch. It's a nice, it's a small to mid-scale experiment. Here is taking that cartoon I showed you and kind of making a machine model where you can see the parts. There's a cavity, there's a tuning rod, there's a magnet, and then there's the stuff that, you know, there's refrigeration, there's stuff for cryogenic motion. There's a whole separate space, this quantum amplifier package. This is the word quantum again. And there it is. So, this part gets pulled out so you can work on it. So, there's that part of the cavity covered in shields. That part contains the amplifier packing. That's most of the support equipment. That's the magnet down there. Actually, it's going to go in. That's what it's coming through, I think. This might be a little technical, but when you talk about this cavity resonator and tuning, this is what we actually mean when we're tuning in saying that some boundary conditions. Saying that I have some boundary conditions, I have Maxwell's equations, I hit a bunch of resonant modes, and then I plot these resonant modes as I move this antenna. So these light green are resonant modes in terms of frequency versus rod position, and it is, of course, a mess. The lower one here couples to the axion field because you have to think about the wave function overlap, the TM010 with the magnetic field and the axion field are the one. You integrate all that and you get a positive number. You look at like this one and you get. You look at like this one and you get no overlap. Some of these other ones, there's some overlap, but the strongest coupling is this lower one. And so you can see that each cavity we build has some. This one went from 8, 10 to nearly a gigahertz. And so this certainly sets a scale in which you can do one experimental run before you have to build a new cavity. You just kind of start there. And then this is where we were at some time, a long, long time ago. But that's the sense of the tuning. And this is the sort of signal we're looking at. And this is the sort of signal we're looking for, just to remind you: you know, occasionally we'll plot things in terms of signal and noise because we have to scale everything to our noise. It turns out that's the easiest way. And so there's some noise power, there is some putative signal power. The idea is how quick can we scan where this peak is still big enough to easily take out of this? And that's a lot of what the decision making is, and that's what the pressure to move that. You move this, make this stuff smaller, which means you can scan faster. Smaller, which means you can scan faster, which means this peak can be smaller, or some order of that. And so a lot of what we worry about is how do we calibrate and understand the noise? Because you want to take watts into the cavity and turn that into a GA gamma gamma and a rho. And so how do I know watts in the cavity? The way we calibrate it, it's a lot like the CMB experiments where you look at something of known temperature, and then you look at the space. You look at something known as temperature. Space. You look at something known as temperature, you look at space. We have something of known temperature. We actually, since the heated load, we can warm it up and cool it down. And so a lot of the technological development is in getting, you know, pumping this power and being able to switch and look at it and calibrate these sensors here. We use, this is Joseph and parametric amplifiers, our current amplification system. We use that because we are at the point where, you know, Where h-bar omega over our integration time is of order KT. That is to say, we've cooled it down enough that we are now into quantum effects, to noise temperature. And these superconducting amplifiers are the ones that will get down to where you are only getting half-photon required by quantum mechanics. It turns out measuring, when you measure power in a radio, you haven't chosen a good quantum basis. You're measuring both. Chosen a good quantum basis. You're measuring both phase and photon number, and those don't commute. Anyway, but for us, there's a standard quantum limit. It's like 30 millikelvin per gigahertz. And so you need the most advanced amplifiers around. There's the ones used to read out quantum computers. And so we work with this one was Berkeley, the most recent one. The next one's going to be Washington University St. Louis. We'll be developing our RJP bits. And this is what it looks like in terms. And this is what it looks like in terms of just normal operations. So you tune the cavity to a certain frequency, you've got the noise all calibrated, you take a power spectrum, you subtract off all the weird Dane shapes of all your amplifiers and continuers and cables, and you make a plot, integrate for about 100 seconds, then move the tuning frequency, move the tuning frequency, move the tuning frequency, and then at the end of the week, you line all these up. And so these are separated for ease of viewing. It's not like this is more power than this. We've just lined up. This is more power than this. We've just lined up every 100 seconds, and this is a synthetic signal demonstrating what we would hope to see: is that as you move the center of the cavity resonance onto the axion frequency, you get a bigger and bigger bump. And you, then your analysis, you can combine all of this information and capture it to see something like that. So, and this, you know, this is perhaps 20-ish minutes, maybe a little bit more, over which we cover one frequency in each of these, like I said, is 100 seconds. Seconds. Now, axions are not the only things that form bumps in your experiment. There's, of course, if you're running as fast as you can, there are statistical fluctuations. There are radio signals, because people, this is cell phone range, this is Wi-Fi range, TV range, and one uncovered port or one wire that wasn't shielded right. And you get these things. And so we have, you don't have to read these, but this is just to convince you that after our one week, we go back and look and see, oh, there's a bump here, there's a bump there. What do I do about it? There's a bump there. What do I do about it? Well, first, I get to re-scan and see if it persists. This is how we get rid of cell phones. Most human things are not in the same place at the same time all the time. Some of them are. But we only look for persistent signals, and that's because the entire experiment is designed to look for a continuous smooth dark matter distribution. This is bad news, by the way, for people who want mini-clusters, because there's no way for me to say, oh, there was a mini cluster passing through that day, or oh, Passing through that day, or oh, it was lunchtime and everybody was running the microwave for their lunch. And then you, and then it was gone the next day because I checked not on lunchtime. So, this is actually something that I'm thinking about actively, is how do we do that? I should mention the turn off primary synthetic axion injection. We pay members of our collaboration to go behind our backs, and there's a cable that runs to the bottom of the insert, and there's a black box that's plugged into that cable, and they operate it remotely and inject signals for us. They operate it remotely and inject signals for us. We're serious about discovery, and so at any given time, we have discovered one or two axions. So we always have these, we always have these synthetic signals, and we're always going through the process of properly eliminating them. And if we stop seeing them, you know, something's wrong with the experiment. Our discovery potential is down, and we want to cut the data and go back and redo it and fix it. And then, yes. Is there any discussion of Is there any discussion of building duplicate experiments at different locations on Earth? I think that would be amazing. Nobody's planning out because it's too expensive. It's right. We were planning out a next generation experiment. We haven't gotten the next generation experiment going, much less copies of them. And then you can ask again when I talk about other axion experiments, why don't we check for many? Why don't we check for many? Oh, yeah, I'm just going to say, I mean, you said you haven't got to this point. If you get to the point of checking it's proportional to B squared and you find that it's not, I think he might sort of be interested to know whether you still have a, that could be a different model or like a different photon. Well, sure, sure, yeah. If you turn the magnetic field off and it's still there at full strength, then that's a good candidate for a hidden photon. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. But it is, yeah, the clearly one of the last things you want. You want to know whether it's proportional to b squared before you write the paper, for sure. Yeah. I think also this statement that you figure out what you're looking at by turning off the magnetic field is something of an oversimple implementation because for some of these systems where like vibrational noise is a problem, what you actually have What you actually have, right, is you have your experiment vibrating inside a magnetic field. Let me hold off on what I'm saying until I don't want to show up saying it right now. So, just as an example of one of these synthetics that we eliminated, this by the one, this, this. Eliminated this by the one. Our synthetics team is allowed once a year because we normally turn around in a period of a week or two weeks. We say we found signals here, here, and here. Please confirm these are synthetics. And then when we turn them off and we'll rescan them, they're allowed once a year to just flat out lie and be like, we're going to put that in. And then the analysts really go at it. And this is one, you know, this plot has gotten super small. Other than to say the. Other than to say the whole point of it in the end is that this ends up being measured on the TM010 mode, which couples well of the axion. This is measured the TM011 mode, which does not couple well the axion. There is significant power in both. And this is how the local analysts caught the synthetic injectors of saying this thing does not couple like an axion. Like the wavelength doesn't make any sense. It looks more like an antenna someone's stuck in. And they're like, okay, yep, he got us. Okay, yep, you got us. But it is a good exercise in making, you know, both being sure we're ready for discovery and making sure we don't have false alarms. To give you a feel for what our data taking looks like, this is the last year of data taking in terms of where the cavity frequency was versus the time, you know, year, month, year. And so we usually stake off a particular frequency range, say this is going to be it, and then we run the cat, we run the And then we run the cavity up back and forth. You see, there's usually a long, slow scan. This is what we call the initial scan. And then there's usually a second scan where we take places that the amplifier cut out or there's some electrical problem and we cut data. And we get, so we reacquire data on this. There was a question about why is the data so jagged? And so you're imagining, you know, if this has certain periods where things go wrong, like every time you fill the magnet with liquid helium. Every time you fill a magnet with liquid helium, things start shaking around, like you said, and we end up cutting data. And so there's a gap there. We always catch that on the second pass. Then we have these candidates, these excesses, and we rescan them again. And usually, once is enough. Sometimes he takes a couple times. And for some reason, we decided to go high. We're mostly have a run plan, but we also follow where is the noise low. There gets to be these not particularly scientific things where, like, oh, it's. Things where, like, oh, this week the JPA is giving a really low noise at this frequency, so we've got to get it while we can, but mostly working our way down. So, that was a year's worth of data. And with that, let's see. So, last five years, exclusions looked like this. This year, the exclusion looks like this. Notice we're not all the way at DFS-Z over the whole thing, and that's to say DFSZ in the 0.45 GB versus CC, and that has to do the amplifier had a little bit. The amplifier had a little bit of noise beyond the quantum, about an extra 100 millikelvin. And right now, it is, we've pulled the thing apart and we're preparing the amplifier. So we're going to come back and try and push down to this benchmark, however arbitrary it may be. This is a good spot to talk about, you were saying why is it so jagged? So I already gave some reason of where the amplifier noise got a little high in this region. Got a little high in this region. And I can tell you why we think it isn't super technical, but we'll ask you later. There's also these gaps. These gaps are mode crossings. As you're tuning your cavity, you're going through a complicated geometry. I told you one of the modes couples well with the axion. If that gets into a crossing with another mode, then you can't say with good confidence what the axion coupling is, so that data has to be cut. So these things get left to be caught some other time or by some other experiment. And then the other, and then I've also given you the And then the other, and then I've also given you the notion that, like, during magnet fills, for example, if there's things going on in the laboratory, they can corrupt your data, and usually it's better safe than sorry, and you flag the data, cut it, or you de-weight, you know, say the cavity Q is completely poor overrange, it gets de-weighted, and it causes things to really be quite jagged in our system. What about the really narrow missing frequency at 1270? I think those are still most. I think those are still mode crossings. I think all the ones in this preliminary thing are mode crossings, from my recollection. There might be one gigantic, strong radio signal that's like in the air and in the experiment, and you're just like, I have no idea. You can say it's clearly not an axion, but I can't make any statement. But those are usually super narrow. Okay. What about that dip to the left of the word D of the C? Ah, okay. Ah, okay. So these things, where it goes low, you're right that I talked about this rescan process. So if you have a small statistical fluctuation, and so you just spend a lot of time, spend a whole day rescanning that area, everything except that fluctuation gets much, much more sensitive. Or rather, the fluctuation gets much, much more sensitive as well. And so you get some of these things that go down or just you physically spent more time. Sometimes the tuning system. Sometimes the tuning system gets stuck. And you kept, you know, the data taking was on, and you're like, well, I'm not going to throw it out. And so you happen to be super sensitive in one area. So it's so, yeah. And in particular, like these synthetic signals, they have to get hit.
