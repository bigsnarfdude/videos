There is a connection with the problem of classification of pointed half algebra. I'm going to say what is this. And there is another connection with one rules special. Special kind of cofalge that can be seen as deformations of a lithium. So brain equations doesn't seem to have a lot to do with Lithium or these things, and there is a bridge between these two notions, a bridge. It is given by some object that depends. Object that depends on a solution of the red equations. We're going to talk today is Nichols algebra. The aim of this talk is going to be say what is this, what is these Nichols algebras, what role they play in these kind of problems, and a bit of what are the interesting questions that are around these objects. And some of them are directly related just to questions. Directly related just to questions here. So, an Euclid's algebra is going to be a certain type. So, let's fix first. So, V radio vector space space. But I I guess I ca I don't need to say what it is. You all know here. You all know here what is that. And I'm going to construct from here a certain brain, the cofalge. I'm going to say what is this, determined entirely by B. Okay? So how I'm going to do this? First, what is a ho-file, right? I think it would be nice to I think it would be nice to just say because I think a lot of people are familiar, but not all of you are. So, half-algebra, for me, I'm going to say quickly, it's a vector space. It is an algebra, so it has multiplication, so a bilinear map like this, has a unit, we write it like this. We write it like this. To satisfy these are associative, well, this is a unit. So this can be written in diagrammatic terms, certain commutative diagrams that are satisfied. So if I multiply the first two terms, then multiply what is remaining, and if I do that in the other order, Order, I get the same thing. And for units, there is a similar action that encourages that this choose an element here that is a one, that ones time h is the same as h times one that is h. Dually, like if I invert the arrows here, I have the notion of a coalgebra. Have a notion of a coalgebra. So now I have a map here and a code unit that satisfies exactly this action but with the arrows reverse. So I And apply both rotation and then apply it to the left or the right. The same, there is an action with this, that is dual for the action for your unit here. And this notion, well, this is a PI drop plus. Well, this is a P, a drop plus. There is another map, the antipode to satisfy also some action here. That's okay. And the same here with the S on the other side. So Hofager is this. And this notion makes sense in any predicate tensor category. That's why I wrote it like this. So Hofager is when you have this done in vector spaces, but it can be done in any predicted tensor. It can be done in any category you might like this notion. And why I say this is because the Nichols algebra is going to be a Hof algebra, but not in the category of metric space, but in a certain very tensor category defined a link. That's why I talk about this: how we're going to make of algebra. Any statements? There is a certain tensor battery I really like. The drinkful center of the representations of a fire group, for example. Or it doesn't need to be. Or doesn't need to be final, but it's going to be final for me. And this has another description in terms of what is called object and different models over a group. And how does this category look like? Well, the objects are G-graded vector spaces. So it comes with a gradient like this. B has a left G action, so linear, and there is a compatibility that if I act in something of degree h, I go to something of degree the conjugate by h by g. Okay? And this is. Okay? And this is a predicate category in the sense with this predicate the degree of P acting W or homogeneous. And a realization of a Brady vector space is to, this is a vector space with a solution. So if you have your favorite Brady vector space, you have to find a group such that this braiding, this categorical braiding, coincides with the one you had before. And this always comes up. There is always a braiding solution. The use always a radius action. And more importantly, the construction I'm going to do for B of P, the Nichols algebra, is not going to depend on the realization of what you pick. So pick any realization, it doesn't really matter. Important just that you pick one. Once you look, see at the definition, you're going to see it doesn't. Look to see that the definition, you're going to see it doesn't really depend on the reception, but depend entirely of the premium vector space. So, I have to make a half-algebra, so maps m and delta in this category. How do I make that? Well, first I need an algebra, okay? So, I have here ready. So, an easy way to make an algebra is to consider just a tensor algebra, right? It's always uh something that you always can do. It's something that you always can do. Furthermore, but this doesn't, the tensor algebra by itself doesn't see the breaking. It's just something that depends on the structure of the vector space. But if I make this a Hof algebra, it's going to see the breaking. They have a very unique way. So how do I do it? Hof algebra, I need to define a map, conflict location, like this. Is V finite dimensional or algebra? Finite dimensional, yeah, for me. Yeah, I'm gonna be interesting in finite dimensional co-algebras. And one very hard question is when is this object I'm gonna define, that this the Nichols quality algebra, when is finite dimensional? That's one of the big problems. There is like some answers to this question. Like some answers to these questions for some families, but in general, it is like a hard question. It's gonna be a quotient of these tiers. So, I need this to be an algebra map where ho is the structure of algebra and T of B. Structure of algebra in T of B, it has the break, right? So the algebra, the multiplication in T of B, tensor T of B. How do you do this multiplication? You switch stuff here with the braiding and then And then multiply everything multiplication, multiplication. So this object is an algebra in a way that depends on the breaking of the category. And And to require this to be an algebra map, well, this is the tensor algebra, I just have to say co is delta in B. I have to declare what it's going to be, and then by the universal property, I'm going to have an algebra map like this, and I'm going to have this is going to be a half algebra. And this map is going to encode stuff in the brain. I'm going to be explicitly called the the brains and call. Please decode the brandings in call. So let's declare in B delta B is given by this. And this is the reason of why this, there is a connection with D theory. If you the enveloping algebra for D algebra, The Belopin algebra of a D algebra is a Hof algebra where the elements of G, the elements of filtration degree 1, like the generators, satisfy, have a hole multiplication like this. So the Nichols Age is going to be something that behaves like kind of like a lead way. So let's try to describe how this map is more explicitly in terms of the brain. That's things are being fun. So for these, let me traverse shuffles. These are stuff that just determines the radio of the radio. Of the brains that's mine, right? So, when it's a shuffle, the shuffle is Is part of the permutations. This is the permutation group with n elements, such that the first I think the order is preserved and the it would be plus one would be. One will be like this, right? This is the i and minus i shuffle. Okay? The brain boot acts too strong the hand. The n copies of the tensor product of B by itself and times. This is because it's the solution of the predefined question, right? This is exactly basically by definition. And the Bregg group has as a quotient the symmetric group. There is a section that is not a group section. A section that is not a group section, of course, from Sn to the breakgroup. That's the matsumoto section section was the five per month. We have the permutations Si, Ii plus one and if you have a permutation writing terminating a reduced expression here, expression that M sigma in the break group. M sigma in the break group is the same thing with the generators of the break group. Here, I'm thinking the break group is generated the reflections here, it's concepted groups, and this goes to reflections. So, it used to means as short as possible. Short as possible, yeah. Like, write your promotion in the shortest possible Transition in the shortest possible way. There are many ways to do that, but all of them go to the same element here. So, this is a section, in particular, the preserve lengths. It's a nice section. And with this, you can define an operator that acts here. Operators related to the shuffles and the symmetry group. All this I'm doing to describe the obvious math looks like. I want to do a very explicit description of this. Then it's going to be, oh, okay, this is how you have to define it because I don't write this. As you see, that formula. So I will send that. So I will say that so the i and minus i shuffle, quantum shuffle is the sum of the shuffle, where we split the shuffle m m i minus i mass multi section sigma minus one. C to minus 1. Let me also find a 1 to symmetrizer. That is now the sum over all permutations, the maximum section here. And this is a map here the action that we have of the breakgroup here. This is an element of the breakgroup that action. This is an element of the breakgroup that acts here. So I always can think of this as maps here. And these shuffles and these quantum symmetrizers have actually a relation. This is... All this depends only on predate vector spaces. Like I could have started with this probably. And actually, they satisfy the following relation. For all eyes They are not independent operators, this always happens. So now, how does this look like in terms of these operators? So if I have I multiply an element B n times, I want to see how is the commodiplation. According to this definition here, it's going to have It's going to have first an element like this. Then I'm going to have comps. When I say column, you have to interfere with this. But you have to interpret this as leading in PS. Living in TIP tensor T r. Okay? Because this has to live in T V tensor T V, right? So where do you put the tensor? You put it like in the I term. The first I, put the tensor, the other I's. So the commodification depends of this hof algebra, predicate hof algebra, can be described entirely in terms of the gradient. These very natural mass. So that's one of the reasons why the realization doesn't matter, because in the end, it's going to be a very nice quotient, an ego sale of this, and it doesn't matter which realization you pick, you're going to end up with the same predicate of algebra. Because as algebra, they're going to be just a tensor algebra, and the co-multiplication just depends on these points. Which question I want to take. I want to take a portion because TB is very big. So it's very nice, but it's complicated, but it's big. And essentially, one way to take a portion and be sure that what you get is still a cofalge, because you can take many portions and be an algebra, but you break the cofalge structure. Is that the generators of the EL you want to? The generators of the ideal you want to portion out are, for example, primitives. So I want to portion out elements x that the x is X is like this, but degree X is too much. So the generators, I don't want to portion those out. Because if not, they could happen. Not starting, they're going to be first place. So what do I want? If I push in all but this, I'm for sure going to get the whole file. So what I want is stuff. Stuff where this is zero. Okay? But if you look at this formula, here the elements that make all this zero for sure are in the kernel of this operator, the quantus on the tritium. And it turns out that that's exactly the elements that they are there. Like if some element is in the kernel of the quantum symmetry, Of the quantum symmetrizer, okay? And you push around by those elements, then these maps are going to be invertible and they necessarily have to leave in the curve here. So actually the way to portion out by this stuff, all these elements that are very hard to compute, these elements same as portion out. That's portion out or shed by the wheel generated by the kernel. Let's call this idea GB created ideal, and this is kind of. And these use hanging for size graph. So it's something that depends entirely on the brain vector space. So if you have a brain vector space, you can always play this game out in this. And it turns out this object is very rich in It's very rich in Lie theory. In fact, there is a connection with all the quantum groups, connections with classifications of Hof algebras. And they're very excited examples. It's a very big question when this is finally mentioned. So let's talk about some examples because I just let's do some examples. So this is not so abstract. This is not so abstract. And the example is going to be with the easiest brain vector space, you might think. So, just one-dimensional. And the easiest thing I can do is just put a number. This is the easy solution of the rest. Easy solution of the very equation that we might think. And for this, I'm going to assume characteristic is zero. If God, I get like some extra stuff in the kernel for this example. It's not hard to see, like direct computation, how these quantum synchronizing maps are. This is a quantum minomium. At this point, you know, and um and one to symmetric end up being jumped. This factorial means I have to move by n, by n minus 1, by so on, right? This is the quantum integral. So you think them as integers. And then this factorial is the multiplication of all integers, n and minus 1 and minus 2 up to 1. So it's like the same as the binomial form, combinatorics. And this times t denote, right? This is zero. So it's just another in both cases. And when does this is zero? Well, if Q is not a root of unity, this is never zero. So in this case, the tensor algebra itself is the Nibels algebra. But if Q is a root of unity, you get a finite dimensional portion. So finally, a portion. So Q n is one predictive group of community one. Then you get the relation S of n. S of n is the parameter. So the nickel size over in this case is a divide power by x. So, simple as it sums. Of course, in general, it's going to be way more harder to compute than this. This is just because it's one dimensional, right? Dimensional, right? But it's nice to see what it looks like. More complicated examples. Well, I can consider no V available to space where essentially there is no rack. It's just a change in the twist by an antique. In the twist by a number. This is called diagonal type. is finite dimensional only when these This is essentially seven years of essential the positive part of a quantum positive part there is um this was not McCeckenberger. It's not Heckenberg. It's not a plot. And the characterization of which matrix is q here a low is done in terms of generalized thinking diagrams. So there is a lot of lead theory here. And what you obtain is essentially quantum groups plus a small list of exceptions. So lead theory very naturally appears here in a connection with just Just some sense predictive vector space, right? Solutions of the Brady equation. And all these ones admit realization over ability. Yeah. So what is Q or H I again? Let's just say. Q Ah, here? No, in the first line. In the brain. In the brain, C X I X J Q Q I J. Ah, this is a number. Q I j. Ah, this is a number. Oh, it could be any number? To, yeah, in principle, yeah. It's going to be a solution of n-ray vectors. And so you would get like, because normally quantum groups are infinite dimensional, I mean at least it's true. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So it would be the one at the root of the. Yeah, not all of these are going to be quantum groups. I say this is finite dimensional, only if this I and Q is a root of figures. You can obtain the ones without root of unity. It's also Nicole Algebra. It's just infinite dimensional time. But all non-quantum groups can be obtained like this, plus some small list of exceptions that people think are still quantum groups. I thought you needed some special values for the QY change. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For the classic. For the classical quantum groups, that is not the supermartials or anything, the Qij is a number of Qii, and here appears the cards and matrix. That's how it needs to be. This is the result of the classification. And there is a more complicated version, if you want, like super versions of this, modular versions. Modular version, like there is like a sou there, but all of the soup comes from lithium. Most of it, except some exceptions. Yeah. How do you know which root of unity you get? Which root of unity? I think you know what Q is from the Qij. Which root of unit is this? So if you get a finite dimensional alpha, how do you affect Q? How do you. How do you figure it out for yourself? Ah, the Q, there's going to be a whole family of Q's. The only one that matters is the Qi's. Yeah, and essentially you can choose, in the diagram, in the list it says which ones are allowable. And for the quantum groups, there is just one queue. And this is one you choose, depending on which quantum group you want, which level you want, is which Q. Which level you want is which Q you put on. So, this is a parameter assumption. So, I want to say something about examples that are not like this, that are more exotic braid solutions, right? And how they look like solutions. So, show you this because there is conjecture. There is conjectures. Like, as soon as we move out from this world, like you consider more complicated brain equations, a lot of stuff is not known. And you get very surprising connections with other stuff. Not that sleeve, but still geometric. What about this? So, what is the grade vector space I'm going to consider? Is a transposition. Is a transposition of Sn. So I have a vector space, it's going to be a pre-vector space where the basis elements are going to be indexed by transposition of the symmetry group and the grading. I want to consider for two transpositions. It's going to be a number. It's going to be a number. I want to just know this then. Solution square tau j is equal to minus one if So, this is a solution of the bread equation, and it admits a realization very clearly over the symmetric group where. Where degree of x sigma is just sigma. And the action is given by this number and sigma sigma. So this is fine, and you will ask what is the Nickel Sager of this example, quantum symmetrize and stuff. I shall stop. And I'm going to say that Niples algebra is known only for five. It's a family of algebras, so I'm going to describe the second formula of algebras that appear not because of red vector spaces, but they were introduced to the study homology of flag methods. By this, and for say is non conjecture. Conjecture sorry, Majid, I think, was the one that did this. Dimension dv is infinite if m is greater or equal to 6. Another conjecture is that in general, this is the formula kilobyteman already find. This is also not known. So, when you say not known, you mean it's not identified. It's not even known, right? Because it can be. I mean, you can define it, of course, but you don't know which algebra is. You don't have a presentation of the algebra, right? That's what I mean with known, right? So, is it known that it's finite-dimensional? No. For n greater or equal 6, it's not known if it's finite-dimensional. People conjecture is infinite-dimensional. Dimensional and they don't know even if it's the forming trilobadius that I'm gonna say. Yeah, there is always a surjection from here to the nipposage. The nicosager is kind of like the smallest type in some sense. So yeah, this is a nice problem related to a brain vector space that we just don't know. And it has And it has not so this has consequence for the classification of points that have algebras, or symmetric groups, or the homology ring of that manifold, is going to have consequence, it's going to have consequence, I think some stuff or like the geometry of discrete spaces, that's these things also. So, like, it's kind of like an exterior algebra there, like non-commutative geometry. I don't know too much about that, but I know they appear there too. So, let me write what is the formula of algebra. What are the relations in this for the degree? Surprisingly, all the relations are just in degree two. Degree 2. So compute the relation. Degree 2 is computing the kernel of the quantum symmetrizer for n equals 2. So it's something directly related to the value. Okay, so relations of degree 2 is just the kernel of this, that is the kernel of this. It can be computed by hand if you want. If you know this, you just have to compute the matrix. And the relations are x sigma squared is 0. This is not very surprising because there is a minus 1 here that appears. xij So one equal AN X well there essentially Well, they're essentially the omnipotent of these. So just compared everything. And file augmentation. Is this form kill of algebras create some more data? Excuse me. Yeah, probably said my confession is: are there any restrictions on the fields, the ground fields? For Nicholas algebras. For Nichols algebra, there is no real restrictions. The classification results are for characteristic zero, characteristic P, a lot of not all. For formula of algebras, I think this, as long as characteristic is not true, you're good to go for at least up to any positive. For at least up to n equal to 5. In 6, it's not known. So even in characteristics, 0. And for this example, you can assume any characteristics that is non-2 because you have a minus one. That's why. Um I wanted to write the dimensions so dimension of fkt is just 12. Okay, no, I wrote the I wrote the top degree. Okay. Top degree. So these are graded algebras. So there is a degree up from which they are zero, right? I know the top degree. Job four. Let's get four, twelve, fourteen, five inches inches are twelve. 97694460. So these are the dimensions. As you can see, it grows quite fast. The dimensions of this stuff. And for six and so on, it's a lot more. And the connection is that. It's a theorem that was proven by Farming and K. Lob. Commodity ring of a flag manifold lives inside this thing. So they think this algebra is a kind of a quantization of the commodity ring of a flat map. That's how they construct this algebra in some sense to provide a In some sense, to provide a basis, a combinatorial basis for this commodity rate. So they wanted to understand this. And then doing combinatorics, they found this, and this object comes from vector specific nonsense. So these are very, very nice connections from this. So let me talk, I think, that's I think that's the units we have, the connection with the classification of point of half adjustments, how they appear in a predator. So it shows of regular vector spaces with classification. Classification points this is a program that was initiated by Andrews Kavich and Snyder. Kirich and Snyder, and it has proven to be very successful. We have quite many families specified, so I understand which one is the idea. You have a finite dimensional You have a finite dimensional coffee you want to understand. And one way turns out this is a filtered algebra. It has a filtration that is called the quoradical filtration. Sorry, this is a little bit filtration. Something that comes from coalgebras where it's zero is the sum of simple subcoalgebras and the the minus one CH 0H plus 12. And it turns out if G in H in a half algebra you want to study, G in H is what we would call group type. So the multiplication is just G tensor G. G times to G. This is a simple subcoalgebra. So all these elements that are called group-like elements live inside here. They h0. So the trivial part is filtration. A half algebra is pointer. So a half algebra. It's pointing if H0 is exactly this. And their method applies when, of course, H0 is not all H. If not, you are in the case of groups, of course. So if you are in this situation, Situation, right? Yeah, yeah, the group items. Ah, yeah, no, here, but here, the group item, the linearization of this. So if you are in this situation, what you can do is the following. And take the associated graded object object with these and of course h minus one is just zero, right? Zero, right? So if you have this, this is a Hof algebra, a grain of Hoff algebra with the following property. K of H suggests, as is in your sum, just is zero for this few. Okay? But also at zero, the leaps. Leaves here. And if you compose this and then the projection, you get the identity. Okay, so inclusion, then projection. And if you were like in the group setting and not of the hof algebra setting, you would say, oh, it's a semi-direct product. Okay? In half-algebras, something similar happened. It's kind of a semi-direct product too. It's kind of a similar approach too. So it means this is a rather magic. Where R is ah I'm not going to say exactly what it is, but it's kind of a seminar product between the group and this, where this is a Hof algebra. So, this is a Hof algebra in June for GG. And it satisfies almost all the properties that characterize Nichols algebras, except one that is a question or conjecture. If If R is generated as an algebra, as algebra by the degree one elements, this is something that the Nichols algebra of the constructor has. Then this is the Nichols algebra. The question is Is thus this always happen turns out that in many families, in particular the family that when this problem was pointed out was that you fix the group G to classify. If the group G is a billion, this problem has been successful. Been successful essentially classifying the nichols algebras from red vector space that were of diagonal type that are finite dimension. So it was successful and in this case this happens. Like all the stuff you get here is only nickel satisfies. And conjecture does this happens in general. If you can prove this, even for non-abelian groups, you get like point half atoms. If you, for example, Of adjectives. If you, for example, prove that for a specific group, there is, for example, I don't know, S6, there is no Nichols algebra of finite dimension, for no matter how you make the brain vector space with these rules, then the only point co-found algebra that are are just groups. And you automatically get a classification result from this. So, from brain equations, you got to classification of co-falge. Classification of coffee. And what I should mention, complete the results, they almost on time. And then of course you have to study all the possible edges that comes from. But the corresponding gradient object is this, but this can be done by a cycle information. Right? If you understand and are possibly always nipples with artistic zero, the conjecture is for the artistic zero and possible deformations functions to go together. To go range to classify points of atoms and when G is a billion done by By a converter that classified the nicos algebra as finidimensional, understand which they essentially need the other steps, right, to get the corresponding, what are the corresponding pointed hof algebras. And what you get is essentially quantum groups. And what you get is essentially quantum groups or stuff similar to quantum groups. Because of these things that Nichols algebras are in some sense quantum groups. So quantum groups are not determined by just things related to the brain equations. This is, I think, one of the surprising morals of this story. And I think this is a good place to start. Okay, a lot about exactly the information. How difficult is it in those cases to do? Not very difficult. It's computational intensive, so you use the computer in a lot of cases. But as I understand, conceptually is not difficult. You use stuff related to Kof Galois objects and stuff like this. Objects and stuff like this. I am not an expert in how you do that, but as I understand it, that's not a difficult part. The difficult part is related to the nickel cycle stuff. Is it true that any pointed H is a cosy called the formation of its spread at H? I think in general it's not known, but it's not known for a lot of families, particularly for Giabilia. A lot of families, particularly for G abelian and a lot of non-abelian Gs. I think all the simple final groups is known, but like in general, general, like for every group, I think it's not known. Because that would mean that they have the same kind of presentation, right? Yeah. So would it be easier to try to classify a pointed tensor kitty? Including, you know, those that come say from classical values. Probably, probably, yeah. Yeah, one of the things I love to think about is how this story goes for, in general, radio tensor categories. Because all this story is like the center of Rev T. So there should be a similar story in other radio tensor categories. Yeah, exactly. And play this game, and as far as I know, not many people. Not many people are playing this game in this general setting. I think it will be very interesting to see what happens. Alright, shall we thank Hector again? And then we start again at 10. I think it's just a way to argue from both the markets.  Yeah, this is great. And it's a lesson at all. You can't like do this and then all you have to say. So and so the only communication solution that we did is purple. It's the only one that's hard to consume. I don't know if you can see it. Yeah, but I should have to use it. Yeah, I can imagine. Yeah, you just take some subset and on the right. For me, I know it's the alpha, but it's kind of weird. Yeah, maybe as that stupid slight generalization. Yeah, yeah, I guess. I mean, usually when I think about it. I guess I mean you didn't think about set the solutions, right? You have this sequence, you're cheating in some sense you're using that stuff that's like in beach. So I mean actually it's kind of similar. It's kind of similar to the loops far. So yeah, right. So quantum SL premises relevant to A and Blush to A and B I to be at the same. Right, right, yeah.
