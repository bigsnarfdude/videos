using models and I should input that these are math models that I'm talking about. So just to sort of remind you of a picture that I showed on Monday, there are a lot of interacting systems that in various ways can interact with the ovulatory cycle. And so having this sort of multi-scale approach and also the interaction of these different systems is sort of an area that's right for modeling because it's a lot easier to do. Modeling because it's a lot easier to do that than to try to tackle all of that in a single or even a few clinical studies. Primarily today, I'm, at least for the first part of the talk, going to talk about this sort of insulin resistance arm and where I left off on Tuesday was bringing up this idea of polycystic ovary syndrome and the idea of trying to use math modeling to get at mechanisms of dysfunction. Mechanisms of dysfunction and eventually just to sort of understand more about the system. So, the things about PCLS that we care about, at least for our purposes of modeling, are the fact that there are sort of three major potential symptoms and you only need two of the three to be diagnosed with PCLS. But the primary ones that I want to focus on are the idea of androgen excess. So, testosterone I'm sort of using as my sort of a Sort of a major androgen to focus on, and then the idea of ovulatory dysfunction. So, one of the issues, aside from the fact that PCOS is relatively common, like it affects at least, I'm convinced, 10%, if not more, of women of reproductive age. The cause of PCLS is also fairly unclear, except that in many cases, though not all, androgen excess is present. Excess is present. The other thing that is interesting about PCOS, particularly given my background in diabetes modeling, is the fact that in a clinical setting, insulin-sensitizing drugs are actually used in certain cases to treat PCLS and to sort of restart the cycle. And so, this sort of interaction between insulin resistance and what that means for the ovulatory cycle is an interesting problem. So, just to sort of orient you. So, just to sort of orient you to the things that we care about. So, we can measure steroid hormones that are produced in the ovaries, and I'll focus on testosterone because we can sort of clearly see that there's a difference. Androstenedione is the other androgen that's listed on here. But the idea is that there's two groups of women pictured here in terms of their data. The open squares are normal individuals, the closed circles are PCOS individuals, and there's a clear. PCLS individuals, and there's a clear distinction between testosterone levels in normal individuals versus PCLS. So that's sort of thing one. Thing two is how does testosterone become elevated in the first place? And even though that's not necessarily known, it's sort of well accepted, at least these days, that insulin plays a large role in that. And the way that that happens is through if you have a person who is more prone to insulin, Have a person who is more prone to insulin resistance, then theoretically, what you will find is also that they have higher levels of insulin in the blood, and insulin would in turn affect the ovarian production of testosterone. So, over here are sort of measurements of what people care about in terms of insulin resistance. So, there's insulin sensitivity and also the insulin rate of production. And you can see that in the PCOS groups, insulin sensitivity is lower. Insulin sensitivity is lower and also having higher levels of insulin, which is indicative of this insulin resistance setting. So, these are the things that we kind of want to keep in mind when we try to tackle this with a model. Erica? Yep. I'm sorry. What was the horizontal axis on all of this? On the left. Oh, here. Yeah, so this is basically in response to a, so HCG is basically an LH service. LH surrogate that you can use. So they kind of just did a dose response study to sort of say, like, how much, what's the output, but it's not over time. Yep. And so thinking about that, I want to briefly talk about the testosterone-dependent model that I worked on with Jim Selgrid, and then also some of the work that I've been doing with Dave and Noemi to try to take that model and sort of broaden the scope, but also refine it. In the scope, but also refine it in certain ways, and that's a sort of overarching reduction in the model that has a lot of unknown parameters. So, also as a recap, and Nanigo sort of showed pictures that were similar to this, there's sort of very clear distinction between the behavior of hormones over time. And those are things that sort of set the stage for a regular, so to speak, So, to speak, populatory cycle. The thing that I'm including in here is testosterone as something that we know exists. We don't necessarily know exactly what it does in the ovulatory cycle, but this is something that we can model based on hypotheses in the literature. And there's not really sort of a clear trend to how testosterone behaves. I'll point out that all of these are average data. The testosterone is smooth data, and there are all And there are all sorts of issues with what actually happens to testosterone during a course of the cycle. That this is what we have so far. So, when we think about this model with testosterone, I mentioned sort of like this idea of constructing a model that takes into account the interaction between the brain and the ovaries and the hormones that they both produce and how they sort of signal each other. So, where testosterone shows up in this model is in a Is in a potential increase in the LH synthesis that happens between the hypothalamic and pituitary axis. The other potential role for testosterone is to reduce the progesterone-mediated inhibition of the production of those hormones as well. And then there's also a theorized contribution of testosterone to actually sort of initiating these, well, not initiating. Of initiating the, well, not initiating, but increasing the sort of recruitment of very immature follicles into the pool of follicles that would actually sort of start growing through the course of a cycle. And the other thing that we've included, which wasn't included in some of the cell breed group's earlier models, was this sort of like intracellular model of steroid production using the two-cell two-gonadotropin theory. So, again, testosterone is. So again, testosterone is produced in one cell type in the ovaries. Estradiol and P4, for all intents and purposes, are produced by another cell type. And the connection between the two is that we don't get estradiol without testosterone because it's a precursor. So in this particular model, again, we come out with 12 ordinary differential equations that describe the variables in each of these areas, and then also 43 unknown parameters. I mentioned the other. Unknown parameters. I mentioned the other day that that's a ridiculous amount. However, when we do that and we try to sort of fit the model to existing data in the literature, we get pretty good qualitative fits, right? So I'm only showing two cycles here, but if I ran this for infinity, it would stay on the same cycle. So there's a limit cycle happening here, and we kind of are able to capture the behavior. So when we think about how does insulin play a role here, and where are Play a role here, and where are the targets in this model? So, there are a couple of ways that we can incorporate that. So, one, as I mentioned before, is that insulin very clearly and now it's sort of established will increase ovarian testosterone production. The mechanism for that is more or less known, but just sort of detailed in terms of insulin signaling. And then the other piece of this is that insulin may actually increase what's referred to as premature luteinization. Referred to as premature luteinization of follicles. So the mouthful basically just says that there are certain points in the growth of follicles that respond to FSH and LH differentially. And when follicles are mature enough to respond to LH, they do so because they acquire LH receptors. So insulin may actually force certain follicles to prematurely luteinize, that is, prematurely acquire LH receptors. And so disrupting that signaling process. And so, disrupting that signaling process is something that may also create this sort of irregularity within the model and the irregularity in terms of the cycle length. Okay, so I'm not showing the full model here, but basically these are the results of the model. In the sense that if we sort of separate what happens under a normal luteinizing case and a premature luteinizing case, we can sort of try to study. Sort of try to study phenotypes that exist as far as PCOS is concerned. So, the one phenotype that I ignore is the actual polycystic ovaries because I don't have histological information and I'm not modeling that. So, we're really focused on having a combination of hyperandrogenism and an ovulation or ovulatory dysfunction. So, that basically creates, for all intents and purposes, three different phenotypes where Different phenotypes where one and two are sort of blended together. But basically, we have sort of the normal case. There's the case where you only have hyperandrogenism but not ovulatory dysfunction. And then there's the case where you have an ovulation but not hyperandrogenism and the case where you have both. And so the idea is that in that case where you have both, you're probably more likely to have a more severe phenotype of PCLS. And so here, if we separated in terms And so here, if we separate it in terms of normal luteinization versus premature luteinization, we find that as we increase the degree of insulin influence, which is represented by this parameter alpha, there is a regime where under normal glutinization, you sort of enter this area of hyperanthrogenism without any sort of ovulatory dysfunction. And then, as alpha increases, of course, testosterone is going to increase. And now you have both hyperangis. Hyperantrogenism and an ovulation. We're sort of measuring that based on low LH levels because we need an LH peak to stimulate ovulation and then also low P4 levels because progesterone is often used as a confirmation that ovulation has occurred. So that's how we're like sort of defining these thresholds. And then in the premature luteinizing case, it doesn't take that much of alpha to initiate some. Alpha to initiate some level of dysfunction because there's already sort of this embedded dysfunction in, say, the individual. So you go from normal right to an ovulation, you tack on hyperandrogenism as alpha increases, and then you enter what we sort of think about as a very severe range of values, and that just means that P4 levels are even lower and LH levels are even lower. So basically, collectively, what this says. Basically, collectively, what this says is that, and this is sort of consistent with studies, that if you lack hyperandrogenism but you are an ovulatory, the only way that that can happen is if under premature elutinization. And that's what we see here, right? So you can only have an ovulation in this second case, whereas the first case, you can sort of, you're doing pretty well. Maybe insulin resistance is higher, but like you're not necessarily predisposed to premature luteinization. Premature lutonization, and so those things would be associated with phenotype severity. Okay, so that's part one. So, part two is we have 43 unknown parameters, and that's ridiculous. We don't really know what's going on with testosterone. Again, we have some ideas, and the model can give us some insight into the effect of higher levels of testosterone. But it would be useful to. But it would be useful to be able to sort of improve parameter identifiability, maybe not fix the issue. We want potentially something that's more generalizable, so we're not just focusing on PCOS, so that we can explore other mechanisms of ovulatory dysfunction and potentially tackle this issue of why individuals have variability within their cycles as well. So, what we do in this work with Dave and Noemi is we Dave and Noemi, we reduce the model, and we did reduce the model not in a mathematical way, but sort of like a biological, like what mechanisms are relevant versus not necessarily. And we're able to reduce the model from 43 unknown parameters to 27, so about a third reduction, that's nice. So basically, the main differences between the previous model and this current model is that testosterone is basically taken out in terms Basically, it's taken out in terms of the fact that we're not modeling it, but instead we're basically allowing for it to have an effect as sort of a constant parameter. So there are all these parameters that are in the model, but we can sort of lump those and have a surrogate for what testosterone would look like. And that's a reasonable simplification. And then the other piece of this is like there's all these sort of mechanistic feedback mechanisms that are built into the model that we might not necessarily need again. That we might not necessarily need again because of issues of identifiability. So, we basically just sort of truncate a lot of those terms. And so, this is sort of like pictorially where the adjustments come in the model. Okay, so we have this model and we need to figure out what to do with it. So, first, we might want to try to estimate those 27 parameters. So, what we do is for the first two pieces, we want to know that this reduced model can actually reproduce. Model can actually reproduce the behavior of the original model, because otherwise, what am I doing? So, these first two steps of model evaluation really boil down to making sure that the behavior of this reduced model is more or less qualitatively the same as the original model. And then from there, we can sort of run simulations that allow us to identify different parameter profiles and behaviors by By essentially initializing the parameters with some sort of perturbation and then refitting the model to data. And so once we do that, we can get out parameter distributions, we can look at different things, we can look at the trajectories that come out of those parameter regimes that we get and try to see if there's something to be learned from that. So here's what we learned. So these are just two isolated, kind of like extreme Kind of like extreme ends of the results that we get. So we refit this model for multiple Monte Color Low simulations. And in the one case that I'm showing here, we have a sort of very regular behavior, right? So the cycle is more or less 31 days, which is basically forced because of the data that we're using. And there's a very clear sort of LH surge happening. So that is what we would categorize as sort of the regular phenotype. A regular phenotype. And we're using the sort of textbook reproducing endocrinology definition of what we mean by regular, which is all cycle lengths or all interovulatory lengths are between 25 and 35 days. Then on the other hand, what comes out of the model is that in some cases, we have parameter combinations that lead to this very irregular behavior, where there's no sort of consistent difference between inter between ovulatory events. So in this sort of Ovulatory events. So, in this sort of extreme case, there's about, I think it's like 60 or 70 days in between this ovulation event and this one here. Notice the peaks are different, but this is probably sufficient enough for ovulation to occur. And then there's a very short, like 15 or 20 day range in between the next ovulatory event. So again, this is like the extreme case. So we have these sort of phenotypes that we can set up and at least distinguish between regular and irregular behavior. Regular and irregular behavior. And then what we find is that if we take a little bit closer and look at some of the regular phenotypes, there's actually sort of a distinction between how well they fit the data, even if all of the ovulatory events lie within 25, or ovulatory cycles lie within 25 to 35 days. And so the green here is basically like the very sort of tightly regulated, like ovulation is regular, and as far as the differential equation. And as far as the differential equations are concerned, there's also regular dynamics, right? So there's not this sort of like period doubling that happens. And in the regular minus case, we're saying you fit within the 25 to 35 day restriction. However, there are likely differences and more variability within the interovulatory intervals. So that's theme one. And so if we look at what the interovulatory interval distributions look like, we kind of see exactly. Look like. We kind of see exactly what we expect. There's way more variability in that in terms of the regular phenotype, and then the very, very regular. So the regular plus is just hovering around 31As. And then there's a little bit more variability with the regular minus group. How are these defined? I'm sorry. How is regular defined? Regular is if you simulate the differential, or you have the numerical solution for the differential equation. Numerical solution for the differential equation. Every ovulatory event has an inter-ovulatory interval of between 25 and 35 days. Okay, so you're just this definitional. That distribution is definitional. It's not like. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, got it. Okay, so the next thing we're saying is: okay, well, is there a difference in terms of what parameters come out of the Monte Carlo simulations that we can distinguish between regular and irregular? That we can distinguish between regular and irregular groups? And the answer is yes. So out of the 27, there's actually eight that are statistically significantly different in terms of their cumulative distributions. And we can actually look at what those parameters are to actually try to identify what mechanisms really sort of govern the regular versus irregular behavior. Answer the question about that. When you say there's CDFs, is this like across? Is this like across so I have this whole pool of simulations that I ran and refitted, right? So there's like four or five hundred. So all of those have 27 parameters associated with them that were quote unquote best fit. And so I separated them by regular and irregular according to their criterion. And now I'm looking at the regular group and the irregular group and looking at what those parameters look like. What those parameters look like. So, this thing is also related to the sampling strategy of the parameters. So, there's like a prior in there somewhere. So, this is just coming straight out of the, yeah, all of the simulations and the parameter distributions that result from this little perturbation and then refitting. So, then if we're like, okay, so is there a trend between the parameters and whether it's irregular or regular? No. Regular. No. This is just a hot mess. So, how can we distinguish between individuals? So, let's try clustering instead. So, we have eight dimensions. Can we reduce this to two dimensions and actually be able to identify regular versus irregular? No, no, we can't. Which is a good thing because that means that there's something else at work, right? And this is sort of like consistent with from a clinical setting, right? We ask questions. Setting, right? We ask questions about when was your last cycle and whatever, but like it's nearly impossible to distinguish between what's regular and irregular, particularly if you're asking that just in one visit. But we do see that there is some sort of like clustering in the sense that we might be able to find five clusters here, even if all of the phenotypes are sort of mixed in together. And then the question is: well, what do those represent? Is, well, what do those represent? And it turns out that if we look at the eight special parameters, there's only one that distinguishes between those five groups. And this is V sub F, which represents in the model the maximal rate of FSH synthesis. So what do we get out of that? Well, for these models, if FSH, or this VF increases, right, so now it's increasing from right to left, we are more likely to see a variation in. A variation in irregular behavior. And it's less likely when VF is low that you'll see irregular behavior, but you'll probably see regular behavior. And so this is sort of like, well, there's predictability in the cycles, but if VF is high, you're going to see a lot more unpredictability in what comes out of the model. So these are all sort of summarizing that, but basically, the idea here is that this is actually. The idea here is that this is actually consistent with clinical associations where they said elevated FSH is an issue and that can lead to cycle irregularities, infertility, reproductive aging, that kind of thing, which is independent of what we think about in terms of mechanisms of PCLS, right? So this is a sort of more generalized version of ovulatory dysfunction. So there's plenty of things to do. Dave wants to add insulin, sure. I'm not convinced yet. I need to be convinced that it has to be modeled as opposed to an input, but there are lots of things to do with just the data that comes out of these. So I will stop there. So, can you go back to the clustering, the ring of clusters? So, yeah. So, you said no, you can't distinguish, but I think. So you said no, you can't distinguish, but I think what you ended up saying is that like each of these has a higher proportion of irregular. Like five has the least and one has the most. Yeah, but we can't do it just by like having a profile of parameters. That was the main question was like, can I take these eight parameters and everybody in group one has the same and then everybody in group two is different but they all have the same? It's like no. Would you say that even could you think of that as a curve? That is a curve, could you think of this as a parametrized curve? And as you move on the curve, you get more likely to be, is it regular or irregular? Is that right? In theory, except for the fact that as far as Atiznia is concerned, we don't know what it's separating the dimensions by, but in theory, that could be. Well, but it means that there's a low-dimensional space. Right, yeah. So, yeah, something you should be able to potentially move around, but I would have to look at the different trajectories to The different trajectories to see. So, interestingly, Jake sees similar things in the ventilators when he applies TISNE. And there was just a, I haven't read it yet, but there was a really nice, what people say is a really nice applied math justification and explanation for TISNI in Scien Review. Worth reading, and I need to read it. But at any rate, it's very cool because TISNI turns out to be a very powerful thing, and it works pretty well for us. And as Matt says, Well, for us. And as Matt says, there's probably, we see this more often than not, that there's some kind of a surface there. But it was invented by Hinton to deal with artificial neural network parameters, and it's a little bit of a mystery. But I think this paper is supposed to unmystery it a little bit, but I just can't comment down. I mean, this is cool. I mean, I just said it, but like, there's a 2D manifold that says what you want. It just, you don't know how to write it yet, but it is there. Yeah, it's there somewhere. It's whatever that curve is on the... Yeah, it's a little bit amazing at work. Oh, yeah, she will. Yes. She doesn't know this yet. Yeah, make that a business. Yeah, that's not a problem. What do we mean? When Eric was like, well, we got slightly different, I changed some stuff and we got slightly different results. I'm like, uh-oh. Yeah. And he was like, that's what we want. Awesome. All right. George, she's up. Oh, and Will, you need to press the very funny bits at the end of all of these talks.
