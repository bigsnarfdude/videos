I'll be monitoring the chat window, so if you have questions that you'd like to have raised during the talk, you can post them there and they may or may not interrupt as it seems relevant. So thanks again, Laura. Thank you, Tom. And thanks to all of you for coming. And thanks for the invitation for me to speak. Okay, so elliptic surfaces and our divisors. Surfaces and R divisors. This is just a picture, but let me tell you the setting. All right, so the setting for this talk is elliptic surfaces. So I'll just remind you what that is. So here I have a projective surface. I call it E. Maybe I should say from the get-go that I'm assuming everything is defined over Q bar, so over a number. Over q bar, so over a number field, even. And this surface admits a projection to a curve. I'll assume that the base here is a smooth projective curve. We'll call it B, B for base, and the fibers are elliptic curves. Because I'm assuming that there exists a section of this surface. So the elliptic surface is really the package of the surface E together with the projection B to the base. Projection B to the base with this section that I'll call O, which picks out a distinguished point in each of the smooth fibers here, well, in every fiber, but in particular then, all of the smooth fibers are elliptic curves. And the classic result that I want to remind you of is, well, in this case, oh, sorry, maybe I should say a little bit more about my assumptions. So I'm also going to assume not only is So, I'm also going to assume not only is that everything is defined over a number field, but that this elliptic surface is not isotrivial. And isotrivial would mean that the J invariants, these tori, are constant, that all the complex tori that are in the fibers are all isomorphic to one another. So, I'm going to assume that that's not the case. So, there is some variation here of the complex structure. So, I'm assuming that it's not isotropic. So, I'm assuming that it's not isotrivial. And there's this classic result, which really goes back to Mordell and Vey in the 20s in the context of number fields, but also holds in the setting of function fields. And so the statement here is that if we work with the function field of the base curve, so little k here represents the function field q bar of e, the base curve, then the set of rational points of e Points of E now viewed as an elliptic curve defined over the function field is a finitely generated group. So we do have a question for clarification. So Kurt's asking whether you're assuming that E itself is smooth, even though some of the... Oh, I see it now. I see the question. No, I'm not assuming that E itself is smooth. It does not actually matter for what I'm going to be saying. So we can take, of course, we can always choose a smooth model, but it's not necessarily. Model, but it's not necessary for what I'll be talking about. In fact, most of the discussion is really about what happens for the smooth fibers, but in any case, yeah, no, I'm not. So let's see. So the set of rational points, so maybe I'll just make a comment. So if we view the elliptic surface as an elliptic curve over the function field, what are the rational points? The rational points are just the sections. points are just the sections of this projection. So in particular the O is the zero of E as an elliptic curve over the function field. And in general the rational points are simply the sections of this elliptic surface. And the fact that they form a finitely generated group will play a role in what I'm saying. So I wanted to mention this important fundamental result first. Okay so the goal the goal of this The goal of this talk is the following. I want to describe some unlikely intersection problems or results in the context of this picture. So in the context of curves inside an elliptic surface of this sort. So let me just write this down. Goal to describe some un Some unlikely. I'm using a new app for this talk that I haven't used before for presentations, and the handwriting is a little bit sloppy here. Unlikely intersection problems associated to this setting of looking at curves inside E viewed as an elliptic surface, or say rational points or points that are living in some over some finite extension. So curves. Some finite extension. So, curves in E. But what I really want to do is to describe a tool that Mirzo Mabracki and I use to analyze these unlikely intersection problems. And specifically, it's a tool that's been used often in this context. So, broadly speaking, I want to use the tool of, oh, it doesn't fit. I can't write smaller with this. Equidistribution. Can we see that? Equidistribution. That equidistribution. So, equidistribution has been used a lot in this context, but the novelty here, and what I want to emphasize, is that it's specifically equidistribution for height functions for height functions that are associated to R divisors, thus the R divisors in my title, from or associated to what are called metrizations on our divisors. Metrizations on R divisors. And I'll say more about this as I go on. Typically, the heights that we think of, the height functions that we think of, are associated to divisors in a traditional sense where there's an associated line bundle. You can equip the line bundle with a metric, and there's a lot of structure there. In this case, of an R divisor, there isn't a line bundle per se to speak of, but one can still talk about a metrization and therefore a height. So what I want to do is explain applications of this tool. Applications of this tool in the context here of unlikely intersections for elliptic surfaces. Okay. All right, so the key players in this story are indeed height functions. And so the most important height function that I want you to be aware of is the narrown taped canonical height function. So defined on either an elliptic curve. Defined on either an elliptic curve or an abelian variety. In this case, there are two different height functions that I'd like you to be aware of. There's the geometric height, viewing E as an elliptic curve over a function field. So this is a height function here, say, on the set of sections or rational points of this elliptic curve. But also, we have the arithmetic height, the height on the fibers. So, of course, all of the smooth fibers here. So, of course, all of the smooth fibers here are elliptic curves. And if I choose my parameter t in the base to be algebraic, then I have some elliptic curve defined over some number field. And so, of course, I have a height function defined on those fibers, on the algebraic points of those fibers. I won't give a definition. Perhaps I should mention an important basic property about these height functions. Oh, oh my gosh, this app. All right, there we go. All right, there we go. Uh, is that for example, and one important property? Oh, goodness, I cannot write this thing. Uh, that the height evaluated at a point, whether it's the geometric height or this arithmetic height, is zero if and only if x is a torsion point inside the corresponding elliptic curve. So, that's an important basic property of these heights that you'll need to know. Okay, so these two different heights, the geometric height and the arithmetic. Geometric height and the arithmetic height are, in fact, related. There are these lovely results from 1983 that I want to bring your attention to. Specifically, the first result says that the geometric height controls growth of the arithmetic height. So very specifically, if you choose one of these rational points, namely a section of our elliptic surface that I've drawn in here and called P, then you can look at the function on Then you can look at the function on the base, which is this arithmetic height in the fibers. And the theorem is saying that as the height on the base grows, so does the height, the canonical height in the fibers. And in fact, it grows at a rate given by the geometric height. So the geometric height is telling us about the growth rate. I just happened to see the question in the chat. You're absolutely right. There's no need for people. Absolutely right. There's no need for p to be non-torsion for this statement. Of course, if p is torsion, then this height in the numerator is just identically equal to zero. And so the same result holds. And here, of course, we could take a trivial divisor. So absolutely true. And also, yes, not so interesting. So yes, sorry, I wanted to emphasize what happens in the case of growth for the height when the height here is actually positive. Thank you for pointing that out. Yes, so actually, and going beyond just the growth rate of the heights, Tate gave us a little bit more information about what happens for the height function overall. In fact, one should really think of this height as a function of t, as a genuine height on the base curve. And so, what he showed is that it really is a V height associated to a particular divisor, in this case, a Q divisor. In this case, a Q divisor, the degree of the divisor happens to be exactly this canonical height, the geometric height of the point, which is always a rational number, and show that there is a divisor on the base curve so that this height, this function of t is in fact within bounded distance of this bay height. So I don't see that. I just noticed there were some more questions. Oh, I see. Merito answered. Thank you. I probably shouldn't look at the questions because I guess it's distracting. I should focus on them. All right. So these are the basic players, the two different notions of height. The geometric height corresponding to thinking of E as an elliptic curve over the function field and the arithmetic height in the fibers. In the fibers. All right, so this next slide illustrates an example of equidistribution as a tool at work here in the context of proving an unlikely intersection result. So this theorem is a statement that Myrto and I proved a few years ago. So let me describe what it is. So here, to make sense of all this, I really do. To make sense of all this, I really do want to assume that I'm starting with a section which is non-torsion. So assume that P is not a torsion section. So the first observation is therefore because the elliptic surface is non-isotrivial, the function field height of P is non-zero. And so we genuinely have growth of the height. And the statement is that here's the definition. So here I have now, I'm thinking of this function of t in the base, which is just arithmetic height in the fibers. Arithmetic height in the fibers of the specific point, my green point here, P. The statement is that this function is more than just a V height up to bounded correction. In fact, one can analyze this height function completely and get that it happens to be the height associated to a metric on the line bundle associated to that Q divisor and that has all sorts of good properties. And I've mentioned some of these good properties in the specific. And I've mentioned some of these good properties, and the specific properties are perhaps not so relevant for this talk today, but I'll just mention that it happens to be the height associated to what's called an idyllic, continuous, semi-positive metric on this line bundle, or really at all places of the associated number field. But let me emphasize a couple of things. So, first of all, again, I'm here, I'm now working over the number field. So, I've fixed a point which is rational over the function field. I've chosen the function. Field. I've chosen a number field so that P, the elliptic curve, so everything is actually defined over that number field, and I've called that K. So here I'm working with over a number field, K. And so the point is that now I have a height on the algebraic points. This height is defined here on B of Q bar. And it's a good height in this sense. And so this was really building on Tate's observation. Building on Tate's observation that it's bounded away from a given V height, but also building on some work of Silverman that gives us a more detailed description of how this height function varies as t varies. So this technical statement is useful because it puts us exactly, exactly into the context of being able to apply existing equidistribution theorems. Now I haven't Distribution theorems. Now, I haven't stated the equidistribution theorems themselves, but what I want to draw your attention to is that when you have exactly these conditions satisfied, including this condition on the self-intersection number that I'll come back to, one can deduce statements of this sort. So now let me just read this to you so you can see what kind of application I have in mind. The statement here says that if you take two sections, so first of all, now I have a section P and some. Section P and some other section, say Q. So if I take two sections now of my elliptic curve and you look at the points in the base where the height is small, the intersection is itself very small, and in particular finite exactly when the two points are independent from one another. Independent in the group structure on E. So they're exactly. So there exists a positive epsilon, so that the set of points where the height of p is small and the set of points where the height of q is small, that common set is only finite. Now, I should mention that the case where you take height zero, that would correspond to looking at the points where you pass through a torsion point in the fiber. And it's known that there are lots and lots of values. If you just look There are lots and lots of values. If you just look at where, say, hp is zero, so in other words, this section is passing through the torsion points and the fibers. That's an infinite set down here in the base. In fact, a dense set down here in the base. So each of these is geometrically quite big, though their heights are small because these are comparable to a standard base height. And the case for zero was known, and this was proved by Masser and Zaniev. And in fact, in a series of works, And in fact, in a series of works, they treated this intersection problem in various settings. First, starting with just the Legendre curve, with sections that have constant x coordinate, and then extending beyond that in a collection of articles. And so, in fact, it's exactly equity distribution that allowed us to pass from the case of looking at points of height zero to get this extra room to say that actually small points from a height point of view behave the same way. Of you behave the same as points of height zero. All right, so I want to just draw your attention here just for a moment. There is this extra technical condition here that I've thrown in as part of this theorem, because what we were doing were some computations that allowed us to put this problem into the setting for certain equidistribution theorems. This intersection number is what we call the Arakeloff. Is what we call the Arakeloff-Zhang intersection number. It's really introduced by Shou Wu Zhang, associated to for intersecting metrized line bundles of this sort. And I'll give a definition on the next slide. Being zero turned out to be exactly the condition needed so that you actually get equidistribution because this height, its minimal value is zero, but it also has lots of points where it takes the value zero. And so that matching. And so, that matching of this minimal value together with the self-intersection number being zero was crucial to make this implication go. And so, one of the things that Mirto and I have been looking at over the last few years was, can we say more? And what type of stronger statement do we need in order to strengthen this unlikely intersection result? And I'll try to make that clear what I mean as I go. What I mean as I go. All right. So, this slide includes, in particular, a definition of this intersection number, though I haven't told you what all the notation is, so I'll come back to that. But here's the main theorem that I want to present today. So, this is again joint work with Mavraki. And the setting here is as before. Oh, I didn't write the word. Oh, I didn't write the word non-isotrivial, but the setting here is that again we have an elliptic surface E. I assume that it's non-isotrivial. B is the base curve. Everything is defined over a number field. In particular, since the set of rational points is finitely generated, I can assume that everything is defined over the same number field, so that all of these sections are defined over some given number field, k. Let's say k is this number field over which everything is defined. Field over which everything is defined. And the statement is that these intersection numbers, as you let p and q vary over all of the rational points, are controlled by a geometric quantity, namely the neuron-tate regulator. So in other words, this quantity here is comparable. It's bounded from above and below by this neuron-tate regulator. All right, so what are these quantities? So, first of all, So, what are these quantities? So, first of all, the main thing I want to emphasize, as I just said, is that this thing is related to the geometric height. This isn't written in terms of this, the Narrown-Tate height function. This is the Narrown-Tate bilinear form, so that H is just, so this is exactly the form for which H of a point P is just exactly what, P paragraph P. So this is the Nalantate bilinear form. And what is this quantity? And what is this quantity? Well, one important observation is that this quantity is zero if and only if p and q are dependent on one another. So this is really an inner product on a certain vector space, one can think of it, and this is the associated quadratic form. And so this thing vanishes exactly when P and Q are pointing in the same direction. And so because of that, in fact, our previous theorem in this language, our previous theorem was saying that. Language. Our previous theorem was saying that was this implication, or this if and only if statement, that this intersection number here, at least for pairs of points in E of K, is zero, if and only if the two points are dependent in the sense that some, either one of the other is torsion, or one multiple of p is equal to a multiple of q, so dependent in the usual sense. And then, because of what we know about the height function being non-degenerate, that's equivalent to this. Non-degenerate, that's equivalent to this. So, in other words, our previous theorem was saying that this quantity is zero if and only if this quantity is. So, it's just saying the zeros line up. And now what we've realized is that, in fact, they grow in the same way. That they grow in the same way. And that's really the content of this result. Another way to interpret this result is that, well, each of these being bi-quadratic forms, they're quadratic in P and quadratic. Quadratic in P and quadratic in Q, same as this, each of them is, in fact, non-degenerate on the associated real vector space. So I'll come back to this perspective, but it's helpful to realize that this relation here, because of what we know about the neuron tate height, implies that this quantity, whatever it is, as this bi-quadratic form, is non-degenerate, by which I mean that it's zero. Is non-degenerate, by which I mean that it's zero if and only if, so i.e., that this intersection number over r now for real points is zero if and only if p and q are dependent over r. Sorry, this is impossible to write on. Okay. Because this, of course, is a finitely generated group, and then of course the torsion gets killed when we tensor with R, and this is some finite-dimensional vector. Much about that. Maybe I should. Oh, you can't see it. And I don't know how to erase. Maybe I can. Oh yeah, I don't know how to erase. All right, well, I don't know if you can see what I wrote, but it just says why should we care? So I will say a few words in a moment about why this non-degeneracy is relevant, because as I said, I want to use. Because, as I said, I want to use R divisors and equidistribution as a tool for studying unlikely intersection problems, and I'll come to that. But let me pause just for a moment. I should probably say a little bit about what this intersection number is, because it's playing an important role here. And so, again, this is an arithmetic quantity. This is not a geometric quantity. So, what do we have here? So, this is a sum of integrals, a sum of integrals. Each integral here is over Role here is over a Berkovich analytification of the base curve. So we fix our number field k, and for each place of k, we have this associated Berkovich analytification of this curve. And what are these lambda q's? These lambda q's are the local pipe function. So this lambda q here represents, so lambda qv should be thought of as, so evaluated. These are defined on the on the These are defined on the curve. So evaluated at a point t is what? It's the neuron local height function for the corresponding elliptic curve, the fiber, at that place. Oh no, gosh. Clicking the wrong thing. Oh, good, came back. Evaluated at the point QT. So these are the local height functions as functions on a base. The omegas The omegas are the curvature distributions associated to these metrics line bundles. But really, they're nothing more than taking Laplacian, in an appropriate sense, of lambda. So away from the singularities of lambda, of course, lambda will blow up where q is zero or if you hit a singular fiber. So away from the singularities, this omega is just a Laplacian on the Burger space of the associated function lambda. So these integrals are really So, these integrals are really, in the analytic sense, an energy pairing between the local height of one of them and the other. And then I've written it in an asymmetric fashion. You'll see it doesn't look quite symmetric the way I've written it, but in fact, it is symmetric just by doing an integration by parts. In any case, that's a definition. It doesn't necessarily help us understand how big this number should be. And so this theorem was an attempt to Theorem was an attempt to explain how big these numbers actually are and how we can control them geometrically. Is there a question? Can I ask a question? Yeah, I'm slightly confused about the scaling of the two quantities. It seems like if I scale P by a factor, then the Archielovjang pairing scales linearly, but the regulator square scales. Yeah, no, actually, yeah, it scales. Yeah, so the scaling. So in fact, this is also quadratic. So it's not obvious from the way I've written it, but From the way I've written it, but this line bundle has the property that if you take, yes, n times p, that this will be this line bundle will be lp to the n squared. So it's really, it's really scaling quadratically, in fact. So the line bundles, right, so it's not a linear assignment from point to the line bundle equipped with this metric is itself a quadratic identification. So I didn't write So, I didn't write down all the definition, but it has to do with the fact that the metrics are also given in terms of these lambdas. And these lambdas also have that same quadratic scaling property. Yeah, I'm glad you asked. Yeah, so I really want to emphasize, and in fact, these objects were set up this way so that they truly scale the same way and they vanish in the same place. And so, we had some hope that we might be able to control them in terms of one another. So, these are it is indeed quadratic on each of the variables separately. Are there other Are there other questions before I go on? Yeah, Laura, I just put one in the chat. So you talked about the energy pairings here, but what about the HP of DQ in that same box formula? What is that doing? Yeah, sorry. So this is, of course, the height evaluated at the support of this divisor, weighted by the coefficients. So really what this integral is, is, so another way to think of these integrals is that we're really looking at, you can forget it, you can even forget about that constant term. That constant term. The point is that when you, sorry, I'll say, changing how I want to say this. The point is that if you genuinely take the Laplacian of Lambda, you will get not just omega, where you're integrating at a smooth part, but you'll also get some extra measure, which is supported at the finitely many points, namely at the divisor dp, where lambda blows up. And so this measure, so when you do, when you write this out, what we're really doing is writing, it's really Doing is writing, it's really expressed as the integral of lambda integrated against the Laplacian of the other one without this term here. So then this makes it look symmetric because then we can do integration by parts, and this part corresponds to the finite measure there. So I've written it in this very unhelpful asymmetric way. Perhaps I should have just written it this way. Have just written it this way. But from a computation point of view, sometimes it's helpful to have that out there. So the height function, I also didn't say, but the height function is indeed just the sum of the local heights. Sum of the local heights. All right, so as I said, why should we care? So again, so really the main theorem, so it's telling us about the growth of these intersection numbers, which have these fairly awkward definitions as integrals, and so it's a little hard. As integrals. And so it's a little hard to tell what it really means and how to compute these numbers, because we can't, in general, compute these numbers. Maybe we can only understand them from a growth point of view. And so let me give you a sense of what these numbers as numbers actually represent. So on this next slide, here's just an answer to the question, one answer to the question of why should we care from a purely concerned. From a purely conceptual point of view, or a philosophical point of view, shall we say. Here's one thing that I wanted to say: is that so geometric height, the function field height, is known to control the growth, as we saw in, say, the theorem of Silverman that I stated at the beginning of the talk, is known to control the growth of the arithmetic height. So large height phenomena. And so this result, and also the equidistribution, the result that I stated earlier. Distribution, the result that I stated earlier of mine with Nirto shows that the geometric height is actually also controlling small height phenomena. So in the previous case, it was just looking at what happens as height tends to zero. Here, one can think of the following. So Zhang's inequality from 1995 shows that this intersection number is actually comparable to the minimum or the essential minimum of the Or the essential minimum of the sums of the heights. Essential minimum, by the way, just means that you throw out finite sets. So you don't care what the actual minimum of this height function or sum of height functions is. You can throw out finitely many points. And so like taking a lim inf along sequences. So an essential minimum of this sum is comparable, in fact, just up to a factor of two. And when you multiply by this, to this intersection number. So we could replace. Intersection number. So we could replace this intersection number with this quantity in here. And that's then telling us that the minimum value you can get to have both of the heights be small can be described in this purely geometric way. In this purely geometric way in terms of these geometric heights. So in other words, I've written it over here. If I rephrase our earlier result here, I mean, I wrote the earlier result exactly the same. The point is that this value of epsilon is approximately or comparable to. Approximately or comparable to up to factors of two, this ratio. This quantity which is arithmetic, this intersection number, but normalized by the sum of the two heights. So you could compare that, therefore, to purely geometric quantities. So that was one application of this result from, as I said, a conceptual point of view. This intersection number tells us information about small heights. About small heights. So here's the main application in this unlikely intersection context. There's a lot of text on this slide, so let me go slow. It turns out that this result comparing intersection numbers to this narrow tate regulator is equivalent. Is equivalent to this statement here. So I'll just read it out loud and then try to make sense of it. So the statement here is now, as throughout my talk, we fix our non-isotrivial elliptic surface over our base curve B, everything defined over a number field. Now take any curve which is horizontal in this fiber product. So we take the M So, we take the m-fold product of our elliptic surface over the base curve. So, the fibers are just e to the power m, each fiber. So, take any curve in this fiber product, and then look at the subgroup structure of this fiber product. Specifically, let Em2 be the union of the flat subgroup schemes of codimension at least 2. So, subgroups that are defined by imposing at least two conditions. At least two conditions on the points in the fibers. A co-dimension at least two. And then we look at the tube, the height tube around this EM2. So this T here represents all points that are a small height perturbation away from this EM2. So the set of all points that are just a small height perturbation away from EM2. From EM2. So I can think of that as a tube around EM2. And the statement is that if you take any curve, well, the actual statement is that it intersects this set. The intersection is contained in a finite union of Flat subgroup schemes of positive codimension. So, in other words, the curve either itself lies in a subgroup or it doesn't and then it's Or it doesn't, and then it's only intersecting in infinitely many, infinitely many parts. I'll come back to the significance of this statement in a moment. Let me just give you a little bit of the history of this statement. So for an isotrivial family of elliptic curves, or in other words, just a constant elliptic curve, this is known. This was proved by Viata and by Galateau. In the non-isotrival, In the non-isotrivial setting, exactly as we're working in here, the corresponding statement without the epsilon was proved by Baruero and Capuano, who I think are here. And so in other words, looking at the intersection of the curve with exactly this set of subgroups of codimension, at least, yeah, this union of subgroups with codimension at least two. And their work was building on those earlier. Was building on those earlier results of Masser and Zanier that I mentioned about taking just two sections of an elliptic surface and looking at the intersection of where they're both torsion. So in the case where m is equal to 2, when m is equal to 2, notice what this is. This is just the torsion pieces of your surface. And so it's just looking exactly at where the coordinates of the curve C are both torsion. Curve C are both torsion. And so similarly, our earlier theorem actually also allowed us to extend to epsilon, but only in the case where you go all the way down to torsion. So it would be say codimension at least m if you're taking Em. Theorems of this sort, statements of this sort, have quite a history. I just mentioned some of the names that have inspired this result. Have inspired this result and related results and conjectures and theorems. And there's a long story, and I don't have time to go into detail here. I just wanted to mention some of the names so you see that there really is a context for this type of result. The particular statement that we're proving, I should mention importantly, is in fact a case of a conjecture that was posed by Shou Wu Zhang in his 1998 ICM LectureNet. And so one can reformulate this theorem. Formulate this theorem. In fact, this is equivalent to this, but there's yet there are other formulations that one can make equivalently that match a little bit more the language that he used. And so we include that in our article, but I did not include it here in the talk. But actually, I do want to mention an equivalent formulation, which is a little bit, from my point of view, is a little bit more down to earth than what I've written here in terms of flat subgroup schemes. So here's another formulation. Another formulation of the same statement, which I find a little bit easier to parse. So let me just read this one so you can see how this is formulated. So again, you fix a non-isotrivial elliptic surface to find over a number field. Suppose now we take at least two points, P1 through Pm, in E of K. So sections of our elliptic surface, where K here was a function field. Here was the function field. But of course, everything here, viewed as sections, is defined over a number field. The statement is that these m points are linearly dependent in E, if and only if you can find infinitely many points in the base and small height perturbations of the specializations of these points, so that the specializations satisfy at least two independent linear relations. Independent linear relations in the fiber. This is exactly the same statement that I was making on the previous slide. As I said, I find this a little easier to understand. It was a statement that you're given M points, and if they almost satisfy two relations, if they almost satisfy two relations infinitely often, then they must persistently satisfy one relation at least. I'll say that one more time. If you have a clutch on a point, More time. If you have a collection of points that almost, meaning under small height perturbations, satisfy two relations at infinitely many points, then it must be that they had originally satisfied already at least one relation. It's always easy for any point or any collection of points to get lots of points where they satisfy one relation. So, for example, if you're given one section, there are always infinitely many points in the base where it becomes In the base, where it becomes torsion. That would be satisfying one relation. There are infinitely many where it becomes torsion. If you take two points, there are infinitely many where they satisfy relations to each other. But if they satisfy two relations, then you're in trouble. They must have been related in the first place. And so satisfying those relations on the nose was exactly the content of this theorem of Aru Ero and Capuano. They also formulated it. In fact, I learned the flat subgroup scheme formulation from their article. From the general time, the waves. Okay. Right, so what's really going on here in this study? Why even are these statements equivalent? I would say it's probably not obvious from the way that I've written all of this that this statement about intersection numbers is related to this thing about satisfying two relations. Satisfying two relations. And so, what's really going on is the following, as I alluded to at the very beginning of this talk. We're approaching the problem from an equidistribution point of view, studying these height functions and how they behave at their small points. And so, ingredient number one is what I'm calling here theorem number one, which is the statement that extending beyond what Myrto and I had proved before. And I had proved before. And this is fairly formal. The first statement is that if you take points in this finite-dimensional vector space, beyond just looking at the sections themselves, but let's take real linear combinations of them, then we can still talk about divisors. It's just that now we have these funny R divisors. So we build up these divisors with real coefficients on the base. K here, remember, was the number. K here, remember, was the number field over which everything is defined. And this artivisor can be equipped with a notion of metrization. And so maybe I'll just say, it's important, well, I wrote here. This notion of metrization of an artivisor was introduced and is well studied by Maury Walki, and he has a series of papers investigating various properties of these metrizations on art divisors. Use metrizations on artivisors. But really, all a metrization is, is the following: it's a function at each place. So, here I'm just working on a curve. I'm just working on a curve. So, what is a metrization? So, let me just write one of these a metric. It's not really a metric because it's not a metric on anything, but one should think of it as a function, sorry, a collection of functions, let's say g, one at each place of the number field. So these are functions on b, or really, I should say, b minus. Or, really, I should say B minus the support of whatever this divisor is to R. So they're real valued away from the support of a divisor. And they're continuous and they're subharmonic. So they're continuous and they're subharmonic. So their Laplacians are non-negative. Now they're going to have singularities at the support of this divisor. And the point is that their growth, the growth, is of the following form. So GB evaluates, say, Be evaluated, say, x is approximately equal to the logarithm of the norm if you choose some local coordinates. Oops, sorry, I need some coefficients. Let's say a times the log of x. So near a point of the support, near a point of the support, let's say the support, let's say D has is a at x plus, not x, well, x equals zero. Let's say x naught, plus dot, dot, dot. So let's say one of the points in the support is some x naught. Points in the support is some x naught, and I choose coordinates near x naught, and let's say a is this real coefficient, then the point is these subharmonic functions have to grow exactly like the logarithm times this number a, or maybe negative element. But in any case, the point is that the objects are the same as what we already know in the context of idyllically metrized line bundles or even local height functions. They behave like local height functions, it's just that they have growth with real coefficients. They have growth with real coefficients. And so the point is that each of these real linear combinations of points naturally gives rise to one of these R divisors equipped with certain local height functions that come from the local heights from the original points. You don't just take a real linear combination of the local heights for the original one. You have to do some sort of quadratic manipulation of them, but it's certainly doable. And conveniently, they satisfy this. Conveniently, they satisfy this self-intersection normalization. The self-intersection normal is zero. And so, that, just as in the case of Q-divisors, puts us into the setting that we would need to prove an equidistribution theorem. And so, what Myrto and I do is extend the traditional equidistribution theorem. We only prove it for curves because this is the setting that we need, though I imagine it's true in higher-dimensional varieties as well. But here's one way to formulate an equidistribution theorem, which is the An equidistribution theorem, which is the following. So, if what I've written here is if you're given any two idyllic continuous metrizations on R divisors in this way, if you assume that at least one of them is semi-positive, which means that you have this subharmonic behavior at all places, if you assume that at least one of them is semi-positive, and you assume that that one is also normalized, that it's Normalized that its self-intersection number is zero, then if you take a small sequence for d1, for the associated height, which is just the sum of the G V's, by the way, so the height is just the sum over all places of these G V's, most of which are trivial. They would agree with a standard wave height, or real combination of a standard wave height. So if it's small for one of them, then you know what the other one converges to. What the other one converges to. The equidistribution theorem is that then the second height converges to this value, this value, which is precisely this intersection number. By the way, so I've just written down here: the proof of this equidistribution theorem is not novel in the sense that it follows exactly the outline of the proof of the, it's exactly the same statement. It's exactly the same statement. It's the same statement and essentially the same proof as what you would see for Q divisors. But there's one ingredient that we needed in order to carry this out, which is a result of Moriwaki on, excuse me, the continuity of the arithmetic volume function for these R divisors. So the arithmetic volume extends in a natural way from Q divisors to R divisors, and Moriwaki proved that it's actually continuous. And so we use that just to make sure that. That just to make sure that to carry through that proof. I'm sure there are other proofs. In fact, we've discussed other possibilities of how to prove that. By the way, I should also mention this isn't equidistribution in a geometric way. At least I haven't formulated it like that, but it actually is. So the usual way we think of equidistribution is the following statement. If you have a sequence of points which is small for this good height, for this semi-positive one, if you have a sequence which is small, If we have a sequence which is small, then the conclusion is that the Galois orbits, remember everything's defined over a number field. So you look at the Galois orbits, k bar over k of this point Tn in B. So these are just these collections of finite sets, which are growing as n goes to infinity. The usual formulation is that those Gaoa orbits are uniformly distributed with respect to a natural measure. A natural measure, specifically the curvature distribution of the height at each individual place. So, in other words, you fix each place of the number field, you work on the Berkovich projective, the curve associated to be the Berkovich identification at that place, and the statement is that these Galois orbits converge, they're equidistributed with respect to the curvature form at that place. And it's true at each place. And it's true at each place. So what we do is we show that the equidistribution extends, and that gives us the language. It gives us the tool and the language so that we can even talk about these intersection numbers for these real points. This next slide just shows how this equation. Just shows how this equidistribution statement and the statement about the intersection numbers is related to, for example, the theorem of Baroero and Capuano that I mentioned earlier. So, just I want to sketch very briefly why these statements are connected or how we would prove their theorem with this equidistribution theorem. So, the statement is follows. So, remember what the statement was. If you fix M points, I'm assuming I have at least two points. So, they're sections of our elliptic surface. So, there are sections of our elliptic surface. And suppose that there are, let's say, infinitely many linear relations, pairs of linear relations, that are satisfied at a sequence of points in the base. That is, the specializations, if you look at, so this generates some, this is some finitely generated group, and you look at the specialization, the rank is always no more than m in each of the specializations. And we're saying that the rank drops by at least two. drops by at least two along this sequence. The rank drops by at least two along this sequence. Then the conclusion is that they must have been dependent to start with. If the rank drops by two, they must have already been rank n minus one or less to start with. All right, and so how is this related to equidistribution? So, well, you can basically take these explicit relations that are satisfied, rescale them. Rescale them, rearrange terms if needed, but by passing to a subsequence, you can assume that the coefficients converge and converge to real vectors, say x and y in Rm. And because these were independent relations, by doing just some linear algebra, you can conclude the x and y are independent vectors in Rm. In our M. But the point is that when this relation is satisfied, the associated height is very small. And in fact, along this sequence is necessarily tending to zero. Because this relation being zero, we're rescaled, saying that this point itself is just zero, so its height is zero. And so that's very close to the height of hx. So the point is that each of these are this. Is that each of these are this sequence Tn's becomes small for two different real heights, Hx and Hy, and they're genuine heights as we know from our theorem one that I've not shown you that's on the previous slide. And so because now I have a small sequence for two different of these heights associated to R divisors, and because now we have equidistribution for R divisors, we conclude from this theorem here that the intersection number of this metron. Of this metrized R divisor, and this metrized R divisor has to be zero. And the main theorem, the main theorem, sorry, now I'm writing them as D's instead of L's. This is the same thing as what I was calling before the L X and the L Y. It's just that when they were actual points, there were genuine line bundles. And here there are no longer line bundles, so I was changing the notation. But I mean, the same thing as what I wrote in the main theorem. The upshot is that the only way this can be zero is when the The only way this can be zero is when the two vectors are dependent. So it must have been that the original points were dependent. Of course, these vectors, I said they were independent, so it must have been that the original points were actually dependent. So that shows the connection between the main theorem about intersection numbers and the statement about subgroups of codimension at least two. And now I'm out of time. So in my final And now I'm out of time. So, in my final slide, I just want to show you. I'm not going to read the whole thing, but just so you can see, there is one more ingredient needed for the proof, and in fact, to prove the main theorem. So once you have all of the equidistribution for R-divisors machinery in place and the language in place, then how do you actually show that this real quadratic form on this real vector space bi-quadratic form, I should say, on this real vector space. Bi-quadratic form, I should say, on this real vector space is non-degenerate. What we do is some complex geometry. And the upshot is, I'll just say in words, is that these curvature forms that you get turn out to uniquely determine the point up to the dependence and the optic curve. So it turns out the curvature forms, even at a single place, at the Archimedean, at some single Archimedean place working over C, the curvature forms turn out to determine. The curvature forms turn out to determine the point. The magnitude of the measure is given by the geometric height. So if two curvature forms happen to be equal, then h of x has to be h of y. So it turns out they just are the same in this real vector space. And then I've mentioned some of the results that we use in order to prove this. So I think I should stop there. Hello. Thank you. That was very nice. I think anybody ready to unmute and And invite everybody to unmute and applaud. And we have time for some time for some questions. Laura, I got a question. Do your methods allow any hope of turning this into a quantitative echo distribution result and/or like bounding the number of points and the exceptions you talked about? Okay, so as for quantitative. So, as for quantitative, no, this will not prove a quantitative equidistribution because we're just following the proof in this case of Yuan. But I should say that, so in the case when the base curve is P1, so Charles Favre and Juan Rivera Latelier, as you know, but a lot of people probably don't know, have a quantitative version of these arithmetic equidistribution theorems, which Distribution theorems, which I think is very useful and an analog of that is not yet proved, but should hold for arbitrary curves. Naming, the statement being that you can control based on the size of the Galois orbit, you can control how close the discrete measure is to the limiting measure. And that having a quantitative version of the traditional equity distribution theorem, but on curves, but arbitrary curves, should also give an alternative proof. Give an alternative proof of this equidistribution for our dividers. So we don't prove a quantitative statement, and so we don't get any explicit statements about exceptional sets and how big they can be or anything else. But I would guess that the Faub and Ruben Alletelier proof should carry over to curves, and then we'll get an alternative way to do this. I have a question also. So what are the obstructions to pass to the case of abelian varieties instead of elliptic curves? So yeah, so there are a number of obstructions, but there's also some work that's been done. So in this case, from the very beginning, in the very first theorem that I mentioned, that Mirto and I have, we use crucially what's happening to the local heights near the Happening to the local heights near the singular fibers. And so, in order to get that this is genuinely a good height in this sense, we study exactly what happens near the singular fibers and we use some work that Silverman had done to analyze the behavior near the singular fibers. The analogous statements may or may not even be true for families of a billion varieties near singular fibers. And in fact, there is reason to think that, especially if working over not just curves. If working over not just curves in the base, but say higher-dimensional base, that indeed there are some different kinds of singularities, and we might not actually get this type of behavior. So, a priori, you cannot use, say, Yuan's equidistribution theorem in that setting. However, so I probably shouldn't let the cat out of the bag of the state this moment, but I will mention that Lars Cuna has some work in this direction that gets around some of those technical difficulties. Some of those technical difficulties. And he's working on that actively now. And so, and has an alternative approach to getting various equidistribution theorems that don't rely on the delicate behavior of what happens near the singular fibers. And so, indeed, much of this discussion could hold, but all of it is technically more challenging when dealing with families of the domain brains. Thank you. So, Laura, I think on this same slide, Holly was wondering too, like, if you can get your hands on, say, the maximal such epsilon, such that that implication holds. Yes, yes. So, that, okay, so if you, right, so well, I mean, so the stating here, is this what you're referring to? So, here, the point is that we know exactly what this epsilon is, it can be described. Lines. It can be described, I mean, at least up to replacing the max of the H's or the min of the H's with the sum of the H's. But in any case, the point being that what is this approximately? Actually, this means it's bounded within a factor of two of this amount. And so then the answer is yes. So the point is that these intersection numbers, so in particular, so this quantity, for example, is uniformly bounded from below over all independent p's and q's. Independent p's and q's here. But this quantity is different because, of course, the scaling factor of the height and the denominator. And so here you get a different type of control as P and Q get big, say, in E of K. So it's a little bit delicate exactly how this number varies. But one can now compute it. I mean, one can say exactly based on this exclusively geometric information. Gotcha, yeah. It's a very natural measurement. Do we have any other questions? Okay, then. So let's uh let's thank Laura again.
