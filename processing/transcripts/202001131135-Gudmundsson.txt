In a way, I'm actually going to be talking a little bit more about just the general relationship between bat and surface, because to me that's sort of the first thing towards an inversion is the resultance, the formal problem. And it's also sort of a piece of a mathy exercise I did some time ago. So this is actually from a paper by Rob Arthur and others. By Rob Arthen and I, some time ago. This will show us the problem. We know something of the surface, and we want to figure out what's happening at the bat. And we have to solve some equations within a domain. And hopefully, when we solve the equations, they reproduce what we actually observe after that, with the unknown, is what's happening after that. Now, this is almost a bit redundant because this has been shown so many times before, but by now we can do large-scale inversion. Do large-scale inversion for whatever flow water invert for, basically. This is an example of an inversion of an employee ice sheet. And the velocities here are actually calculated velocities. And if I were to compare this with the measured velocities, you would pretty much see the same information. And there's a lot of information contained in the surface. This is a section of Pine Island, Clayton here. And by the way, these are regional features, so volcanoes. And so there's a lot of information to show in the position of the ground line, the surface velocities, each surface topography, and how it changes. And so that sort of brings the question of how does topography, based on topography, affect the surface? And there's a lot of history here in glacial as you having looked at this sort of classical problem. When I When I worked on this, that was actually while I was in Seattle, the mid-90s, and I was quite impressed by a recent PhD thesis by Thomas Johanneson, who had gone through the whole literature before. A lot of people had worked on this. And he also sorted out a lot of the issues which had been with previous papers. And I really felt like this is something that I have to understand and I have to learn. And I tried to extend a little bit upon what he did. What he did. But basically, Thomas Johannes solved the problem, the 2D problem, in its time-dependent form. And the way you do this, this is basically just an exercise in simple applied math. You have a reference state, and you hope you have a solution for that, exact solution for that. And then you perturb the reference state a little bit, and you arrive at some linearizations that you then solve. Then solve. But this becomes quite involved in the end because the system is quite big. But this can all be done. And this is an example of what we can get out of this. And I guess I'm sort of showing this here to express that there's a lot of rich structure in these solutions. It's not just a trivial sort of statement. So you can calculate things like how bad was overcome. This is maybe overloaded a little bit of information, but the idea is that there is. The idea is that the ice is from left to right, and there's a Gaussian-shaped bump up to there, which is represented through these green circles. The grey-shaded surface is the steady-state topography that you get. So it's flowing left to right, tiles up on one side, there's a trough on the other side. You can sort of expect this to happen, it's a standard wave. And we can calculate whatever we want to know with the surface velocities, the velocities throughout the depth, the The depth, the strain rays on the surface, or whatever we want to do that. And these are the expressions we have, the equations. And we notice that we have time dependency here. We have two time scales. One which is sort of a phase time scale or propagation time scale. Another one which is like a relaxation time scale or diffusion time scale. This goes all the way back to the kinematic wave theory where John F. Nye showed that if you have a bump at the surface of a glacier, you should settle. But the surface of a glacier, you sort of set it off, it does just two things: it farms down away, but also diffuse with time. And just to drive home the fact that you can get new things out of this, this was one of the things that came out of it, is that when you take up the basal sliding velocity, you just increase it, or rather you increase the ratio between basal sliding and the total ice deformation, some funny things happen. Here we have Here we have again a Bakausian bump at the back that is from left to right, and this is the response to the surface of different times along the needle line. And you have a standing wave forming here, and with time the ice piles up on the upper side of the bump, but the bump here, which formed initially, starts to travel downstream and leaves sort of a wake behind it. And you can also see that if you And you can also see that if you plot this as a function of time and space. And if you look at this from above, this is what you see. You see that there's a Gaussian bone here on that. The surface you have upstream, so surface rise, and then you have this trough which is traveling downstream. And if you wait long enough, it will look something like this. And I do this here for two different types of perturbations, per gaussian-shaped perturbation. One is a back. Percussion-shaped perturbation. One is a backdrop perturbation, and the other one is a perturbation in the basal slipperiness. And this is a very general feature, that the response to Gilman's perturbation, basal slipperiness, tends to be much more broad and diffused. That's what you see here and there. Whereas the response to a backdrop perturbation is more concentrated. And this is actually a real feature. I think this is a real feature. This is something you see out there. Oops, for some reason I. Oops, for some reason I skipped over one slide. These referred to as flow stripes, they're all over the place. They're not all formed in this manner, but some are. Some of them are clearly formed by a flow of a bump, a concentrated bump of the bed of a fast-flowing ice stream. And you can ask yourself, why do we see this on ice streams if we don't see it elsewhere? This is very noticeable if you look at subtle images from If you look at subtle images from Tartif, you have all these flow stripes, wherever the ice is flowing quickly. And the reason for that, I think, is this. This is the explanation for it. There is a particular peak in the transfer from bed to surface at certain wavelengths, provided the ice is flowing fast enough. If it's flowing slowly, you don't see this peak. This is an example of better surface. Is an example of bed-to-surface topography transfer. This is the ratio between the amplitude of the surface to the amplitude of the bed. This is done here for illustrative proper purposes for a sinusoidal wave of the bed. Down here you have a wavelength, so you have a sort of sinusoidal bed shape with a particular wavelength, and this is just scaled with mean eye thickness. So 10 is the wave, 10 times the mean eye thickness. This is the ratio between This is the ratio between what you see at the surface, the amplitude, and what you apply at the bed. And because this is linear, it just scales linearly with the amplitude. So you just look at the ratio, that's just fine. And the thing is that when you go to very, very long wavelengths, the ratio goes to one, which you would expect. When you go to very short wavelengths, it goes to zero, which is again something you would expect. And then, interestingly enough, an intermediate wavelength here, provided Here, provided you have a high enough sliding velocity, you get this peak here. And this is what's causing these flow slides. You wouldn't get it any other way. Or at least, this is one way of producing it. There's another important message here, which is this is actually the full system, or I call it full system, called full stocks maybe. This is the full stocks solution. But you can do this hail whole exercise or any approximation you like. Exercise for any approximation you like. You can do it for the SIA and you can do it for the SSA. And the interesting thing is, the Shallow Ice approximation never produces this peak here. And you could say that's maybe to be expected because the Shallow Ice approximation is not designed for high rates of basal sliding. But nevertheless, it's interesting that you do miss it. And the shallow ice stream approximation, I call it the SSA, does capture half of this peak. Capture half of this peak. But then, in a very unphysical way, it approaches the limit of one when the wavelength goes to zero. And this is physically nonsensical. But this is not just a feature of these analytical solutions. This is a feature of the SSA equations. You will see this whenever you do a franchise run using the SSA equations. You will always see this. You always get this very strong response. Strong response are short wavelengths in the SSA equations to basal perturbations. And that is inherent in the equations. We always get it. And it's totally unphysical, and in some ways, it's as bad as that can be, because this ratio will always be between 0 and 1, and the right answer is 0, and the SSA comes up with the answer 1. So it's very important to realize this when we do an inversion using the SSA, but it fails in a really bad way, or a short way. Bad way for short wavelengths. And in some way, both of these equations will fail at short wavelengths, at least there are long wavelength theories. But sometimes you hope that you get lucky and they fail in a sort of at least physically plausible way. Or they're limited physically plausible. But for the SSA, it's definitely not plausible. How about so? If you're in brain regularizations, it's forcing your slippery SSA to be pretty smooth. Do you think that you're Food. Do you think that issue is not going to be there anyway? So you could do this through regularization. A way of doing this is to do it through the not through the regularization, which is like a prior constraint. I think the better way is to do it through the mission function or the likelihood. So you put in an extra term that explains that they're in exact physics in your model. Model. But that's it. It can be done that way. You guys are still on this slide. Isn't that expected that SSA is not even valid on those length scales? Yeah, yeah, it's expected that both of these theories will not work at these length scales. So then it's not a failure, it's just in approximately a limit where you cannot use that approximation. So it's rather a fault of whoever uses it in that limit. Yeah, I guess that sort of is my point, but people are using the SSA to solve role, and you will always get this whenever you use the SSA equation. It's then up to the individual person to decide whether it's the right thing to do or not. No, I mean it's not for a person to decide whether it's valid or not. It is not the right for short scales. Yeah, we all know that. This is a very informed audience. We all know that. Maybe people didn't realize it was. Maybe people didn't realize that it goes to one down here, basically this particular way. I should also mention that if you use a hybrid model, for example if you use the platter approximation, the situation isn't actually much better. So I've done the exercise with the button approximation as well. It catches this peak here and then continues right on. Okay? No. The other issue is the time schedule. So when we Is involved. So when you touch with flow, francium flow, you get these two time scales, the propagation time scale, the diffusion time scale, the relaxation time scale. And they look very, very different in these different approximations. So in the solar ice sheet approximation, and this is already seen in the solution by Nye, it decays to lambda square if it's the situation linear. So it drops down here very, very quickly. And if you do Do simulation of some ICs using SIA approximation, all the undulations that we have at the beginning of the burn, which might be due to some errors or whatever, they will just disappear very, very quickly, automatically. You don't have to do anything in order to get rid of them. And in some ways, that's a nice thing, because you know that these are wavelengths that you theory fail to work. And in a way, you sort of want them to be there, or you don't want them to do anything bad, like blow the heavy thing up. Blow the heavy thing up. And the SSA approximation, in my opinion, is much, much better when you come to higher sliding ratios, as it should be, because it's designed to cover that situation. And one of the things it does so well is catches this lower limit in the realization time scale. So the realization time scale does not go to zero if you use the full scale, sort of the full system solution, the full stock solution. It does so in an SNA approximation. It does so in an SSA approximation. It shouldn't. It actually goes up once you get to wavelengths comparable to the ice thickness. Now the SSA does not capture that increase, the decrease in wavelengths, but at least it captures this lower limit here, which is a significant improvement and makes the transient evolution much more realistic in the SSL case. So the phase speed is another thing that is another thing that given the Kiliman wave theory is what is n plus one times the surface velocity. So here n is equal to one, so it's twice the surface velocity. And in the SIA approximation is non-dispersive. So the base velocity is independent of wavelength. But in the full Stokes equation and also in the SSA it's dispersive. It's a functional wavelength and approaches the correct limit which just has to be one for short wavelengths. For short wavelengths. So, again, this is a significant improvement in description of glacial physics that you get using the SSA approximation. I just want to mention here one thing that I haven't actually seen anywhere, but I think it's potentially quite important. The redistribution of mass is actually not governed by the phase velocity, it's governed by the group velocity. And the group velocity, because it's a dispersive system, is a function of wavelength. System is a function of wavelength. And it actually goes below one for a significant range of wavelengths. That means that the distribution of mass through wave propagation is happening slower than the surface velocity itself. The SIA approximation and the old Finnemann wave theory predicts that this n plus 1 times the surface velocity. You can see that for the full Stokes. That for the full Stokes system and SSA, it's far from it. It goes to one, this is good, but actually, it even goes below one for the slower error. Now, what does this actually have to do with large-scaleized dynamics? And again, I want to get back to Thomas Johanneson, who did this in his master thesis, before he did his PhD. And he argued this is a simple way of estimating. This is a simple way of estimating sort of the response time of places. Well, we can see this, but he introduced the concept of volume time scale, which actually will have in different sort of different systems. And you just think about the change in the volume of the glacier, the ice, whatever you're looking at, due to some perturbation, external perturbation. And then you say, okay, now I have my new volume that I try to calculate using some statistic arguments. And now I think about, well, how long will it take? What's the lower? Take what's the lower, the least time it can take to fill up this volume. And that would be the perturbation in mass balance applied over the previous area. So that's the change in flux that you have to, that you get for the perturbation, and that has to fill up the volume that is created by the perturbation. And this gives you the volume time scale, and this will always be a lower estimate of the response time of glaciers. Now, is this lower estimate a realistic sort of Estimate a realistic sort of usual estimate? Or is it like far too low? And his argument is that you have to look at how ice is being redistributed. And it's done through two processes, the phase speed, or the wave propagation that we showed before, and the diffusion process. And the diffusion process is actually much, much, much faster. So in the old kinematic wave theory, there was too much emphasis on the wave propagation aspect of that theory. Of that theory. It's actually what is happening is diffusion. It happens exceedingly quickly. It's so quick that it is almost irrelevant when it's back to the volume time scale. And the conclusion therefore is that it is the volume time scale, which is a reasonably good, this may be twice too small or something like that, but it's a reasonably good approximation of the response time scale. So that's a statement here. And this is in some way And this is in some way an argument for glacier mechanics not being too important. Because if it's governed by the volume time scale, which is something you can get sort of back by the annual law calculation by looking at changes of volume, and you calculate the changes of volume by just looking at steady-state arguments, then a lot of these sort of finesse about how things work on short time. Things work on short time scales just don't really matter. If these time scales were longer than they are, it would matter. So this is his argument. I always like this argument. I sort of need a glass of water. You send me off to do that. Fast. Fast for us. I actually think this is five before lunch. He may not come back. It's supposed to be five before lunch. Before lunch. Yes, yes. So then I because we wanted to get there at 12, didn't we? No, we don't. It's not that rigid. But we need to be there soon after 12 because... Okay, okay, then. Then I will expand for it. I have work ahead of me. You see? So very practical person. Elmar, can I can I ask you a question while you're waiting for one? A question while you're waiting for one. Can I ask everybody else to scribble their questions down as much as possible? I'll make mine quicker. So under what assumptions do the invection diffusion time scales remain much smaller than the volume response time scale, right? Because so this is this is of course based also on linearized reference state. But actually these volume, I actually think this. But actually these volume I I actually think it's it's quite general. So first of all th these time scale they don't depend on the nature of the penetration. So when you do the calculation, you do the inverse Laplace transform, you get a pole. You see the pole doesn't depend on the right hand side of the equation. So they're always the same, irrespective of what kind of perturbation you have. Now the ratio between these two, which one is faster, depends on the surface slope of the glaciers. But basically all practical surface slope slope But for basically all practical surface slopes, Tp is much, much longer than T D. So I think it's a fairly general thing. Anyhow, so what I actually did, expanding what Thomas did, I sort of did the whole 3D situation. And there are some new things you see, but most of it sort of New things you see, but most of it is sort of to be expected. Then we are looking at transfer functions here. This is SSA, and this is the full stocks. The way I plotted this now is I'm looking here at the wavelength of the sinusoidal perturbation as a function of the orientation with respect to mean flow. So this is an angle here. So zero means the angle is zero. So I'm looking sort of down the glacier, along the flow. Along the flow. And this line here is the profile I showed you before where the transfer amplitude is zero at zero wavelengths, has a maximum somewhere, goes down again, and then up again. This is again for conditions typical of ice streams. And if you then sort of go change the orientation with respect to the The orientation with respect to mean flow and you go to 90 degrees, it drops down as zero. So, again, this is, I think, really important for understanding the transfer between bath and surface. If you have certain topographies which are aligned with the flow, they will have zero effect on the surface. So you can always add, if you only know about surface topography, not it's okay. About surface topography. It's okay if you know about surface velocities, but if you only know about surface topography, you can always add to your solution or the back top topography any longitudinal ridges that are along the flow, because the transfer amplitude is zero for those ridges. Okay? This also makes sense. If it's along the flow, why would it go up and down? There's nothing to go over. But this will allow you to quantify these things. And thankfully, the SSH. And thankfully the SSA now produces the right limit. Since it was so stupid in this limit here, you never know what it would do. Are you okay? I'm looking at the doctor. Well, there's a hierarchy here. You're very important. But there's a person who's even more important. So just go along with the lunch. And we've got a collection of questions. Collection of questions. But you did not know me this continued. Okay, do two or three more slides. Two or three more slides. This is your recording here and finish when the thing begins. Finish within five minutes. Within five minutes? So I think what we saw before was sort of to be expected. You could almost predict that it would look somewhat like this. But this here is, I would say, a little less obvious. This is now, again, a transfer function. This is now again a transfer function, but in this case it's the transfer between back to procuring and forward surface velocity, the velocity downstream, the glacier. And this now starts to have sort of a rich sort of structure to it. And it means that if you have, if you're looking here at 45 degrees or whatever, with respect to the ice flow, there will be no transfer. So it's invisible to what the velocity is. It has no impact. The velocity is. It has no impact on the bed. So you will have this when you do an inversion. You might have some aspects of your system state that simply do not affect the surface velocity at all. That will then be in the null space. And you can always add that solution to your inverse solution and you will get the same thing. And this will be, you expect the velocities, this will be in the null space. This will not be an issue if you have both velocities and surface topography, because the surface topography In the surface topography, we don't have too much response, but it's not zero. Okay? So now the full stokes obviously has a much richer sort of structure than the SSA. And here I can have my flow over a button. And the lower half are plotted the analytical solutions for the full stocks. The upper half goes for the SSA. And I'm only looking at the perturbations. The ice is actually flowing from left to right. The bump Too light. The bump of the bed is over here in the middle. And because this is slowing down the flow, the perturbations in the flow are against the flow. So the total flow is the background flow plus the perturbation. So because this is against the flow, it's a little bit slower here. And then it will increase and decrease again. So I just want to go quickly, since I have only a few minutes. This is something that you guys were mentioning earlier, so it's sort of obvious. We are doing We are doing a format problem. We have bad. We want to go to the surface. We have a system to do that. We need to come up with an estimate of the bad, so we need to find out retrieval function. And this is sort of something that has been mentioned before, but we need a framework for this. So, in most books about geophysical inverse theory, you will see this notation: D being the data, G the model, and Data, G the model, and M the model parameters. I'm just using this notation. And the framework to deal with this is to think about statistics. So we have our prior here, and we have our likelihood over there, and we then update our estimate of the prior. And we have to write down the likelihood function. We have to select some statistical model to. We have to select some statistical model to do that. We have to write down our estimate of the prior, and then we maximize this function, rather than minimize the negative of the log of this function. So this is our standard geophysical inverse theory. And you end up, you throw away, a few terms you throw away, you end up with two terms with geophysical inverse theory somebody's just referred to as missive term and the regular. Referred to as the NIST term and the regulator term, but that actually is the likelihood and is the prior. Now, there's a practical issue here, and I'll be interested because some of you guys are true experts in this field, is how to construct the precision matrix or the inverse of the covariance matrix so that I get a sparse matrix. Because if this is a full matrix, even if the covariance matrix is Even if the covariance matrix is sparse, the precision matrix will usually be full. And this basically kills off the whole framework. So I guess when I go quickly through this, I mentioned that the transfer function that I showed can be used to approximate the sensitivity matrix. Probably need this as a discussion experience. Which is one way of doing it. Halfway up to this point. I would like to thank the. To make the equation somewhat ecumenical, so I'll leave that as a question. What's AC mixing? So my question is, is AC mixing up? I don't think anyone has spoken about it. We would need probably a discussion on what AC mixing means. We started to eat until lunch here. So we need to wrap this up. What I would do instead of having an extended Having an extended question session at this point, which is a really good goal, and I guess it's a real lesson for the chairs here. I'm at the separate writing down the questions that I received on the blackboard as a matter of things that people can discuss. But Ian knows the running of this place much better than I'd be ever concerned if I run an extended QA session here. This session basically continues after lunch, so if you want. Okay, let's do that then. So I'll write these questions down. Um give them to me and I'll write them down as well. So we have a cool component. I was trying to keep them on my laptop at the time, but it's like it's going to come back into are we still able to change up? So so look there's a tour at one o'clock. If you want to go on the tour you need to have lunch get back to the lounge in the corporate hall at one o'clock. In the court hall at one o'clock, and then there's a photo at two o'clock. But the photo we meet in the foyer here, we're going to find it outside because I think we'll get a bit like wind from up outside. Straight after the photo, we'll then carry on and take practical to the next little fucking thing. Is it your sense of making stuff here? I think it's not the only person I'm talking about. I think it's not on.
