Thanks for inviting me to this workshop. It's really a great pleasure to be back in France and I really look forward to having more collaborations with people at the workshop. So the workshop is carton sub-algebras and operator algebras and topological food groups. And I am firmly in the topological food groups camp. This is where I've been asking a bunch of study questions. Where I've been asking a bunch of study questions about C-star algebras because what I know about is groups and maybe a little bit about inverse semi-groups, but not enough to call myself an expert. So with that said, let's start. So my talk is one of the short talks, so I don't have time to go into the motivation, but trust me, it exists. Motivation exists. Exists. So there are various reasons why we want examples of simple groups that are topological groups. So you can put a topology on them. And this topology has to be totally disconnected and locally compact, which will from now on be abbreviated to TDLC, because that's too many words. I want the topology also to be not discrete, because of course a discrete topology is TDLC, that's not much use. TDLC, that's not much use. And I want the group to be generated by a compact subset. So I've written two examples that may or may not be helpful. If they're not helpful, ignore them. I'm going to give some examples that's probably more helpful in a minute. So PSLN and n by n invertible matrices of determinant one modulo scalar multiples over the p-adic numbers. Over the p-adic numbers for n at least 2 and PL prime. Okay, these things act on buildings, and if n is 2, then the building is a tree. So let's focus on trees. That's a much more concrete thing. The group of orientation-preserving automorphisms of an infinite tree, that's not a line, otherwise we just get Z. That thing is an example of one of these. Of one of these two DOC groups that we're looking for. As I said, if these things are not helpful, then don't worry. So, more examples of these, well, we've known for several years now that full groups of actions on Cantor spaces give examples of simple groups that are infinite and finitely generated. I've already said the bad word. They're finitely generated and therefore they're countable, they're discrete, they're not what I want. What I want. Okay, so how do we fix this? Well, there are examples, there are examples of more examples that I could add to my list, and here's one of them. And this is going to be the example, the prototype example, which Colin and I, oh, I should have said at the beginning, that this is all joint work with Colin Reed, who's moving to Sydney to start a position shortly in Western Sydney. Western Sydney University. Okay, so the motivating example is the group of almost automorphisms of a deregular tree, where d is at least 3, otherwise we end up with a line. Again, not interesting. And I'm going to denote by x the cantor space, which is, of course, the boundary of this tree. Okay, so what's an almost automorphism of a tree? Well, it's all the homeomorphisms of the boundary that are. Of the boundary that satisfy the following thing. We can partition the boundary into finitely many clopen parts. So, what's a clopen part? Well, it's, I've helpfully drawn a picture here. You can take some finite subtree, remove that, and the boundary of what's left, that's a finite clopen partition of the boundary. Okay, so there's a finite clopen partition of the boundary. In this case, there are four parts. In this case, there are four parts, and we want there to exist in this case four automorphisms of the tree, such that on each of the parts, we're just doing a restriction of that automorphism of the tree. So, here's an example. Now I've got rid of some things. So, here, for example, on parts one and three, maybe we'll do some rotation about this vertex V. This vertex v. Okay, and that will take. So, this one, this subtree one, or its boundary one gets taken to, oh, let's see, that's a distance one, two, so I have to go distance one, two. That ends up there. And then something might have happened inside here, inside this one, because it's just some rotation, and there are own counterweemen. Okay, and the same thing with three, three ended up over here, and there it is. Okay, so that's one possibility, but maybe on four. One possibility, but maybe on four, on this one, I'll do a reflection about this edge E. So that means that four will end up here. And now, okay, and for the last one, maybe on two, we'll do a translation along this ray R so that two which was here will end up one along over there. Is that more or less clear what it is? Okay, good. And I can't see it because I'm too close, but I've I can't see it because I'm too close, but I think I've chosen this correctly so that you can see that the element G is not an automorphism of the tree. There are some edges. Let's see. So one and two were at distance two, three apart at the beginning, another at distance two. That's not an automorphism as a tree. Okay, so this group was defined by Neritin in the 1980s, and it was proved 10 years later that it's a simple group. Okay, so now we've got simple. Okay, so now we've got simple, and now we need a bunch of other adjectives. Right. Ah, I forgot to say. The way I've given this definition, it's not the definition that Naritin gave. I've given the definition, which is equivalent. I've given the definition that makes it obvious that this group of almost automorphisms of the tree is the full group of automorphisms of the tree. And by full group, I mean exactly what's written here. I mean exactly what's written here. It's the homeomorphisms of the Cantor space or the boundary that are formed by, well, I've called it a piecewise full group because of course I want to look at topological groups and here the topology means you've put a topology on the group, not the topological full group in the way that it's usually set. Right, so really I'm going to take as the definition of a full group Definition of a full group, this thing. There's a partition of the Cantor space, and on each of the parts, we do an element of whatever seed group we started with. All right, so far, so good. So far, so good. Right, so this group is simple, but I want it to be TDLC. So what topology do I put on it? Well, okay, there's an obvious topology to put on it, which is the topology coming from homeo X, the compact open topology. So that's all the homeomorphisms that take. So that's all the homeomorphisms that take some compact to some open, but because we're working in the Cantor space, I can assume that the compact is also open and that the open is also compact. And this is my notation for compact open subsets of the Cantor space. All right, well, there's a problem with this. If you choose this, which is the naive topology to put on this subgroup, it won't be closed. For reasons that I won't explain, but it's not too difficult to see. So, this is bad because what's the point of dealing with topological groups if you can't take limits? What's the point of putting a topology on something if you can't take limits? So, that's bad. Let's see. Well, instead of inheriting a topology from an overgroup, let's induce a topology from a subgroup. Topology from a subgroup. Now, this is something that's well known. I mean, we can read it in Bokaki and the topology tone and how to define a topology for a group. Well, the important thing, this is how this Bobaki proposition translates to our context, the important thing is that the group of almost automorphisms of the tree preserves the opens of some. Of some subgroup, of some group which we already know is compact. And will always be compact, in fact, in the compact open topology, and that's the stabilizer of a vertex. The stabilizer of a vertex, stabilizer, as in automorphisms, that stabilizer vertex. That's a compact group, and it's prophylate, totally disconnected. Okay, what do I mean by preserving the opens? I mean exactly this. It means that for every open subgroup of this Subgroup of this compact group that we're taking, and for every almost automorphism, the intersection of U and its conjugate by the almost automorphism is an open subgroup. Okay, so yes, so we stay in the set of open subgroups. Okay, so let's see. Why does this happen? Well, the opens of this compact group are the fixators. The fixators of finite subtrees that contain this vertex. There's a picture here coming. So we can take the fixator of, let's say, the vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4, or in fact the whole subtree that is spanned by these four vertices and contains me, right? So I mean by this, I mean this subtree here, this one, the final form. Okay, so that's a basic open. And the nice thing about this. About the stabilizer of this vertex V is that if we stabilize this and all of these four vertices, then this actually decomposes as a direct product. You can see this because if I stabilize each of these four things, then well, I can do whatever automorphism I want here independently of whatever automorphism I want there, whatever that one here, that one here, right? So I've given this. So, I've given this a name. This is the rigid stabilizer, say, of this vertex, this green vertex. That's all the automorphisms that do something here, but leave everything else fixed. Is that clear? What do we do to stabilize? Okay. So, this big direct product is an open subgroup, right? And I've written in very, very small, which you probably can't see, why it is that an almost automorphism preserves. That an almost automorphism preserves the open. So let's take this almost automorphism, for example. We want to show, it's enough to show that if we conjugate the stabilizer of the vertex V by, well, okay, if I conjugate it this way, then it has to contain some basic open. That was this condition up here. It has to contain the pull. Right, it has to contain the point-wise fixed vector of some finite sub-tree A. So let's take A, the subtree corresponding to the shaded red things. So that's, well, the sub-tree corresponding to the images of 1, 2, 3, and 4. If I do that, and I take some k in the rigid stabilizer of these things, well, it's a direct product. So when I conjugate by g, at G at each of these things, so my k is just a tuple, in this case a four-tuple of things. And when I conjugate by g, what I'm doing is conjugating by each of the actual tree automorphisms that took one to one and two to two, and three to three, and four to four. So, so here I ended up, so here I've ended up with actual automorphisms that fix each of these. That fix each of these subtrees. Does that make sense? Okay. So this is the key. This observation. So this means, we give this a name because this is very useful. We'll say that the stabilizer of a vertex V inside the group of tree automorphisms is locally decomposable, which means exactly that for every compact open, so that you can think of as the boundary of some. You can think of it as the boundary of some little rooted subtree. The rigid stabilizer of that compact open times its complement, this is how I would denote complement. That thing is an open subgroup. And this is basically just saying that stabilizers, that stabilizers of vertices decomposes this dark prototype. These are the opens. Okay, and this, well, that's the thing that I just explained. So the this So this argument here is what guarantees that we can take the topology of this compact group and induce it up to a topology of AOT. And this is what's in the Rumbaki proposition. So preserving the opens means that you can then, there's a uniquely defined topology whose basic opens are the cosets, the cosets of basic opens. So you take a basic identity neighborhood here. Basic identity neighborhood here, and you take all of its cosets by elements of the big group, that's your basic opens in the new topology. And the robot by key property. Yeah. So V is fixed? I fixed a vertex, yeah. Okay, so you don't do this for every vertex? No, I just need to do it. I just pick one subgroup. Yeah. That's a good point. It doesn't matter which one you pick. No. No, it doesn't. I just need an open subgroup. An open subgroup. So the stabilizer of A vertex will do. Yes? You need to remind me of what a Hecke pair is. Okay. Maybe you have a locally compact? Yes. And a compact open? Yes. It's a Hecke pair. Yes. Exactly. So the compact open is commensurated. The compact open is commensurated by the locally compact group. The reason I ask is that you're coming around a different way. You're constructing the topology upstairs. Yeah, so I started off with a compact open. I started off with a compact and I wanted to be open. So I defined the topology. You're giving a topological hecator, which is locally compact and a compact of hepatitis. Well, no, I'm making the local. Yes, exactly. I'm creating a hecatha out of a I'm creating a heck pair out of a compact group. Yes. Making mistakes and coming in with some stuff. So for you have the weighted stabilizer. That's a subgroup of T, right? And now you press out once you, how can you open T? Not do I have? Ah, uh yes, okay, okay. So uh so let's say that this is you. Yeah. So let's say that this is U, right? Then the complement of U is all of this. Okay, so the stabilizer, I, okay, so basically that's all of that, right? So the stabilizer of this thing is the direct product of this rigid stabilizer and, well, actually, no, it's okay. Okay, well, so what I wrote, so what I wrote Okay, well, so what I wrote, so what I wrote here is true, but maybe to see it in this picture, what you need to say is that this, that the complement of you, which is these three things together, also decomposes as a direct product, and that's still open. But if you want, it's enough to say, actually, no, let me say it again. This direct product here, that contains the open subgroup, which comes from the fixator of this whole subtree. So if a subgroup contains an open subgroup, then it Subgroup contains an open subgroup, then it's immediately open. That's the way topological groups work. And so this direct product here, that dark product here already contains something over. More questions? Okay, more questions will come when I don't expect them, so that's okay. Please keep them coming. This is good. I forgot to say, ask as many questions as you want. What was I saying? Yes, so I'm making a hand. Saying, yes, so I'm making a Heke pair, as you just pointed out, and this is how you do it. Since, and of course, I started off with the compact, and because I started off with a compact, and I made sure that that thing is open in my bigger topology, I've ended up with a locally compact group. Okay, now as most of you know, there's no need to start off with a group to get a full group. Like, I started off with odd T, which is a group, but I could have. Which is a group, but I could have started off with anything. I guess most people here like two points to make their full groups. Well, I'm in the inverse modo camp because I guess the easiest way I know to get a full group out of a groupoid already involves the groupoid being a locally compact groupoid. Like the groupoid already has a topology, which has nothing to do with the topology of this situation. So I don't. Situation. So I don't want to end up with two topologies on a groupoid. That's a bad idea. Okay, so what we do is we translate the topology of the groupoid into algebra, but we only care about the compact open bisections. That gives us elements of an inverse monoid. So these are partial homeomorphisms of the Cantor space, where I take some compact open subset of my Cantor space and I take it homeomorphically to another compact open subset. To another compact open subspace. That's a partial homeomorphism. Alright, so I start off with that inverse monoid, and then I can do the full group construction. Okay, so let me point out how you can do this for this example. A group of almost automorphisms of a tree is the full group of the inverse monoid, which is built out of, well, it's an inverse monoid of partial homeomorphisms of X, where C stands for with compact open support. And it's generally And it's generated by, again, this compact group. And what do I mean by this picture? Well, I mean the inverse monoid corresponding to, or if you want, corresponding to the groupoid, the path, the graph groupoid corresponding to this. So what is this thing, right? So what I've ended up doing is I've stabilized a vertex B, right? And that means Right, and that means so d was three in my all my pictures. So I've uh stabilized this vertex v, and now I've got this sort of picture happening. And now in this inverse monoid, I'm allowed to push and pop things. So basically, what I'm doing is taking some infinite path and replacing prefixes. Okay, I see nodes, so that's good. People know what I mean. Okay, and I take the Boolean inverse monoid approach to. Boolean inverse monoid approach to building a full group, which means I take all the restrictions of my inverse monoid M to compact open subsets. I allow partial composition and inversion, and the Boolean part is that I allow finite joints over disjoint subsets. Is everybody happy with joints? People know what I mean by joints. If I have two partial homeomorphisms. If I have two partial homeomorphisms, one that does, say, this and another one that does that, then I just take the join of them will be the thing that takes these two things to these two things. Okay. And the full group is the group of units of this thing. I'm going really, really slow. All right. The thing that's probably not so obvious to see from where you're sitting is that this inverse monoid is. This inverse monoid is, you can put a topology on it, and actually, I've cheated because I'm using again the topology of this compact group, the stabilizer of the vertex. So I'm again inducing up from the topology of the compact group that stabilizes V. And this topology on the inverse monoid is locally decomposable. Now, what does that mean in the Inverse monoid context? It means that it acts control. Context, it means that it acts continuously on the Cantor space, and this funny condition that says that for every compact open, I can do what? I can take some M and restrict it to that compact open and to its complement. And that map needs to be continuous and open. Doesn't matter if you don't understand what this is. The point of this condition is that Is that it's what makes joins continuous. The whole point of this condition is that disjoint joints will be continuous when we take the Boolean inverse monoid. And this is the topology that you need to take on the Boolean inverse monoid. So, okay, this is the same thing that I had before. And the theorem, well, okay, it's a theorem, but I basically already told you how to. It's a theorem, but I basically already told you how to prove it. The point, it's not really a theorem, it's one of these things where the difficult thing is to realize what the right definition is. And once you've realized what the right definition is, then the theorem just falls through, falls into your hands. So if you start off with a locally decomposable inverse monoid, then there's a unique inverse monoid topology on its Booleanization that extends the topology of M, so that means that M is open, and it makes taking disjoint joints a Taking disjoint joints a continuous operation. The whole point of this is that, of course, the full group then inherits this topology. So we've given, okay, if we start off with an inverse monoid which is locally compact or discrete, then the Boolean inverse monoid or the full group will be totally, will be locally compact or discrete, whatever you want. Okay. Alternating full groups. Okay, so. Alternating full groups. Okay, so these are the things, these are the simple, these are the simple groups coming from full groups on Cantor spaces. So, just a reminder of what the definition is, these are the elements of the full group, that you remember the word partitions, the elements of the full group that actually preserve the partition, which defines them. So you don't have two partitions that end up, you know, one going to another. You preserve the partition, and on the parts, you do an even permutation. You do an even fragmentation. Those are the generators of the alternating one. Okay, and Nekrushevich, who, as far as I know, was the one that defined this subgroup, proved that if you start off with a minimal, well, he termed it all in groupoid language, but it translates to inverse monoids. So if you start off with a minimal groupoid or a minimal inverse monoid, so that means that all orbits are dense, then this alternating full group is simple. He also proved He also proved the discrete version of the following theorem. We've just taken everything and put compact instead of finite. It still took a little bit of work. But anyway, so if we start off with a locally decomposable inverse monoid, right, because if we don't do that, then we can't put a topology on the full group. And it's compact, the locally decomposable monoid is compactly generated and expansive, so that means it's basically the analog. It's basically the analog of an expansive dynamical system, if people know what that is. Okay? If not, this is the definition that I can use: the M orbits, there's a Kopen partition of the Cantor space whose M orbits separate every point, separate any pair of points of the Cantor space. Then, if you have all of these conditions, then the alternating full group is compactly generated, of course, for the topology that it inherits, that we've built in the previous slides. Slides. Okay, now more words. If, moreover, M is minimal and non-discrete, then in fact the action of the alternating full group is fully compressible. And okay, here there is a proof that I'm not telling you. And that means that the fact that this is fully compressible means that the closure of this alternating full group, I mean, This alternating full group. I mean, this alternating full group is already closed. You don't need to close it. So that's nice because taking closures is hard. You don't know what you've added. And in fact, it turns out to be equal to the derived subgroup of the full group. And of course, it's simple by negotiations there. So examples. So here's the thing. I can give you very few examples. Non-discrete versions of Non-discrete versions of Scott Rover groups. So people call them Rover and Nikushevich groups, but actually the first person to make such examples was Elizabeth Scott, who was Graham Hickman's PhD student. And then she went off to do computer science and she's a professor in computer science now and nobody cites her original work. So the original, everybody cites Rover, but Rover was following the steps of Elizabeth Scott. So I think this should be mentioned. Elizabeth Scott. So I think this should be mentioned. Anyway, what do you do? You take, so Robert took the example of the Grigorcher group acting on an infinite, right, on a binary tree. If you don't know the definition, ask me later. He took the Gregori group and added the Higman-Thomps group V2, which I guess everybody is an expert now on. Mal 1? Well, it's O2. It's the group of units of O2. And okay, it turns out that the group generated by these two things is something called the abstract commensurator of gamma, but you don't need to worry about that. And it's a finally presented simple, infinite, finally presented simple group. Now you can play the same game. Instead of taking the Rogoric group, you take its closure inside the group of automorphisms of this. The group of automorphisms of this binary tree, that's a compact group. And you play the same game. You add V2 and K Presto. Well, you need to make sure that the conditions of the theorem are satisfied, but trust me, they are. And you end up with something that's simple, T D L C and non-discrete. Instead of the Grugotsch group, you can take any profinite branch group that you like, whatever that means. So, you know, things that look like a Grotcher's group. And instead of V2, you need to make. And instead of V2, you need to make sure that you take something, some compact subset that preserves the openness of your compact group. Otherwise, the topology won't work. Okay, let me give you another example. So people know about full groups of these pictures? No? Yes, maybe. Maybe without the C2s and S3s and C3s. People know about full groups of graphs. Okay. Graphs. Okay. And the way that you make them is you take the graph and you look at the path space and you say it's all the, well, it's essentially prefix replacement whenever you can. Well, now let's add things. Now we're going to add group actions. So I'm going to allow that on the blue edges you can do an action of S3, and on the orange edges you can do an action of C2, and on the red ones you can do an action of C3. That gives you something non-discrete. That gives you something non-discrete. And the claim is that the full group of that thing is, well, the alternating full group of that thing is another example of this sort. So my open question to you is find me some more. And also find me some more that don't feel like cheating, like the Scott Rover example. It feels like cheating. We started off with a compact group. And I want Right, and I want to be able to say, well, look, you don't need, I want to make this sentence meaningful. I want to be able to say, look, there are many more full groups that don't necessarily come from group actions. I want to construct them from in-verse monoids, where you don't obviously have a group hanging about. So please find me some more examples, maybe from K-graphs, maybe from. From K-graphs, maybe from other group points? Who knows? Thank you very much.
