 All right, here we go. So thanks for coming back. Now, Denika will tell us about integrity and its breaking in buttons. Thank you, Sarah, for the introduction. Thank you all for being here attending this talk. So yeah, I will tell you about integrability, but in particular integrability breaking in point and circle, and I will mention also. Okay, but let me start with a little bit of context. So the context So, the context here is one of isolated quantum systems out of equilibrium, and we know some examples of these systems starting from these experiments with ultra-cold atomic gases, proceeding to experiments with optical lattices, for example, or to the more recent quantum devices, quantum computers that On the computer, that would be it in a sort of a digital fashion, so it would be a one-to-circuit. So, what all these systems have in common for the purpose of my talk is that they can study dynamics, auto-equilibrium dynamics in a system that is well isolated from the environment. And in a system, in a many-body system with many degrees of freedom. And the question that's interesting in this kind of context. In this kind of context, is how does an isolated quantum system reach thermal equilibrium? Now, okay, the protocol is very simple. You start from a state that's simple to prepare in an experiment, like a product state. You let this evolve meantime, for example, this is Hamiltonia. You look at how an expectation value or an observable changes in time. And then you expect that after some time this will converge to Time this will converge to some value predicted by some thermodynamic ensemble. That can be, for example, the kids ensemble for Hamiltonian evolution, or if you don't have energy conservation, for example, in a circuit, this would be an infinite temperature thermal state. Now, another possible case is if you evolve, for example, with an integrable system, with an integrable Hamiltonian, the correct The correct thermodynamic description is a generalized Gibbs ensemble that keeps into account all the presence of other concept quantities. Now, as soon as you add to this integrable Hamiltonian, you're the perturbation, so this lambda v. Lambda here is a small real lambda. What you expect to see is that the evolution for some time will For some time, it will be very similar to the one of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, but after some time you will start to actually see these deviations. And this is actually been studied a lot. So this is called pre-thermalization. So you first have some thermalization occurs in different stages. And at later time, And at later time, you have eventual thermalization. Now, the question that I care about for this talk is: how fast does this take for this event of thermal mutation to happen? And the general expectation is that the equilibration rate should be given by something like a Fermi's Godran rule, in the sense that you have an order one number. That you have an order one number that depends on the energy scales of your system times lambda square, where lambda was the perturbation strength. So this is what the usual expectation in these cases. Now there was this experiment a few years ago. This was done by the Google Pontomia Collaboration and what they found, well they studied an integrable quantum circuit. Integrable quantum circuit. They studied, for example, the propagation of bound states in this system. But what they also pointed out was that they observed an unexpected resilience of the bound states to integrability breaking. And since at the moment Lesik and I were studying integrability breaking perturbations, we saw this, we thought, okay, we want to understand what's the origin of this unexpected. What's the origin of this unexpected resilience? And this is what I will tell you in this talk today. I will show you the data in a while. Sorry, I because I don't have one specific and the only one probably in the world. But how But how, so what is what makes the quantum circuit interest? Yeah, I will show what the quantum circuit is. But essentially, you can also in this case a lot of the you can have better answer solutions, you can have conserved charges and so on. So there is a non-intable model behind this? Yeah, yeah. So why is the what do you mean by unexpected reasons? What do you mean by unexpected resilience? Why is it unexpected? Resilience might mean they don't break or what? Why would you expect them to break? So, okay, I will describe exactly what they see. But the idea is that the moment you add a perturbation that breaks integrability, because these bound states are in the middle of a continuous spectrum. Of a continuous spectrum, you expect that they will decay in this control. And they claim that at least they don't observe it to put it on scale. So to me, it's very familiar, the opposite thing. This is the story of confinement and integral assistance, right? You have C nodes, and then in the integral case, and you do a perturbation, then they bind into mesons. So the opposite happens when you perturb. When you put up the system, it's also very popular. That's usually, but usually, when this happens and the system is non-integrable, those are not in the middle of the continuum spectrum. You have a discrete part of the spectrum and then you have the continuum. And so if you have a gap, so if you have a discrete spectrum, that's quite expected, right? That you have a gap. But if they're in the middle of the continuum, If if they're in the middle of the continuum, that's fine. There should be no reason why they're this part. Okay. So let me introduce the model. So I will essentially show a cartoon of that. So what they they did the following, they prepared an initial state was i it was initialized like this, so there's zeros everywhere, once in these three sites. In these three sites, neighboring sites, and then they applied this sequence of gates. Each gate is basically a locker version of the XXZ model. So essentially you have a hopping and an interaction term. So basically, you conserve the number of ones, of particles here. And this model was studied. This model was studied, it's mounted as an integrable system, and also this was well understood. And what they studied, for example, yeah. So this gate, is it Clifford? Sorry, second, yeah. Is the gate Clifford? I think it's not, right? It's for generic theta and Generic theta m phi. I think it's not confirmed in generic. But in the experiment, they fix the angles? Yeah, they chose some values for those angles. They kept them fixed for the entire depth. Yeah, yeah. What dictates the choice they did? They they chose the values so that um so first of all that bound states are there, because I think there's some condition on the angles for the bound states to be there. And the angles for the bound states to be there, and also they wanted them to be some so they explained why they chose these values, but they had to do with the dispersion of the bound states. Some regime that was convenient for them. Okay. So here I'm just representing this state in a circle because they have periodic battery conditions. They let this evolve in time. They let this evolve in time and measure the positions of these three particles after some time. And they observe there is a large probability for these three particles remaining bound, which what they essentially observe is the probability for these three particles to be on neighboring sites. And they also could measure, for example, the dispersion relation of these bound states. And as I said earlier, And as I said earlier, these are pulse states in the middle of a continuum spectrum. So here, okay, it's not really easy to see, but basically this region is all a continuum part of the spectrum. Yeah. Actually, we looked at this model here on an infinite time. All the spins down to three spins up and study its evolution. function of delta the anisotropy so it depends very much what delta you choose if you choose a small delta they will disperse i mean the bound the bound state will just be very close to the magnonic there's the romancy limit which tells us within the light cone in which they are going to produce Light cone in which they are going to propagate. So you're saying this dispersion basically here will be very infinite circuit or XFC. Yeah. But uh the Hamiltonian continuous. Yeah, this this one, like the the difference is that it's applied on uh on gates. Applied on gates. So it's just a periodic. You're going to get the same asymptotic writers. Yeah, identical. So indeed, I mean, this problem of releasing a bound state has been studied. I've done it also from HGCU. Dramatic difference. As delta goes into the gap regime, one suddenly you keep the bound state, it just doesn't die. So the bound states, in other words, they become heavier and heavier. So they. Happen. So they propagate closer and closer to the star. Otherwise, they just spread out. That's very much of what value you choose for them. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So indeed here they looked at some value where they had this dispersion. They they also studied their propagation and how like they they were able to match this with the with the velocities that they expected and so on. They expected and so on. But the figure, so blue means one or zero? Like, what does it mean? One. Yeah. This means the initial state was three particles and three neighboring sites. And zeros everywhere. So yeah, so maybe you are going to be swaying later. So I was bothering, so Hi what's battery? So okay, so this uh quantum socket uh okay, so uh this internet propagated, so you you put uh non-committing terms in the initial. So in this sense, and this quantum socket is already some kind of approximation to this intelligent parameter, right? So I think we have to be very careful about the strength of integrality by lighting parameters because so you're referring to these two terms that are not This is already the approximation. So, this quantum circuit is already the approximation of this. So, we have one committee. No, so they actually can implement precisely this gate. So, it's because the idea is that this is still applied on only two qubits. So, this is not summing over size. So I'm not summing over sites here, this is just a single, sorry, this picture is of the moving. So this doesn't produce the precise time evolution of the whole Hamiltonian. Yeah, no, this is not the Hamiltonian. Yeah, yeah, no, so this is not the same as the Hamiltonian case. And if you email was evaluated in Labor, it gives part of the lambda, I assume, but this lambda will be some perturbation with this alcomium term. Um no so the the well the reason why the for this so you may so if I understand correctly you may worry that okay this in some sense this is a trotterization of the of the xxz so you may say okay then an integrability is broken, but actually also this is integrable. So even far from the limit of the continuous Hamiltonian. Hamiltonian. So if we find theta and phi, this model is also integrable. It's not the same as the integral of it at the level of the quantum circuit, not at the level of Amantonium. Yes, yes, exactly. Yes. Okay. So what is the value of five divided by theta? So really large. Yes, there was. Yes, there was so I think theta was pi over six and phi was to pi over three. That's quite textual as easy to explore the model. Okay, so this was the model, and so far everything was integrable and everything understood. What they did next was to add a perturbation in this form. They added some additional sites here and they had essentially the same gates coupling these two sites. So essentially, they had one more layer to the circuit that now coupled these external. This external side move is just with a different value of theta, that is basically this perturbation strength. So the theta was smaller and it's this small parameter. I love it. Yeah. So the expectation now is integrability is broken and so these bound states Bound states, we expect them to decay in the continuum with a rate that is basically the one I showed before. So proportional to lambda squared. Now, this is what they observed. So this is again the probability of the three particles being on neighbouring sites after a certain number of cycles. And this is as a function of the perturbation strength, essentially, of the theta parameter. Essentially, of the theta parameter on these additional sites. So, what they see is that, well, even in the absence of a perturbation, these things decay just because of the dissipation and the continuum solar. But when they turn on this perturbation, they don't see a dramatic change in this decay and indeed also for very for many very long time, so many iterations of the circuits. Hyderation of these circuits, they still see a quite large probability of finding these particles in a bound state. And so they also did some simulations. These are numerical simulations for longer times. They did simulations for larger systems. And in all these cases, they say that but also for very long times, there is still a fairly large probability of three these particles being next to each other. Next to each other. And so at this point, the question was: Is this some example of anomalously slow thermalization, or are there really some robust bound states that are non-thermal in the sense that they don't depend on the question we wanted to answer? And so, to do so, we started by studying the spectrum of this system. Of this system. So, what you see here is part of the spectrum. So, this is K, this is quasi-energy. So, I'm just plotting the part where these bound states are. In this lattice, there are four of them in the absence of the hopping to the external sites. And the quantity, the color here represents this. Color here represents the momentum resolved inverse participation ratio. This is just essentially a momentum participation ratio that tells how much the wave function is localized in the center of mass of the three particles. So for example, if for a three-particle bound state, this quantity should scale as a, should be a constant. For a scattering state with a bound state of two particles and a A bound state of two particles and another particle, this should decay as one over L. And for a scattering state with three different particles, this should decay as one over L square. So it's okay here. Yeah. This is the spectrum of what? The spectrum, right, of the local operator. So it's the unitary operator that's basically an application of two layers of this. Of two layers of this prequels. So the evolution is just this operator to the number of cycles. And yeah, so basically these four bands that you see here, this represents these bound states. Now oh, and here you Oh, and here you, okay, this is what pictorially I'm just plotting the same thing here. Now, as you turn on this perturbation, what we expected to see was that, okay, these delta peaks that you see here, they will merge with this continuum. We will see some broadening of these peaks. And okay, this is what we find. So we took. We took a value of the perturbation just even as large as the one of the circuit. And here, okay, it's a bit hard to see, but basically we still find a very narrow band. So we don't see any broadening of these bands. And also, okay, here maybe you can see it better. This is just this vertical. This is just this vertical cut at zero momentum. These are different system sizes. And you see that there are always these large peaks that are still very, very narrow. And here, so it's a bit hard to see, but here you can see basically what I'm plotting here is as a function of L is the largest. The largest value in this region. So you see that these pits since they go down with system size, this is just a linear fit, but it's very, very noisy. So we can't really extract a clear trend from this. So if we want to argue that these peaks are disappearing with increasing the system size, we thought, okay, this is not really conclusive. How did you casually light for the computer? Oh, this casually on my laptop because this is a very is actually just three particles. So this is a reliable calculation. I mean, you will not have these problems that a quantum computer has. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no. This is just examinalization of it. And it's basically because you only have three parts. It's basically because you only have three particles, you can really go to more. Well, these are 60 unit cells, so 100 into size, and that's pretty much the largest. Okay, so there is this decreasing trend. It's very slow. So we tried to study another quantity. So we tried to do a perturbative analysis and try to actually measure this decay rate. Measure this sticker rate. And so the idea is that this sticker rate for these different bands, labeled by m, should be given by this formula. So this is just the density of states. This is the matrix element of the bound state of the perturbation with the rest of the states averaged over a certain energy window from the unperturbed spectrum, and this is the perturbation strength. Strengths. So we computed these quantities separately. And so we found that, okay, these matrix elements, both the matrix element and density of states have the dependence so L that we expected. This is just a simple argument. If you count how many states you have, you can easily convince yourself that this is the correct state. Convince yourself that this is the correct scaling, we should expect for this with the system size. Then we put everything together and we find this, we compute essentially this quantity as a function of system size. And for all these four bound states, it looks like this quantity is converging to some value. And but the actual value where this is converging to is very small. Converging to is very small. So for this band, it's like 4 times 10 to the minus 3. In these other states, it's even smaller than 10 to the minus 5. So this result suggests that there is a finite BK rate, but it's very, very small. And this means that, okay, this actually explained their observation because what we estimate based on this number. What we estimate based on this number is that one would need to simulate more than 6,000 unit cells for up to 10 to the 5 cycles to actually see the decay. And this is way beyond what could be simulated here. That it goes like theta prime squared is sort of sort of tested. I mean, in principle, you could introduce a perturbation where you don't get Fermi's code rule, but you get something in higher order, like theta prime to the power of 4. To the top force. Yeah, yeah. But in that case, we would have seen that these gammas, like this number would go to zero with this size. That's what I would expect. That if the decay was some higher constant, this would go to zero. I actually will discuss something along the slides later. Okay, so now why are these numbers? Why are these numbers so small, right? It's very puzzling. Why should one get something of the order of 10 to the minus 5? So, our explanation for this is the following. So, this, I'm just plotting again. It's the same plot I showed earlier, just I'm changing the scale here. So, you not only see these four bands, but you also see these other states down here. And so, okay, as I said, these are the. So, okay, as I said, these are these three particle bound states. These yellow states here, these are one plus one plus one scattering states. While these other states here, those are two plus one scattering states. So it's a bound state of two particles and one other particle. So, okay, so basically, this is the spectrum for those parameters. The spectrum for those parameters that they have. What you see here is that if, like, this three-particle bound state can decay to these scattering states, they have the same energy, but they cannot decay to the two plus one scattering states. So, and we argue that the fact that this is the only decay channel available is what makes DSDK rate so small. And in fact, we tried with other parameters, which With other parameters, we change this theta and phi. And what we found was that if you have something like this, where these three particle bound states overlap with the two plus one continuum, then you actually see this broadening. So and here you can see it also, this is the again the cathode k equals zero, and you see very clearly here this peak is going down and it's broadening. Down and broadening with L, while these other states that instead do not overlap with the 2 plus 1 continuum, they are basically unaffected. So that we have actually energies, so in fact, with balance power E to plasma over T, is it possible that the green thing below would pop back from above? Below would pop up from above because it's a range of choice. Yes, yes. So yes, that's basically what happens in Git is that you can, like if you if you look at the Hamiltonian spectrum and you compare it with this Floke spectrum, you it's basically like these three particle bound states got folded on the on top of the continuum. Okay. So to summarize, we found that these long-lived bounce states eventually decay, but at very long times, just because this rate is very small. And now I want to show another example where, actually, as you mentioned earlier, you can have something that's slower than Fermi's. That's slower than Fermi is called the rule. And that's, for example, you can have some higher powers of lambda. And this is also what Fay talked about yesterday. There are these weak integrability breaking perturbations. So yeah, Faye explained the constructions already yesterday, but I'll try and give a geometric picture for what is happening here. So the idea is that you have some, say you start. You have some, say you start from some integrable Hamiltonian that has a certain set of concern quantities, then there are some called long-range integrable deformation that can be applied to it. And the way to like I think the intuitive picture for this is that it's as if you apply some unitary transformation to the Hamiltonian and to the charges at the same time. It will still commute. At the same time, it will still commute. So the model you get is still integrable, but when you do this, the model will maybe become long-range and get some data. So the idea behind this weak integravity breaking perturbation is that, well, a generic perturbation will look like this, but you can choose some special directions that are actually tangent to this manifold of the integrable deformations. Of the integrable deformations. So these are what we call these weak integrability-breaking perturbations. And so the idea is that, okay, if those are tangent to this manifold, it means that to first order in lambda, they don't break integrability. So the preserve integrability is order lambda, and the effective integrability breaking is the order lambda squared. So if the integrability breaking is order lambda squared, then we can say, okay, then. Lambda squared, then we can say, okay, then the rate will be lambda to the fourth rather than lambda squared. So that's the general idea. And we applied this, and you can also have some higher powers of lambda if you take better approximation of this manifold. So we apply this construction to a few examples. For example, we consider the XFZ chain and Chain. And so here, this is the unperturbed part. And if you add the perturbation next nearest neighbor, isotropic term, we found that, for example, this is a weak perturbation. And this was studied before, and actually the the some of the consequences of this being a weak perturbation were already found in these papers. Already found in these papers. We actually also found that you can go beyond first order, and that if you consider the xx and you add also the third neighbor with a prefactor lambda squared, this breaks integrability to the next order, lambda cube, which I think we thought was nice. I think it's always was nice. Another example was the MyRajain is using model. And we found that this perturbation is a weak perturbation. This is one of the many weak perturbations you can construct. And this was also studied in the past. Like if you read this by Nana fermions, you get this. My runoff fermions, you get this nice interaction that was studied, for example, in this work. And also, more recently, there was a paper where they actually showed that the diffusion constant scales as lambda to the minus 4 rather than lambda to the minus 2. And this was one of the consequences of this being a weak interval easy-breaking perturbation. So, to summarize, So to summarize, I first told you this story about these long-lived past states and why the decay rate is so small. And then I've mentioned these ideas of weak integrability breaking perturbations. Now, as an outlook, something we think we can do is to generalize this to the case of quantum circuits. Quantum circuits, but we haven't found an interesting example of something that, you know, the structure becomes more complicated, so it's still not clear to us if this is interesting enough to try and actually do this calculation. And also the consequences for transport, I think there's still a lot that can be understood. Another thing that I want to mention is that there are. Another thing that I want to mention is that there are other examples of even slower rates. Like you can have a rate that is like non-perturbating in lambda is of this form. And one was studied, for example, in this paper. If you start from a Hamiltonian that has an integer spectrum, and we also studied it in these other works that i one nice physical example is the one of uh the false vacuum decay. Of the false vacuum decay. So if you have something like, if the idea is that if you have some kind of an energy per year that you have to thunder through, you get this kind of expressions. And this is what we study in these papers. And now, since I was extremely optimistic when I wrote the abstract and I thought I would have time to talk about this one as well, I just have a Well, I just have a slide, so if anyone is interested in this, you can ask me during the coffee breaks. But it's basically another case where we studied a quantum circuit and we ran into some special integrable point that was quite interesting. And this has to do with something that was found in the read-Bergadem experiment, where the fact that you have these special states are called anibotic scars. States are called antibodies cars, and we found that this can be traced all the way from the continuous Hamiltonian evolution to these special points. Okay, with that, I thank you for your attention. Questions? The calculations you showed check the stability of the boundary. The bound scope. For which value of T prime do you use? I mean the ratio of the Z company to XX? Yes, so okay, there was a large value. So there was this. This was file receipts, files via three, and the the phi in in the In the perturbation was also the same as this. But we tried different values of theta prime. So for example, this one was for theta prime equal to theta. This one here. And I think also, yeah, this, no, this was for the amper, starting from the amper third one. So for theta brown. From the unperturbed one. So for theta prime, zero, because we did the perturbative analysis. But this one was the theta prime equals theta. Energy zones far down. That means these excitations are some large finite number plus a little bit of cosine or something. That's how we can describe this. Yeah, I mean um you have some number like form. Got some number like 4.5, and then there is some bigger top of the number. So it looks to me as if you're relatively deep in the easy direction, I think this excitation should be stabilized by a binding effect. I mean, the excitation, the three binding ones that are bound are wise to stay close to each other and not to separate, I mean for energy reasons. For energy reasons, um I mean, actually, I mean it's my opportunity to understand what I'm saying, so I think that's true in the Hamiltonian case, where okay, you can talk about the bottom of the spectrum, top of the spectrum. Indeed, in that case, those bound states are stable because they are protected by the gap. But the problem here is that The problem here is that because this is a periodic Hamiltonian, basically, so this spectrum is defined, this is an angle basically, right? 0 to pi. And there, like if you just take the Hamiltonian spectrum and you try to fold it on this circle, right, you find that these bound states that were These bound states that were stable in the Hamiltonian now have the same energy as. So essentially, here you cannot really talk about the bottom of the spectrum, the top of the spectrum. So it's, or at least it's a bit more subtle than that because the spectrum is defined as a, so this episode is an angle, then I think I'm saying. I think you have to think of the matrix elements, not just the energy, right? So, there's going to be a rate of breaking these things. And if you ask me to guess, for example, what's going to break those things, it's just going to be a modulated exchange at a frequency corresponding to the binding energy. Then they're going to disappear. They have to have a certain energy. It's three times larger than before. Yeah, yeah, absolutely, absolutely. But, you know, once again, Since Shigo's sitting in a continuum, in fact, right? So you can always resolve. Fact, right? So you can always resolve the energy constraint. It's a matrix element that kills the process. You fail to see the continuum, I mean, the continuum that belongs to the magnet subspace must lie a triangle. So it should be below in space. I mean, in energy region, there is nothing. But maybe one way to understand this is that because you have. To understand this is that because you have this time periodicity, you can always exchange an energy that's given like the frequency, right? The frequency of this drive is some energy that you can get for free, right? You can exchange it. It's just because of these periodic drive somehow. So I'm confused about Google. I mean, so they have smart people there. They have smart people there. They did not look at the Flaque spectrum because it seems like that's the main ingredient, right? I mean, looking where the band is relative to the continuum. Isn't that the main take-home messages that... So they looked at the, like in the sense that they found that it was in the continuum, right? So they looked at the spectrum and they found that these bound states were in the continuum. That's why they said, oh, this is unexpected, because these bound states are in the middle of the continuum. Are in the middle of the continuum spectrum. They didn't do this type of analysis that we did here, like looking at these matrix elements and so on. And they did essentially the simulations of time evolutions, by the way. They were pretty close from. Yeah, they're the I mean the it's true that if you look at this. Yeah, it's a difference between nature and PRP, right? Exactly. If you look too closely, then it's no longer. If you closely, then it's over. Maybe PRP stops.
