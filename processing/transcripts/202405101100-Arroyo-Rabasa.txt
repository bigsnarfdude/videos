Now, here that this with what this guy is a constant, well, it is amplitudes in the space where the operator is not selling, or other paragraphs where the lambdas are allowed for the operator. Permitted by the operators. And this, the more in general, and the majority of the cases no other way, so that no decent concern in these segments. Here we understand, or understand abstract management, these non-linearities. This functions are non-linear functions, when I. As non-linear functions, with the portal. But a point all difficult. And I will imagine that with all these non-lineal. So the differential equation with user is conjugate in non-linearity. And well, the resources that resolve in 2005 also a corresponding If there is a correspondence between the types of oscillations and concentration allows for the operating concentration, these functions are one function that is also convex. The day of the problem is, you can precisely abstract this characterization that jams, which we are not very constructive that can say much, no. And not current, if really the frequencies. Well, it's about this time to second part of the platform that this part, where the geometry and the idea is that vido greats in this part. Tendiendo ya when the concentration current concentration create singularities, singularities. Because we have experiences in that provides these sabances in the part if it contends of the party. So, here the idea is that if they prove with the party, we are pornography with the party, no? Well, how we traditionally, and we're going to. And we are reporting or targeting a coquette, what is the geometry of the media that satisfies a partial difference and that one is pilot that are very. So, a reference for the gradients. Ok, so regret, like the rotational range, is my and that the media is my gradient of a function, we are. It is a gradient of a function, because we have the rotation of the route, and if you implement homology of data. They are functions that are for the work, but not functions that will be. So, Jacqueline, in this case, that is the matrix of the derivative, a matrix of MPO, all matrices. And if the functions are not simply a function, not coordinates polar, but in form of F, simply the F, between the absolute D. How between the validor absolute DF por el valor absolutely. So this modulo and this is like the angle of the function. You can see with the meditas so that if we have a gradient polar, that is here that I see what matrices are today. And this meant when it matrices. So this is what one for the points where significant cases with respect to the variation of the media. So, we repente what we are seeing is that there are restrictions. Now, another very important thing that I think is the idea that this is because first implemented and implemented. If you have a very good idea, If you have serious con legs, then, but this is not this theory or a little different. If this is within this conjugate, and the point with what superficial superficial, and the quantity that has the intersection has dimension, but it is superficial. So, my gradient doesn't enter there, in other words, in other words, the gradient is not living with us, not a legend and superficial, it is a superpower, and well, during the people, if these are relations, more sentimental purpose of me. Advance for certain collaborators, a very innovative result. And now, the history of the gradient general is implemented in a meeting, polar composition, and satisfaction in this case, rotational and 40 Wrinkler, which operates the annual mathematics. Of mathematics, no theorem. Especially the generalization of theorem of one because I am good. If you have a confusion that is made in space, punctual restrictions for the policy of my part, and that is precisely with the definitions and positives, no? And positives, that with an extension because I am the rotational extension, like A, so the precisely the matrices are, or in other notes, in here, so this has and there is. And these matrices are really. No, so really a generalization of the opportunity. I think this is good. However, in this situation, how do we do the media in case it points? As the type of technician utilizes that are singularities of media, it was with the theory of compensation in this case tomando conjunto and the more sensible. Imagine the difficulties that progress these processes and operations in mathematics. And operation of mathematics with a solo count. Well, with two with Philippines, with me that is in Lexi, we are finally geometrical. And that is what we build, we have a con and discovery that is like the dimension. And we have a jerk of knowledge that will be. And what we have to do the vegetables have my conflict and this here, you can see very quickly with a lot of superficial, not necessarily. Because the superficial dimension, which is where, no, in the dimension between intersection of my conjugate many dimensions or a dimension. So, the idea that satisfaction the differential equation satisfies this proposal of its polar queue is. That really is content in that new queue more restrictive. And this is the theoretical explain how these results of gradients are connected between results that people do not like connected by 60 years, for results that are connected to very, and the same. That Cause what passes that the ge quiet. But if the gender enters the sero, what is that? No, you cannot live in those conjugates that can cover completely with superficial dimension. If you are very paid, that is. May very much that can be vivid and in this case, the theory of utilization can be connected to man that more complicated points of plan and their manifold all day, but societies when you are important, what we mentioned in this part of the This part of the Atlática is that when the linear and more and singularities of dimensions, so we have a completely checked and definition of these connections, but all varieties are polynomials. So it's mentioned, and we are. We are all forced, which is if the singularity of these concentrations. And these are determined forces that the phenomenon of concentration also is determined by algebraic terms. And no, for these things that we have the convexity, it's like a part of regret, the part of the convexity, with the part of the convexity. And we have to go back a pass for trance. Y recover a little first slide. The convergence of December, but not interesting because part of life, that phenomenon that occurred, as I mentioned, the societies and concentrations are what I prevail that have convergent. Qualitatively, they are the unicorns that we. But like this is for the concentrations possible. And well, that is a concentration as we have our sequence, and we will have a concentration if there are a peg of this sequence, but with. Sequence, but of course, that is a series, but the integral does not for a epsilon. So, what is the pipe, in a divorce, so the function in this conjunction, very quickly compared with the right, for example, in the dimension? And in this case, the function has many because if not, many. Because if it doesn't create much, the functional model, the function, 30%, so this will be much. And how much many, and the more complicated part of the platform, like a negative, more creative, and affected, because there is an interpretation stochastic from the concentrations. All this idea that it is very infinite, the values of the function. In these cases, two dimensions there infinitely, but in this infinite directions that are the infinite direction. There is a manner to simplify the angular part of the sequence, knowing what this part of here denominates infinite denominations, and understand the distribution of values that the angles of toma when the infinite photos are pointed. Certain points and here, and then what results from the condition, which is the distribution of values, because in the value, my second values are pointing here infinite and valuable. Point there complicated the situation, but a massive situation. OK, so that is part of a funeral that the concentrations simple probabilities. They are implementing probabilities in the ferris of condition, we are clear. Well, there are other ingredients that are also complicated, but the idea is that two types of concentrations. The first thing that is the type of pura, the pura because creating a singularity of a dimensional mass, approximately the mass of dirty major queue, all well, the singularity. The simpler day. Or how the curvature that we curvature concentrated in a dimension, which also dimension mass. Well, that would be a purpose. Now, the total mass and modifies and are really not generating singularities. And this is what, but it is a man who can see the noise, and how you can imagine that. Because imagine that here, torrents are also one about 200, which the turbine and that the distance between them. So, you can all catch a total is one about it. And also, the total alley, but the problem is that to recitate, don't have singularity because. No general singularity because he laid a very private. And here we are that I will converger development to the function. The serrogo diamonds. Now these concentrations pursue the dividend more understanding because they generate a singularity when generating a singularity push to the part of the plateau and porters. But they are many more difficulties because they are not But these are many difficulties because no singularity in the power cumulative analysis and analysis. So, recording a cogito provenance that proves the concentrations permitted by the operator is characteristic for homogeneous functions and convex. And that has this idea of experience, which can be chanted by all these combinations. Ojarl is a combination not necessary, and we can characterize many people who have found the children. So, if only the experiences of probability. Bive precisely in the permitted layers for the operator. So, this results very connected because first nonsense and abstract of knowledge and agebraic. No, in this case, concentrations for concentrations is possible to characterize the completiment simple por this situation. That is the experience or the simple experience. What is the experience with the experiences simple integral of the variable of the probabilities? Ok. When do you think and you're not? Tier es Marada, no relaxion of myrno. And this has a compromise, the champions comprimible have atomic parts. So, there are a superposition of atomic parts to clear what? And these atomic parts are implemented bookles, what the loops. All this type of coffito here, yes, they are generating all the incomprimes. But what we have the attention is like a purpose, a first atomic part, and understand how the position. And that means there is a fundamental principle that explains a little like these concentrations for differential equations. For differential partial differences. And more importantly, if it is a variational additional variation, because it does not want to seem a variational additional, because this problem of the point, this problem of the materials, all minimization problems, but I create that there is a more explicit, more silence fundamental concept. In that case, the conjugate perdon is a superposition. And what is that what diffused concentration can be strit like integral, superposition pursuits? So here, simple esto is a integral about a conflict that is y pure, but simplements are the concentrations pursuing concentrations. Ok? Today, well, the mathematical buildings, the encantas superpositions, because the transformation transforms implemented as a function, and the function is a superposition of amplitudes in space with respect to the frequencies of this function. And also, that is a result that if the very utility is very full, have this type of expression. And if you are good, Well, possibly, because of here in reality, there is very few concentrations to enter info, the ration por the current result of partial results, you can diffuse concentrations. And that is a conjugate. And that is a conjugate. It is not. When these two and both can be like, I am theorem, because it is with the character in the renew. Character and a conjugate convex and express una combination. Present combination convex combination of the mass in more points. And what is that what convex and describing like the superposition of points extremes? That is a point, they are that we can express as a combination of linear combination other points. So, the first So, the first point is that there is a superposition, but a superposition in the super difficult concept are superposition of extremes. All good for all this is not a result complete. And diffusion that I prove that satisfaction is conditional. When satisfaction is algebraic condition that characterized my concentrations, and if that is probable, concrete to notice in not good evidence of their verdict, there are four cases, the great model, no explain many, but between four cases there verified that, but there are good evidence that we have. There are good evidence that concludes these things that we have and differential algebra, but really because the concept is interesting to concept because you have implications very differently. The first pose is the concept of 20. And that is vanishing with. And that is a vanishing volume conjecture. And it is a vanishing volume conjecture that says that the structure of that point is superfunding, but without volume, this or the madura of the point is microscopic with very much. So, you can imagine that they are planets, a more, and all these. Because it is important because this problem is very difficult to take the computer very convex, the computer not to resolve. But if not here, this type, we can say, well, we can see that my forms here, and all those things, all complicated computers. If we all Remuyo all this type of comportament, and solo in this, the computer me can build approximations. The problem is that how we can many groups that are intending to be the first consequence directly because of the resolution of the consequences, the second series can be or the first result of capacity for compensation in one. Compensation in one. There is also compensation in the Para P major one and not that infinite and the raise because the fury transport, but for some points of theorical point is if we convergence promotions cannot create singularities, if not and more. That's theorem, and for the And for 15, that means more interesting and problems in the calculator of variations, or relation with the problem in the calculus of variations. No voyage talks much that the problem is, but what I can say is that sometimes the problem in the calculation is more difficult in the modern world. And that is what we start. In the temples, quasi-convexity in terms of convexity of range, one when this domain and rotation that are gradients. No? And from the world, the definition for first convexity, that the convex are convex in segments of rango, and if we have the And the same thing that knows that the convexity in two locales, their inventions, because we have, but not that. And well, that conjecture is that the. But if we lose identity, the problem of Mori sex or verdict when only concentrations and other convexity is if we have gratitude, if only we have quasi-convexidades. So, we are interested to receive. And now that we can't do it. So public notemos in this moment for us to verify in the chat, nadamas, tampoco tenemos in the chat preguntas por el moment pale. Pues quiero pedirl que demos las gracias de nuevo adulfo por estricente plática por forward. Thank you. Yes, por the limitation also very content of participants in linear participants that approximate the puerto sigmierta and the generation of organizadors for your name. Val present much.
