Um insurance, some insurance problems, where for instance uh an insurer needs to link the premium of some insurance products to the level of accidental prevention, then we need some jumps. And for this reason, we need to introduce this process J that like in the paper of Like in the paper of Christophe and Camponi, this process J represents some losses, some accidents that can happen, and it has a negative impact on the output X. This J is just a compound process given by this sum and this M is the expected value of this random. Value of these random variables UI, it is the average loss per accident. So, in this setup, our agent needs to do two actions, an effort alpha in order to increase the drift of the outer process, and an effort beta in order to decrease the likelihood of these charts. To be precise. Our agent writes this contract C, it's just a triple. Tau, that is a stopping time that stands for the termination of the contract. I, that is a continuous stream of payments, so it is a predictable process, and psi, that is the final payment at tau, so it's enough tau. So it's an afternoon variable. So given this contract, the agent needs to compute to maximize his criterion. It is just given by this formula where H is a convex cost function and U needs to have Needs to have this behavior at infinity. So, at infinity, this function behaves like the power between the function with power 1 over gamma, where gamma is given, it's a given parameter, it is assumed to be infinitely ligand on 1. So, this is the problem that the agent faces, and regarding the principal problem, she needs to maximize her criterion over the Over the contract C that satisfies some credibility assumption and the participation constraint. So the agent needs at least to receive UR. As in Dila and Nisar paper, we would like to understand whether in this setup with jumps there exists this golden part. So if So, if the agent stops working at some time, tell and receive a lump sum payment, this is what it's called termination, or the agent stops working at some time, um tau but he receives a continuous stream of payments until some other time t plus other time t plus tau and at the end a lump sum payment sign. But see, since the two discount factors are not assumed to be equal, then the agent can be indifferent between these two options, but the principal can increase her reward. And for this reason, we need to introduce the facelift utility FBA. The face lift utility F bar that is just given by this deterministic mixed control stopping program. This is just the criterion of the principle when the agent does not work. So alpha is equal to zero and beta is just minus m. So the agent does not do anything to decrease the likelihood of the jumps. So, we need to compute this phase lift utility F bar in order to understand the problem. And to do this, we need to distinguish some cases, like in your paper, plus one. So, first of all, we can start with the easiest case, that is when the two discount rates are the same. In this case, everything is like in the framework without jump. In the thermal without jumps. So the phase lifting utility is just the function f that is equal to your function f that I denoted with f power 0. And in this case, if a golden power should exist, then this can be only of this termination type. So when the agent stops working, then he receives this lambda. He receives this lump sum payment and that's it. But if the agent is more impatient than the principal and so the ratio between these two discount rates is bigger than one and the average of the losses is small and small means the m is smaller equal to that constant then Then F bar is just a C1 concave solution of that OLE. We can write it down, but the formula is not so nice, so this is nicer. And this is exact like in the case without jumps. So f bar is always strictly above f. So if the value function of the Value function of the principal proven touches this bar, barrier F bar, then this means that a volume partition can exist. And if that exists, it's of a retirement type. So the agent stops working, but the contract is not over because the agent receives this continuous stream of payments. What is new is when the agent is more The agent is more impatient than the principal, but the jumps become bigger. In this case, we need to introduce this constant y bar, that is just given by the formula. And in this case, we can prove that the facelifted utility is just given by the function f until that point. Y bar and then it starts to solve that ODE. This F bar is still concave and C1 and this is new compared to your case because in this case we can have both scenarios. So in the sense that if there exists a golden parachute, this can be This can be either the termination case or the retirement case, depending where I touch the lower barrier F bar. And when the principal is more impatient than the agent, then we have to distinguish two cases. Cases. First of all, when the principal is much more impatient than the agent, and so that ratio is less than that constant 1 over gamma, then the problem degenerates and f bar is just given by f until it reaches this threshold minus m and then it stays constant. It stays constant forever. This is quite similar to the framework without jumps because, in that case, f-bar is just the constant zero. While if the principle is so is impatient, but not so much, f bar is just given by f until that point y hat and then it is. And then it is a translation of the phaselifting utility of the case without jumps. And this is in some sense a bit weird because the phase lifting utility is not C1 and concave anymore because here the left derivative is strictly less than zero and the right derivative is zero. So in this case, we have still these two different types of golden parachute depending where my value function touches the barrier as bar. So either termination of the contract or retirement. This is the analysis. The analysis of the phase lift utility F bar. And like in every principal agent problem, we can reduce this problem. And we end up with a mixed control stopping problem where the control state process is the utility continuation of the agent, this process Y, but we need But we need to introduce that random measure mu J tilde, that is the integer diary random measure associated with the component Poisson process J. This is the problem that we need to solve and in order to do this we can analyze the HP equation associated with the equation. The HP equation associated with this problem that is given by this formula, where we can see that J is given by this formula, but there is a non-local part. So J is a non-local operator because of this term, where FU is just the distribution of the Distribution of the jumps that can happen. So, right now we are trying to understand this movement of this solution and whether this solution touches us not our barrier F-bar. So, the problem is not solved, yeah. So, just to conclude, I would like to To conclude, I would like to point the main differences between the case with jumps and without jumps. First of all, we can notice that the phase lift utility is not always C1 anymore, because when the ratio between the two discount factors is less than one, then we have that function that is not concave. And if And if there exists a golden parachute, then this is not only retirement, but it can be also of the termination type. In the reduced control problem, we need to introduce this random measure muj that comes from Martinier presentation. And because of this, we need to deal with this normal. We need to deal with this non-local operator in the non-Belmont equation that characterizes the value of the function. Since we're almost perfectly on time, there is time for a few questions for Cara. For the A G B equation you don't have uh the degenerate part, like for the class, like in our web. Class, like an albino? The non-linear operator, it is there simplifying. Yeah, it it's exactly the same except for this non-local thing. So maybe I miss it, but how are you controlling the component custom? So this FU So this F you sorry. I'm I'm controlling the compensator of this component process. Oh, yeah, I didn't say okay, H is assumed to be a convex function such that. function such that if the agent does not work so alpha is equal zero and beta is equal to this m then h is zero and but yeah we have other assumptions but I didn't put nothing slides because they are a bit heavy one more question about the equation yeah can you get rid of the obstacle like in Sanikov here you cannot get rid of the obstacle you have to keep track of the obstacle yeah this is the the main difference with also the space production I wanted to start. So they are choosing data like this, or we can find change of matures? Are you doing a query exchange of matures? Yeah. Yeah, uh uh I'm these alpha and video are related to this change of method for this son of Change of methods through the son of theorem. Yeah, I don't know what you're using the intensity. Okay. So you have a fixed person process and then you're changing the intensity. Alright, there are no more questions. Let us thank Jara. If the speakers of this afternoon already have their slides, it's nice if you can put them on the computer.   He doesn't check out the books.    Thinking of doing this. If you were already doing it, I should have to do it. Yeah, exactly. So we know that the order is. So so we know that the power is not when you have in our case it was an optional stocking, but the data is a compound. You cannot run them before you invest. So that's that's what you're showing. Just give all the examples and I'll send it to you. Very good. I think there are something in the middle of the morning.  I don't because I don't think effectively the question.  I can tell you the working control is all without the same thing.  I mean you get the problem, right? And then when it's keyboard, you can wait for support. You can win full support and then you can do some parts. No, you want to be very generous because you have to move to another technology, which is not equivalent. You can ask Marco and Dania what I think. Actually, I have already got some examples. That's right. No, but you looked at the same thing. I mean, you have to assume it's one doesn't tell. I mean, yeah, you could see that you were not. Yeah, I mean, it's a very true question. But I think that she's somehow stronger with French people. Ah, and not she was off with Fabrice and with me. She was just off from me. She was like, I don't care about these stupid guys. Everything is wrong, but I don't even care. But it's here or last year? Ah, actually, but I remember that she had students without me. She was probably speaking without the words and sounds. I can understand some French because it's quite similar, and she was a projector or something. I don't know if it was that. I also remember she
