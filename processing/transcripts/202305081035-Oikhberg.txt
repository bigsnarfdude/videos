Well, thank you for this brief but informative introduction. I should return the thanks by mentioning my excellent collaborators on this project, Mitchell Taylor, Petr Trudeseti, who has just introduced me, and Vladimir Trovsky, who is one of the organizers of this meeting. And actually, when I was preparing his talk, Vladimir asked me to give an overview of a quote-quote unquote memoir on free bonic lattices, which we have posted on archive, I think, in October of last year. So I decided that the best I can hope for is to pick a topic in this memoir and then try to. Try to cover it. So, if your favorite topic is not covered, well, don't be too upset. Don't throw chairs at me, especially I think I don't know whether the chairs are attached to the floor in this room. And well, the best I can advise, if you don't find your favorite topic at my talk, then, well, read the memoir, and this is consider this as a brief commercial. So I hold this mouse. So, I hope this mouse works. Well, it kind of works. So, what do I plan to do in this talk? So, yeah, I'll begin by a brief overview of what Banach lattices are. So, we are on the same page. Then, I want to introduce 3P convex Banach lattices. And then I will talk about lattice cohortism between three lattices and how they are. Between three lattices and how they are connected to composition operators. And then, specifically, I want to examine the daughter when for a given D, when the 3P convex binoclysis on A may be identical in some way to the 3-binoclysis on some other Rabanic space staff. And it turns out that the cases of P equal to infinity and P different from infinity. And be different from infinity finite, are very much different. And here, my goal is to draw your attention to the connection between this problem, the problem of lattice isomorphism or lattice isometry between those two Banach lattices and the theory of certain non-linear maps between Banach spaces. So, hopefully, this may generate some interest in non-linear maps. Non-linear maps. So, first of all, the definition. So, by the way, here I'm going to talk about real Banach lattices and real free Banach lattices over Banach spaces. So, Pedro and his students have related results on complex lattices, but I'm not going to touch this topic. So, a Banach lattice, well, it's a Banach space with a certain norm. We have a partial order, which is consistent with additional multiplication. Consistent with addition and multiplication. It's a lattice, meaning that lattice separations are defined, and the norm is consistent with order. So we shall talk about various classes of maps here. So a lattice homomorphism is a map preserving lattice iterations. A lattice isomorphism is an inverteble lattice homomorphism and lattice isometry while it's Lattice isometry. Well, it's a lattice isomorphism. It's used actually in the linear isometry. We can talk about lattice embedding. So, what is a lattice embedding? It's a lattice homomorphism where the range is a sub-lattice, and then the operator is a lattice homomorphism isomorphism, or even lattice isometry in its range. And similarly, we define the Lattice quotient. So, a canonical example of a Leightsis isomorphism is a weighted composition on a C of K space. So, this is what it looks like. And it turns out that any lattice isomorphism on C of K is is a weighted composition. And we shall actually see that the that uh composition operators also appear in the context of free button lattices. The context of three banned lattices. So we also need the diffusion. So here I'm going to talk about 3P convex lattices. So instead of the class of P convex lattices, you can take a different class, for instance, lattices of the eye with an upper P estimate. This has also been done, but once again, this was done by... Well, this was done. This was done in mostly in other works, not in our memoirs. So, I'm only going to focus on the p-convex set. So, p-convexity means this kind of inequality. So, one convexity is, of course, automatic because constant one, this is a triangle inequality. Now, on the other extreme, you have infinity convex lattices, so C of k's and Lattices, so C of k is infinity convex plus constant one, obviously. And this is this turns out to be a canonical example because everything infinity convex is let's say isomorphic to a sub-lattice of C of k. Oops. And well, if you want your constant to be one, then you even isometrically be in a sub-lattice of C of K. Oops, I keep getting going in the wrong direction. So in the p-convex, In the p-convex settings, kind of the canonical example is LQ. LQ, LQ is P-convex, essentially if and only if Q is greater or equal than P. P-convex, it's a kind of passes downward, so if X is Q-convex, then it's also P-convex for smaller values of P. Values of P. And also here we have the definition of P convexity with constant C. Well, it turns out that if you have this convexity with constant C, you can enorm the lattice to get it u-convex in this last bullet point, this constant one. So having given this definition, I can get to the topic of 3P convex lenses. 3 convex lattices. So let's say, so here I'm talking about three lattices over Panach spaces. So let's say the Panach space, P is a number between 1 and infinity. A 3P convex Panach lattice on A or over A, well this is how it's going to be denoted, is the unique Banach lattice X. So then the following holds. So first of all, X has to be P convexpress control. X has to be P convex with constant one. Second, there exists the Banach space E is isometrically embedded into E, and the image of E generates X as a Banach lattice. And finally, the most important property is this, is this extension property. So let's say C is a p-convex lattice is a lattice which is p-convex with constant one. Then any linear operator Then any linear operator T from V to Z can extend to a linear operator T hat from the free P convex lattice back to Z with the same node. So extension is encoded by this equality here. Now in the definition, this Z has peak and vexity constant one. Now if you see if your peak convexity constant is merely C, then Merely C, then you can renorm the target lattice to make it deconvex with constant one. And in this situation, well, you discover that you still have an extension t hat, but now the norm is controlled by C times the norm of T. And well, I also want to mention. Well, uh I also want to mention specifically the case of P equal to one. So of course when P is equal to one then well as we know any banned lattice is one convex so this z here can be arbitrary and then we just talk about the free body classes. So for free bonate lattices again any operator from e to z will have this extension t. So well maybe let me maybe go back a little bit Well, maybe let me go back a little bit. So, here I'm given a definition, but a priori it's not clear that such a free band applys exists. So, it's clear, well, not totally clear, but by some diagram change and argument, you can see that if such a lattice exists, then it is unique. It is unique. Well, it turns out that this definition is not vacuous, so such binary lattices do exist. And let me briefly outline the functional representation of such a lattice. So we look at the space of positively homogeneous functions on the dual of this. So positively, this is what positive homogeneity means. And well, H, I guess, stands for homogeneous. So if we fix P, we denote by HP of star the set of those F in the H space for which there exists a constant C, so that whenever we have a finite sequence, xi star, with a P v. Xi star with the p-v norm not exceeding one, then the corresponding sum, then the corresponding strong p-norm of the values of f evaluated at those xi stars does not exceed c. And then we define so by the way, this is, I remind you, the definition of the p-v norm of a sequence. There are other ways of define it as well, and maybe I'll. Define it as well, and maybe I'll touch on those later in this talk. But here, the important thing is that we define the norm of the function f, the p-norm of the p-norm of the function f. So, this is not LP norm, this is this HP norm. Yes, the infimum of the C's as above. And well, you can embed E into well. E into, well, I should have, I guess, written hp here. So, how do you do this? You take an element x and you map it into a function which has historically been defined as delta x. So delta x is an evaluation function. So we evaluated at x star by taking this dual action of x star onto x. Of x turn on to x. And the theorem, well, I kind of give a reference here to our memoir, but it may have been known before. So it tells us that this map phi taken E into the homogeneous space here is actually an isometry. And further, if you look at the space, sorry, if you look at the lattice generated by the image of E in this HP, this is going to be precisely the free Banach lattice. And for future use, I want to say that, well, this function delta x, they are clearly big star continuous. Continuous, and if you look at the free Banach lattice, at the Free Banach lattice, it turns out that all the elements of this Free Banach lattice are also going to be weak star continuous. Well, here I wrote weak star continuous on the unit ball of a star, but actually they are going to be weak star continuous on all bounded sets in a star. And we should also recall that they are positively comedian. Also, recalls that they are positively homogeneous. So, I'm not going to prove this functional representation theorem. However, let me maybe briefly try to explain why indeed FBLP is the 3P convex binary classisis of me looks the way it does. So, here, well, yes, the node Yes, denote, so this capital B will be our standard notation for the closed union ball. And then we look at, we can view this, we can consider this ball as equipped with its relative big star topology. So you look at the space of continuous functions, and this, of course, contains E, and it turns out that in many cases, It turns out that in many in many uh situa in many set situations in one expresses, when we need to embed E into a sufficiently large space, this space of continuous functions on the unit ball of the dual is actually sufficiently large for our purposes. Well, and we want to look for this P3P convex bionic lattice. Well, in a sense, we want to look at it. Well, in a sense, we want to look for it inside of this set of continuous functions on the wall, except that we want to equip this with a different norm. So what is the defining property of FBLP? Well, any operator on E, from E, any operator from E into a P convex lattice. E into a peak and vex lattice C should extend to a free bandic lattice. Now, well, let me make a choke here. So any operator T from E to Z should extend an operator T hat here, and this is our function. So I can Our file. So I have put it here. I try not to block it too much. Now, what? Well, it turns out that we don't really need to worry about an arbitrary p-convex lattice C, because it turns out that any p-convex lattice C embeds into an L-infinity direct sum of LP spaces. And well, therefore, it suffices to worry only about the extensions of Extensions of operators from E into L P spaces. Vladimir, just for you, you can also somehow bound the cardinality of the L P spaces upon it. And here, maybe I should say, and then comes in a sense the cheating part, because we can discretize and only look at operators not into capital L P on some. not into capital L P on some measure, but what LPNs. So this is, I mean, it's basically, I'm saying it's cheating because it's not really trivial to go back from LPN store to general capital of P. And what are operators from E into the cell Pn? Well, we can represent each of those operators as a sequence of functions. As a sequence of functionals, say EI start, E limit the dual, and let's say our operator T has norm one. So in this situation, this is just the same as saying that this finite sequence CI star has norm one. Now I want to extend this operator. Come on. That's not what I want. That's not what I want. Oh, let's see. Uh maybe I should go back to full screen. Oh yes, here. So I want to extend this T to the Lysis homomorphism and to do this I actually need to extend those. I actually need to extend those EI stars to Latin's homomorphisms, and then, well, I put them all together. So, since I have kind of persuaded myself that I'm working with functions on the ball, then when you work with functions on the ball, then each EI star, well, you view it as an operator from E to R, it extends to lattice homomorphism EI star hat from the free banach lattice to R. From the Free Banner classes to R. And what will it be? It will be just the point evaluation at the point is Ti star. So then, what is our operator T-hat? As I said, I just want to put those extending linear functions together. So, this is just the sequence of the I-hats. Now, what can I say about... So let's say now I have a function f. So let's say now I have a function f in the free bandagaltis. So what can I say about its norm? Well, its norm is clearly at least is large. So remember that the norm of t was 1. Therefore the norm of t hat should also be 1. And therefore the norm of f in F B L P of A should be at least the norm of T hat F. Now what is the norm of T hat F? Well you Of t hat f? Well, you evaluate f at the i stars. So here you have a sequence here of n real numbers, and you find the norm of the sequence of real numbers in LPN. Well, this is what it's going to be. And it also turns out, and this is a trick which Marcel also used in his talk, that you can define the norm of. That you can define the norm of f as the supremum of all the quantities here. So, in a sense, you take all possible maps, in this case N to L Pn, and in some sense take the supremo, and this will give you the norm of the element F of the 3P convex Banach lattice. So, let me maybe give you some examples of. Let me maybe give you some examples of free Banach lattices, and let me start with something fairly pedestrian. So let's say E is one-dimensional. Well, it turns out that the Free Banach lattice then will be the space L infinity, L infinity two-dimensional. So how will this work? Well, I have to. First of all, what is the map phi? Well, I need to define the map phi only at one, so this takes So this takes the real number 1 into the vector 1 negative 1. And then if let's say we have a banded light with Z, we have an operator T from A to Z. Well, you would represent the image of 1 as the difference of its positive and negative parts, which are clearly disjoint. And then you You well, I guess there is a title here, there should be a plus, not a minus. So the image, so it's you hat of the pair AD is AZ plus plus DZ minus. So this minus should be a plus. And you see that this operator which we define like this to have is positive and disjoint. Had is positive and disjointness preserving, therefore, it's a lattice homomorphism. And if you actually trace what goes where, you'll see that this diagram is going to commute. Now, of course, if your dimension is higher than one, then the situation is more complicated. So, for instance, in particular, your three-pandemic Leitz is going to be infinite-dimensional. Infinite dimensional. However, it turns out that you can at least characterize explicitly the infinity free Banach classes. It turns out to be the space of big star continuous positively homogeneous functions on the unit wall of the dual. And the norm is the usual subnorm. In particular, it's going to be To be an ideal in the space of big star continuous, well, it's a cold space of big star continuous positively homogeneous functions. However, for finite P, FBLP needn't be an ideal in HP, and actually it needn't even be an ideal in the sublattice of HP, consisting of positively Sorry, well, they are positively homogeneous and weak star continuous functions. And this is an example due to Abu Las Rodriguez and Trudicette, where they constructed weak star continuous positive functions g and f so that f is well they're well they're both in HP and f is below well f is actually the F is actually the modulus of some element in the range of phi, but G is not in the corresponding free banner classes. So for finite P, the task of describing the Free Banach lattice is actually tougher. So let me maybe stop here. Next, I want to talk about Lyttis from. Lysis homomorphisms on three banana cytices. Before I do this, let's see: are there any questions at the moment? Okay, so on to homomorphisms. So here is a theorem established a few years ago by Niels Lausanne and Petr Tredacente. So let's suppose that we have a letter homomorphism from From a free binocletis on E to the free binocletis on F, then this is actually a weighted composition. So there exists a positively homogeneous nonlinear function phi from F star to E star, which is big star to big star continuous unbounded sets, so that this latest homomorphism, well, as I said, is represented by this uh way by this composition. By this compilation. And you can also see that this non-linear map is treating the norms reasonably well. And actually, you can say more. So, first of all, it's positively homogeneous. So, in the case of B equal to infinity, this is all we need to know. So if we have a map phi between the duals of those spaces, which is big star to big star continuous and bounded sets, then it determines the latest homomorphism T from one to the other. And well, actually, you can even say a few words about the norm of T. If, however, D is finite, T is finite, then we can extract some additional information about T, about phi rather, namely that it treats reasonably well the Q weak norms of sequences for Q greater or equal than P. And finally, if T is not just a Latin homomorphism, but the Latin isomorphism, then but the inverse the inverse operator T, but The inverse operator t, well, the operator t inverse is implemented by the inverse of this function phi. And well, just to remind you, this is the cubic norm we'll be working with. And let me also say, well, let me repeat this inequality involving the norms. Involving the norms. And further, if t is a lot, so the norm of phi t phi applied to y star is always bounded above by this. And if t is the lattice quotient, well, in this situation, t star, the adjoint operator, will be bounded below. And therefore, the mapping phi will be also bounded below in this fashion. Low in this fashion. So let me maybe again try to see how this works. So here I'm restating this theorem. So first of all, how can we construct this nonlinear map phi? Well, we look at the dual banning crisis and we look at its set of atoms. So it turns out that That the set of items exactly corresponds to the set of point evaluation operators. Now, T itself is a lightest homomorphism, and therefore its adjoint T star is interval preserver. So it maps atoms to atoms. So in particular, if you take y star in the dual of F star, then T star applies. then T star applied to this y star hat is also an atom which has denoted by phi y star. And then if you work a little bit further, you can establish big star continuity on bounded sets. So this establishes the first part of the theorem. Now for the second part, we should make an observation. We should make an observa so the for the second part, we should make an observation that for any sequence y star in F star, well the cubic norm of the sequence is equal to the cubic norm of the sequence by y i star cats. So y i star cats, these are now elements of the dual of the three band classes, which By the classes, which are just the evaluation functions. So, and the reasoning that we can use here is actually very similar to what we have seen a couple of slides before. So, we have a map, we fix those yi stars, we take a map t from f to lqn, which is determined by those yi stars. We take the extension operator, so for any function, any function extends like this. And so then the norm of t is exactly the cubic norm of the sequence. But on the other hand, this is equal to the norm of t hat, which is now the norm of the cubic norm of the sequence of y i hat. Sequence of y hats. And now if you look at, well, I guess here is also, there is also a typo hat should only cover yi star. So I take the sequence yi stars, I apply t star to it, and then this can increase the norm by no more than. The norm by no more than the norm of t. So, this, I'm trying to dwell on this because this is actually kind of an important tool at our disposal. Namely, if you have a lattice homomorphism between or a lattice homomorphism between two of your lattices, we can somehow extract some information about the noise. Extract some information about the norms of cubic, the cubic norms of finite sequences, and this is going to be important in the sequence. So this is our description, at least partial description, of lattice homomorphism between three lattices. And now let's ask ourselves when can When can two free bandic licenses be light sensation worth? So here we fix the value of T. Let's say, so first of all, let's say we have a light session, sorry, E and F are banned spaces, so T is an isomorphism from F to T. Then it canonically extends to a map T hat from between the three banded platforms. From between the three banded lattices. Well, so if indeed in general it's a lattice homomorphism, but if T is isomorphic, then so is T hat, and if T is isometric again, so is T hat, not T hat, but T bar, rather. So what does it mean? It means that if E and F, if Banach spaces E and F are isometric or isomorphic, then the same is true for the corresponding Banach lattices. And the question is: can we go the opposite direction? If two free banana lattices are isometric or if they are isomorphic, then can we conclude the same for the underlying banana spaces? And it turns out that, first of all, the setting of p equal to infinity is different from what we get for finite p, and also there is a And also, the isometric and isomorphic cases, they at least can be treated differently. So, the case of P equal to infinity, it turns out that there are plenty of free-banded lattices which are lattice isometric to each other. So, here I'm just repeating some of the facts that I mentioned before. So, the set of infinity free bonaclitices is the space. Lattices is this space of big star continuous positively homogeneous functions of the pole with a sup norm. And consequently, any sufficiently good non-linear map between the tools determines the latest isomorphism and if we can control of the norms like this. Sorry, any map phi determines the latest homomorphism and if we can control of the norm sufficiently. Control of the norm sufficiently well, then we get also a light sisomorphism. So it turns out that in many, many cases those three banach lyses are Lightsis isometric. And well, what are those cases? Let's begin by introducing the definition. So a Banach space E has a finite-dimensional decomposition, or FDT for short, if we have a sequence of finite random rejections. Finite and projections so that well they commute the product of each two is the one with the smaller index. And secondly, any element x of the Spanish space is approximate is the limit of Z projection. So from this, you conclude that the norms of the projections are uniformly bounded. So for instance, any shader basis gives rise to an FTT. gives rise to an FDT using just the basis projections. Another definition, an FDT is monotone if all those projections are contractive. So for instance the canonical basis in Little NLP's give us a monotone FTT. And the central theorem here is that if E is a Banach space with a monotone FTT, then the free Banach space is then the free bandach the infinity free bandic lattice on E is largely seismometric to, well, I wrote the free bandic lattice on non-C0, but the gist of this theorem is that as long as you look at Banach spaces with the monotone f dt, all the infinity free Banach lattices will be the same. And I'm not going to give you a complete proof. Going to give you a complete proof. Let me just give you a proof in the situation when the dual basis, well, the pi-orthogonal basis here is strictly monotone in the sense that, well, first of all, we have this monotonicity condition, and the equality happens if and only if this last coefficient is equal to zero. So, in other words, we have something with n terms, we add the non-zero n plus first term, and this strictly increases the It strictly increases the norm. So, our goal is to find, is to construct a positively homogeneous norm-preserving subjection phi from E star into little L1. So little of the role of little one here is just as a dual of C0 so that both phi and its inverse are big star continuous on bounded sets. So here we have well. Here we have, well, as I said, orthogonal functionals. fi star will be the will denote the canonical basis of little one. So then let Pn be the nth basis projection in E, and P n star will be the project the also projection on uh from a star to the span to the f span of the first bar of top uh first ten bar of topic. First n by octopus. And now we recursively construct the maps phi n from xn to yn. So yn is, as you may guess, the span of the first n elements of ital 1. So when n is equal to 1, then we just map alpha 1 e1 star to alpha 1 f1 star. And now let's suppose that Let's suppose that fn has already recursively, well, let's say fn minus 1 has already been defined, and let's try to define fn. So we need to define, we pick a generic element of x1, of xn. So what is it? We write it as alpha times en star plus some x star. So this x star. Some x star. So this x star comes from the n minus first subspace. And we define its image under fn as the image of x star plus some constant t times f n star. So this t is selected in such a way as to make phi n norm preserving. So we want the norm of e star to we want it to be equal to the norm of It to be equal to the norm of its image. And then we take phi as the point big star limit of phi n in a sense and then you have to check that this map phi has the desired properties. Now of course if you don't have strict monotonicity, you have to your c your construction will be more complicated because you More complicated because you will have to kind of adjust phi n on each step. You have to shrink it a little bit. And of course, the key question from my standpoint here is that whether the FTT assumption is necessary. So we are using it as an artificial support. But really, is there something special? Really, is there something special about Bannock spaces with the FTT? Or maybe the conclusion is true for all separable spaces. So if you look at if you look at we have explored a little bit the properties of this FBL. Of this FBL infinity of C0, which is actually FBL infinity for all bananas spaces with a monotone FDT. So I don't think those properties are particularly important. So I'll skip over them. So I also want to say that in the non-separable case, of course, if you have an empty, Of course, if you have an empty, your Banach space has to be separable. So, in the non-separable case, the situation is very different. It may happen that the infinity free Banach lattices for spaces E and F are very different. So, here is one of our results. So, let's say we have a set gamma of cardinality at least continuum. So, let's say E. So let's say E is we look at L one of gamma and L P of gamma for P between one and infinity. Then it turns out that well from certain topological considerations you can show that the pole of a star equipped with its big star topology is not homeomorphic in the topological sense to the pole of F star. And from this you can conclude. And from this you can conclude that the corresponding three bandic lattices are also not lattice isomorphic. So this is what we have for the case of P equal to infinity. Now when P is infinite, the situation is different because now we have also, in addition, we have more restrictions on the map. On the map phi, namely on the map phi, namely we have this last sentence involving the treatment of cubic norms for Q greater or equal than P. And well, it actually turns out that there is an obstacle here because it may happen that you have a map phi which. That you have a map phi which does satisfy all those properties we require, but still it does not implement, but still the corresponding weighted composition does not implement the lattice homomorphism. So still this information about the behavior of the weak norms to some extent restricts To some extent, restricts our possibilities, our options. And this allows us to show that certain p-convex free banned lattices for p-less and for p-finite are different from each other. So once again, the results are kind of technical, and I'm going to scroll over them. Let me just quote a few of them. So, for instance, so let's say we have two numbers, alpha and beta. Let's say beta is between one and two, and alpha is strictly greater than beta, then in this situation, the free banach lattice on L beta is not even a lattice quotient of the free banana lattice on LR. So, this, so, so we know that in This so so we know that in this for such values of alpha and beta, L beta is not a quotient of L alpha. Let me know this well knows beta is between one and a half, and alpha is greater than beta. I said before. So in this situation, L beta is not a quotient of L alpha. Now this results. Now, this result does something more. This results that tells us that the three banana lattices are not lightest quotients of each other, and well, one is not lattice quotient of the other, and in particular, they cannot be lattice isomatic. So, there are more kind of well, another, well, come on, in other fairly ah, in other fairly technology. And as a fairly technical result, I want to state here. So let's say we have two spaces, E. Let's say E is an L U sum of finite dimensional spaces, and F star contains a copy of L V prime, where there is a certain dependence on U and V, then again one of those spaces is not Elias quotient of the other. The other. So, this leaves us with a few questions. So, the first one is that can we have a situation when the free binocletices are isomorphic, when the free binoclytices of E and F are isomorphic, but E and F itself are not isomorphic. So, this is an open question. Of course, we will be happy, or at least I will. We will be happy, or at least I will be happy if somebody solves it. Another question is maybe more general. So let's say we have two free banded lattices which are lattice isomorphic. Which properties do the underlying spaces E and F have to share? And in this situation, we have an answer with a typos, so this is, if you suppose, not so. So, this is if you suppose, not suppose, suppose FBLE is let's say metric to FBLF, then if E contains a complemented copy of little L1, then so does F. And if E contains L1 and complementably uniformly, then again so does F. And the proof is in. Is the proof is indirect because so what we do, we have to relate the properties of E to the properties of the corresponding bannock lattice, and then if the two we establish some kind of correspondence between those properties, and well, if the banner clattices are lettuce isometric, then well, they have to share those properties, and the underlying spaces E and F have Spaces E and F have to share whatever properties we are describing. So, this is all I wanted to say about Leightis isomorphism, for Leightzis isomorphisms for finite P. Now, what about Lexus isometries? In this situation, it turns out we can say more. And we can say more because somehow, somehow, in the isometric case, we For in the isometric case, it's more restrictive. So let's introduce what we call some definitions. So a Banach space Z is called smooth if for any non-zero element of it, the norming functional is unique. And so what it means, geometrically, what is non-smooth? A non-smoose A non-smooth batter classes would have a coordinate like this. Because in this situation, you can draw different hyperplanes and they correspond to different Norman functions. So smooth meaning that you have no corners. So here is the theorem that we managed to prove. So let's say P is finite, E and Fanny spaces, so that. So that either both duals are smooth, and if actually both spaces are reflexive, then we can relax this condition slightly and only assume that one of them is smooth. So in this situation, the 3P convex binary lattices, although they are isometric, are lattice isometric if and only if the spaces themselves are isometric. Spaces themselves are isometric. So the idea of the proof is, well, something that I already stated before. So let's say we have a finite sequence, then its p-weak norm is the same as the p-weak norm of the sequence of corresponding evaluation functionals. And well, this is something that we have access to. And we We have to use the information that lattice isometries preserve those coincidences. And how do we use this information? Well, let's say we have an element x of a banana space z. We shall denote by f of x the set of its supporting functionals. So these are the elements of this star, so that somehow They, in a sense, satisfy the Kanban theorem or witness the veracity of the Kant-Banach theorem. So now, a lemma that is crucial for us is the following. So let's say x and y are two elements of the sphere of z. Let's say p is again finite. So for y, let's look at the element y. Sorry, let's look at the element x rather. We look at the space or the set rather of its support functionals and then we evaluate the parameter kappa. So what do we do? We take the support functional of x, we test it on y, and we take the supremum. Uh so then it turns out that we can evaluate the asymptotic behaviour of this norm of the pair x t y. Of the pair x ty. Well, it turns out that this is what we are going to get. And from this, we can show that if star and f star are smooth, then lattice isometries between the three lattices are implemented by isometries between the Banach spaces themselves. So here is So here is a reminder. So, first of all, what does it mean that in general that the space is smooth? So, if the space is smooth, it means if the space Z is smooth, it means that for any element the supporting functional is unique. And so for x, we call the corresponding supporting functional f sub x. And this permits us to define the so-called semi-inner product. semi-inner product. The semi-inner product of y and x is just the action of the supporting functional attacks, of the unique supporting functional attacks, and we act with it on y. So this semi-inner product has many similar properties, has the same properties as the usual inner product, except of course it's not going to be additive in the second variable, because of course you vary x. Variable because, of course, you vary x, you have no control over how the supporting function changes. So we look at the semi-inner products of the only star and x star. And now, let's say x star and y star are elements of the duals. Say x star and y star belong to the sphere, to the unit sphere of f star. Then What can we say about the p weak norm of this pair x star T Y star? Well, this is the asymptotic behavior as T approaches zero. And well, you see that in this asymptotic behavior, the modulus of the semi-inner product appears. And well, these p-wig norms. These p-weak norms of pairs are preserved by the action of phi. So now let's suppose that T is a lattice homomorphism. We look at the corresponding phi, and we see that this phi preserves the summa inner product. And then it turns out that we have an information about the Information about the structure of maps which preserve the semi-interproducts. So, this is the theorem of Ilisevich and Turcek, which tells us that in this situation, this map phi is a composition of a map sigma, which just take assigns either positive or negative one to any element of list of f star. And then we have a linear isometry. A linear isometry V so that well phi is implemented in this manner. And then we have to show that sigma is actually constant, either positive or negative one everywhere. And then V is actually big star continuous map, so we call it U star, and then this will be our U here. So I'm pretty much running out of time, so let me briefly mention. Of time, so let me briefly mention a few other results related to lattice isometries. So, another helpful notion we came up with is the notion of the L1 point of a banana lattice. So, what it means? It means that for any x is an L1 point, if for any y, the maximum of x plus y and x minus y is equal to the sum of the norms of x and y. So, by the way, this. Of x and y. So by the way, this maximum here is nothing but the one weak norm of the pair xy. And you can say a little bit more, so you can prove that x is a null one point if and only for any y. We have this equality for the p-wign. And from this, we immediately obtain the tennelite seismometry. Any lighter seismometry acts as a bijection between, well, for any lighter seismometry, the corresponding map in phi acts as a bijection between the corresponding L1 points. So in general, L1 points may not be easy, may not be very straightforward to find, but for AM spaces, for AM spaces, they are because for AM spaces, The L1 points on the dual are just point evaluations. So in this situation, we can say that if P is finite, then D and F are R spaces, then the corresponding P-convex lattices are lattice isometric if and only if it's. Isometric if and only if we have E and F themselves. E and F themselves are isometric. So, and another thing that we can observe in a similar fashion, that lattice isometries between three, if E and F are banned spaces such that the 3P convex lattices are lattice isometric, then one, then the dual of E. One, then the dual of E is strictly convex is if and only if the dual of f star is strictly convex. So here maybe I should also draw a picture. So what it means that a banana space C is strictly convex, it means that if you take two points on the unit sphere, then the interval connecting those two points will lie entirely inside of the union ball. You cannot have things like this, where you have. Things like this, where you have some kind of a segment on the surface of the unit hole. So, what the moral of the story is that for lightest isometries, we can say more than for lightest isomorphism. And this is pretty much all I wanted to say. And here, I can say that I'll be happy to answer your question, or hopefully, I will be able to answer your questions. Anyway, Mice? I guess it's a very general one over there. Is there any hope? Is there any hope of ever being able to recognize the free band of the binoculars? Whether you can recognize free binocular lattices in the Bionic litices in the class of all banacc litices? Well, there are some properties which free binoclytices possess. So for instance, there are points in the free banner clattices are separated. Lattices are separated by lattice homomorphisms because lattice homomorphisms are point evaluations, so there are many of them. So, for instance, a free banac lattice cannot contain little LP or whatever, or sorry, not little LP, capital L P is a sub lattice. In the non-separable case, it also happens that the free bonac lattice cannot Cannot have an uncountable sequence of these joint elements. So, this already helps us to rule out certain things. Beyond this, I don't know how to rule out even whether some object is not a free banana flatten. I'm sure there are some other properties, but I mean, returning to I uh returning to a question, I don't know how to rule out how to determine whether this is a free bone aclysis and this is a non-current something very ambitious question. But see, among the C-style algebra, you can recognize the co-normal algebrais, those that prefer be global. But similar to what somehow you said, you know, that you have a lot of lattice homomorphisms, which misorder continuous functions. Well, no, I don't know if it's. That's a public case. No, I don't know if it's a criterion, but that sounds similar somehow. Well, it may be similar, but I should warn you that free banana clattices are not going to be order continuous. Because lattice homomorphisms. Lattice controls. It's separated by lattice homomorphisms. Lattice. Yeah, yeah, they separate points. Yes. So, this means that they are order continuous functionals. Yes. Which means they are like the order functionals that you have in the predeval of a polynomial algebra. Well, this is well I mean you're going somewhere in parallel somehow. Well, they are normal in the sense that I guess they are they are right. Yeah, yeah. Right. I'm not sure I'm not sure whether I'm not sure how much information this will give us. I'm not saying, no, no, of course not. Okay, more questions? So, I'm going to go ahead and do that.  The details are not the right way to get the
