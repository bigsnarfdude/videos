Yeah, so I'm going to talk about something not directly related to hypercalor varieties. Let's start with a smooth projective variety and defined over an algebraically closed field. Then we have this cogno filtration. Okay. And also. And also, let's fix some coefficients. For example, so the L or B Z L or maybe Z and Q or Q L. I mean, you know, if this is over the complex numbers, then you can consider singular cohomology with Z or Q coefficients. And in general, you can consider eta cohomology with the other coefficients. So, I'm going to ignore this coefficient in my notations, but somehow here you can define the cognomo filtration on this cohomology, either eta or maybe singular. This is the sum of all the image of lower star h. This is the sum of all the kernels of H K of X, and you restrict to some open subset in here. U is open. open and then the complement z has codimension greater or equal to c okay so this is the conival filtration i mean the definition makes sense for any of these coefficients and of course traditionally this is first introduced by gorotendic And the most important case is probably, I mean, for complex varieties, and you consider the rational coefficients, and this has a relation to Hautic vector, sorry, generalized Hauscon vector. And then, if you use a little bit of duality, then you see that this is If I access dimension d, then this is the same as h2d minus k. And then I can consider the well, this is using a little bit of duality, this is the same as the sum of all the inmates from three at lower star of h 2d minus k of y. y to h2d minus k x and then h k of x so essentially i mean you just use this z here to be the y okay um then i think the story is um grotendic actually claimed that this is That there's another definition, tilde C of HK. Now, this is the same. I'm going to use this in H of C from H 2D minus K of Y. So M H 2 D minus K of X. 2d minus k of x. But here, on y to be smooth and projected. So there, I don't have any restriction for y question. Yeah, but I think you can use hyperplanes to cut. But yes, yeah. Go to okay. What's the minus E minus K? That's okay. Okay, on the flatboard, this is probably some function. Let's see. Some function involving D, K, and C, but I think you can use Lexus hyperplanet because it's trajectory. So, I mean, everybody Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, okay, that's a good point, right? Okay, here, okay. Now, yeah, again, so essentially codimension, so the dimension of y should be less or equal to d minus c, right? And here, this is the same thing. Yes. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yes, um, yeah. Okay, so let's call this a strong conneval filtration. Yeah, so the story is I read. Yeah, so the story is I read this in the introduction of a paper. So Gurotende had this expose on Brauer groups. And then in that, in one of these expose, he exclaimed that, so these were the same for any coefficient. But then later, so he had this more famous paper about the generalized halt conjecture. Then he retracted that statement. Okay. So later, the theorem of the linear shows that if this is Q or maybe QL, then this strong filtration is the same as the strong cognival filtration is the same as the cognival filtration. The conival filtration. So, this is essentially uses the theorem of weights. And also, for complex varieties, you have this mixed hot structure, but then there's still a question of other coefficients. And then in recent years, there has been some interest in understanding this question for this basically integral coefficients. I think in general, this sort of sits into a larger framework of understanding somehow topological restrictions for algebraic varieties. Sort of like integral halter conjecture. Of course, we know this is not true. It's hard conjecture. It's not true with integer coefficients. But somehow you have, in order to prove this is not true, you have to keep with this topological restriction. Keep with topological restrictions for like sub-varieties, and then you also have to construct examples of varieties which actually shows that this restriction is not empty. So that's, I think that's somehow the interesting part of this problem. And of course, let me state the theorem. This is Benoit. Um, so for any c that's greater or equal to one, and any k greater or equal to two c plus one. So there is an example, and this first depends on the summary you choose the smooth projectors or the complex numbers so that. So that this N C of H K X strictly contains this with integer coefficient and moreover so this dimension of X well in general Well, in general, it's for general C and K, I guess they construct examples of really large dimension. So, somehow for smaller C and K, so it can be as small as four. And of course, for surfaces, there's not so much to see, and you can see that's true. So, that's basically this. That's basically this theorem leaves the case of threefolds open. And also, if c is greater or equal to two, then x can be rational. And also, they can also construct examples with torsion torsion. Dispersion canonical bundle. So this is their theorem. And in some sense, it answers this question in a very general context. And as we would expect. Somehow, another interest for this question is that when C is one, then you consider the quotient of HK. Okay. So this is also a stable birational environment. And also for E minus one, but here I think essentially we only have one thing. This same index. I mean, you can see this. Well, over the complex numbers, you can use blow-up. It's a weak factorization. So, you know, there are some interests in recent years to construct this, to prove some varieties are, some rationally connected varieties are not rational by producing examples with non-trivial stable vibrational environment and use specialization argument of Woozong and such. So, of course, it's interesting to know if you can construct examples of rationally connected varieties. Connected varieties so rationally connected. I mean, I'm going to abbreviate this as RC, in particular for these cases, because this, so this is not covered by that zero. So then the second theorem of Waza. Now again, it's most productive. over the complex numbers and we can see the integer coefficient okay first thing is um so she def she actually i mean in her work she actually defined several different kinds of filtrations in addition to this cognivo filtration and strong cognivo filtration so this is one of them and i think i'm gonna explain later what this means but here Later, what this means, but here, let's just write it like this h3 of x the same as x module torsion. And here I'm using sort of the in the homologic connotation. So NCHK is the same as. H k is the same as N D minus C H 2 D minus K. And somehow later you'll see it's easier to use homology in this case. Assuming some conditions about the About the worker album copying by, I mean essentially, it's ejective on torsions, and this condition is actually true dimension three, and also for rational. And also for rationally connected varieties. So in dimension three is the result of block, and this is for rationally connected varieties, this is true due to Sudoki. So bear with me. So I will explain what this means a little later. And then the second thing is if X is rationally connected. I mean, as I said, for rational connection, you don't have to worry about this condition anymore. And then you can actually show that and one of h minus three modular torsion the same as n tilde one of h two d minus three. No, I have D minus three here. Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I think it's T minus one, right? Okay. Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay, yes. Minus, yes, okay. Okay, yeah. Okay, so this is our theorem, and I have to explain some of the conival type filtrations she introduced. First of all, let's see. Let's see. So this is the sum of star of h okay, I guess here I can actually use R H K of Y. Y 2 H A plus 2 R X So here the summation is over all the family of cycles y cross X is a family of R cycles over Y. This is in X. I mean, that is the Okay, I mean, then this is the correspondence, and then I can have this tilde HK. So this is essentially the same thing, but here I asked that why should be smooth and projective. And you can see essentially you put a tilde on these things. You put a tilde on these things, and then you require something that's smooth, maybe also projected. And I also have this R semi-stable. So this N semi-stable. Again, it's very similar to that, except now I require that this gamma to y is semi-stable. It's semi-stable family semi-stable family and uh should make this into a semi-stable family actually you know before this is a sub ori maybe like a sub-scheme or something but here you only have a morphism okay again you can define similar like using the schema Define similar like using this gamma to define this morphism. Okay. And now, so the first thing is saying that, well, you cannot really directly compare this cogno filtration and a strong cogno filtration. But first, you can actually pass to this semi-stable one. And then somehow, I guess, Rodan's idea is to compare. Guess Rodan's idea is to compare this different filtrations and somehow some of them are actually the same. So, this is lemma to Waza. And also, so Waza basically did the integer coefficient case. And for ZL, this is proved in a paper by Scaria and Suluki. And the salutey. So essentially, let's see. So H so this C2C plus one. So this strong conival filtration is the same as okay and E minus C plus C. Let's see T minus two plus two H2D minus two C minus okay so the thing is um so this is the same so this strong condivalo filtration So, this strong connival filtration is the same as giving a family of cycles. And you can see, so this comes from a smooth projected variety Y. And then essentially, you have a family of divisors in that smooth projected variety that's parametrized by the Picar variety. And then essentially, here, what you have is like the H1 of your variety. And then, you know, so this H1 is you can find this H1 in the P car variety. And then again, you take. Car variety, and then again you take some hyperference sections, etc. So, somehow you can relate these two. Okay. Here. So, now if you compare the last lemma, and here you see this is exactly in that range, right? This is the C until the untilder C and 2C plus one. So that's somehow how you relate all these kinds of different kinds of connival filtrations or this connival type filtration. I will write it here. So then was I also asked this question on These nutritions nutritians agree with each other connected. Okay. I mean, you see, you have different kinds of filtrations on that board. And also with cognition and strong cognum filtrations, some of them have inclusion relations. Inclusion relations. Some of it are not directly comparable. But somehow, I guess the expectation is that in this case, they might just all be the same. And it's even better, they might actually be the same as HK of X. And later, I think you'll see the. I think you'll see you can even somehow weaker this condition is probably still true with all these questions. Okay. I'll get to that in a moment. So my interest in this is, well, first, I think this is already a very interesting question, but there is actually some arithmetic applications if you know a positive answer to that question. So, suppose, I mean, that's quite some work that makes sense over any algebraic closed field. H uh upper three or yes, I think yes, is it cohomology, yes. Okay, yes, okay, yes, yes, you are right. Yes, so this. Right. Yes, so this, okay, so this is very, because I, okay, let me write it here. Yes, so maybe the particular question you can ask is this one. For HK. So is this, okay, so I have strong cognomos. Is this the same as H1? So I call HK. And is this And is this the same as HK? Okay. I think that in that case, it's not in. Okay, if you formulate in that question, okay, it's not very, it's a, I guess that's a counterexample. But for this, if you could only consider like finding one cycles, their examples are not counterexample to the equality. Okay. Yeah, I'm particularly interested in this one because if you know this for K is Ft bar, actually you know that these two are the same, then again, you know, this is basically the in that paper scalvius. So they show that you can somehow produce some algebraic cycles, some Taushen algebraic cycles over So essentially, one algebraic, this is x over maybe some finite field, and this is subjects onto h1 of all I need is k equals 3. This is h2d minus 3. You somehow have some integral tape conjecture for one cycle. For one cycle. And this is important for other applications like local global principles over global function field. But somehow, this is a little bit different from the main line of this talk. So I'll just start here. Anyway, I guess so this is the main question I would like to study. And of course, you see there are two question marks. Question marks. So maybe you can divide this into two parts. The first one is whether these two are the same, and the second is whether these two are the same. And now my feeling is that the first part is mostly geometric theory. So there are some geometric part of the first question mark. And the second thing is somehow motivic. It probably has a different nature. Okay. How do I want to approach this question? Well, the first thing is to notice that there are some commutative diagrams. So let's have this. Again, X, it could be any projective variety. And let me. Okay, then let me define this z1x so as a functor from maybe smooth varieties or k to abelian groups and here for any u we'll just map this to okay yes i can consider our cycles here x comes u over u okay comes u over u okay so by this i just mean that the group of r cycles of x over u parametrized by u okay yes yeah yes i'll i'll get to that yeah okay Okay, so this is a well here. If you define this properly, then this is a functor. Okay. Then, so by the abstract nonsense, you know that this functor z r of x, so it's a co-limit of all the representable functions u. This is the UNIDA. You need a functor associated to a smooth variety. I mean, it's just abstract nonsense. And now, somehow, of course, this functor won't be representable in any suitable sense. And it can't be represented by some scheme or whatever. But you can actually give a topological space structure, more precisely, a topological group structure for this thing. The idea is simple since this Zr of X, well, this is the collimate. If you arrive at the definition over there, this is essentially over all the U. Essentially, over all the new and gamma new at the side, more precisely, maybe at the set. And of course, this one has a natural topology, at least over the complex numbers, right? Over the complex numbers, this has a natural topology. And you just declare that you take this as a diagnostic. You take this as a definition. So you get this is a topological space, and it's actually a topological group. And then now, whenever I have some variety u, I have h k here is just like lower star to h. 2h k plus 2r of x. So this gamma gamma u as a correspondence induces a morphism going this way. Actually, there's a factorization. So here it might look a little bit surprising to the homotopy group of this thing. And then here I have. And then here I have some morphism phi going this way. So there's a commutative diagram going this way. And here, what you need is a down double isomorphism with a symmetric product. So, this is an isomorphism. So, you have a large commutative diagram going this way. And then let me also call this fine. So, you can construct a morphism going this way. So, here to do this, you essentially need the work of Lawson on afraid. On afraid longer. You combine the work of these people and also some different combinations of these people together, you get a morphism going this way. Okay. So this one is now called Lawson Homology to honor. To honor the contribution of Lawson. And we also know there's another filtration here, and this is actually contained in HR cycle. Our cycle that this is contained in part of the contained in this conivo filtration, at least if I get the index correct. And this is probably our oh, yeah, our constant one basically maybe there's a D minus or plus minus one, something like this. I mean, the thing is. Something like this. I mean, the thing is, if r is one, then you should end up with t minus two here. Anyway, so the index, if you mesh everything together, is like this. Okay, so now if you look at that question, so obviously the first thing is so here you have this huge group. Usually this is I mean, okay, so yeah, there are several reasons to consider a homotopy group. First, so this is a topological group, so it has a homotopy type of products of K type N. And then first, I mean, from this homotopy point of view, these homotopy groups are more fundamental. And also, when you consider this homotopy group, it has a direct relation. Group, it has a direct relation to higher chau groups. I mean, some sense of the higher chau group is also homo like the algebraic homotopy group of this space. And here, I mean, this as a direct analog, I mean, I think it's better to consider homotopy groups here. Okay. So, the next question you can somehow ask if this is the same as L1 of HK, and if this is the same as somehow n hilda something of HK. Q does something of HK, and then it's the same as HK. Okay, so there are further restrictions. Okay, and now I can tell you the main theorem I'm going to discuss. And one UDA recalls for H3. So this is the same as here. Sorry, this is not. I should look at the image of the smile image. Stay density in major two h3. And in this case, this is actually better. So we know this is the same as and e minus 2 h3 or maybe 2d minus 3. So here, again, this is essentially So here, again, is essentially the work of Lawson Freedlander. I mean, they computed this Lawson homology for divisors. And then it follows from their work that the image of this thing is actually the same as this. It's precisely this conival filtration. And of course, so now you see that on case three, I have equalities up. Up to this point, up to this point, that somehow, I mean, I believe this here you also have the equality, but I don't know how to do that. That's essentially, you need to show that the image of this Lausanne homology, some kind of a motivative environment, is the same as H3. Okay. And in particular, oh, okay. Here, this is a rationally connected, or maybe a rationally connected vibration over a curve. And there are some exotic examples in each positive characteristic. Let's ignore that. Just, for example, over the complex numbers. And in general, you can also say a little bit about smooth projective varieties. This is for this one. Now, if x is just smooth projective over the complex numbers, then remember we introduce this semi-stable scene. Semi-stable C or H3. So this also the same as this N D minus two H2D minus three. I mean, so essentially you can allow torsion in this part. You don't have to without results, you have to model the torsion part. And here, well, that's included. Included. Okay. Any questions? Okay, yeah. So this is a very good idea. This is an infinite symmetric product. You have finite symmetric product, and then you take some collimate. Okay, so in fact, there's a more general question you can ask. So, okay, I just read, you know, this z1x. Well, this is the co-limit of Of y smooth and projective. You can also add projective here of y complex numbers. Now, with all I said, and especially with this cumulative diagram here, I just erased. So the question you can ask is, first, is this a pi r of z1x? Is this the same as the colon? It is the same as the co-limit. Again, it's the same co-limit, but now we have h k of i k of y. And similarly, you can ask HR. In other words, do you have a commutative? So, this is a co-limit, right? And then you can ask whether you. And then you can ask whether somehow this homotopy groups, or maybe I only use the homology. You can ask whether it commutes with this taking co-limit. And of course, in general, you have a co-limit of topological spaces. Somehow, this co-limit, the homotopy group, or maybe all. Homotopy group or the homology is not the co-limit of a homotopy group or homology of each of these things. So then the second question you can ask is, is this co-limit over y sort of a weakly equivalent to the homotopy co limit? That's why. In other words, whether they have the same homotopy, They have the same homotopy group or not. Of course, this would imply things like this. Okay, and so somehow the main technical theorem gives you some indication in favor of this question. Now let me explain this. Basically, I'm going to restrict to the complex number field case because for positive characteristic case, so it's a little more subtle. There's something more going into this. Something more going into this, as you can see from this. Actually, so the whole thing, this loss of homology can be defined over any algebraic closed field, but somehow impositive characteristic or over any field that is not a complex number, the definition is very complicated. It's not as simple as this one. So, for the complex numbers, okay. Yes, that's a good question. This is definitely not a filtered co-limit. If it is, then you automatically know this is the same as the, that is weakly equivalent to the homotopy co-limit. Exactly. So the Lennon theorem is somehow you want to understand how far this is away from being filtered co limit. Let's again see. Let's again say a loop, or maybe an algebraic loop, a loop is a space, let's say W. Is some okay, so this is W. Well, later, this W could be the topological space. It doesn't have to be a variety, it's something like a morphism. Something like a morphism going this way. Now, this is like a variety, or maybe spin. Of course, you can see it doesn't have to be irreducible. And then I should have two sub-varieties. If I call this L, this is L time and L1. So there are sub-varieties and the requirement. varieties and the requirement is that as are not as i want you know set theoretically i mean if this is like an interval this is really like a loop inside of this space but somehow here you want to in some sense approximate a topological loop by some variety Variety at least if you allow this variety to be reducible. Okay, now the key geometric input comes from some joint work with the Janus Kohler geometric good. Is it a serum it says that if I have a loop from L to Z one of X so given this So, given this, now I claim that there is F tilde from L tilde to maybe stable maps bar across itself. Again, this is a loop. And now there's a natural map here. Map here. This is a modularized space of stable maps. So basically it parametrizes stable families of genus G curves and also with a morphism to X. And now I can take the difference of these fundamental classes alpha minus beta. So it gives this essentially I take the image and that gives me a cycle. So I have a morphism going this way and then I can compose. And then I can compose this. Now, the conclusion is that the image of F tilde is the same as the image of F. That's the setup that you get this. Okay, so this is the key geometric input. I want to explain, you know, in some detail what this actually means. In some detail, what this actually means. And here you only need to assume. So for this, for this one, so you only need to assume x is smooth and projected. And over any algebraic closed field, as long as you can make sense of this z1x. So a loop, I mean, let's look at a simple example, just a curve. It's called this V. So map to Z1 of X, well, it's basically saying that you have a family of cycles parametrized by V. And to say this is a loop means that I have two points, let's say B1. means that I have two points, let's say B1, B2. They are mapped to the same point. So the fiber, let me call this gamma over B is contained in VX. So that's gamma. Okay, gamma one is the same as gamma two, but only as a cycle. Only as a cycle. In fact, I mean, this gamma, so it's a sub-scheme. Now, this so it's a sub-scheme of this, but the fiber could be very complicated. In particular, and this is the most difficult case, is that they could have non-reduced fibers. And they can even have embedded points in this. So the scheme, so the point is that the gamma B1, in general, is not the same as gamma P2, B2 as sub-schemes. This sort of answers the question. So, this, you know, this co-limit cannot be a filtered co-limit, essentially, because, so here you have the same, somehow the same cycle. I mean, even here, this is already a closed sub-scheme. This is like a family of effective cycles. But somehow the fibers at the sub-scheme, they're different. Okay, they're different. Now, what is the loop in this moduli space of stable maps? Well, it's again, this is B prime. And now I have maybe two X. I have C one and C two. This kind of sigma. Now this sigma one. Sigma one here I have F and F restricted to sigma one. This is actually the same or maybe isomorphic to sigma two and f restricted to sigma two. So then you see this is the difference between a stable map and the cycle. The two cycles are the same. I mean somehow the scheme structure could be very different. But to say that two stable maps are the same. Maps are the same. I mean, they're actually the same. The curves, the domains are the same, the morphisms are the same. That's somehow the content of you can lift this loop into another loop. And also they have the same image. So essentially, what's happening here is that I have L. Then this, for example, in this case, this is V. Is V and I have sigma here, and then I have a tilde, and then I can gamma tilde. Basically, I perform a semi-stable reduction. So now I get a family of semi-stable curves, but already you'll see that the fibers. The fibers, they could be very different stable maps, even if they correspond to the same cycle. And then this loop L tilde is essentially, I find another curve. Let me call this V1 tilde. So this is my curve B, and it has also some size. And it has to do some semi-stable reduction if you get a family of cycles. So the cycle of these two fi the cycle class of these two fibers are the same, but at the stable map, they are different. So somehow I find a different curve, B tilde prime. This is B tilde that connects these two. This is again a new family of stable maps. And if you look at that condition saying that they have the same image, you'll see that. same image, you see that the fiber, all the cycles, all the cycles over prime, they are the same. This is a constant. So this is the context of this theorem. Yes, but only for one cycle. Yes, but only for one cycle. Yeah. Okay. Now, if you think of in terms of topology, basically, you know, the image of this, so you have an interval and zero is mapped to this point, and one is mapped to this point. So that gives you a cycle. It gives you a loop inside of this topological group. But somehow, when you pass to this some mistake. Semi-stable family, you separate them. And then that theorem says that that's okay. You can add another curve that deforms from one stable map to the other. But somehow this curve, because it has constant cycle, so the image inside of this topological group is actually the same. Sorry, it's a point. So then you can, you know, before you have a loop like this, now you take this sort of a larger loop. So somehow then the image is the same. Somehow, then the inner is the same. And with a little bit more work, this shows the part about you can actually represent any class in the Slausen homology by a family of by a semi-stable family or some variety, or maybe a scheme. Okay. So this is the first part. And we have four minutes. We have four minutes. Any questions? Now the next thing is, so here I only have this loop. Now it turns out that if x is furthermore rationally connected, or maybe a rationally connected vibration. Vibration over a curve. I can map this to we call this U. I can actually embed this into U, and U is the most projected together with the morphism of this. And so the composition still contains this, you know, here again, you have a cumulative diagram going this way. Okay, and if you use this, then you'll see with a little bit more argument, you prove that for rationally connected varieties, all these different filtrations, they're actually the same. Because essentially, you know, you start with something coming from this loop, and then you know that you can lift this to this altitude, but somehow you have this factorization. So somehow this image actually comes from this. Somehow, this image actually comes from this u and um now how is this related to the question about whether it's the filtered co-limit or something? So, to have a filtered co-limit, well, you have two conditions. The first thing is you have two things you can embed them into a larger thing. This is the first condition, and the second condition is. And the second condition is: if you have two different embeddings, then somehow you should be able to find an even larger one to become the same. Then you get this filtered collimit. Now, what this theorem, well, so this part is easy. This part actually works for any dimensional cycles in any variety, not even smooth projective. Not even smooth projective. And the second part: well, you see, this would definitely fail because of that example, that situation over there. But somehow, this theorem says that, okay, you may have two different embeddings, but somehow they're at least homotopy equivalent. You can move them from one to the other. I mean, if you somehow, if you want to say this is the weakly equivalent to the homotopy. weekly equivalent to the homotopy co-limit. Something you should prove is that for all different homotopies, they're like contractible. Whenever I have different homotopies, you can always fill in by a larger homotopy, etc. So this, I mean, so this geometric part really said, essentially says that you have a homotopy, but then somehow, you know, what you need is you can always fill in different homotopies between homotopies, etc. Okay, I think maybe my time is. Yeah, I think I'll stop here. Okay, yes, thanks for the question. I think that's another thing come out of. Another thing comes out of the joint work with Kolar. So essentially, you know, so this L tilde could be something very bad, like this. And then you have a family of stable maps. So the idea is that you add a family of curves to this family. To this family. So that you have singularities on the space. Maybe I can speak. So the fiber over this singular point, you want this to be unobstructed, unobstructed. Okay. Then you have this whole modularized space, MG5, and maps to this. I mean, this is unobstructed. Unobstructed. So its image inside of this would be a smooth point. So in particular, there's only one unique irreducible component containing this point. Then, I mean, so these two irreducible components have to lie in the same irreducible component. Okay, so this would imply that the image here lies in some irreducible component. So, even if this is quite singular, then of course we can somehow desingularize this part, this component, up to making a further base change, et cetera. Now, the key, I mean, so the key observation from our work, from this joint work with Kohlar, is that, well, you can always do this as long as X satisfies this condition. I mean, you know, to make I mean, you know, to make a single curve unobstructed, this is the standard operation. It has been known since Maury, I guess. But somehow the point is you have to do this over a family. The difficult point is, so you have a family. If you know one fiber is unobstructed, of course, on a neighborhood, this is unobstructed. But somehow here, you want Here you want essentially every fiber to be unobstructed. So that requires some construction of this curve. You can't take any curve. Like for rational recognition, right, usually for a single curve, you can use very free curves. But in this case, you can't use them because of this condition. It's an open condition, but not a closed condition. And somehow we prove that in these conditions, there's always lots of nice families. There are lots of nice families of curves which can do this job. That's another thing in our paper. I mean, okay, so Okay, first of all, that's only something I would like to do when there's no serum anywhere. So, I mean, as you can guess from this argument, for example, for loops, the problem is that on the smooth projective thing, you may end up with something that starts here. This starts from one point and ends up with a different. Starts from one point and ends up with a different point. But then, so this theorem tells you that you can somehow glue on a different curve. This is D, this is C. So this different curve of C, well, it has it parametrizes family of cycle, a family of stable maps. So the stable maps may vary, but somehow if you look at the fundamental class of each fiber, that's constant. So if you look at the image inside of Z1, Inside of Z1. I mean, so this loop, you know, you go from this point to here is the same as you go from this point and then C and then go back to this point. And of course, this is only like for interval. If you want to do higher homotopy, you have to put something like between different homotopies you can fill in and then with some thing with no pi 2 and etc. Two and etc. It's kind of
