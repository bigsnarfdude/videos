Then you have to spotlight. Sorry? Yep, so somebody else just spotlighted me. Uh probably whoever the host is see. Chi, can you spotlight me? So the room one with the green boards. Yeah, it's all these spotlight. There you spot. Betty, you're spotlighted, Ian. I want you to spotlight the room. So there's a participant called video, which should have the big green things on it, which should be whatever the auditorium is looking at. Spotlight that's. You can make me poster if you want. Sure. Okay, just one second. And most of this should be auto-auditorium, so it shouldn't have changed. As long as you can make out my writing. Why can't can we see the do you see the little window on the left hand side with a that is kind of strange? That's new to you because you had never seen zoom in the room before. And that's basically what the Mac Mini is seeing. So that's a view of the Mac Mini. It's a Zoom setting we can control, but it shouldn't interfere with anything, and it's not necessary. Anything, and it's not necessarily what the participants are seeing. Every person that joins Zoom can decide if they want, like, the gallery view or if they want the picture-in-picture. Because if it films with the camera, there will be another little bit of a so it's going to be there plus another window will pop up when you're going to. Right now, this is what Cash is seeing. Oh, I see, okay. So we are seeing something else. I need to do that through the I think actually that's you spotlight uh the video and uh there's a zoom pop-up box on the live stream. Be gone in about 15 seconds. Okay, and then if I go over to the corner. I think we are the are the lights on above me? They are. All lights are on, yep. Okay. Yeah, that's good. I think we'll just have to either get those lights taken out or tell people like if it's an in-person PowerPoint presentation, we're going to have to turn. In PowerPoint presentation, you're going to have to turn the lights off. That's something totally different from the system. That's just something that Linda notes. I think it's definitely true, though. Yep, all good. All good. I think this is good. So the overall thing is different than what was what it was like last week says that the audio in the room is better and you can hear everybody. So everything else is still as it was. Everything else is still as it was. Pretty much. Now that everything's in, I can work on automating and getting rid of some of the pop-ups for you and making sure the right things are unmuted. But there's going to be a little bit of manual unmuting. So I'll join the first few meetings and I can co-host with you if that would help. But basically, we're going to want to make sure we have remote access to the Mac Mini and I have remote access to Castle. I want to make sure that that room you can see both displays. Actually, Jake, if you come. You can see both displays. Actually, Jake, if you come through just now, I'll show you what the problem is, and then hopefully we can fix it. But yeah, I think that would give us enough to get back to where we were last week, but with better audio, and then I can work on some of the automations for Zoom to make it better going forward. Well, I'm coming over now. Carl is your host. Um did you ever also uh T V and you can  And then break it on that. And then for the last two minutes still. I think I've got randomly when I group. I don't think I know what Audi was. Or I had a number of Oli was. On when it is set as a default for display, so whatever it detects, I'll try and set it to. You can set it to scale, but it'll be weird for us. Okay, in this case we need to add one more device. In Zalarian, it's called Agent Mind. We'll give information because scatter itself doesn't give any information about what it supports. What it's supporting. It's it should receive from uh displays. But since we have distribution amplifier, it's a limitation because it's taken only from in bottle number one. And after that, we have extenders. Some way it's broken. Okay, in this case, we need a device, two device, and It will devise the before between Marmini and Scalia, and it will provide necessary information. I can try to put right now scheduled work in chief because I have preachers from where you can see.
