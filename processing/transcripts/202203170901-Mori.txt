One and then and then we get started is that pronounced Bor√© angles maybe I don't know if that is to use. If you're not too embarrassed to use French pronunciation, there you are. The correct pronunciation is beer. Yeah. All right. We'll take your word for it. Like in Bure Suili Fet. Maybe that doesn't mean anything to you, but it's okay. It's a place near Paris with a famous mathematic. Right. Also theoretical physics, but it's high energy. We're very happy to have Ryuhe Mori, who's in Tokyo Institute of Technology and is an expert in various aspects of theoretical computer science as well as quantum information. I had a great time collaborating with him. He's going to tell us about, so he's calling from Japan. He's calling, he's giving the talk from Japan. Well, he's giving the talk from Japan, so it's pretty late there. I guess it's midnight, Rio Hai. Yes. Okay, so it's midnight. So he's going to talk about lower bounds and error probability of quantum channel discrimination by the viewer angle and the trace distance. So I'm glad you survived the earthquake, Rije. So please take it away. Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity for presenting our recent work. And this work is And this work is joint work with Leo Ito, who is a master's student. He will graduate this month. And this is an archive number. The problem is very simple and fundamental. We are given a fixed finite set of quantum channels by 1 to 5k. These are quantum channels. To 5k. These are quantum channels. And also, we are given a probability distribution on the quantum channels. The input of the problem is some oral, O, this is unknown quantum channel, but this is one of the known K quantum channels. And this is given with probability Pi. And our task is to find the correct index i satisfying the oracle o is equal to phi i. So what is the trade-off between the number of queries to the OLAC group and the error probability? Of course, the number of queries increases, the error probability decreases. Decreases and we want to know the trade-off. So, especially for fixed number node queries, what is the minimum error probability? This is our problem. Thank you. It's very clear. By error probability, you simply mean PIs? Yes, PI and also PI and of course quantum algorithm is always probabilistic. So, yeah, in this sense. So yeah, in this sense, it's probabilistic. Okay, yeah. And this is a general quantum algorithm. General algorithm calling the olaclow n times. Here, gamma 1 to gamma n are quantum channels, and m is measurement, and this is a quantum circuit. is a quantum circuit. First, ket zero is the initial state and apply some quantum channel gamma one. Sorry, this is gamma, gamma one, and then call oracle O for some quantum bits. And for other quantum bits, it's just identity channel. So yeah, it's just identity. And then call next content. Next quantum channel, gamma two, and then call or O for some quantum bits, qubits, and so on. And we repeat this n time. So this quantum circuit calls the oracle O n times. And finally, we measure the quantum state and we output the index i. i is one, two k. I is one, two, k. And this is a general quantum algorithm for this quantum channel discrimination problem. Sorry, maybe very basic questions, since it's a very clear talk and you're stating everything very precisely. So previously on the previous slide, you had, can you please just go one? So you call them 5, 1, 2, 5k. Now on the next slide, you have these gammas. Yeah, these are different, completely different. O is one of the phi and gamma one to gamma n are part of quantum algorithm. So it's just quantum algorithm, part of quantum algorithm. And this quantum algorithm output i, i should be the index of o, or o is phi i. So we want O O is phi i so we want to find i so excellent thank you gamma one to gamma n are part of quantum algorithm and so and in this research we do not argue the complexity of gamma one to gamma n so these gamma should be some quantum circuit so this consists of quantum gates and the number of quantum gates is complexity but we do not care about the complexity so we About the complexity. So we just care about the query complexity. It's a number node or a curve codes. So the gamma one to gamma n could depend on 51 to 5k, but you know, for now, they're just another set of channels. Thank you. I agree with it. Gamma one to gamma n can depend on the set, phi, one to phik, but cannot depend on the i correct index, of course. Of course, yeah. Yes. Yes and yes and the related problem is quantum state discrimination problem. So here if we fix gamma one to gamma n and if we optimize m the this problem is the contact state discrimination. So here just before measurement we obtain some quantum state. Of course it depends on the oracle so if oracle O is phi one we obtain some quantum is phi one we obtain some quantum state low one and if o is phi two we obtain some another quantum state low two and so on so the problem is the quantum state discrimination so now we here we consider quantum state discrimination uh i have a question ruge uh if you go back to the previous slide um then oi is each time you get a fixed quantum channel uh right so Right, so it should it's not the case that the first time you get the first one channel with probability P1, second time you get some other channel with probability P2. Same contact channel. It's the same one. Yes, yes, of course. Yes. Okay. Okay. We cannot find. Okay. And this is a quantum state discrimination problem. This is also This is also a simple problem. We are given the fixed set of quantum states rather than quantum channels and probability distribution on the quantum states. And input is a quantum state law. This is one of the low i. And here i is chosen with probability pi. And we want to find the correct index i. So that's fine. Low is equal to low i. So here we have to optimize a measurement. And if the number And if the number of quantum states is two, there is very clear characterization. The minimum error probability of the discrimination of two quantum states is given by this equation. This here is a trace distance, trace norm. This is a trace norm. So the minimum peropherability is completely characterized by the trace norm. This is called the Hole-level Herr Strong Selen. very strong CLM. Yeah. And if we consider more than two quantum channels, sorry, two quantum states, this is multi-channel states. For more than two quantum states, the minimum error probability is a solution of some semi-definite programming. So there is no clear characterization like Trace North, but the problem. Is normal, but the problem as a value, the minimum error probability can be computed efficiently by the SDP solver. Very good. Rio Hai, a quick question. So the problem statement, Mathematica, is very clearly stated. Thank you. Can you please give us a little bit of intuition and not intuition, but motivation for why you would want to solve this problem? Like in practice. Like in practice, yeah, yes, just general motivation that would help general audience. Yeah, you don't have to, in case something is in your mind. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So if we develop quantum computer, yeah, we have to develop quantum gates and we want to make sure that. We want to make sure that the quantum gate is an idiot one. So in that case, we have to check whether or not the developed quantum gate is close to the clear, close to the ETR quantum gate. In that case, we have to check. I see. So it's like an aspect of quantum verification problem. Yeah. Yeah, maybe across the quantum state tomography rather than quantum state discrimination. Yeah. Or, you know, checking circuit architecture. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then, okay, let's back to the quantum state discrimination. So the simple setting is following. The discrimination of two quantum channels with a Two quantum channels with a single query. This is a simple setting. And in this case, the minimum error probability is characterized by this equation. And here is the diamond norm. And the definition of diamond norm is given by this equation. And here, A system A is a system where the content channel is applied. And R is additional new. Is the additional new system, arbitrary system. Yes, and this law AR is a quantum state on the system A and R. And here, R is arbitrary, but without loss of generality, we can think that the dimension of R is equal to dimension of A. And this quantity can be computed if. Quantity can be computed efficiently by SVP server as well. Okay, the meaning of this equation is this comes from the Holy Herald Strom server. Here, we just optimize input state. So, if we consider discrimination of two quantum channels with a single query, we have to optimize the input state and measurement. And row AR is an input state. So if we input row AR to phi1, phi1 tensor product identity on r, and also we input low ar to phi2. Then we obtain some quantum states, low one and low two. And then it's a quantum state discrimination problem. So we can approach. Discrimination problem. So we can apply the Holyo-Herstron theorem. So yeah, so this is just optimization for the input state for the quantum channels. So yeah. I think this is clear. Okay. And similarly, if we consider the discrimination of two quantum channels with n non-adaptive queries, Then, no adaptive queries. No adaptive means output of content channel is not used as input for another content channel. So the oracle calls must be parallel, completely parallel. It's no adaptive algorithm. In this case, similarly, the minimum era probability is characterized in the same way. The evaluation The evaluation of this diamond distance is not necessarily easy because the dimension is exponentially large. If n is large, the dimension is exponentially large. So yeah, exact computation is difficult in general. But anyway, it's characterized. But in this work, we consider general quantum algorithm. So quantum algorithm. So queries must be, queries can be adaptive. These are interesting facts. These are not directly related to this work, but it's interesting previous results. There are two quantum channels that cannot be distinguished exactly by any no-adaptive algorithm, even if we approach. Even if we apply million queries to quantum channels, it cannot be distinguished exactly. It goes to zero, but it's probability is strictly positive, but can be distinguished exactly by an adaptive algorithm with two queries. Just only two queries, the two quantum channels can be distinguished. Interoperability is equal to zero. But But any non-adaptive algorithm cannot distinguish two channels exactly. This is, I think, interesting. So this means adaptive algorithm is very positive. And this is another result. For any two quantum channels, either of the following is true. The quantum channels can be distinguished exactly by finite queries, like this case, or the Or the error probability of quantum channel discrimination decays exponentially in the number of queries. Okay. And really, just a quick question. The second bullet was for adaptive queries? Yes, adaptive queries. Okay, all right. And I don't have in your previous slide, I don't have a very good intuition for. Slide, I don't have a very good intuition for fifth slide number five. So, if you do these exactly in, I mean, how does how does doing n parallel queries help you? I mean, if you have the theorem, why would you want to consider n adaptive queries? But what do you mean? So, like, there is a theorem for discriminating using a single query that you said above. Query that you set above, and there's the diamond norm distance. And you know, this may be a very simple question, but the corollary then, yes, the corollary is true. But I just wonder why you would want to get end copies of the channels. So does the error probability improve or? Yeah, obviously, because for example, the let's concept quantum state discrimination problem. If we have n tensor problem. If we have n tensor product of low one to low k, obviously it'll probability decays because image crash are inteced. Because if we have two coins, one coin is unbiased and another coin is tried to be biased and we throw the coin a million times, we can distinguish two coins with higher probability, right? Sure. And in that formula with the diamond norm, it's obvious that the With the diamond norm, it's obvious that the probability increase the probability of success increases. Sorry, in this case, if n grows, this goes to zero or yeah, this goes to zero. And yeah. Great, thanks. That answers. Reho, I have a question. So if P1 and P2 are a half, then you just get the diamond norm of the difference of the tension. Of the difference of the tensor product of yeah, no, you don't, right? Is the diamond norm linear in say tensor products? Is the diamond norm of the tensor product of a channel is n times the diamond norm of the channel? Is that true? No. If we consider tensor product of some map, gamma is not necessarily channel because here this is a difference of channel. This difference of channel. If this is tensor product of some quantum map, it's NS power of a single diamond node. But here, this is not any tensor power of some quantum map. So it's difficult to evaluate this tensor product, I think. Right, right. Okay, yeah. So that is related to what I was asking, too. Thank you. Yeah. And even if Yeah, and even if for the quantum set, it yeah, same issue, there is same issue. But in that case, very asymptotic exponent is given by quantum term of bound. So if we consider the here, just replace low one to low one to ns tensor power and low two by the n tensor power of low two. It's asymptotically exponential. Asymptotically, it's exponentially small. It's e to this is equal to expansion. This is close to one. So this total equation must be close to zero. So this should be E2 minus some CNA. C n n is a number of copies, and this she is obtained by quantum channel band. Great, thanks. Please go ahead. I think we're standing down. But for the quantum state discrimination, we can input the entangled state, right? So for there are n copies, n parallel copies of quantum channel, but we can input entangled state. We can input entangled state. So, output is also n-tangled. So, yeah, it's more complicated. Okay. There are some previous works. The simplest case is a discrimination of two unitary charms. And in this case, the exact minimum error probability was given by Kauber J12. Given by cover J12. And in this case, the minimum error probability is achieved by non-adaptive algorithm. Yes, and more than two channels. In my knowledge, there is almost no previous work. For the special case, for the global search, yeah, the minimum error probability is known. Is known. So Sarga shows that global search is optimal if the number of market elements is one. Yes, this is a special case, but interesting. And our work is strongly motivated by this Serga's paper. And for general quantum channels, if we consider two quantum channels, recent work by Recent work by Pirandora Eduardo using port-based interpretation gives some lower bound. And more than two channels, Pyandra, Zhang and Pyandra, showed similar lower bound. And in this work, we showed another lower bound for these two cases. And sorry, here, we consider quantum channel group discrimination problem. Group discrimination problem. So this is generalization of quantum channel discrimination problem, but we consider quantum group quantum channel group group of quantum channels. Yeah. So we need this for considering global search if the number of marked elements is more than two. So, just a quick question. But group, do you simply mean the fact that you're considering a set of channels? Yes, set of channels. Yes, set of channels, but set of channels are not necessarily partition. So, set of channels may be overlapped. These are set of channels, and there may be overlapped, right? And if some channel is given, channel here is given, we have to output some group. This is group one, group two, and group three. We have to output one or two, possible correct answer. Correct answer, right? What do you mean? What do you mean by overlap of channels? So you have a set like 5-1 to 5k, which were K different channels. Yes. In what sense do you mean 5-1, like 5-2 can have an overlap? I mean, there are 5-1, I think 5-1, 5-2, and 5-3. There are three. And 5-3. There are three channels. And first group is say A, A, B, C rather than 1, 2, 3, A, B, C. And quantum group, quantum channel group A consists of 5, 1 and 5, 2. I see. And so on. Okay, P consists of 5, 2 and 5, 3. Yeah. And yeah, and this is a problem. So if we are given some. This is a problem. So, if we are given some oracle, oracle O is either of 5, 1, 2, 5, 3, and we have to find the group index rather than channel index. In your first slide, O was just one of the five, one to five case. That was my understanding. It was one of them, and the question was, which one? So, in your very first slide, O was one of the five onto 5k. 5 onto 5ks. It's still true. Yes. Right. But now you're saying O could be any group. No, no. O is one of 51 to 5k, but output should be group index rather than channel index. So it's a slight generalization of your first slide. Yes, if A is a singletons, these content groups are singletons. These content groups are singletons. It coincides with the first line. I see. Okay, good. Yeah, motivation of this problem is global search. If global search includes the K market elements, like there are n candidates and there are n elements and k market elements. There are n choose k possible quantum channels, right? So these there are quantum channels. These zero quantum channels, and it should be quantum channels, and group a group one group one means quantum channel, yeah, for which no, it's it's very clear now, it just wasn't clear what you meant by group, but now we get it, I think. Yeah, please go ahead, yes, and then this is a technique overview of the proof. Let's consider the quantum channel discrimination for two quantum channels, phi A1 and PhiA2. And assume we fix the algorithm, its best algorithm, we fix the best algorithm, and then the quantum state just before the measurement is this. Is this if the oracle is phi a1, the quantum state just before the measurement is low one? This is start from zero and then apply some quantum channel gamma one and then apply the cola curve phi one and so on. Yeah, maybe yes, yes, yes. So this is a quantum state just before the measurement. If the order Just before the measurement, if the orac rule is phi one, and this is a measurement, this is a quantum state just before measurement if the oracle is phi two. And from the followable Herr Strong CLM, the minimum error probability is this if the probability distribution is uniform. So we want to analyze this quantity, but of course, we want to Of course, low one and low two are complicated. So we use this very useful technique, hybrid argument. This is a very common technique and used in many areas. First, define here we concern sequence of quantum states. First one, low zero, is low one in the previous slide. This is quantum states just before the measurement when all Before the measurement, when all olocles are one, and last state is low two in the previous slide. This is a quantum state just before the measurement if the olocre are all phi two. And here, these intermediate quantum states is here, the first queries are phi two and the other queries or phi. are five and next first two queries all acquiescer five two and the other queries all acquiries are five and so on and then this is what we want to analyze this is a trace distance between low zero and low n and we consider this telescoping sum and apartheid angular inequality obtain this And of course, you could have done this with any norm. Sorry? And of course, you could have done this with any norm you wish. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That is a point. So we just use the triangle inequality here. Yeah, it's satisfied by any distance measure. So we can use arbitrary distance measure here. Yeah. But here we use a trace distance because yeah, this appears in whatever. So yeah. So, yeah. So, now we want to analyze the single term, this force distance between low i and low i plus one. And here, the definition of low i and low i plus one is this. In low i, the first i order recalls or phi two and the other oracle calls or phi one. And for low I plus one, the first I plus one olocal codes are phi two. So these are similar, only difference is only I plus one olocal code. So first we approach we consider the outer channels. So here I plus two I plus two polar current calls to end solar cry. recalls to ends oracle call i like i press to lock records then oracle calls these oracle cores are common and if we limit the common channel quantum channels here the torus distance increase this is a very simple general uh yeah general uh property called monotonicity so if we apply So, if we apply a quantum channel to quantum states, obviously, the distance decrease its monotonicity, right? So, So we just remove the common quantum channel here and then trace distance increase. Next, we look at the inside. Inside is also common here and here. These are common quantum states. So here we replace this quantum state to the best one, its flow AR. So we replace this quantum state to some general quantum state, rule AR. Then we obtain this inequality. In parentheses, you need the gammas as well. Sorry? In your second set of parentheses, you need gamma i plus one as well, I think. Ah, yeah, sorry. Yes, you're right. So, yeah, here, here. Here, here. Yes. And then, this is replaced by, yeah, this one. So it's low AL. So we obtain this inequality. And this is a definition of diamond distance. Yes. So here we use the monotonicity here. Yeah, only we. Yeah, only we use the monotonicity. So we can replace this distance measure by arbitrary distance measure if it satisfies strong angle inequality and the monotonicity. Yes, so we obtained this lower bound of the error probability. Error probability of any quantum algorithm using n or a protocol. And n or a gluco is lower bounded by this right-hand side. Here, this was a sum of n sum of n towards distance, but each term is replaced by diamond distance for any i. So there are some Their sum is n times time of distance. This is very simple, lower bound. Okay. Very nice proof. Just a quick question. And are these results tight, you think? No, so this is, of course, our purpose of this research is to improve this lower bound. So we improve this lower bound. Lower bounds. So, in general, this is not tight. So, why this is not tight? So, yeah, there are some reasons. We employed three inequalities here, triangular inequality, here, monotonicity, and here, the replacement of the quantum state. And now, And now we are, I think, okay, and now we look at this inequality, triangle inequality. And this is not tight in general. Why this is not tight? This is an intuitive explanation. First, this sentence is not correct. We load it on our paper on archive, but this is not correct. But this is not correct. For pair states with two layer state vectors, psi zero and psi one, the trace distance is equal to the Euclidean distance up to a constant factor. I'm sorry, this is not correct because the Euclidean distance is this, and the trace distance is this. So here it's the real part of the inner product, and here it's the square of the absolute value of the inner product. So they are different E wave two state waves. Two state vectors are real. But anyway, for the intuitive explanation, in this slide, we consider the Euclidean distance. If we consider the Euclidean distance of the sequence of state vectors, here obviously the triangle inequality is not tight. tight the screw Euclidean distance between psi zero and psi two is upper bounded by the Euclidean distance sum of Euclidean distances between psi zero and psi one and psi one and psi three and obviously from this figure obviously the triangular inequality is not tight so this is a problem and yeah trust distance is not exactly equal to the equation Is not exactly equal to the Euclidean distance, but yeah, similar. So, yeah, this is an intuitive explanation. So, in this work, we consider two ways to improve the triangle inequality. First one is to use angle rather than kind of Euclidean distance. Angle is this, this theta, theta 0, 1 and Œ∏. And theta one, two angles may be better, at least in this case, triangle in equality for angles is tight. So this is a first idea. So here we use angle. So this is a definition of fidelity and various angle. A is defined as the arc. Is defined as the arc cosine of fidelity. So, yes. Fidelity is kind of inner product. This is between 0 and 1. And f is between 0 and 1. And its arcosine is between 0 and pi over 2. This is angle. And okay, so now we use the same argument for angle rather than. Of angle rather than trace distance. Yes, and in the following Harris Roman theorem, the trace distance appears rather than US angle, but there is an inequality between the trace distance and the fidelity. This is where known inequality, huge Founder graph inequality. And this inequality is not so bad because the equality is satisfied if two quantum states are pure. Okay, and then disappear in the whole herostromo, but we can apply this inequality and then we can argue fidelity. And then we can use the same argument for virus angle rather than torus distance. So in fact, virus angle is a distance measure. So virus angle satisfies triangle inequality and also monotonistic. Quality and also monotonistic. So we are interested in this quantity and we can paratrano inequalities and we obtain this. Yeah. Now we want the upper bound of trace distance. That means we want the lower bound of fidelity. And that means the upper bound of viewers distance because our cosine is decreasing function. So we are interested in upper bound of US angle. US angle and here we apply triangle inequality and yeah in the same way this is completely same as the yeah the proof for the trace distance completely same here we use a monotonicity and here we replace the yeah state with the best state and here is here simply we replace replace A by the definition of A and our cosine is decreasing so we consider the minimum of the fidelity. And this minimum of the fidelity can be evaluated by SDP as well. So yeah, there is an efficient algorithm. So we obtain this inequality. Okay. And this is our first result. And this is our first result. And for the special case. And like you said, since this triangular inequality applied to pure angles is tight, your theorem is tight indeed. And of course, not always tight, but we expect that it's tight in some case. And in fact, this This gives the optimality of global search. I see. Yeah, not always tight. There is no such clearly any improvements on the previous. In fact, for some channels, the trivial simple lower bound. For some case, simple lower bound is better than. Lower bound is better than our new lower bound. In fact, I see it's a complementary result. I see. Okay, good. Thank you. This idea is strongly come from Zaluka's paper. So, yeah. And for amplitude dumping channels, if we consider the discrimination of two amplitude dumping channels with parameters R1 and R2, then the Then this tau as a growth form, analytical form, it's arcosine of this. It's kind of Battacharya parameter. And if P1 and P2 are one half, this is a probability distribution on the quantum channels. This 4, P1, P2 is equal to 1, and 1 minus cosine square is sine square, and its square root is sine, so it's 1 half. sign so it's one half one minus sign and positaria angle so it's very simple formula i think this is new formula okay and then next idea this is a next idea how how to improve the triangle inequality this left figure explaining you're explaining why the triangle inequality is not tight. But here, if we multiply some weight R1, this R1 is some weight smaller than one. So this vector is shrink, this vector shrink, then the triangle inequality is tight in this case. Okay, so this is the idea. And so if we consider n 2Ds, we have a sequence of quantum states. Sequence of quantum states, and if we choose the weights appropriately, in this case, triangle or triangle inequalities are tight. This is the idea. So, in this case, we have to optimize the weights, many weights, and n weights, n is the number of queries. And so, it's very hard to optimize if n is large. So, here we introduce. Here we introduce a simplification. We assume that weights are geometric. So we choose some k between 0 to n and alpha and beta or ratio for the geometric case. And we choose a weight as one alpha, alpha square, alpha cubic probabil to alpha k. This is equal to beta 2n minus k and beta 2n minus k minus 1 probability to 1. So, yeah, this is for the for reducing the computational complexity for evaluating the lower bound. And then we obtain the lower bound. Yes, so yeah. Yeah, this is a lower bound. So here we use a torus distance, but we introduce weights. We introduce weights so we consider sequence to weights low low zero, low one, low two to low n, but yeah, the intermediate states are weighted, not normalized. Yeah. And then we obtain this inequality. So here, there are three parameters, alpha, beta, and k. Yeah, we have to optimize them. optimize them beta is beta is determined uniquely from this equality if if we fix alpha and k so essentially there are two parameters alpha and k but if we fix alpha and k uh yeah tau one and tau two are computed efficiently by s dp so yeah and i could optimize alpha and k Optimize alpha and k in some heuristic way. So, this is a second theorem. And this is a numerical result. Here we consider two discrimination of two amplitude damping channels. The damping rate of the first channel is R0. This is a horizontal axis. And the damping rate of another channel is dumping rate of another channel is R0 plus 0.01. This is the damping rate of another channel. And we consider discrimination of two amperage damping channel. And this curve is obtained by the lower bound using BOA angle. That is analytical, that is very clear, but numerically it's not good. Not good bound. And here, this is a lower bound obtained by the previous season that is based on torch distance for weighted quantum states. Rihai, we don't see your cursor. It would help if you say, so the solid line is the theoretical one, theorem three. Is that what you said? Yes, this is an article. This is theorem. Because this is this. No, no, yeah, we just couldn't see your cursor, so when you said this and that line, it's hard to know which one you meant. Great, yes. Yeah, this is the anarchic curves. That's why we don't put points. Yeah, this is an article. And the triangular one is the previous one, but k is fixed. So yeah, k is some integer, and here the integer and here the weight weight geometrically decreases up to k and yeah geometrically increase to n so intuitively k equal to n half is okay right this is just intuition but it's not true if k speaks to n half the bound is this and if k is optimized Optimized if k is optimized, a bound is this. So there is zero. So once you optimize, the lower bound of the error actually increases. This is lower bound of the error probability. So we want to obtain a larger lower bound of the probability. Error probability is here we consider the best error probability, minimum error probability. Right? So we want to maximize. So we want to maximize the lower bound also. And this curve is obtained by the previous work by Pierre and Reidworld. They use port-based departation and it's very complicated and their raw boundary is better if the dumping the idea is large. Okay, and okay, and they also apply the triangle innovative for the trace distance as well. So I think that we can apply our idea to their bound because their bound is based on a combination of triangular essence and post-port-based deposition. So yeah. I think we can apply our I think we can apply our idea to zero bound. Yes. So this is a numerical result. And here I do not explain detail of our results for group quantum channel group discrimination. This is an overview to find group including each channel. Yeah, I explained before. So yeah. Before. So, yeah, group may be intersect, not necessarily disjoint. And we derive lower bounds of the probability for the quantum channel group discrimination problem using the Burial angle and the trace distance with weight. And lower bounds using Burial angle proves the optimality of global search if the number node marked element is k. And if k is equal to 1, the optimality was proved by. By Zarka. Yes. And Zarka notes that it is possible that the semier method can prove the optimality of global search for general K. But no formal proof has been known. Yes. Yes. And yeah, and similarly, lower bound using the trace distance with weights is numerically better than previously known lower bounds by Pirand or etor for some cases. Yes, and this is a summary. We obtain the lower bounds by the hybrid argument combined with Burial. Argument combined with Burial angle or trace distance for beta distance. And a simple generalization, simple idea is to use some other distance functions. Yeah, I don't know whether or not the lower bound can be improved by using other distance functions. So yeah, if you are interested in, please try this problem. Yeah, please try this problem. Yeah, thank you for your attention. Thank you so much. Yeah, it was a very clear talk. And thanks for taking questions on the fly. We have some time for questions. Yeah, please, Ilya. And then Jeff. Ilya, go ahead. Mine is the clapping, not the hand raising. Oh, yours is clarity. Not the hand raising. Oh, yours is cloudy. Or Ilya is also. Yeah, sorry. I'm sorry about my. I apologize. Yeah, thanks. I know it's I'm the one who should be apologizing for misreading the emojis and the reactions. All right, so if nobody has a question, I have a very dumb question I would love to ask. All right, so Rio Hai, why do you want to increase the error probability on your plot? Why do you ideally want a larger error probability? Sorry. Sorry, we want to show the lower bound of the probability. We want to analyze the error probability. Yeah, minimum error probability is some fixed value. We cannot change it. We want to know the logo of the error probability. Yeah, so we... I see. So there's an ideal error probability somewhere above 0.2, but here you're just in closer and closer to it. Yes, yes, yes. And closer to it, yes, yes, yes. Okay, okay, that makes that makes a lot more sense. Thank you. I was kind of confused about that one point. Any other questions? Is there some understanding on what would say if you restrict the power of your strategy? If you restrict the power of your strategies for discriminating, how can you be bounded away from these lower bounds? Simplest way is, simplest restriction is no adaptive algorithm. So if the algorithm is restricted to non-adaptive, the minimum error probability is characterized by this equation. Characterized by this equation, this is exactly orbit. So, the problem is to evaluate this time on distance. This is in general not easy to evaluate, but yeah. And what if I say that, see, in diamond distance, usually one has the possibility of sending an entangled state through one half of an entangled state through the channel. Yeah, using those things, you can. Using those things, you can achieve the diamond norm sometimes. Now I say, okay, in my protocol, I restrict you from, you know, you can't use entanglement. You're restricted in some classical way. And now can we say we can bound what the best classical strategy can do away from we restrict that the Reflect that the input quantum state is not end-angered? That's correct. We say we consider two different cases: one in which you have full quantum strategies, and the other in which you can't ask entangled questions in some sense, which is what the discrimination will do if you send an entangled state. I mean, if the quantum states are not entangled, the problem is. The problem is exactly the same as quantum state discrimination of n and tangent states. And in this case, the asymptotic law of an asymptotic error property is known. It's obtained by quantum channel of bounds. So it's just optimization of exponent by the input quantum state. So it's very easy to optimize because it's independent of. because it's independent of n. So yeah, in that case, it's easy to obtain tight, asymptotically tight wall bounds. And in general, input states may be entangled. And in fact, in this case, discrimination of two unitary channels, in this case, the base algorithm is non-adaptive, but input state is. To but input state is entangled, so yeah, so we have to consider entangled input state, but yeah, in general, I don't have idea. Very good. It's very useful to know because you start out by saying one motivation for doing this. This is more of a comment than a question, but I think. This is more of a comment than a question, but I think in Bears, it's more okay to do comments. Ramiz? Is that a question for me? No, no, I was like, can we do comments as well? What do you mean, can we do comments? I mean, I have right. My comment was that initially, Ramiz asked. Of course, you can. Yeah, initially, Ramiz asked if there was a motivation to study this. And the idea was, well, And the idea was: well, you have two circuits, it's not quite clear. It's one of several circuits, but you don't know exactly which one, and you'd like to find out. And to me, it seems what is emerging is if you'd like to find out what happened using entangled inputs, you can do exponentially better in some cases than if you don't use entanglement. Is that a fair A fair intuitive float on the results. You mentioned this. I was also thinking about what ways could this help or use use cases and motivations for the problem. So I'm glad you brought this up. Okay, I think uh comment has been made. All right Yeah, we don't know and it's like 1 a.m. in Japan, so yeah. Any other questions or comments? Well, we are right. Well, we are right on the hour and yeah, happy. This was nice. Thank you, Rio Jei. Get some sleep. It was great. It was a nice talk. And see everybody back in two hours for the talk of Bruno Necnegale. Okay, thank you.
