In the talk, I will talk about SKT structure. This is, in fact, is the same as Blurry Kloss metric, as Alexander already mentioned. So, most of the talk, I will speak about Blurry Klaus metric on a complex manifold, and we will see some general. We will see some general properties, some results, or the new. And I will talk about the conformal generalization that we introduced recently. The preprint is on archive and is a joint paper with Debar, Ana Ferreira, and Larbi. So let's start. And let's start with the definition introduced by Alexandra. Alexandra, and okay, it's a little bit slow, but it's working. So, we will work on complex manifold and the type of geometry that we will consider with binocular. And Hermitian metric, a compatible metric with the complex structure J is called Blurry-Clauso SKT. SKT stays for strong color retortion. This state for strong Kaleric torsion is related to the torsion of the bismuth connection, and we will see in a moment. If the fundamental form omega is ddc close, that's equivalent also to ask that is dd bar close by the user relation that you have between the operator dc and d bar minus z up to a factor. And one can consider many types of Consider many types of, in fact, non-Keller Hermitian metric, and one of these is from the point of view, since you just apply the operator DDC, can be to be interpreted as the only weakness of the Kerala condition, which is linear in the fundamental form, because we will see other conditions that involve the star loge of omega and then are much more complicated. Complicate. And SKT or pluric close is completely different if you work in complex dimension two. So if you work on complex surfaces or in Eiger dimension, for this result, you could be shown, let's say, that in the compact case, you always can find in the conformal change of omega a new and medium form. Here I will identify often the metric with the Often the metric with the fundamental form such that if you take the minus one power wedge of the new form in the conformal class, this is the debar clause. And then you have also the unicity just by this integration condition. And let's say exactly that for a compact complex surfaces, you have always such skt. SKT metric because if you do a conformal change, then you have the power n minus one with power z d bar close. So for n equal to two, you just have the bar omega tilde equal to zero. Another result that we use for because we can see this condition as KT or pluriclose in terms of the bismuth connection, and it was shown by. Connection. And it was shown by Gouduchon that when you start with Armitian manifold, then you have a natural one-parameter family of Armitian connection. We present the complex structure, we preserve the metric, and which are characterized by the torsion. Here I will identify the torsion tensor of type 1, 2, with the torsion tensor of type 0, 3. And every connection in this family is characterized by a condition of the torsion. Is characterized by a condition of the torsion. One condition is given by the fact that the detrion has zero, the one, one component, as a chain connection, user chain connection. And then the connection that we use here essentially will be the Bismuth connection, also called Strominger connection, that's characterized by the condition that the free form, the torsion free form, is Q-symmetric in all the arguments, so it's free form. Argument so it's free four, and this is true for every metric connection. The difference between the metric connection and the Levitica connection is essentially given by the torsion in this way. And for the Bismarck connection, the torsion free form you can see from here is just dc of the omega. And then you can see easily that the SKT condition or pluriclaus condition is equivalent that the condition. Equivalent that the condition that the torsion TB is closed, and that's why it's also called strong Kayla retrosion, also for other reasons related to physics and so on. And another one form that was mentioned many times in the previous talk is the leaf form, which is just a trace of the torsion of the chain connection and can be defined as the J of the coderivative of. Of the coderivative of the fundamental form, omega. And there's a property to be the unique one form such that if you take the differential of omega n minus one time, then you get theta, the L form, with omega n minus one. Let's go to this conformant generalization. This is something that we started a long time ago, and then finally we finish. The idea is the following. So, we use the name conformal, but here we don't use really change or conformal metric. In fact, we work just in the torsion. So, let's consider Hermitian structure on our manifold, dimensional manifold, and we will call locally conformal SKT, shortly FC SKT, if and only if. If and only if you have a one form, which is non-zero, alpha, which is the closed. So we ask this condition on the torsion. So the differential of the free form, which is a four-form, we ask that is the wedge of our one-form wedge T, the torsion. And then alpha is close, non-zero. Of course, here we have a first problem that's different from usual what you do and you do a conformal, you impose the condition on the two-form. Condition on the two form, non-degenerate two form, that our free form can be degenerate, right? And so it can have kernel. And that means so that you can have on the same time the condition, let's say, alpha, which TB zero, on the same time dtb zero, right? And then this condition is satisfied, but you have still skt, which is SKT, which is exactly this condition. And so here we will have many questions and few answers on that. But anyway, the first question is, maybe stupid question, we don't know. For SKT, SKT has a rich relation with physics, with super symmetric theory, SIMA model, and so on, generalized scalar geometry, and so on. So one can ask, okay, what happened with this condition? Work with this condition, with this condition in the non-SKT case. And then, of course, the other natural question is to see: okay, we have the empty set. We can have compact ST manifolds, which are not SKT. For this question, I will answer. So we found examples that are compact and which are not SKT. And as usual, at least for me, this example will be near manifold, in fact. Will be near many for in fact. And that's surprising because we will have different properties from the SKT case. Okay, so let's go to example of SKT manifolds. The more simple example, compact and very rich compact manifold of SKT, of course, are just if you take real compact semi-simply group with summits of such, right? These are naturally SKT. These are naturally SKT, but in this case, you have that the Bismuth connection is flat. And if you look for other examples which are not flat, for which the Bismuth connection is not flat, you can look easy away in this class a couple locally homogeneous spaces that was considered already by Alexander, in fact. And so we just work on On okay, sorry. We just work on a comprehension of a Lie group by lattice and J, we will call J invariant compost structure if J is coming from last invariant compost structure G. And then for SKT case, we have some classification. With Maurice Superton and Simon Salomo, we classify the case when the dimension is six, and then later with Henriette. And then later from reacting fetzoni, we consider the eight-dimensional. But then we thought that, in fact, we proved the result that I am writing now as a conjecture, but there was a gap in the proof. I mean, we thought that we proved that every manifold with invariant complex structure, which omits SKT metric, this is for SKT, for the existence of SKT metric, you can suppose any SKT metry as not to. Any SKT metric has not to be invariant, as Argenstr√∂m displays with the average approaches, you can always obtain a new metric which is not invariant, as to be 2 set, and then you have a total space of holomorphic torus bundle over the torus. In fact, this conjecture is true in dimension 6, in dimension 8, we know. And in general, if you say the commutator plus j, the commutator of the real. The commutator of the Lie algebra of your G in the case that this is abelian. This is with under this assumption, this is always true, the conjecture is true, but unfortunately, we cannot remove this assumption, so it's not known in general if it's true or not. And for the case of G-solvable, we have also classification in this case with Otale Ugate, we consider the six-dimensional case. Consider the six-dimensional case with the additional property that you have a holomorphic reserve form. And then, more recently, with Fabio Paradizo, we consider my PhD student, we consider the case of almost a billion, which are semi-direct product of this type, essentially a copy of R, R to M. And then there is a nice construction that preserves the SKT condition. The SKT condition is due to Friber and so on, and is what is called the share construction. This shared construction is essentially preserved in the SKT structure and give many examples and also some partial classification. Here, I want to mention a recent result that I obtained with Adine Betsoni. Mention this result because, in fact, we will see later. Because, in fact, we will see later that this condition for the complex structure that looks restrictive, the abelian condition, it means that in general, if you take the complexification, you will have the one, zero part plus zero, one part. And here we are asking that the one, zero part is essentially the one, zero vector form not only a complex subalgebra, but Only a complex sub-algebra, but an abelian sub-algebra, that means billion. And we were quite surprised because if you combine the abelian condition for the control structure and the condition for the Lie group to be unimodular, which is a necessary condition for the Lie group to emit a lattice, then you go back to the true separate boat. Choose apne both. So it seems that this is too much. And the proof is, I want to mention just the proof because it's very doesn't use any type of classification. It's very clean, some sense, because you just write the condition for the torsion to be zero, and then you interpret anything in terms of this condition for any x, y, theta, and w in the Lie algebra. In the Lie algebra. And then, if you use the previous condition for x, y, and jy, j, x, you just see that you have this other condition that comes from the previous one. But this is very, in some sense, very strong because they say, okay, if you have x in the center, then it's clear that the bracket with x with any other element is zero. But these relations say that if x, the bracket, That if x, the bracket of x with jx is zero, then you have both of these are zero. So that means that s is in the center. So it's quite equivalent condition to be in the center. And then allow us to show that if you have a modular library and g is your modular, then for any g like that, the commutator g1 plus g1 is always strict container. One is always strict containing G, and that's very useful because you have an induced SKT structure that, and then you can use the induction. And in fact, the only thing that we use that if this ideal is two-sabinet, then G is two-sap name potent. So you go back to the two-sap name potent again. So it seems very strong condition in that case. And one can ask: okay, what is Okay, what is going on for the condition that I mentioned before, L C S K T? And in fact, for SKT, there are four classes of isomorphisms. And here we find two classes. So if we consider a Nilmani for dimension six, and then you impose that you have an important CSKT structure, then automatically you have only two. Then automatically you have only two examples. The first one is not so is essentially the Isenberg copy of real Isenberg, three-dimensional Heisenberg plus R3. But the second one is more interesting, I think, because it's three-step nearput, and so it cannot admit any SKT structure. So you can see from here a difference. We also consider this condition an almost abelian case, but I will not mention it. Case, but I will not mention here this thing. I want to mention some other SKT example, which are not bismuth flat. One are the OT manifolds. We were mentioned by Alexandra. And recently, Alexandra showed, Timan showed that at least in dimension eight, you can have SKT structures. So, again, six-dimensional. So again, six-dimensional seems to be tricky in some sense, seems to be different from the other case. And she also found some restriction, in fact, on Betty number, on the turbati number of this manifold, compass manifold. And other examples, which are not, because this automaniform, in fact, are again, as Kazuya described, are again compass on manifold. So again, compact. Compass on math. So again, composition of soluble group by lattices. But there are also examples which are not on that category. And that was constructed by Dimitri Grancherogia-Grancher-Jan Sampoon. And this is a more general construction, in fact. They were looking on this type of speech geometric on Taurus bundle over Kelly Menifold. In particular, they consider here they construct. Consider here they construct the SKT metric on the connective sum k minus one copy of S2 times four, connective sum k copy of S3 cross S3. And this is essentially a tissue bundle over the complex blow-up of CP2 in K points, which belong to a special curve. More recently, they generalize a little bit the construction. They generalize a little bit the construction, the previous construction to the core, where they consider the total space of principal mandor of a projective manifold, where the such group is other unitary group or spectral orthogonal or composite symplatic. And I saw in the literature that more recently they construct some, they generalize a little bit this again in relation to toric geometry. Torik Jones. But one thing that one can look is, and we will see that SKT, at least for some examples, seems to have the same behavior, is to see, okay, what happened if you combine the two conditions to be SKT, so the bar close and the balance condition. So that means that these stars Of omega is zero, or equivalently, the Li form is vanishing. Then, if you combine both at the same time, then you go to Keller, essentially. This was shown by Alexandro Ivanov and Popovici independently later. And so we conjecture, in fact, that, okay, obviously, are not f, but one can look transversally what happened. you what what happened so you we fix we fix the country structure oh this is not good sorry we fix the country structure here okay and then we suppose that on the same time you have a metric which is compatible with the compress structure which is skt on the same time balance and then what happened that And then what happened that automatically this condition, at least in the known example that now I will mention, this is related to some discussion yesterday in the evening discussion. In fact, because this is, for instance, true for twisted space of a compact antisla dual four-dimensional Riemannian manifold. That's a natural balanced metric, but was shown by Verbiski that it cannot amit. By Verbiski, that it cannot admit any SKT metric. And another class that is very close to Keller, the Fujiki class, these are just manifold complex manifolds, which are bimeromorphic to compact Keller manifold. This cannot be again pluriclose, cannot emit any pluriclause. That was shown by Kiosi, Cholse. And then also then colifold transition. Colorful transition doesn't work well, at least with the SKT condition. They work well with the balance. If you start with something which is Calabiao and then you apply this curning for transaction, so contraction followed by smoofing, then you get something which is volume but not anymore SKT. So for instance, this connecting sum, K copy of S3 cross S3 has no SKT, but S3 cross S3 has SKT. 3 as SKT, so it's a difference. And then we study this for some classes of locally compact homogeneous bases like ni-manifold or sol manifold. And also for the standard B-smooth flat example that I mentioned before, the compared semi-simple in groups with the summary of complex structure, they cannot emit balance metric. We show that we grant Betsoni. Showed up with Grantro and Bezzoni. And more recently, Jussi and Podesta constructed again, these are non-compact, but they easily have compact Ocean by lattice. And they show that if you take a non-comparial simply groups of inner type, inner type is referred to the symmetric pair that you can define associated to that, a balance, but not a scale. Balance, but not SKT. We try to see if the L C K T condition is different from this behavior, because of course it's more restrictive, so it's not clear what is going on. But in fact, at least for the example that we check until now, then it seems again to be translational. So maybe it's related to some property related to the torsion, maybe not, the bismuth connection. Maybe not the bismuth connection, we don't know. Um, I want to mention other link that one can have with SKT geometry, with simplicity geometry. And in that direction, I gave some negative results. We already saw the definition in other talk of what is called taming condition. So it just means that we have a simple. That we have a symplastic manifold. And then we ask that almost complex structure is the same by omega if essentially you have this condition, omega x dx is positive. But then it means that if you take the one-warm part of omega, then the one-warm part of omega together with J give you a metric, positive metric, niche metric. Here, the situation is completely different for Is completely different for complex dimension two. Again, a higher dimension, because for complex dimension two, so for a compact complex surfaces, if emits a symplatic structure, taming the complex structure, then has to be career. And that's what we showed by Street Zen Tian and Lien Zong with different arguments. Stritz and Tian showed that just using the signature theorem, so the theory of complex surfaces, and Lien Zong. surfaces and Lieutenant Zong use colour. So take on a compatible colon. The result is the same. So it's not known if it's true in eigenvention. So for complex dimension bigger higher than two, it's not clear if this is still true or not. We have many negative answers. And many negative, some of the negative answers can be given just using. Given just using the relation with SKT geometry, for instance, because if you write down the condition for d omega to be zero, and you just decompose omega in the one more part, two, zero part, zero, two part, then the condition is just to ask that del of the one more part of omega is the bar example. bar example and for some the close the two zero form that in fact is minus the two zero part of omega but anyway you have skt metric um near manifold provide often a contra example to many properties but in this case at least when j is invariant it doesn't provide any conterexample in fact we prove with emulati with zuni that that that near map That Nil manifold, company manifold with an environment structure, cannot have any simplity form time engine unless it is a torus. We generalize the result, the previous result for the Keller case, Keller case. And with Kazuya, we extend that to a case of solmifold when the Lie group G is completely solvable. That means that a joint represents So that a joint representation has only real eigenvalues. And the way I will prove that is not using, in fact, SKT geometry, but is using the sort of reduction that was mentioned in the talk by Giovanni and a little bit at least of the other direction. So we use that when you have a simplatic form. Have a simplatic form on liquid, which can be solvable, then always you have ADL which is isotropic with respect to the simplic form. And then you can do what is called the simplatic reduction, adapt in this case. So this is exactly what you do. And if you play also with the couple structure, tame by the simplic form, then everything goes well. But of course, it's still open for other types of salmonic. open for other types of cell manifold. We are still looking on other classes of cell manifold. For instance, with my students, we construct some new examples of cell manifold, composite manifold with KT structure, which are also, so a new class in the sense of not including this almost abinion on these other stuff. And they also have a new type of generalized scalar. Of generalized scalar known at least for some manifold, because in this case, the generalized scalar is not split. So the two complex structures do not commute. You don't have the splitting on the tangent body, but it's not yet finished. The paper, so I don't, I prefer to talk in the future about that. And after, okay, there are now many in the literature, many type of geometric flow. Type of geometric flow which preserve Hermitian structure. The main idea is to generalize what is now the Keller rich flow. So if you saw with a Kauber-Keller manual, you take the rich flow, so you evolve the metric using the Ricci of the metric. Just the Ricci, you just forgot about two, you can forgot about the factor two. The factor two, and this preserves the Keller condition, and then you have all the theory about Keller-Wich flow, and so on, and preserved by Kaut, Jan, and other people, and reduce everything to a parabolic motion per equation. For non-Keller manifold, the first thing that one can remark is that the Levich-Mita connection doesn't preserve the complex structure, and so the Rich flow doesn't preserve the meter condition. And then there are now in the literature some. Now, in the literature, some type of flow, let's say, geometric flow, it preserves, for instance, the SKT condition. And one of these is involving the bismuth connection. And it was introduced by Sriti and Tian. And essentially, instead of using the Ricci form of the Levicivita connection, you use the Ricci form of the Bismuth connection and you The Bismuth connection, and you take the one one part because, in general, the Ricci form of the Bismuth connection is not a type one one, and then you evolve the metric just in the direction the opposite of the one one part of the Bismuth connection. And what Swiss and Chan show that if you restrict these operators of minus the one-one part of the Richie form of the Bismuth connection to SKT, JL-meteometry, then what you get. JL mitigate, then what you get is essentially a lithic operator. And then you have a short time resistance. So if you start in the complex case, if you start with a complex manifold, if your initial condition is SKT, then at least for this mod, you have a solution which is unique. If you have also the, let's say, the maximality of your interval with initial condition omega zero. And when the initial condition And when the initial condition is scalar, then it's just the Keller Ricci flow, the use of Keller Ricci flow. Here I just mentioned something like still open some problem. There is many things in the literature now, even a nice paper of Garcia Fernandez, Switzer and Jordan, where they study, for instance, the behavior of the plural. the the behavior of the pluriclos of this pluriclos flow when you start from something for which rho b rho b zero right and so it is involving the flat case we will see later other condition on the curvature of the bismuth connection which is let's say like satisfying condition similar to the curvature of the levy meta Curvature of the Levitic connection. But let's go on here with this, let's say, introduction, short introduction, because it is very rich, also related to generalized scalar geometry. Anyway, one of the things that allow to show that the operator, in fact, is elliptic is that the operator can be written in this way. So locally, in local complex coordinates, you have this part. coordinate you have this part plus e dig bar of log the terminal dot the metric this is just minus the the richie the churn the richie the chann richie form essentially which is a type 1 and we have a relation with the simplicity for taming a complete structure because in fact if you have a skt metric this was shown by switch and tian for which the For which the one one four, the one one part of the this which four is proportional to the fundamental form, omega, with constant non-zero, then automatically this is the one one part of the simpletiform time in the complex structure. So we have exactly a relation with the previous condition that is not clear that for not complex surfaces, you can have some. Complex surfaces, you can have something which is not calor, so it's still open, as I said before. And then the natural problem: this is a natural problem for all the flow, is to describe the maximum smooth existence time and study the limit at the time t of the existence time, maximal existence time. And in this relation, Srich and Chian obtained some result using essentially instead of using the user Keller cone, Using the user killer cone, they use the epicon, so that the right homology here to be used is just the real 1111 epicomology, which is just the kernel of E dd bar over the form which are del eta bar plus del bar eta, which are in this form. And then one can do, as in the killer case, one can look about the one a pre-positive con. Just asking the class for which there exists a representative which is positive. So we give an SKT metric. There is a relation with the first-chain class because the first-chain class can be viewed as Botcham class, and you have a natural inclusion here from Botcham to the EPLI class. And in fact, they found out. In fact, they found out they found out the upper bound for the maximal smooth existent time t in terms of essentially the con and of c1. Because as in the Kellerich flow case, you have that the class of omega t is just in the class of omega zero minus t, the first chain class. And so what they show. And so, what they show, that Stritten Chiang showed that, in fact, the upper bound is just given by the slope of T, for which this class is still in the epile, let's say. And they conjecture that if you serve a complex manifold with a sketchy metric, then the maximum solution exists exactly on the interval given by. Of the eastern ball given by zero and this upper bound. That's what they conjecture. There are many results in this direction, confirming the conjecture. I just mentioned one for the important case that I got with Angrieri and Sony. And then there are other results that one can chose similarly for other types of this type for Lie groups. Because for Lie groups, with everything is left important, essentially. Is left important, essentially one can use the tricky due to Laurette. So when you have the pediatric flow, the pluriclose flow, you fix the complex structure and you deform the metric, right? Here, what you can do is to fix the structures of both complex structure and the metric, and you deform the Libracket. So you just deform the bracket. And what we show that for two-step in important case. For two-step an important case, this list, you have a solution for every t positive, and this is the case for many, many other similar examples, let's say, and was shown later by Arroyo and LaFonte that, in fact, the solution converged in the grammar Hausdorff sense after a normalization, you just value one over plus one, with a similar solution. Plus one to a similar solution of the flow. Here, of course, the Gromov also sense is the manifold is non-compact, but you can adapt in this situation. There is another flow that preserves the SKT condition in the literature, is the channel Ricci flow. And you just evolve the metric this time using the churn Ricci form. You don't have to take any time. You don't have to take any time 11 because it's automatically time 11. And this was introduced initially by Gill and then study by Tozati and Meinkoff and reduce the flow essentially, they reduce the flow to a scalar E and in terms of a parabolic complex Monsanto equation. And this is, of course, from the point of view of torsion of the Bismarck connection is not changing. That's maybe because that's why. That's maybe because that's why it's not maybe so interesting for other properties related to SKT structure. But it turns out that for L C S K T, since the torsion is fixed, is fixed because you cannot write explicitly the solution omega t, in fact, just in terms of omega, and then you have an extra part, which essentially is the close. So the differential of omega t or the solution. Of omega t of the solution is again d of omega zero, or the starting fundamental form. And so for this flow, the S C S K T condition is in fact preserved. So it's automatically preserved. And now in the last part, I will go back to this Sabelian condition that I mentioned at the beginning, and also we will see a relation with Weissmann condition. See a relation with Eisman condition, at least for complex surfaces. Okay, one can, if we are in Hermitian non-Keller manifold, the Bismuth connection in general doesn't, unless it is the Levicita connection for the Keller case, does not satisfy in general the first Bianca identity. Okay, since if you write down the first Bianca identity, then you have terms involving the differential of the torsion. Involving the differential of the torsion of the Bismarck connection plus extra term involving the quarantine derivative of the torsion with respect to the Bismarck connection and then this extra term this sign in this way. One can ask, okay, when the curvature of the Vismal connection satisfy the same condition as the curvature of the electric connection for the glucase. And that's exactly what. And that's exactly what we impose. So we consider Killer-like, Bismuth-Killer-like. We'll see later that one can impose this condition also for other type of connection, Hermitian connection. So the Bismuth connection is scalar-like, if satisfy the first Bianca identity, plus this condition, the tie condition. So it means that if you change x and y to jx, jy, then the crevice. Jy, then the curvature is the same. It was conjectured by Agela, Utal, Garte, and Villa Campa, that if for a median manifold, the Bismuth connection is scalar-like in the sense that I defined before, then G is SKT. And this conjecture was confirmed by Zhao and Zhen. Yes, the paper is on archive. Paper is on archive, and that the condition to be killer light is equivalent not only to be SKT, but plus the condition that the torsion of the bismuth connection is parallel with respect to the bismuth connection. What we study with Nicole Lactos RDV is to see, okay, what happens if you start with SK Techmetry, which satisfy this business-like condition under the flow? Under the flow, under the pluriclos flow. And complex surfaces give some answer, in fact, because it's related to the Weissmann option. If we take complex dimension two, the torsion is just minus the coderivative of the leform that we considered before. And what this is definition of Weissman that was already considered, you know, in taught by Libya, for instance. So, Remetri on a complex manifold is Weissmann if the differential of omega, the fundamental four, is just theta, which omega, and here theta, the one form theta, the reform is D close and parallel with respect to the Levitic-Weta connection. And in particular, vice-war metric are Mudushon, and the norm of the Leaf form is Causal. What we show in Nicoletta Taldini is the following that Is the following that on complex surfaces, the condition to be Weisman is equivalent to be SKT, the metric, and the bismuth connection satisfy just one of the two conditions. So the first Bianc identity. And of course, this, we know everything about coupled Python surfaces. They have been classified by Billy Boon, and they are other long Kalier properly allitic surfaces, Codira surfaces, plus one or allitic. Plus one or elytic of surfaces. What we look is: okay, what happens if you start with a metric which is Weissmann? So here at the real dimension four, we are on a complex surfaces. And with Weissmann, but unfortunately, we need to add this other assumption, constant scalar curvature, that is equivalent to ask. That is equivalent to ask that the chain connection has also constant scalar curvature. Then the Pluri-Closed flow, starting with omega zero, preserve the Weissmann condition under that. And essentially, we could write more or less explicitly the solution in this case, because if you sell with a compact Weissmann surfaces, then you can write the term Li Ti4 just in terms of the differential G theta. terms of the differential J theta, and then you have a factor H, some smooth function on M. The problem is exactly this smooth function with the additional assumption that the constant scalar curvature is, the scalar curvature is constant, then H is constant, and then allow us, so in particular, we have C1, the first chain class of our compass surface C0, and then it allows us to write down that this precise. To write down this PC solution. But it's not clear, for instance, in the other case, if it's true or not. If you sell with a Weismann, just Weisman, so you remove this other condition, if the condition is preserved or not. We don't know. I mentioned now, the beginning, I was mentioning this result about J abelian, the compost structure abelian. Campus structure abinion. In fact, it has a dramatic meaning in this situation. Because if you take a six-dimensional loop and you impose that the B soot is scalar-like, then automatically J has to be abelian. That's so as a geometric meaning. It's not true, the converse. We show that. And we show that under the pluriclose flow, again, also in this situation, the bismutkeler-like condition is preserved. So, if you start with two-step group with a left-in variant, B-smut-Keller-like emittance structure, and you have a solution to the purely close flow, then you remain B-smut-Keller-like. So, the question is: is always true that? So, the Bismuth Keller-like condition is always compatible with the Always compatible with the plural, it's always sure that it's preserved. We don't know. We check for other examples, but I don't know. Maybe there is some general thing that we can show, but I don't know. So it's open, completely open. And as I mentioned at the beginning, one can look for other type connections and try to impose this Bismuth Keller Lie condition. This Bismuth Keller-Y condition. So let's consider a compact, Hermetian manifold. And if we impose that the Levita connection or the channel connection is scalar-like, then we show by Yang and Seng, then automatically G is balance, which is transversal in some sense to the SKT condition. And there's also a sense because SKT and balance are some. SKT and balance are in some sense transversal. We don't know if it's true in general, but that makes sense at least. Was conjectured by Angela, Utal, Ugarte, and Villa Campa that if you take other type of connection, so you work in the feminine with the Shank connection, Nabla T, and you don't consider the bismuth connection that we considered before, neither the Chen connection. The chain connection, then, and you assume that it's scalar-like, then they conjecture that this is scalar. So, if you go far from the Bismuth connection and the Chen connection, they conjecture is that you get only Kerr. You don't go far from Kerr. They show, in fact, the way they conjecture that, they show that this is true for compass manifold with an inviocomplex structure, which have a non-zero invariant. Which have a non-zero invalid close 3,04. One can confirm another, was another case. And recently, very recently, there is a perpetrat by Tsao and Seng where they confirm this conjecture, but not for all the connection in the family. So they consider essentially case n equal to two, separately for the case n equal to three. n equal to phi as far as I remember but they don't have for all the values of for all the value of t is still open and their argument I think at least what I saw cannot be extended for every t so if one has one needs to show that probably one need to use other type of argument that's not working here so I think So I think it's a good time to stop. I will stop. Probably I went too fast, but as usual, but I think it's a good time to stop here. Thank you very much for the attention.
