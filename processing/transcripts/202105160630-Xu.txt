The second speaker is morning, and this workshop is Professor Xi Jin Wang from Nanjing University. His title is False College Flow on True Sphere. So please, please, Xing Wang. Okay, okay. Sorry, I have to speak English. Sorry. Okay, today I'll. Okay, today I will talk about. Sorry, sorry. First of all, I have to thank the organizer for the invitation to let me have a chance to talk about this regional work. Of course, compared with the first talk, my one is just an example, because true superior can be considered as a one-dimensional complex map. Mention a compact map. Okay, let me see. How do I okay? In this talk, I shall briefly discuss how we can apply the Gauss curvature flow to reprove the existence of a prescribing Gauss curvature problem. Okay, this is a joint work with my colleagues, Xiazhan Cheng at the Nanying University. Cheng at the Nanying University, and my two current students, okay, uh, Yi Ming Xiang, Yi Zi Ri. Okay, the project was started when I was lecture on the lecture, I mean the last semester about rich flow. Okay, then when I talk about the local existence, then I will ask my two students to take care of how to prove that the How to prove that the local existence for prescribing curvature problem. And then I want to ask my colleagues, Xiu Zhan Cheng, to take care of their work and try to work it out in the detail. So that after we prove that the local existence, then we find that we should give some argument to the existence. Argument to the existence without. Okay, so that's the whole story. So now let me start. Okay, uh, so we consider just a very simple, simple space, just S2. Okay, just everybody understand this. Okay, just the three coordinates added together is one. Okay, take a square, okay. And with a induced metric, okay, which is just. metric okay which is uh just what we call the uh the run metric okay of course that the uh classical differential geometry show us that the the gauss curvature of this metric is always equal to one okay uh then we consider a smooth function on s2 and consider the conformal metric g which is equal to exponent 2w times the 2W times the round metric, okay, the G0, which we define above. Okay, it's well known that the gauss curvature of G can be calculated as using the following formula. Okay, I hope my calculation here is correct. Okay, so this is a well-known fact, so I don't want to speak. I don't want to spend much time on it. Okay. The classical or well-known Niamberg problem says that suppose we are given a function f on the S2, and we need to find the conformal metric G such that the gauss curvature of this metric is equal to the given function f. function f okay this is called the prescribing uh gauss curvature problem which is well studied okay uh of course according to the formula we just given that this is the equivalent of solving the following equations which is as laplacian w plus f times exponent 2w equal to 1 on s2 okay uh so from now on uh we write uh On we write Laplacine separate zero by Laplacine. Okay, we don't need to write a separate zero again. This is for the I'm too lazy to type. Okay, okay, so then this is an equation we try to study. Of course, this is a well-studied question. And I think in this conference, there's so many of the experts in this. In this audience, there's, of course, there's a huge literature on this form. Okay, we just will try to mention only a few of them and relate to our approach here. So the first result, which gives me a very impressive image, is that the theorem proved by Chang, Gersky, and Yang in. Chang, Gursky, and Yang in 93. It says that if f is non-degenerate, smooth positive, and the number of maximum points is not equal to the number of saddle points plus one, then above equation has a solution. Okay, look like this is not much mathematics, just a few words put together. So we make a great statement. Okay, there's a similar There's a similar one, which is about the similar time. The first version was approved by Han Zhen Tao in 90s, which appeared in the Duke Mathematics Journal. And another one is by Zhang Gongqing and Niu Jia Quen in 93, which by, I think, is in the National Journal of Mathematics, saying that if F is Saying that if f is non-degenerate smooth, a number of positive maximum points is not equal to the number of positive settle points, which is with a non okay, non-positive Laplacian, okay, plus one. Then the above equation has a solution. So the difference between the first theorem and the second theorem is that the second theorem drop off the positivity. Uh, positivity for the prescribing function f. Okay, the rest of them is nearby the same because basically we don't need to care about those local maximum or local central point of F with negative or zero values. Okay. So, of course, I said that. Of course, I said that there are many another results under different sufficient conditions, such as radial symmetric group invariant, I guess. My first paper on this kind of problem was appeared in 1993 in Transaction with Professor Paul Yang. Okay, on the radio symmetry, we assume F is. Radiosymmetric, we assume f is radiosymmetric and f also change sign on a certain condition. We say there's no certain condition, there's a radio symmetric solution. So this is basically reduced to the OE. Then we find some condition on the prespiring function f. Then later on, that Sheng Weng Zhong and Min Shongming just generalize our result and Generalize our result and saying that our condition we find that is not necessary, just a sufficient condition, but also the necessary condition. Okay, so this is the first result I did on this field. Then also there are some people doing that the group invariant. That means you have a discrete group that's just not a radio symmetry, radio symmetry, just the One circle group, okay, on a discrete group or another group, then you have similar things, okay. Okay, this is a relationship, okay. Why this problem is interesting, okay? First, there's a two necessary conditions if you go back. Conditions, if you go back to the equation we have, so because Laplacian operators are divergent free, so that if you integrate, the Laplacian term disappears, so that require f to be positive somewhere. And so, this is the first necessary condition, so that's why we have to assume f is positive somewhere. Okay, secondly, we have a very famous what's We have a very famous what's called the test and word conditions, which saying that if you have a solution, the grading f have to satisfy certain vanishing conditions. Grading F times a grading XI times the new metric volume form, then it must be zero. So, therefore, in order to prove that the existence that you have to have That you have to have some conditional f. Otherwise, this is not possible because there indeed for some function that there's no solutions. Okay, currently, existing methods, okay, the first one is using mostly is called variational method. And let's try to minimizing. However, as people observe that the minimization procedure may fail, you only can looking for the settle point, not just the minimizer, because the minimizer exists if only if f is a constant. Okay, so this rule. Okay, so this ruled out the problem, the chip method. And that also tells you that the problem is not so easy to solve. That's why many people interested. The second method is called using Morse theory. I'm not sure this is the MORE which I type correctly. Okay, uh this this is the water that the uh I think is that uh Handenthau used that the uh what I call the uh okay uh uh let me let me think about that just uh using that the uh well well um Okay, just try to construct the okay, but forget about it. Okay, the most theory was adopted by Shang Dongqing and Niu Ya Cheng. There has a condition called a GBC. Condition called GBC, okay, general boundary conditions. And so try to understand his their proof that we have to read Professor Chang's the big book. So it's a little bit take a time. Okay. The third method is called the flow method. The flow method was, we should say initially with the Initially, with that brundle, which, however, his method, the first one, which I know, appeared in the Annals Journal in 2003, which does not include in sphere and does not include in the torus. Okay, then we have Then we have a perturbation method. Okay, just this is new, okay, but we will not talk about this. Okay, so this is regarding the existence method. Okay, then we will our approach here is that the follow the flow method. Okay. I said that the Browno's method does not include. Method does not include sphere and torus, but method itself, of course, is okay. And his proof rolled out a sphere and torch because he required the integral of Q is not integral of scatter gauss coverage is not zero. And another condition is that it's not equal to scanner sphere. Spirit okay, and then uh 20205, the Michael Strua using the same flow method to discuss that the gauss coverage problem on the two-sphere with assuming the two maximum points and no settle point. Okay, uh, then at the this assume after the This assuming after the positive. His strategy is just try to reprove that Chen and Yang's another result. They say that the flow, if does not converge, there must be converge. I mean, the concentration point must be at one of the maximum point. Okay, then try to rule out. Then try to rule out the possibilities. I guess Hong Ming Chung and Mani did the same thing as the Shroa did for F Chen YC sign. And Pat Hong Hall also did some similar work. Okay, we say that our main purpose of this work is to provide a different argument for the second result. Okay, my original purpose, original idea is try to see how we can remove the degenerate conditions. However, that seems still not in progress, okay? So we just follow the same flow method and to finish the first part. Today, we just focus on the first part. Okay, the flow we consider is the following simple equations. Okay, so Wt is equal to alpha F plus Kg. Okay, Kg is a Gauss curvature of time metric and metric and uh alpha is a global defined functions depending on the control factor okay so uh our normalization is given as uh so this one uh approval uh we i i should apologize that this should be equal to not one but four pi okay uh when i type this i just uh When I type this, I just pull or overlook at it. Okay, with initial data, okay, w0 belongs to C infinity over S2. Okay, in fact, that to my understanding, that the flow existence as a PDE, okay, there's no problem. It seems that this always It seems that this always globally exists. The problem is that when we talk about the convergence, the metric conversion, then we will talk about, we need a conditional F so that the limit exists. Okay, if we don't talk about the existence of the limit, then the flow is always globally exist. Okay, so that the construction of the flow is to Construction of the flow is to make sure that the flow were decreasing the energy. Therefore, we have L2 long bar of the W exponential W taken to time t. Here I say that it's routine, but not trivial to check that the flow exists locally in time. Exists locally in time. This was my original promise to ask my students to write down this proof. Okay, so we did take a time to write down this by using contraction mapping principle. There, with global existence in time, is also true for any initial data. So this is a Initial data. So, this is a, in fact, this is probably even easier than the local existence. The local existence indeed take a time. So, the main difficulty for this approach is that we have to ensure that the fluid converge as the time goes to infinity. Okay. Okay, uh, if so, our argument as usual, okay, is that if flow does not converge, then the w must tend to infinity at some positive critical point of f with non-positive Laplace. At those points, Laplace is less than zero. Okay, uh, so my original question is that we said it again, okay, so that what happened. What happens if indeed Laplace is equal to zero? Okay, just a degenerate critical point. And it sense that the next term, when we analysis that the convergent rate, it seems that this next one is long order, okay, because quite. okay it's quite a uh uh time consuming okay it's not so easy to compute okay we we uh we have a time to this well we have difficulty to distinguish that the the first first degree uh converges and second order degrees converges so uh okay uh then we have to do uh What Michael Stroy and Michaeli did for the four-dimensional case, then we have to run out to the infinite-dimensional MOS theory, okay, for this energy function. Then study its critical set and in fact, it should be the critical point, and the most identity to reach the desired contradiction with the assumption F. I think that the okay. Okay, I have only 25 minutes to talk, right? So I guess I just end here, okay? Thank you for your attention.
