Let me stand in a couple of minutes to see us on the criteria. Sure, yeah, I will talk faster. Yes. Okay, let's start. It's a pleasure for me to introduce volume frequency. He's going to speak about high preference partition centers versus that it's going to be a great talk. Wow. Okay. Putting pressure on. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, let me take this opportunity to thank the organizers for putting together this really nice workshop. Apologies that I have to leave after just two days of it. So I have a motivating result, which for this Which for this audience is almost silly, because here's my motivating result. If you have red and blue points in the plane, then you can always find a line that simultaneously bisects them. By bisecting, I mean, you know, the same number of red points are to either side of it, the same number of blue points are to either side of it. And we all know, and some of us love this theorem. So, the ham sandwich theorem for any D finite point. For any D finite point sets X1 up to XD in Rd, there's a hyperplane that leaves at most half the points of each XI to either side of it. I'm stating this for finite point sets here. If you like, you know, Borel probability measures with continuous density better, for example, that's the same thing by approximation. So there's no loss of generality by looking at finite point sets. And one reason that you might like this theorem is because that's Like this theorem is because that's some geometric corollary of you know the famous Bozog-Goulam theorem that any continuous map from the d-sphere to Rd that has this inherent symmetry that f of negative x is negative f of x for all x must have a zero. That's a non-existence result for an equivariant map. And I think I, you know, I'll even flash a proof outline at you, just so we're all on the same page of, you know, how does this go. Of you know, how does this go? So, affine functionals, affine maps from Rd to real numbers, they are parametrized by d plus one real numbers, namely the coefficients for this affine functional. And each such affine functional, as long as it's non-zero, corresponds to a partition of Rd into half spaces, namely where the function is non-negative and where the function is non-positive. Okay, and I want to think of this as an ordered partition, so I care where I'm positive and where I'm negative. Where I'm positive and where I'm negative. Now, of course, if you have a functional and I multiply it by five, I get the same partition, nothing changes. So we can mod out factors that are positive factors. So if you mod that out, then aha, these partitions are parametrized by S D, by the D sphere. And now you just define a map that measures how many points are to the positive side, how many points are to the negative side for each one. side, how many points are to the negative side for each one of these xi, make this continuous by Bose-Goulam, there's a zero. Because if you flip, you have this symmetry. Good. That's my motivating result. So it's results of this form that I want to talk about, ham sandwich type results. But I also have a motivating method, meaning if you can't be bothered to pretend that what I'm talking about is interesting, even for the next 40 minutes, the good news is I'll show you a method. The good news is, I'll show you a method. Maybe the method is interesting. Maybe that's something that you can use for, you know, your interesting problems and not just my boring problems. So here's the motivating method. I'll try to explain it in a toy example. So here's my toy example. I have the sixth cycle. And as you see, I've colored the vertices of the sixth cycle red and blue. It's not a proper coloring. I just chose a partition into three plus three vertices. Okay. What I want you to do is find two disjoint. Find two disjoint rainbow independent sets. Disjoint, we all know, it means they don't share a vertex. Independent, we perhaps all know, it means they don't span an edge, there's no edge in there. And rainbow means I want one red and one blue vertex. And okay, you can do this by inspection that this is always possible for any three plus three coloring of the sixth cycle. But I want to give a more geometric proof of this because this will generalize in a nice way. Okay. In a nice way. Okay, so here's my geometric proof of this. What you do is, so the general setup, how do you turn a combinatorial problem into a geometric problem? Well, you say, well, let me look at the space of all possible solutions. And I just said space, so presumably that's a geometric object. And my space of all possible solutions here is the space of independent sets. Sorry, the space of rainbow sets. Space of rainbow sets. So I drew in every rainbow set. Since rainbow here just means red and blue, rainbow sets are edges. So I have dashed lines of rainbow sets. I have red vertices, three of them, and three blue vertices. So this new space of potential examples is K33. It's a complete graph on three plus three vertices. And now, what do you do? You use the only result that every human on Earth. That every human on Earth knows about K33. It's non-planar, right? So, what does that give you? It gives you, by definition, two rainbow sets, right? Because that's the only thing we drew. They must be, and they intersect. Thus, they must be independent, because how could they be on the outside of the cycle and still intersect another one, right? And they're disjoint if you use Hanani Tat or whatever, right? So, K3. Right, so K33 is non-planar for the reason that two vertex-disjoint edges intersect. Okay, so there you go. There are my two vertex-disjoint rainbow independent sets. Good. How does this generalize? Well, for example, if instead of the sixth cycle in the plane, you use the moment curve in Rd or the trigonometric moment curve if you really want it to close up to be a cycle, right? And instead of the non-plane. And instead of the non-planarity of K33, you use Flores' theorem that the n-fold joint of a three-point space doesn't embed into R2n minus 2, which for n equal to 2 is the non-planarity of K33. Then you get, for example, this result of Alishari and Munier up there. For any partition of the 3n cycle into n color classes of size 3, there are two disjoint rainbow independent sets. Just straightforward. Just do the same thing, but in higher dimensions. Same thing, but in higher dimensions. And well, if that's easy, then okay, you can probably prove extensions. And in fact, we've done this: extensions from cycles to sparse graphs. You can do in this way, prove similar results for sparse graphs. I also put on here that the motivating result for what Alishari and Munier did, namely by all of these people, Aharoni, Arlon Berger, Shudnowski, Kotla, Leewild Sif, they proved. If they proved a version where you only have one independent set, but it turns out you can even guarantee two independent sets, right? Two disjoint independent sets. Good. So that's my motivating method. So to summarize what my method is, what do I do? I construct a simplicial complex X that encodes some data of my problem. In this case, it was rainbow sets. And then I use embeddability, or maybe non-embeddability. Embeddability or maybe non-embeddability results for my simplicial complex as a witness for solutions. Ah, two rainbow sets intersect. These are the rainbow sets I want. Okay. Now, we've already seen some talks about deciding whether an equivariant map has a zero. That's a very common method. Using the Bose-Boulang theorem is an entire book about this method. So this method that I just showed you is equivalent to this method of finding a zero of an equivariant map. zero of an equivariant map by the Hefliger-Weber theorem, provided that the dimension of x is small and it's stronger otherwise, it's properly stronger. That it's properly stronger won't matter to us today. In fact, I will use this method, but in the end, I will use the non-existence of an equivariant map in a sneaky way. Okay. So, how does this all relate to ham sandwich type theorems? Theorems. So, what is the data that I have access to? Well, if I construct a simplicial complex and then I map it to Rd, perhaps I don't map it to Rd in a really weird way where faces are curvy. Perhaps I just tell you where the vertices go and you fill in the faces as flat faces. Maybe that's what we're doing. And then the data that I have access to with my non-embeddability result is the following. There are two faces of my simplicity. There are two faces of my simplicial complex, namely sigma and tau. And if I apply f to these faces, then these faces intersect in Euclidean space. That's what a non-embeddability result will give me. Good. So if you write this out in this facewise linear world, what does this mean? It means some convex combination of vertices of sigma is equal to some convex combination of vertices of tau. Okay? And presumably many people in this audience have once in their life. People in this audience have once in their life seen a proof of Radon's theorem. So, you know what this means, what the data is that I have access to. I just, you know, write this on the other side, and then what I have access to is non-trivial affine combinations. That's what this, that was, this is encoded by this method in the phasewise linear way, right? When I'm in this world of phasewise linearity, what this encodes for me is non-trivial affine combinations among my vertices. So, my vertices encode something of my problem. These encode something of my problem. I put them in Rd and I get non-trivial affine combinations. Good. Well, if that's what I have access to, what do I want? Well, if you believe my proof from the third slide or so, what I want instead of affine combinations is affine values, right? We come up with an affine functional and we plug in points and we're interested in are they non-negative or are they non-positive? Okay, so that's kind of this. So that's kind of dissatisfying because I have access to something that's distinct from what I want. But wouldn't it be nice if for every point set I can construct a new point set such that the affine dependencies for my original point set are the affine values for my new point set. That'd be really neat, right? Then I have access to exactly the correct information. And that's indeed possible. So what do you do? So, what do you do? So, here we're saying, aha, we have n points in Rd. We need to keep track. What we are interested in is affine values. So, you take an affine functional and you evaluate it in these end points, and that's a point in Rn. In fact, this gives you a subspace of Rn, linear subspace of Rn. Okay. But what we have access to is affine dependencies, so we really want a new point set X prime, where the affine dependencies are the affine values, and you just forced it. And you just forced it, right? Just do it. How do you do this? You write down a non-trivial affine dependency here for some point set. How do you construct a point set such that these affine dependencies are affine values? Well, you just write this affine dependency into the first coordinate of your vector, right? And then you do this on a basis, and that's how you get the second coordinate, the third coordinate, and so on. You just, by hand, force this. By hand, forces. Okay. And this concept is called Gale duality. This correspondence that flips, in this case, linear values and affine dependencies is called Gale duality. So take the ham sandwich theorem, here a reminder of what it said, and say, oh, let me apply Gale duality. So I'm in this world where I can use my motivating method. If I do this, what happens? Well, I need to keep track of. What happens? Well, I need to keep track of how many points I have. Let's say I have n points. Then my Gale dual lives in r to the n minus d minus 2. In this case, if you're familiar with Gale duality, you expected me to write minus 1, but I'm really interested in affine values, not linear values, and that's what makes this difference of 1. Okay, so yeah, I have d point sets in Rn minus D minus 2, and what do I want to show? I can keep track of F. I can keep track of affine dependencies. I want to show that there are radon partitions. There is a radon partition AB in this new point set. No, this means radon partition, such that it's separating, it balances, right? It balances the colors. There's as much green in A as there's green in B. Okay? And you can ask, well, is that obviously true? And maybe it's not obviously true, but it is true. So even for a continuous map from the end. Continuous map from the n minus one simplex to Rn minus D minus two. So now instead of convex Hull, convex Haltz, you can have wiggly, curvy faces. The vertices partitioned into D color classes. Then there are vertex disjoint faces such that the images overlap. And they each have at most half the vertices of every color class. This theorem is due to Sakaria in some sense never really. Sakaria, in some sense, never really stated in that way, but proven by Sakaria for sure. A short proof is also due to Pavlo and Gunter Siegler and myself. And in fact, this short proof gives a bit more. And in fact, Sakaria already knew this. If you have D pairwise intersecting families of disallowed faces of your simplex, right? You're saying, okay, here's my first family, and I don't want these faces to be involved in a radar partition. And they all have to pairwise. Radon partition and they all have to pairwise intersect. And here's my second family, and I don't want these to be involved in a radon partition. They all have to pairwise intersect, and so on. Then there is a radon partition that avoids all fi, which is a more general statement. And this accidentally is the Gale dual of Dolnikov's theorem. What is Dolnikov's theorem? Here it is. If F1 up to Fd are families of polytopes. Families of polytopes. If you like compact convex sets, that's okay by approximation. If you, yeah, you can state more general, some more general theorem here. If you have families of polytopes in Rd, D of them, such that each family is pairwise intersecting, then there's a hyperplane that intersects all these polytopes. If instead of pairwise intersecting, you're in a setting where all these FI, you know, each FI has a point in common, they all intersect, that's trivial. You just pick. That's trivial. You just pick these points and there's a hyperplane through all of them. But what Dornikov's theorem is saying, even if they're just pairwise intersecting, here I have red polytopes and blue polytopes and they pairwise intersect, there's still a hyperplane that intersects all of them. So far, how are we feeling about this? Good? Okay, so what's happening here? What's happening here? I claim Dolnikov's theorem is more general than the ham sandwich theorem. On the one hand, you have to believe this because we looked at the Gale dual, said, oh, we need this statement for ham sandwich. In fact, this more general statement is true. Oh, the Gale dual of that is Dohnikov. So Doinikov must be more general than ham sandwich. Let's see this directly. If you have D point sets in R D, they're finite, let's say. Consider the following set of polytopes. Fi is a convex hull. Polytopes Fi is the convex hull of all those subsets of Xi that are more than half the points of Xi. We agree these have to be pairways intersecting. They even intersect in vertices, right? By Dolynikov's theorem, there's a hyperplane that pierces all of them. Well, what does that mean? There can't be more than half the points to one side of this hyperplane, otherwise the entire convex hull would be to one side of this hyperplane, and this hyperplane wouldn't pierce this convex hull. That's a contradiction. So, in summary, So, in summary, Zakaria's non-embeddability result for simplicial complexes implies Dolnikov's hyperplane transversal theorem implies the ham sandwich theorem. This last implication here is in Dolnikov's original paper, I believe. This implication here maybe hasn't been observed, but I'm not sure. But it opens up a very natural question, right? So we have a here is So we have a here is a hyperplane acartition result, and here are more general results. But this is not the only hyperplane equipartition result. There's a whole zoo of them. So let's generalize them all. Okay, so what about multiple hyperplanes? Havler has said a little bit about this already. So Hartwiger's theorem, for example, again. So, Hartweger's theorem, for example, again, I'm stating this in the world of finite point sets. If you like measures, that's fine. For any two finite sets, A and B in three space, there are two planes that cut A and B. So two planes give me four orthons, and they cut both A and B into four sets of equal cardinality. There are as many points of A in each orthon, and there are as many equal numbers of points of B in each orthan. So you could ask, well, is there maybe a Could ask, well, is there maybe a transversal extension of Hartweger's result? Is there maybe a non-embedded, you know, you now take the Gale dual, and then you ask, is there a non-embeddability version of Hartwigger's result, which would be even more general. Let's see, is it clear to us what this would look like? So for ham sandwich, we had more than half of each color class and take the convex hull of that, and that's my set of polytopes. For Hartweger, a partition by two hyperpotopopes. Hartweger, a partition by two hyperplanes. What do I want to do? Well, I have a, let's say, a red point set, and I take more than a quarter of the points, right? And I take the convex hulls, and now they're not pairwise intersecting, but I have no four pairwise disjoint sets in there. So the question is, I give you a bunch of red polytopes and a bunch of blue polytopes, and I assure you there are no four pairwise disjoint red polytopes and no four pairwise disjoint blue polytopes. Are there two hyperplanes? Polytopes, there are two hyperplanes that pierce more. That would be a proper generalization of Hartiger's theorem. And then there's this aggravating Ramos conjecture. So for two hyperplanes, it says if 3m is less or equal to 2d, then if you have m color classes of point sets in Rd, then there are two hyperplanes that cut all the xi. Hyperplanes that cut all the xi into four sets of equal kinality. That's the Ramos conjecture, probably believed by many, but unproven. It's known in really just a few cases, namely if and only if you deviate from a power of two by at most one. If the number of colors deviates from a power of two by at most one, Rama's conjecture is proven. In every other case, it is unknown. Other cases is unknown. Okay, so the first unknown case would be six is the first number, the first positive integer. It doesn't deviate from a power of two by at most one. So if I give you six sets, six color classes, and R9 are the two hyperplanes that cut it into each color class into four equal pieces. So yeah, these results are proven by this non-existence of equivariant maps. So if you're, if M So, if you're if m, the number of color classes, is 2 to the t minus 1, that's the easiest case. There, it's just the non-existence of a z mod 2 squared map, and you can use cohomological index theory, so you can shift around some polynomials and then see that some polynomial is too big to be in the ideal of some other polynomial, too small, and then you're done, right? Not super difficult. The case 2t plus 1 is the next easiest one. It's again. Next easiest one. It's again a Z mod two squared map, but now you have to use obstruction theory. And then the really annoying case is 2 to the t, where, okay, the symmetries of two hyperplanes are the following. I can flip my first hyperplane. I can independently flip my second hyperplane. And that's enough for 2 to the t minus 1 and 2 to the t plus 1. And for 2 to the t, you need, oh, I can't physically do this. That's what I just noticed. You can. You can switch your hyperplanes. The order of hyperplanes can be interchanged. So you have the full symmetries of a square, and you need to use the full dihedral group and equivariant obstruction theory to establish a 2 to the t case. Okay. Still, we're still okay. Okay. And what did I come here to tell you? Of all these cases that we know and that we can produce. These cases that we know and that we can prove in Ramov's conjecture, we now have the Dolnikov generalization of it. So, this is joint work with Sam Murray and Steve Simon and Laura Stemmler. Sam Murray and Laura Stemler are CMU students. Steve Simon is at Bart College. So if 3m is less than 2d, m deviates, the number of color classes deviates from a power of 2 by at most 1. You have m families of polytopes in Rd such that no Fi contains D such that no Fi contains four pairwise disjoint polytopes, then there are two hyperplanes that pierce all these polytopes. So all hyperplane equipartition results for two hyperplanes that we know are corollary of this. You might ask, what's known for like three or more hyperplanes? That's very quickly summarized. For four or more hyperplanes, we have absolutely no optimal results. Absolutely no optimal results. We just have some upper bounds that are terrible. And for three hyperplanes, we have three results. In three dimensions, we can say something. And for one of these, we can also do the three-wise thing. So if F is a family of polytopes in R3 that does not contain eight pairwise disjoint polytopes, the three hyperplane case, then there are three planes that intersect all polytopes. And this again. And this again, this result is also one of these Hardwiger results, right? One of the two Hardwiger results. Statement of the theorem makes sense? Because then I've done what I definitely wanted to do. If the statement of the theorem kind of makes sense to us. Okay. Well, you could ask, oh, you said hyperplane equipartition result. And then if you go up one step, there's some Dolnikov transversal result. Some Dolnikov transversal result, and then if you go up one step, there's some non-embeddability result. So, what about the non-embeddability result? Well, the truth is, that's how we proved it, right? That was a convenient way of proving it. We take the Gale dual and we prove some non-embeddability results. Proof scheme. Okay. So, we are given these M families of polytoles. We need a finite point set to. We need a finite point set to take a Gale dual. What's a good candidate? All the vertices of the polytopes. But we also want to keep track of intersections. So we put a point in every pairwise intersection of polytopes if it's not a vertex. If it doesn't happen to be a vertex, force a point into there. That's some points at x. Consider the Gale dual. What's funny about this is, so Gale duality was invented to study high-dimensional polytopes. That's my understanding. Polytopes, that's my understanding at least, high-dimensional polytopes on vertices that exceed the dimension by a little bit, because when you take a Gale dual of D plus five points in Rd, you're suddenly in four space, which maybe is more manageable. Or let's say D plus three points, suddenly you're in the plane, which you can draw a picture of something, right? But what we do is we're in some nice manageable RD, and we have like a billion points in there, and then we go into a super high-dimensional. There and then we go into a super high-dimensional space via Gale duality to work in the super high-dimensional space, okay. And the reason is that in super high-dimensional space, you have more degrees of freedom, there's more stuff you can do, right? So that might make it easier, okay. So you take the Gale dual. What do you want to do? You, instead of one radon partition, a bisection, you want to find two radon partitions suddenly. You want to, oh, my first hyperplane is a bisection, my second hyperplane is a bisection, and these two radon partitions. And these two Radon partitions interact in a nice way. Okay, so you want to find AB and CD. These are both Radon partitions, such that the four pairwise intersections do not contain the point set of any polytope in Fi. They avoid these Fi. Right? So think of this as all these pairwise intersections between Uranon partitions are large. We force them to be large. Okay. Well, and how do you do that? Okay, well, first I just wrote this and thought I'll leave it at this. This can be established by a certain equivariant map business. I'll say a little more. Let me first give you an example of what such a result looks like. So the example is we have a set in R5. It's a set of 12 points. Four of them are red, four are green, and four are... Four are green and four are blue. Then there are two pairs, two radon pairs, sigma plus sigma minus, tau plus tau minus. They're disjoint subsets. That has to be the case for a radon pair, I guess. This is just saying radon pair, the convex hulls intersect. And the four intersections, so sigma plus intersect tau minus, and so on, all these four intersections are rainbow. They can't be empty, but they're rainbow. So that's one of these radon types. So that's one of these Radon-type results that we need to establish, such that via Gale duality, we get this hyperplane transversal result. Yeah, so I wrote these slides on the plane and was one of these tropical storms, so I couldn't write this theorem. I attempted a few times, and there was always a bump, and so I just went to my paper and copied it for you. So here's the Copied it for you. So here's a general Radon-type statement copied directly from the paper. You know, something about if n is large enough compared to the dimension D and the number of color classes M, and you have a bunch of subsets, this chi of Kg4F less than M means you can split the family F into M families such that no subfamily, every subfamily, if you pick four of them, there's some intersection. Four of them, there's some intersection. There are no four pairwise disjoint sets in any Fi, right? So that's the chromatic number of the Knieser hypergraph of this family. That's one way of phrasing this. Then for any continuous map to Rd, there are two radon pairs such that these intersections, these four intersections between sets in these radon pairs avoid the family F. Maybe one more case just to see that this is not completely unnatural for m equal to one, what this For m equal to one, what this is saying is if you have instead of d plus two, the usual Radon number, you have d plus four points in Rd, then you can find two Radon partitions, and they're as different as possible, meaning all these intersections are roughly of size D over four. So, two very different random partitions. Good. Yeah, and then here's how you see. Yeah, and then here's how you set up this equivariant thing. So, Radon partitions are parametrized by a deleted join of the simplex. You have two Radon partitions, so take a product of this deleted join. A deleted join of a simplex is just a cross-polytope, a boundary of a cross-polytope, so that's a nice sphere. Good. And then you test whether you have a Radon partition. You do that in R to the D plus one squared. That's enough space to test whether you have a Radon partition and another Radon partition. And then in R. Partition. And then in R3 to the M, you test whether you avoid all of these Fi. So there's some symmetry in the background, and now you want to show this thing as a zero. The corresponding hyperplane equipartition result is established by showing that an equivariant map from Sd times Sd to R3 to the M has a zero. This is a strictly weaker result, so we have to show more in the equivariant world. How do we do this? How do we do this? We could have set up the same obstruction theory, it's a little complicated because you have to come up with an equivariant cell complex and then compute the obstructions and so on. So instead, we broke it down to this obstruction by all the differential topology that I know, which isn't a lot, but still some amount of differential topology went into this to show that the obstruction for this thing is the same as the obstruction for that thing. And this we computed earlier, so. We computed earlier, so now we know the obstruction up there as well. And again, it involves this whole full dihedral group of symmetries and so on. Ah, this is if I have time, which I believe I do. So instead of boring you with more details of the proof, I thought I try to convince you that these weird number theoretic conditions, like the number of colors deviates from a power of two by at most one, they make sense. By at most one, they make sense, right? They come up naturally. I'll try to show you where they come up. So suppose we know that we, if you have a map from the two sphere times the one sphere, the one sphere is a circle, the two sphere boundary of a soccer ball, and you map this to R3, and it has these symmetries. f of negative xy is negative of f of xy is f of x negative y. You can flip individually the coordinates. This generically has four times k0. Generically, it has four times k zeros with k odd. I assure you that's true. Let's say we knew this already by induction or something. It has to be four times k just because of the symmetries, right? Zeros come in an orbit of four. And if k is odd, it can't be no zeros at all. So it has to have zeros. Good. If you know this, well, what about a map from S2 times S2 to R4 that has the same kinds of symmetries? Can you maybe break it down to this map up there? And it turns out you can. And it turns out you can. So, what you do is, okay, so here we have this product of two spheres. What you do is, if you maybe in the first factor, you don't do anything, you don't restrict. And in the second sphere, you restrict to the equator. Well, now you have a map from S2 times S1 to R4. Now project onto the first three coordinates. Forget about the last coordinate. And now you have a map from S2 times S1 to R3, and you know something about such maps, right? Maps. So that's this pi here is the projection. Okay. And I'm saying, aha, if I restrict to the upper hemisphere in the first factor and the equator in the second factor, well, then instead of four k0s, I have two k0s by symmetry, because everything that shows up here shows up here, but I'm forgetting about the lower hemisphere. I only have the upper hemisphere. And then lastly, let me grab the last coordinate and say if the last coordinate is positive. Coordinate and say if the last coordinate is positive, that's the zeros I'm interested in. Forget about the negative ones. By symmetry, generically, that's exactly half of them. So you have k zeros. So both this and this have k zeros. And now you just do this. The red bit is zeros of this projected map to R3, forgetting about the last coordinate. It's a nice path by, again, genericity, a nice path of zeros. Path of zeros. And it has to connect zeros on the boundary of this upper hemisphere. And there are some where the last coordinate is positive, and there are some where the last coordinate is negative. And we know something about the parity of these sets. And now you just think about this, right? You just, by intermediate value theorem, if the last coordinate is positive here, and then there's a nice path of zeros of the first three coordinates, and the last coordinate is negative here, well, then you probably had an odd number of zeros in between. And if they're the same sign, you had a number of. And if they're the same sign, you had an even number of zeros in between. Now you work this all out, and what this tells you is: well, you just put it all together, aha, such a map from S2 times S2 to R4 generically has four L L even zeros, because you have an odd number for this S2 times S1 over here, and an odd number for this S1 times S2 over here. So you restrict and you see: is it both odd? Is it both even? Is it both odd? Is it both even, or is it even odd? That's the only question, right? So, one way of saying this is there's a z mod 2 valued obstruction where 4 times Rnm is the number of zeros of an equivariant map from Sn times Sm to Rn plus M mod 8. Okay. And what I just hand-waved for you is a proof that R of nm is actually R of n minus 1m plus R of n m minus 1. You reduce in the first. M minus one. You reduce in the first quarter, you reduce in the second quarter, you add them. If they're the same, you lose. If they're different, you win. Okay, but look at that. That's the same recursion as for binomial coefficients. That's how binomial coefficients, n plus m choose m work. So, or maybe I can say it in a different way. Do I have chalk? Yeah. So said in a different way. Maybe I'll do it away. Okay. You okay, so what is this obstruction? By Bose of Ulam, okay, here's my obstruction. This is n, this is m. By Bose of Ulam, if n is zero, this obstruction is always one, always non-zero, always gives you an obstruction. If n is zero and m is anything, you always have an obstruction. Okay, what about this guy? Well, you have to look down, you decrease m by one. You decrease m by one, and you have to look to the left, you decrease n by one. They're the same, you have no obstruction here. Ah, to the left, down, they're different, you do have an obstruction here. You have no obstruction, you do have an obstruction, you have no obstruction, you do have, but you see how this is how this is going. I'll draw as much as this, I guess. Aha, it's Pascal's triangle, you know, turned a little, and then more two, right? So that's where the number theoretic conditions come from. Okay. Lastly, let me advertise what I think of as the big conjecture in the field. So, Pavlo already mentioned to us that if you Already mentioned to us that if you have two measures in the plane, then there are two lines that cut it into four equal pieces. If you have three measures in R3, this Hartweger result says you have three hyperplanes and they cut it into eight equal pieces. Sorry, one measure. What am I saying? If you have one measure in R3, let me start again. If you have one measure in R3, there are three hyperplanes that cut it into eight equal pieces. Good. You can now make a general conjecture. If you have one measure in Regina, Conjecture. If you have one measure in Rd, there are d hyperplanes that cut it into two to the d equal pieces. In fact, Grunbaum made that conjecture. And it's funny because it's so obviously wrong, right? Because if you have d hyperplanes in Rd, that's d squared degrees of freedom. And if you want to cut one measure into two to the d equal pieces, that's two to the d minus one, equalities that need to be satisfied. So there's no way, right? Unless d is at most four. D is at most 4. Then this might be true. So that leaves open one case. Is it maybe true that any four polytope or point set in R4 or Borel measure with continuous density in R4 can be dissected into 16 equal volume pieces by four hyperplanes. That's wide open. Or if you believe in this transversality world that I just presented, where you have more general transversal results, the question would be, is it true that The question would be: Is it true that for any family of polytopes in R4 with no 16 pairwise disjoint polytopes, there are four hyperplanes that pierce all the polytopes? That's a more general statement. Might also be true. And of course, before coming here, I needed to make sure that this is still open and that nobody had solved this. So, what I did is what you do nowadays, I went to ChatGPT and I asked ChatGPT. And I asked Chad GPT: Can any four-dimensional polytope be dissected into 16 equal volume pieces using four affine hyperplanes? And Chad GPT says, no, that's not true. In fact, you and Gundard Siegler disproved this in 2008. I like that it made up the name 16-cell problem for it, which kind of makes sense. It's a 16-cell problem. It's a 16-cell problem. So that kind of makes sense. And then the rest is total nonsense. I'll leave you with that. Thank you very much. What about the rather than type result for this? Yep. I yep, same question. But now, yeah. Same question. But now, yeah, you now have four radon pairs, and you care about the 16 intersections that you get by, you know, picking the first or the second and the first or the second, right? And you want to avoid some family where the 16 uniform Knieser hypergraph has chromatic number one, meaning it has no edges. Yeah, it's a reasonable question, and it might also be true. You didn't try asking. didn't try scheme. Oh, I did try the scheme. Yeah, yeah, it just doesn't work. Yeah. We'll go back to the oh, sorry. So in this last point, the verbal version is no sixteen terabyte is job version. If you give you sixteen two, then it's very clear that it's not. very clear that you have that like at what moment does it become hope and or is it like easy at 15 and possibly that i i like that question a lot and i don't i don't think i can say anything clever but yeah that's a that's a very good question any other question well if not we think i'll have a hand
