Invitations to talk in this nice conference. So, I will talk on the joint work with Jürgen Olsoli and Boris Wertmann at both Universität of Oldenburg in Germany. And so, let me first describe the plane of my talk. So, I will first describe the YAMAB. So, I will first describe the results about the Yamabeflow in the smooth setting of closed smooth Riemannian manifolds. Then I will explain the geometry, the singular geometry we are studying. And then I will describe the existence of the MAB flow. And then I will say some words about the asymptotic behavior of the YMAB flow for a long time. Yama Be floor for a long time. Okay, so let's first go to the smooth case. When you have a closed Riemannian manifold, the Yamabay flow has been introduced by Richard Hamilton. So this is the gradient flow of the Hilbert functional. So the Hilbert functional is just the integral of a scalar curvature on a conformal class. So you fix a metric, G naughts. You fix a metric G naughts and you look at all other Riemannian metrics that are conformal to G naughts. That is, G is a smooth factor, smooth positive factor times G naughts, and you assume the volume is one. And so then the Yamabay flow is just the gradients of this Hilbert functional on this space, the L2 gradient. And so the question was to solve by parabolic method the Yanabe problem, that is to say, to find conform. That is to say, to find conformal matrix with constant scalar curvature and volume one. Okay, so when you look for such a constant scalar curvature in a conformal class, in fact, you can use a try to find minimizer for the Yamabe invariant. The Yamabe invariant is just the intimum of this Hilbert functional on this conformal class. On this conformal class. And we know that there is always a conformal matrix that reaches this minimum. And so that, in fact, it has also constant scalar curvature. So this problem has been solved over many years by Yannabe, Triniger, Ober and Schun. And as a short abstract of the story, the main result are the following. The first result that I want to talk about is by OB. That I want to talk about is by Obern. So he shows that first is Yamabe invariant for all smooth manifolds is always less than the Yamabe invariant of a sphere. And Oberon then shows that if you have strict inequality, then you find a minimizer. So if you want this condition of strict in some way, is when you look at minimizing sequence is to say that you do not have a Say that you do not have a bubble that appears. And then, finally, the final touch has been obtained by Schoen and also by Obin, that if you have equality between the Yannabe invariant of the manifold and the sphere, then in fact you are conformal to the sphere so that you get in a conformal class a metric with constant scalar curvature. So, in crucial steps for the final result to show. The final result of Shun was the positive mass theorem proved by Schoen and Yaus just some years before. For the Yamabe flow on the smooth settings and on closed manifold, here is a brief summaries of the results. The first is that the Yamabe flow exists for all times. And then there is a dichotomy. You have either convergence or concentrations. Convergence or concentrations. Concentrations means formations of bubbles. It means that if you have no formations of bubbles, then you have the convergence. So I make a picture to explain what are these bubbles. It means that at some point, the geometry looks like a spherical ones. And I put this picture, but a priori, you can have several bubbles. You can bubble over bubbles. So the picture can be very complicated. And the point is that positive mass theorems. The point is that positive mass theorems prevent the formation of bubbles. So, if you are in a setting where you know you have a positive mass theorems, then you know that you have convergence. And the difficulty is that up to recently, the positive mass theorem is not known in every case. So, this mostly came from work of Swedlik and Struver and done by Brandel. Okay, let's turn to the the singular space. The singular space we are looking at. The singular space we are looking at are stratified space and all with iterate edge metrics. So, let me first spend some minutes on describing explicit examples. So, imagine we are looking at the geometry of a surface of a cube. Okay, so it's a 2D object, and you are living on the surface of the cube. Then, if you are on the surface of the cube, you can see the side of the side. You are on the surface of the cubes, you can you have different points, other you are in the interior of the face in these white regions. And in this white region, it's clear the geometry is Euclidean around you. You see the same geometry as in R2. Okay, now if you are on the edge, on the edge, in fact, you see these two half-disks that are glued together, but in fact, you can unfold. But in fact, you can unfold this disk, and the geometry you see is also flat. Okay, it's also Euclidean. So it's a smooth. In fact, along the edge, the geometry is smooth. Okay, and now if you look at the vertex, what you have, you have three quarter of plane that are glued together. Okay, so what you have, in fact, Okay, so what you have in fact is a cone. The geometry here is a cone over a circle of length three pi over two. So three right angle. Okay, so at the end, as a summary for the geometry of the cubes, the surface of the cube, you have a decomposition such as you have eight points of eight vertex outside these eight. Vertex. Outside this eighth vertex, the geometry is Euclidean, nearby you are as in Ner2. And around this eighth vertex, the geometry is a cone over a circle of the length three right angles, three P over. Now we can look at a similar picture for a surface of a pillow. Okay, so a pillow, you can two sheets of papers of toile, and then you glue them together and you obtain these geometric objects. Geometrics objects. Okay, so here you have four singular points, and along this four singular point, in fact, you have a cone over a circle of len pi. Okay, so you have for the surface of a pillow, you have outside four singular points, the geometry is flat, it's Euclidean, and at these four vertex, the geometry or this point is a cone over a circle of length pi. Circle of line pi. Okay, well let's go now to the last 2D example. It's a surface of a Berlino. So a Berlin Go is suite. And so you manage to do some geometry along this phase. So what you do, you take a sphere and you cut your sphere in eight pieces and you have one PC, so it's a triangle with three right angles. With three right angles. And then you take two of these pieces and you glue them together. Okay, so if you glue them together along the first thing, you glue along and then you get this thing. So again, along the edge, the geometry is smooth. It's like on your sphere. And now if you look at what you have on the vertex here, you have to identify the two quarters of hemisphere here. Of a hemisphere here. So here again, it's a cone, but it's a spherical cone over a circle of line pi. Okay, so this is the surface of a berlango. And so again, the surface of Berlin Go, you have outside three vertex, the geometry is spherical, so it's Riemannian. And around this three vertex, the geometry is a cone or spherical cone. Geometry is a cone or spherical cone over a circle of length pi. Okay, so curvature, if you want, is one everywhere, except at these three points, or in fact, of Dirac mass. Okay, now let's turn to our last example. It's more complicated. It's a 3D example. It's a double solid cubes. So you take two cubes and you identify the faces. Okay. And then you also identify the yellow and the Yeah, the yellow and the you identify also the blue face, like this one. Okay, okay. So now, if you are in the interior of the cubes or on the interior of the face, the geometry you see is a 3D Euclidean geometry. Okay, you don't see any singularities. Now you have then two remaining case. The first case, when you are on the edge, so on the edge, what you have? So, on the edge, what you have the locally the geometry is a product of the segment, and you have a half disk, and then you have to identify on this half disk the two radius. Okay, so what you have, it's a cone over a half disk, and then you fold it in this way. So, it's a so the geometry along the edge is a product of a segment and a cone over a segment. And a cone over a circle of length pi. Okay, now let's turn to the last to the last species. Okay, so what appears on the vertex of the cubes? So on the vertex of the cube, you have to do, you have to glue together two of these solid objects, right? The solid objects. So what are these solid objects? This is a cone over a h quarter of a sphere. And then you have to glue them together. And then you have to glue them together. So, what you have, in fact, it's a cone over a bernamble. Okay, so if you have a abstract of the geometry of the double solid cubes, the solid tube has a decomposition where outside the edge, the geometry is Euclidean, along the edge, interior of the edge. So you have 12 unit segments, and nearby the geometry is a product. Is a product of the interval with the cone over a circle of length pi. Okay, and then if you see what you have to do, you have to understand what is the geometry where these two three singular lines intersect. Okay, and at the vertex, you have eight point the geometry is a Euclidean cone over a bare angle. So over a A bare angle. So, a very singular object with three points. So, you get these three lines. Okay, so what are the, in general, the space we are looking at? So, it is stratified space, and the bad object are cone over metric space. So, there is a formula. So, you take a complete metric space with distance d sigma, and the cone over sigma is just a compression of the product of the positive abolition in sigma. The positive alpha line in sigma with the following distance. So, if you take two points, P and Q, so P is T X and Q is S Y, so you have two different pictures, two different case. If the points on the sigma are far away, distance bigger than pi, then the distance is just the sum of the distance to the tips of the code. Okay, it means that the geodesics to go to P to Q, you go to the vertex and then you come back to the point. And then you come back to the point. And if the distance is smaller than pi, then you get this distance. This formula and the formula is just the al-cachy formula for the distance between two points in the R2. Okay, and then to obtain the, what you have to do, you have to blow down zero times sigma to a point to see the total geometry of this code. Okay, now what are Stratify space, so stratified space with the iterate edge matrix. It's a compact matrix space with the stratifications. So you have a piece of dimension n, then you have a piece of dimensions n minus two, so we don't assume you have a piece of dimensions n minus one, you have no boundary if you want, and then you have a piece of smaller dimensions. Okay, so now at each point, regular points are the geometry is in fact Riemannian, smooth. Geometry is in fact Riemannian, smooth, and of dimension n, okay, on the regular part. And then, if you are on a point of a car-dimensional strata minus the car-dimensional one, the geometry exactly look like, I don't want to introduce the right definitions, a product of the flat RK times a cone over some singular space that is also a stratified space but of lower dimensions. Okay, so it's a Okay, so it's a kind of inductive definition. In order to understood the definitions, we need to have the definitions of what is the n minus k minus one dimensional stratified space. Okay, so it's quite complicated, but if you have in mind the picture of the tube of a double solid cube, then it's exactly this case. So now, what is the scalar curvature of such a stratified space? So the regular Space. So the regular part is a smooth, open Riemannian manifold. And in fact, we can extend because the volumes of the n minus 2 of the singular part is zero, we can extend the scalar functions to be measurable functions. And a priori, we have that the scalar curvature blowups laps the one over the distance squared to the singular set. Okay, a priori. If you impose some over. If you impose some other conditions, some smaller decays, then it will imply some particular geometry of the singular stratum. Okay, now we introduce the space H1. It's just a completion of Leipschitz functions. So it's a priori or space only. It's a metric space. So we can speak about what is Lipschitz functions with respect to the usual H1 norms. Then, if you have a positive smooth functions on the regular part, you can still define the conformable matrix. And then we define its Yamabay invariance to be the infimum over all such u of the scalar curvature, provide it's integrable and so on. But in fact, it's very important that we've all codimached. Important that with our codimensions assumptions, the fact that we do not have piece of codimension one, we know that smooth functions with compact support in the regular set are dense in H1. So in fact, this Yamabay invariant, if you want, is the same thing as the Yamabay invariant of, in fact, the open manifold X-reg. And it's also the, you can take the infimum over all U in each one of X of this quantity. This quantity. Okay, so now the Yamabe flow in the smooth setting is a parabolic flow. So it means that if you write the conformal matrix that G is U to this power 4 over N minus 2 G naught, you have this equation. So the variation on time of U is up to something. So the main point is that it's a parabolic equation plus the resistance. Equations plus is the resistance u to the power minus 4 and minus 2 in front of the Laplacians. So it's a parabolic equations with some non-linearity. Okay, so be careful. My conversions for the Laplacians is the one, when you integrate by part, you have no signs, meaning that when you look at the formula, the pediance setting, then there is a minus in front of the second derivative. Okay, so our main result is that if you have a stratified space of dimensions greater than two, and its G naught is a Raymond metric on X-reg that is stratified and so on, so that its Yamabay invariant is positive with volume one. And so we have to impose some constraints on the scalar curvature. We assume that the scalar curvature is in L P for some P that it's Is in L P for some p that is strictly bigger than n over two. Then the result is that there is a long time existence to the Yamabe flow that starts from G nodes. Okay, so if you want, this is a parabolic counterpart of some existent results for the Yamabe problem that I have obtained with Kezu Akutuketagawa and Rafe Mazio seven years before. Okay, so what was some word on the Some word on the existence. So, in fact, we use some functional analytic method to solve this type of equation. So, dt du over dt is equal to u to some power beta multiplied by minus lu vu. Okay, and so on which setting? So, beta is any real number. So, let me introduce what is v and l so. Is V and L. So we are looking on Dirichlet space. So, Dirichlet space is a quadruple where the first letters it's a measure metric space. Here we assume the measure is one, so it's a probability measure. And then you have a closed, densely defined quadratic forms, E. And L is just the Frederick extensions of E, meaning that you get the quadratic forms evaluated to U. The quadratic forms evalu to u and such on good function u is just a scalar product of lu with u. Okay, and the third or fourth hypothesis is that we have the sublf inequalities, the usual subof inequalities, and if you want, and plus the fact that v is in L P for P p n over two. So in this case, we get an abstract existence result. Results for short times on this type of equations. Okay. And if you want these frameworks, it generalizes on the abstract setting the usual Laplacian scale. So where of U is just the Dirichlet emergence, the integrals of du square. So in fact, the Once you have this, you have to verify a certain number of hypotheses, but it is really easy provided you find the right theorems in these very good books by Alexandra Lunardi. Well, it's yeah, it's really good abstract results for existence of non-linear parabolic equations. So it's a very instructive, and then once you have. Instructive, and then once you have these two in hand, we have to check some hypothesis, but it's really easy to get the existence theorem. Okay, so let's come back to our results. So, this is a priori, a short-time existence. And what is about the long-time existence? The trouble is that we do not know whether the scalar curvature The scalar curvature, its Laplacian Z naught, is not necessary in Lp. Okay, so in fact, what happened is that the regularity of scalar curvature moves with time. But in fact, it's not, the theorem tells us that the Laplacian G applied to the scalar curvature is in L P. Okay, so in fact, it's implied also that as soon as you have positive times, the scalar curvature is in fact in L infinity. Even if it's at the beginning, it's not. Even if at the beginning it's not bounded. Okay, and once you have this, you can deduce scalar curvature estimates from this equation, that is equation that is true in the smoke setting. And then because you have integration by part and so on, you can run the usual proof for long-time existence and ensure the long-time existence. So I think I have only three minutes. So let me give. Let me give a brief summary about the Large Time behavior. So, we have also obtained a dichotomy between compactness and concentrations, that is, formations of bubbles. But we do not have positive mass theorems in full generality. And so we know there are examples where only concentrations occur, you have no concentrations. So, let me briefly introduce something. Brief introduce something. So, what is the general behavior? The general behavior is that if you have solutions of the Yamabe flow, so you can extract sub-sequence and the solutions of the Yamabe equation so that along this sub-sequence, you get weak convergent in each one, and you get if you want smooth convergent outside a finite set. And so, if you do not have this singular set, then you. Do not have this singular set, then you have contingent. So, let me give finish with some questions that we are not able to solve. So, for instance, is it possible that concentrations occur at smooth point? Okay, so I don't know. Is it possible also that you have two scenarios? That is to say, for instance, you have two sub-sequence such that along one sequence you get only one sequence. Along one sequence, you get only weak convergence and concentrations along some singular and some points, so formations of bubbles. But along the other sequence, you get smooth convergence. I do not know if it is possible to have transitions between something that is very smooth on long time and then it becomes singular on a long time and then come back and come back. And so, on some cases, we know that there is no Yamabay minimizer. So, there is no solutions of the Yamabay problem. So, there is no conformal matrix with constant scalar curvature that is equal to the minimizer. Okay, so the question is, does in this case, so in this case, the elliptic metals, the variational metals, do not find metric with constant scalar curvature. So, the question is, does in this case So the question is, does in this case Yamabe flow finds other metric with constant scalar curvature? So there are, for instance, two occurrences where you do not get a Yamabin minimizer. You have a recent result by Akutagawa Montpel for a branch cover of a sphere. So on the sphere, you have sub-sphere of dimensions, aqua dimension two, and then you make branch cover. So you have along these spheres. Have along this sphere of codimension two, you have in the smooth case, you have angle two pi, and here you take angle four pi, six pi, and so on. And so what they show that in this case, you don't have Yamabay minimizer. And you have also a result of Brandel's. So it's not stated in the paper, but the conclusion of the result of Brandel is that if you have a LA manifold with non-negative riching, then either you are flat or you do not have existence of Herman. Or you do not have the existence of Yamabay minimizer. So thank you very much. I'll finish. So we thank you very, very much for the very nice talk. And now it's time for questions. Please just open the mic and do the question. I have a question. Please go ahead. Please go ahead. Yes. So is your flow converging to a metric with a constant scalar curvature? First question. Do you know the rate of convergence? Third question. Do you know of any example in which you In which you cannot have a global existence of the flow, and you have global existence. We have global existence. Yes, you have global existence. But do you know of any example in which, I don't know, singularity in the manifold would produce a finite time blow-up, say, not so. Yeah, just yeah, for other kinds of. Yeah, just yeah, for other kind of flow you mean. Or yeah, I d I don't I don't know, but yeah, for or related flow, yeah, because the trouble, yeah, so assuming you have these equations for scalar curvature, then it's fine. But perhaps if you look at perturbed flow, it's possible that you get some singularity. You get some singularities. I think there are some recent results in the smooth case where you do not have this kind of blow-ups if you look for a perturbed Yamabe flow. So not the RAV flow, but other. I think I saw a recent paper on, I don't remember, but where you produce bubbles that can occur. But in this case, for Yamabeflow, Occurs. But in this case, for Yamabe flow, you do not have, and troubles appear in infinite times. But we have examples, very simple examples in 4D, where you, in fact, you have no, so the solution goes to zero along the regular part, and you have only one singular point. And at this singular point, we have a bubble that appears. So, all the mass of the solution, so. Of the solution, so the mass is one along the flow, and the mass concentrates along the singular point. Thanks. Do you have information on the rate at which you approach at infinity? In the smooth case, it goes exponentially. But here we don't know in fact. Here we don't know in fact. We do even don't know if we have no found, we can find criterion to ensure convergence and this convergence imply exponential decay. But we do not know here. Okay, thanks. Okay, are there any other questions? Just hope and we can ask. Meanwhile, maybe I can address one question. You were talking about the condition, Laplace, of the scalar curvature in L P with P greater than n over two, if I don't remember badly. If I don't remember badly, yes. Can you explain a bit more that condition? I mean, is this condition some kind of optimal? Because it is related to what happened in the Euclidean setting. In the Euclidean setting, you look at the operator, a Schrödinger operator, Laplacian plus potential. So if you want the domain of this operator to be the same. Domain of this operator to be the same as the domain of the operator, so v to be a small perturbation, exactly you arrive to these conditions. Ah, okay, okay, I see, I see. Because in the regularity of solutions of Laplacian U plus V U is zero, okay, in fact, it's related to this. It's related to, so the threshold is V in L P and P bigger than N over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was thinking about the fast diffusion equation where you just need n one minus m over two, which you can go a bit below the n by two threshold and still get. Yeah, but if you in this abstract existence theorem, V says essentially it is a small perturbation of L. So if you want to look at To look at the
