I'm coming here and I hope that you will feel curious to know more about the association of remaining mathematical physics. And I'm going to mention this at the end because this has, in my experience, I've found an incredible value in meeting with other people. And like, for example, you're doing now here. You're doing now here in this workshop, but also what the association wants to do. And I found it really extremely helpful to me as a mathematician. And so I hope that I'm all on board for, I hope with this association, we'll be able to share a lot with people doing mathematical physics and women and with problems that are really specific to Specific to people that identify as female and are minorities in this case. So the title of this talk, it sounds a bit like self-help talk. And it is actually a little bit that, but from a very, very humble point of view, because I mean, I know I like to talk about role models, but I never like to put myself. About role models, but I never like to put myself in front as a role model, of course. But I have to do it a bit here, but not with the idea of giving you role models, but to share with you my experience, which might be helpful to know. I think it's always good to know what other people are doing. Or when I was younger, so I have to say here that I'm 40 and I got tenured last September. Last September. So, okay, I've solved a couple of things. I still have other things to solve, but I have solved a couple of things that were my main concern when I was a PhD student or a postdoc. But I did it in a way that was not very linear. And I used to think that there was only one way to get a permanent position in academia and to be. academia and to be fulfilled in academia. But then I realized with the years that, yeah, that was a very naive, that was very naive of me and it wasn't the case. So if you have probably hear this word, ikigai, which means purpose. And I'm not going to the details of the Japanese part because I'm using it as an excuse to talk about. Using it as an excuse to talk about this. The Ikigai concept is used in Western society as this Venn diagram that combines what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. And when these things meet, then you have the perfect environment to really do your thing. Live from it so that your basic needs are met. And it's something that you have a passion to do it, and it also you have this feeling of fulfillment that you're actually contributing something and you're actually doing something that makes sense. Now, this is also related to the idea of: well, what is your place in academia? When we are, well, I'm going to speak for myself. I hope maybe you will feel identified at some point. I don't know if you have everything figured out. There might be people that have everything figured out at your age, but that was not at all my case. I'm really speaking to, you know, my baby, Connie, that used to be, you know, really trying to figure out things. Really, trying to figure out things and not feeling quite fitting in this environment. So, academia can be very hostile to people when they show their differences. So, it's not at all diverse. I mean, there is a big diversity issue in academia. It's very conservative. It's very traditional. And when you come from minorities, well, this is definitely a problem that you don't feel, I mean, I don't feel welcome in such an environment. Welcome in such an environment. So that's why it's so important to find one's place in academia because the way that the system works, it can be that it can be giving you like the signal of you don't fit, you don't have a place here, but that's actually not at all true. It's a version that we might see in the surface. But this is the main point that I want to do today: yes. want to do today is that yes, if you find your purpose, you have a place. You can make your place in academia. And this is not a recipe that works for everyone. I mean, everyone has to figure out their own way. It's not something that, I mean, this took me a while to understand. It's not, you know, the problem doesn't stop when you find your job, when you become a postdoc or when you, you know, when you feel. Or when you finish your PhD, things are not solved quite there. When you get your tenure track job, no, you're not done yet. When you get your permanent position, you think, okay, now I did it, now it's over. No, no, it's not. It's really, you know, this idea of a race that I think is not great for everyone. This idea of competitivity. This idea of competitivity, like it's a competition and you have to compete with other people. This is not, I think, this is really not good for what we are doing in academia. So I wanted to share a little bit of my experience and my path with you. And I asked you to bring pen and paper because at the end I'm going to ask you to maybe think a bit of what your purpose. Your purpose is and your place in academia is. Okay, so let me keep this idea of Aki guys or what you love, what you're good at. So what you can be paid for. So I assume that we're talking about being in academia. So we want to get jobs in academia, okay? Being paid to do our job, to do maths. You're all mathematicians here. So I guess that you love. So, I guess that you love math to a certain degree, and you are good at math to a certain degree, of course. And that what the world needs. So I guess that so this is actually a good question. Like, do you feel like your work is really contributing to society? Okay, this is something that I'm gonna go back to in a while. So, let me show you something. Let me show you something. In 2021, I was still applying for jobs and this was my last job application. And in one of the slides, I had this Vann diagram to explain to the audience where I was standing. So this position was for a teaching position, but actually it was half teaching, half research in teaching. But they wanted someone who But they wanted someone who was a math researcher, but that could also be interested in doing pedagogy, so creative teaching, and not just teaching full-time. And I wanted to really convey the idea that, look, I actually do all these things and I like doing all these things. And why this slide was important for me was that it took me years to come to the conclusion that I Come to the conclusion that I actually am a person that does all these things and that they're all equally important to me. And why I say this because so my research is in mathematical physics is I do I work on quantum disordered quantum systems. So these I study mostly one body particle one particle systems like electrons. Like electrons moving in some material with impurities, and the way one models that is with probabilities and functional analysis and Hilbert spaces and whatnot. So that's my research, and I love my research topic. I'm not brilliant. I never consider myself that good. Maybe that's why also I've always had this feeling that I don't quite fit. But yeah, yeah, but I do research. Yeah, but I do research. I do research in this field. And I also do teaching and I organize courses and I create new courses. And I like this very much. I like teaching. But I don't like teaching, you know, the traditional way. I actually like, you know, I get bored pretty easily. So I like to change courses. I like to teach stuff that undergraduate, of course, stuff that I've never taught. There's many things. I've never taught, there's many things that I've never taught and that I would like to, that I'm naturally inclined to. For example, next semester I'm going to do a course of statistics. I've never done that, but I do a lot of probabilities. So I thought, okay, this is something that I would love to do with students. And so I really like teaching and I like innovative teaching. And I also like science communication. And actually, one of the things why I One of the things why I was invited here is because I do illustrations. I'm an illustrator. I'm a part-time professional illustrator, if one can do that. But it has taken me years to realize and to come to the point of saying, yes, I am a mathematician slash illustrator. I do science communication seriously. And I am a science communicator too. I'm a teacher and I'm a researcher. I'm a teacher and I'm a researcher. It is a lot, and you might ask, oh, yeah, well, but have you have time to do that? That's a very good question. And that we can discuss about later. But I wanted to focus on this idea that since I was doing my PhD and my master, everywhere I would look around, I would see my colleagues, my teachers, my classmates. I would always see that, well, I would always see that, well, mathematicians were just researchers. You know, this is what you do, this is what you want to do. Teaching is something that you have to do in order to do research, in order to have your job. But for many people, teaching is not so important. Oh, just do the verb minimum, doesn't matter. Unless you do some graduate courses and then it's really interesting because you can talk about your research. Okay. And I always thought, oh, by the way, you can interrupt me at any. By the way, you can interrupt me at any point and at any moment. And also tell me if I'm too fast. Don't hesitate to interrupt me. I don't see very well the audience or I don't hear very well. So, well, and I can also help with interruptions. So I always had this idea of this, like, this is a mono, mono-thematic thing. Being a mathematician, you only do research and you are measured. Research, and you are measured by the research you do, by the impact of your research. And that's it. And this is how you get a job. And the goal of this game is to get a permanent position. And that's it. And this was my idea, like early in my career. And well, and then at some point I realized that, well, actually, you know, I'm not fully satisfied. I'm not fully satisfied just doing research. I mean, my research is not going to, I mean, I'm not going to get the Fields Medal. It's not going to be a revolution, but I think it's, you know, it's good. It's, you know, it contributes something. But it's like, I don't want to be just measured by that because I don't think that all my potential is seen there. Because I like doing science communication and I can do other things. I'm very good at applying for grants, although it's something that a lot of people hate. But somehow in the process of doing it so often, I became quite, I actually like applying for grants. It's a nice exercise, I find it. It's like writing. If you like writing, you might identify with this feeling that, oh, I like writing. That oh, I like writing. Me, I can say I like applying writing grant applications. It's nice. Um, and uh, I'm very good at project management and I like to communicate my research. I like to talk about it, I like to write uh articles and proposals and I love collaborating with people, I love working with other people and organize workshops and events. Um, so So, you see, just being measured by my age index, to me, that doesn't work. I don't think this is a good measure of what I can contribute to the community. And since I was realizing that, well, in academia, it's really hard to get a job. There is a lot of competition and there are many jobs. Many jobs. So I have to think of what happens if I cannot get a job in academia. What will I do? And there are a huge amount of things that one can do outside of academia. And one, you know, as a PhD student or a postdoc, I think I had a tendency to be blindsided by this, like, oh, what are the options? If I fail to get a job in academia, what am I going to do? Going to do? I don't know. But then I was doing postdocs in Germany. And I realized that actually, I mean, for my friends doing, I was a postdoc back then, but for my friends doing PhDs and being postdocs, going out of academia, it was something that was really, you know, it was a good option. But there was often this feeling of, ah, I failed academia. I failed academia, so I have to go. And then they would get these super fancy jobs in the private sector and then completely forget that at some point they were sad for leaving academia. But so I started realizing that, huh, okay, there are options, but these options are maybe not for me. Actually, I always kept teaching as a plan B and because I like teaching from the very beginning. From the very beginning, when I started studying math, I always thought, oh, yeah, I can be a teacher. That would be good. And I'm going to show you later in some other slides how I became more and more, let's say, fluent in science communication and illustration. And as these sites started taking more of my time, I started thinking, okay, well, this could also be my plan B. Oh, actually, if I do not make it in academia, I do not make it in academia. I'm going to go to science communication. I would like that. Yes, that would be a job that I would like. Okay. And then while I was, you know, in the fight for jobs and figuring out what to do next and thinking, okay, one postdoc, great. Second postdoc, hmm, I don't want to do a third postdoc. I mean, if I, you know, because there is also this question on when do you leave? Question: On when do you leave? You have invested so much in this. When do I get out of academia? And then I was in Dermos, I came back to France and a friend of mine, we were chatting for lunch and a friend of mine who's a researcher in another field, he told me he knew that I love illustration, that I love science communication, and I draw. He knew that, oh, funny, you know, she likes to draw. You know, she likes to draw. She draws a lot. And one day he surprised me with this comment that he told me, you know, I have a feeling that you really, we were talking about jobs and about job applications. And I was in France with a non-permanent contract. So I was worried about what was going to happen next with my contract. Was it going to be renewed? Was I going to have to apply again or look for jobs outside of? Again, or look for jobs outside of academia. I was talking about that. And his comment was like, But Kuni, I think you really enjoy research. I mean, why are you thinking like it's either research or something else without research? Can you combine both of them? Can you combine research and science communication? To which my answer was like, but are you crazy? I mean, who is going to give me a job? Who makes jobs for Who makes jobs for research/slash science communication? There are no jobs for that. I mean, nobody, I mean, I haven't seen any job offer or an ad that where universities are looking for a researcher that also does science communication. Okay, yeah, it's true, but you could actually make this. You could make your own position. Maybe if the university sees that you're good at That you're good at this, that you like doing this, maybe they would come to an understanding with you, an agreement, and maybe you could stay in a job where you can do research and science communication because you do like both. Why would you like to quit research? It seems like you like your topic when you talk about it. You seem to be enjoying it. I'm like, yeah, that is true. I mean, I love my topic. Research is hard, but I really love my topic. Research is hard, but I really love my topic and I'm still very curious about it. And for me, it was pretty clear that I wanted to stay at the university. I wanted to stay in some research institution because I like science. And I was thinking, okay, if I cannot stay as a professor then or as a lecturer, then I can maybe be in the administration. I can be a project manager or I can work. Can work, be a bureaucrat, and somehow stay connected to research and stay connected to science. But although the comment was a very simple comment, until then, I had never thought that I could do both. It was always like, either I do research or I get out of that and I do science communication. I cannot do both. And that made me think, although... So that made me think, although I had a lot of, you know, I had a lot of, you know, my answer was like, no, you're crazy. I mean, no, I cannot, nobody's going to give me a job for that. But that made me think that, ha, okay, maybe I don't have to renounce to one to find a job. And so I was really during these last years before getting tenure. Last years before getting tenure, I was really trying to work on these three aspects of my professional life, of my career in an equal way. I was really interested, reading a lot about teaching, trying new things. I was still doing my research and collaborating, writing grants, getting grants, and also working in science communication. It was very, very Science communication. It was a very, very tiring period because I was doing a lot of stuff. But I felt like, okay, you know, I have a contract for a couple of more years. And this is giving me the freedom because academia has this advantage that it's very flexible. You have your, you know, your contract, you have your monthly salary, and you have to do your research and your teaching, but the rest of the time, you can do whatever you want. So I really used this fact that I was. Really used this fact that I was at the university to do all these three things and to do a lot of them and to do a lot of illustration, which is how I do science communication mostly. This is my format, my preferred format. And just to give you now a little background, because I've talked about, okay, when I was my postdoc in Germany, when I came back to France, just to give you a little idea of why my Uh, idea of my career and why I say, you know, moving a lot. I moved a lot, I've been very mobile. I started in, I'm from Chile, from the north of Chile, not even the capital. I mean, nobody knows this town, this city, unless you're an astronomer, because there are many observatories. And as there are many observatories in this city, the main, the standard choice, the good choice at the university was a strong. Good choice at the university was astronomy. And I started, when I went to the university, I started in the physics program thinking, ah, maybe I can do astronomy. This seems to be a hot topic. But then when I was in this program, I also had maths. And then I realized that I really liked the math. I never showed a particular interest for maths. I was just okay, fine, good. Yeah, I knew math was part of life. Yeah, I was. I knew math was part of life, but I was never too interested. I never even thought that one could be a, I didn't know one could be a professional mathematician, actually. I thought, yeah, you can be a math teacher, and that's okay. But when I went to do my bachelor, I thought of, I want to do physics and astronomy. And then inside the bachelor, I realized that, oh, the math taught at the university was something completely different from what I was. Completely different from what I was used to. So I got into the math program and I continued and I continued and I went to do a master in Paris. And then after this master in Paris, I spent some time in I spent three months in Stockholm as a postdoc, as some nine months in Slovenia, and then I got a postdoc, but this was my really official, first official postdoc for two years. Postdoc for two years. I had a mercury grant, individual grant, to do a postdoc in Munich. And there I had to do only research. I didn't have any teaching duties. And my grant, it was part of the grant because this is a European grant. They asked me to do some outreach. And as outreach, I started a blog that is called The Rage of the Blackboard. Is called The Rage of the Blackboard. And there I started interviewing women in mathematics because at that time, when I arrived to Germany, I realized that we were so few women. I hadn't seen that before. I hadn't seen that in France doing my studies. But in Germany, I really, really felt it at the postdoc level. I was really, I would often find myself just the only woman in the room. I would see that there were. I would see that there were half and half men and women at the undergraduate level, but then at the PhD level, things got weird and there were few women. And then at the professoral level, it was like maybe there was one woman in some floor and yeah, that was it. And so because of that, I started wondering like, okay, but how. I started wondering, like, okay, but how? So, the women that are in academia, that are professors, how did they manage to do this? I don't know if you have ever asked the same question, but I had this question in my mind when I was a postdoc. Like, how just I wanted to be in front of women professors and ask them, how did you manage? Tell me, what do I have to do? How do I, what do I do in order to get like where you are? And of course, you cannot approach people like that because. Cannot approach people like that because they would feel terrorized. But I was lucky enough to find some people that understood my question, that understood my feeling, like, yes, that's completely understandable that you want to know this. And they were able to share, they were very generous to share their time to talk to me. So I started this blog where I would interview women, professors. uh professors um to to talk about academia and uh in order for me to learn to learn about about them about their paths and their experience and how do they cope with the with challenging things in academia and um and at the same time i started doing so i i also saw this as an opportunity to practice my writing because i was writing the articles and also as an opportunity Articles and also as an opportunity to do to practice my illustrations here. Because, I mean, if you go to this website, which is, I don't work on it anymore, but it's still there, you will see that the articles are written by with my name, okay, but the illustrations are by someone else. And back then, I was afraid that people were going to see that I was doing something else besides mathematics. I thought, okay, writing. I thought, okay, writing articles, it's a stretch. But I was too afraid to let people see that I was also drawing the illustrations. So I came up with a pseudonym that I would use everywhere so that people wouldn't find out that it was me who was doing the illustrations. And it might seem a little stupid, but it was a real feeling of I don't want people to take me less seriously. Seriously, I was really afraid that my colleagues were going to, you know, say negative things or criticize me because I wasn't fully focused on doing maths. On the weekends, I was doing illustrations. I mean, come on, you should be working. So I kept it hidden. I used this pseudonym for like four or five years. And I was really afraid to, I was really making an effort. Afraid to, I was really making an effort to keep the things separated, like my illustration activities and my math activities. Now, after that, Munich, I went to Bonn for two years and a half, and then I kept doing research, and now I'm starting to teach a little bit more. And then I discovered something that is sketchnoting and graphic recording. I discovered that while I was doing, while I was in one, and I was thinking of a plan B. One and I was thinking of a plan B again, thinking, okay, what do I do if this doesn't work? I mean, my second postdoc is stressful. I need to find something else to do. If I don't get a job, if I don't get a tenure track position, next year, maybe I should leave academia. And while I was doing this, I discovered this format that combines language and a written language and a visual language. A written language and a visual language that the visual language for me does come naturally because I do a lot of illustrations. But the sketchnoting gave me really like a format where I felt like my training in mathematics had prepared me particularly well to do that. And I really felt like, oh my God, yes, because in this format, you have to detect a lot of structure in what you're hearing. In what you're hearing. I'm going to mention in a second what I don't know if all of you have heard this term before or not. I'm going to explain a bit more in a second. So I found the thing is that I found a format to do, to combine my skills of drawing. I felt I was also using my skills that I learned through mathematics. And my skills and a good format. Skills and a good format to do science communication. So I started doing that. Well, at the same time where I was in born, I started organizing events. Also, I organized a young women workshop for women in mathematics and probability and analysis. And just to give you an example, that yes, I was also interested in organizing events to bring women together as I was really feeling. I was really feeling that the experience of women in mathematics was really different from the experience of men in mathematics at that stage. So, to show you a bit more about the sketchnotes, so I discovered this format. This is something that you do. The graphic recording is something that you do, you're listening to someone talking or you're listening to a meeting, you hear people discussing and then you draw the conversation. And then you draw the conversation. And of course, you have to synthesize what is being discussed in such a way that is appealing to the eye and such a way that it uses a lot of visual elements and writing. And I really found, I had a lot of fun doing this. And for me, it was a discovery. It blew my mind. I was thinking, oh my God, this is so nice. I can mix writing. I can mix writing, I can mix my drawings. Of course, this is not realistic drawing. And actually, the people that do this professionally, many of them, they started at the point where they didn't draw. So this is really not art. This is a way of taking notes, visual notes. That's it. If you're good at taking notes, you add some visual components and you have this sketchnoting/slash graphic recording. Sketchnoting slash graphic recording. So, graphic recording is done live, as you see in these pictures. That is me in a conference doing this, practicing. And sketchnoting is more, you know, offline, let's say, not necessarily a live thing that you do at the same time. And this format, what you see here, This format, what you see here, so this is this idea when I was listening to Stephen Mail giving smail giving a talk. And I found, I really found in a way in the sketchnote, I found like the place where I could combine many things. And I really felt like this was, okay, now I see through the eyes of the iki guy, this would be like a point of. be like a point of intersection where my skills meet and uh and actually people can do this professionally so at some point i thought ha maybe if i do not go to academia i can do this professionally so i can get paid for it and this would be you know like the point that really uh puts everything together so while i was doing um now while i was what while that was happening what while that was happening i was also applying for jobs and i got a position uh in my last uh with the last hope i had i got a position as a junior professor in dusseldorf and there well i was a junior professorships in in germany are a bit of a weird uh uh construction it's like you are you're not a full professor but you're not a postdoc there so you're really you know people really don't know how to how know how to how to how to deal with you like you don't fit in the in the cases um uh so so it was like i have mixed feelings with this with this experience during that time i found that so what i was what was expected from me was to do a lot of high impact research and graduate teaching and um and i realized that i wasn't truly fulfilled That I wasn't truly fulfilled with this. Like, I wanted to continue my practice with sketchnoting, I wanted to continue doing social science communication. And I felt like I was pushed into a frame that I wasn't very comfortable in. It didn't give me much flexibility. The teaching, I couldn't. Yeah, this is something that I missed that I. That I had to teach in my, I was in the probability group, so I only could teach probability courses. And for me, this was extremely restrictive because I wanted to do analysis courses. I mean, I was in an analysis group before. I wanted to do probability courses, of course, but I wanted to do a lot of analysis. I wanted to do linear algebra. I wanted to do calculus too. I wanted to do all those things, but I could not do it in the German system. To it in the German system, I wouldn't have been able to. So I was a bit frustrated in this job, and it really made me think about what do I really want? Because I mean, I should be happy with this job, but now I feel like it's too restrictive, like I'm choking. So, yeah, that made me think a lot. And that's why, oh, but I did have some time to organize and to to organize and to commemorate the first women, the first International Day of Women in Mathematics in Jusseldorf. At the time, that institute, the math institute, there was only one woman professor and me. I was temporary there. It was not a tenure track job. It was a very nice, it was a very good job, but it had a fixed number of years where I could be. Number of years where I could be there, and then I had to leave. So, this idea of, well, maybe if something else comes up, I should keep applying. And it really felt, I mean, all this from my PhD up to that point, it really felt like, okay, I'm in a race. I'm doing postdocs and okay, now I'm a junior professor and this is not over. I have to get a permanent position and I'm in this race. This race, and um, and then at the same time, I was also feeling like, okay, will I be happy finally with this? I mean, I should have been very happy with this other thing, but somehow I wasn't so happy. And this was, this is an example, this illustration is an example of what I was sometimes I was feeling like, okay, will I ever be able to land? Will I ever be able to land a permanent position? Maybe I should still think of a way out. Does it, I mean, am I doing like my research is really like that meaningful? And you can see here in this zooming that I was really thinking of, okay, I don't know if this is worthwhile. I mean, should I be so much, so stressed with the job? I mean, should I have a job that makes me Job, I mean, should I have a job that makes me so stressed about it, so anxious? Uh, and well, really, what I was wanted to do was to, I mean, now I realize that looking back, what I really wanted to do was to do all these things. I wanted to do my illustrations. I was dreaming of just having time for the illustrations. But when I was doing the illustrations for a long time, I was thinking, huh, I miss doing research. And the sketchnote thing was really the first time I felt like, all my skills are really coming together into this thing. And I liked it because of that, because I was using everything that I had learned from my career, from my personal experience, everything that I have ever learned in my life, I was putting it to use in this format that is the sketchnotes. So I started to do. Sketchnotes. So I started to do a lot of this on my spare time. And I mean, if you're more interested in this sketchnote thing, you can go to the, there is one standard reference book that is the sketchnote handbook by Mike Roddy. And I started doing these challenges on social media about drawing just to push myself to draw, to have a constant habit. And it worked out pretty well. Pretty well. I did in 2018, I started the drawing initiative in November where I invited a lot of people to draw about Emi Nutter. And it was mostly motivated because I wanted to learn about Emi Nutter. I was in Germany and I never had courses like courses where I learned about her. So I really felt like, okay, I can draw. Felt like okay, I can draw, I can do sketchnotes, and I can learn about immunity at the same time, so I'm gonna do this. And I invited people to do it. And the funny thing is that a lot of people participated. And here are some samples of people, other people that participated with drawings. And this was a lot of fun. I did the following year, Malina Gnochia, who participated in the Eminotter Challenge, she contacted me. Via social media to say, hey, you know, I really had fun with this. So, how about we do it again, but for a whole year and about maths? So I was like, yeah, sure, let's do it. And then she used one format that was illustrations, paintings, and I used the sketchnote. And I thought, oh, I'm going to keep doing this sketchnote because I really like and you know, I like it as a format. And I see a lot of foot. Format, and I see a lot of potential as a way to communicate science. And so this went really well. And my work, so my illustration work started appearing in some other outlets. I was published in journals of review, in magazines of mathematical societies, like the German Mathematical Society, that appears there. Also, the AMS notices. Also, the AMS notices. And at some point, I was even able to write a chapter about this experience for a handbook of mathematical science communication. And by then, I had already dropped my pseudonym. So I was already signing stuff like coming from me. And if I have an Instagram account, if you look at my Instagram account, I still have the pseudonym. It's not on my name because I didn't want to change it. But this is. But this is a reminder that I used to use Absuluny. And it took me several years to own my own work and to own the fact that I like illustration and I like it so much that I also want to do it as part of my job. So, and this year, so all this was the seed for For a book that I wrote with Leslie Jimenez-Palma, a mathematician from Chile. We did this book, so we took inspiration from the sketchnotes that I had already done, and we did more special for the audience in Chile. And Leslie wrote the text, and I did the drawings. And it was really a very good experience of collaborative work. The experience of collaborative work, truly collaborative work. We were really horizontal. Nobody was, you know, above the other. We accepted each other with our very specific and different sets of skills. I trusted Leslie to write the text. Leslie trusted me with the drawings. We discussed a lot about what we were doing, both of us, but I think this is the closest thing to like a The closest thing to like an ideal collaboration. This is the best collaboration I've ever had with another, and it happened with another woman, mathematician. And I think this is not a random event. This really happened because we had similar experiences in academia, and we wanted to write a book to motivate people to look at mathematics from a different angle. So, this is a general General public book that appeared this year. So, my sketchnot practice has been evolving and I'm really extremely happy about what we achieved with Leslie to really be able to talk to people about mathematics, about how mathematics appears in other fields, so that people can see the use. See the uses of mathematics and really talk to the people that are, especially that are not interested or that have abandoned mathematics to talk to these people and of course do it with a point of view or with a gender perspective. We are two feminist mathematicians, so we showcase a lot of women mathematics in our book. Diversity, we talk about diversity, we talk We talk about what is our responsibility being in academia towards people that don't like mathematics, well, etc. And so going back to the Iki guy, so I have managed, as I mentioned to you, now I'm in France. Now I'm in France. So I came to France in 2019 from Dusseldorf. I was given an offer to come back to France, actually to a less paid job, but where I could be able to solve the two-body problem. So I hadn't mentioned this before, but I'm married and this was a big issue in my My hunting for jobs and also this permanent feeling of should I quit and do something else? Because my husband is also a researcher and we both really making big efforts to be together. And for nine years, we had to live apart. But every time we were getting closer and closer, and finally in Dusseller, we were able to, you know, finally live together. And when And when I got the offer from France, from Paris, I was able to negotiate to have a joint position, to have two positions for my husband and for me. So that was the main motivation to come. Also, the motivation was this, the fact that they told me: look, we know that you do a lot of illustrations and you could use that here. Here. So I thought, okay, if you're giving me the chance to do what I like, to do research, to teach, to use illustrations in my teaching, to do illustrations in my activities at the university, then I'm in. I come. And of course, allowing me to bring my husband. So we came. We came. It was a big risk because it was a non-tenured track. Was a non-tenure track option. But my husband and I, we thought, yeah, this is worthwhile. It's definitely worthwhile risk. And in the end, it worked out well. But I mean, I was still applying for jobs two years ago because it wasn't sure if my contract was going to be, oh, well, contract was going to be renewed. It finally was renewed, but I was. But I was applying for jobs. And now, of course, I haven't everything solved out, but at least I can tell you that right now, I do not use a pseudonym. Everybody knows that I am an illustrator. Everybody knows that I do science communication. I try to integrate that in my job and I work towards that, towards That towards seeking balance among all my activities. Speaking about balance, this is definitely not something easy to achieve. I think it's a permanent work in progress. And I can't say that I find balance doing all the things at the same time. I don't. The way I do it is that I do priorities. I do priorities, so I prioritize some aspects for a while and then leave that and then prioritize the others. And that's this is how I do, how I work in all these different aspects of my work, the research, the innovative teaching, the science communication. And I work towards the recognition from the university that I do. From the university, that I do all these things. And little by little, you know, have the university recognize that I do science communication and to include it in my job description is not for granted, but we're working on it. It's like little by little, I make progress on that. So I wanted to ask you, and this is why I asked you to bring pen and paper, because I wanted to ask you to, you know, I wanted to ask you to do the exercise for yourself, to try to find the activities that really fulfill you in academia, in mathematics. It might be that you're only interested in doing research and that's great. And now, if you're only interested in doing research, what aspects of research do you really feel like, oh, you're good at like? Really feel like, oh, you're good at perhaps writing grants or bringing people together or finding new methods, being creative. There are things, there are always things that you're less good at. It could be that you're really bad at writing grant applications. And maybe when you're in your coffee break, maybe share with each other. Each other, your, you know, what were the things you're good at? Maybe identify the things that you're not so good at. And then maybe finding people that are very good at this. Like say again the thing about brand application, because I mean, it's very relevant if you're a PhD or a postdoc. I mean, even a permanent position, depending on where you are, especially if you're in the States. Especially if you're in the States, you have to apply a lot for grants. Some people are very good at that, some people are less good at that, but I mean, the whole idea is to have teams together and the fact that you can rely on other people to help you with the things that you are not so good at. This is how the great collaborations happen when you find people that complement your set of skills. So. So now, two last things before I finish. I do keep training a lot. I mean, I like learning and I think it's necessary for the type of job that I do to keep training myself of time management, project management, illustration. Illustration, all these things are extremely useful, extra training. And one thing that has been especially useful for me has been my accountability group. So I have, and I mentioned this because I think that in this workshop, you might leave the workshop with your own accountability group. The accountability group is something that I got in the after. I got in the after doing this workshop with Jessica Bell, who's an illustrator from the US, and I did a workshop with her. And in that workshop, she built, she distributed us in accountability groups. And my accountability group, we're four people in this group. And what we do is that every week we do a check-in and we keep each other updated in the things that we're doing. In the things that we're doing. So every day on Mondays, I get online and I write my check-in. I say, okay, this week, last week I did this. This week I want to do that. The next time I do a check-in, I say, okay, from last week, from what I wanted to do, I managed to do this and that. For this week, I do this and that. And I share what am I struggling with. I'm not able to meet my goals. Why I'm not able to meet my goals. Not able to meet my goals. And we also do quarterly reviews and annual reviews. And this has been extremely helpful for my illustration practice. And actually so helpful that we started in 2016 for this workshop. And then we have continued ever since. We have continued non-stop all these years, the four of us, doing this activity. And it's extremely helpful. And, you know, we have all, we started. We have all, we started with goals, and as we all meet them, we all thank the other members. For example, in my book, I thank the members of my accountability group because they have been fundamental for my growth in my illustration practice. And as I have an accountability group for illustration, which is these people here, I also find that for all my activities, this has been All my activities have been extremely important to have people around me, to have people supporting me and complementing my skills. And so here, this is why I say all this, this finding the purpose and then finding your place in academia where you can actually fulfill your purpose. This is all thanks to the help of other people. I mean, we're not, you know, we're not islands. Not, you know, we're not islands. So, and this is why I think associations like the Association of Women in Mathematical Physics is so important, like the workshop where you are, these kind of events is so important, because you develop networks and networks are extremely important as you go on on your career. Because you will meet challenges all the time. And the people around you, you help you to, you know, you have someone to discuss. You have someone to discuss these challenges, and they have experienced similar things, or they're going to experience similar things, and their experience is also extremely valuable. Okay, and with that, I wanted to thank you for your attention. So, I don't know if you have any questions. My book on Amazon or where can we find your books? Oh, you can go to my website. Yeah, I can put it in the chat. It's in Spanish. But there will be a website soon. Let me just find the... Just find the I can share the. I mean, Connie, they will not see the chat because they are not logged in. But don't worry. I mean, if you send it to me, I can just share it with the participants later on. Yeah. Which event, can we share yours?
