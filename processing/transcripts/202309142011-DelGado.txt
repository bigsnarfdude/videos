Thank you very much. Okay, so I want to keep it sweet and short because I know that it's been a long day for everybody. But I do want to say a couple of words just about my group at Georgetown. So what we're interested in, in fact, is trying to understand how microstructure develops, grows and forms in soft materials with equilibrium due to equilibrium and non-equilibrium processes. And because the time scale and length scale that emerge in this fluid. That emerge in this through this formation of microstructure, then we have an impact in aging, processing of these materials, and all the way into the rhythmology. So, what I'm going to talk tonight, it's mainly just a linear response, but we are interested then in understanding the implications for non-linear response for phenomena like yielding, fixogy, memory, and so on. And so this is just some example of recent stuff. I'm not going to talk about this, but you can ask me or reach out to me if you want. Ask me or reach out to me if you want. I want to say that one of the motivations for us to look into these problems is also to understand how the physics that we dig out then has consequences for the sustainability of the way we make these materials, the way we use these materials. And this is some context in which we have asked these questions. Okay, so I said I learned a lot and I literally learned a lot because I did not know anything. And so I don't do cell mechanics. I'm actually I'm actually quite ignorant biophysically, so I really learned a lot of new things and I enjoyed all the talks. I also got very excited because I saw anyway the connection between a lot of the things that Yudna has presented and talked about and the questions that are interesting for us. Especially with respect to the idea that sensing the environment in this type of complex soft materials and soft networks, it's not just about sensing the stiffness. Just about sensing the stiffness and the structure, but it could be about sensing the dynamics, the set of time scales that are involved, and spatial temporal fluctuations can play a dominant role in that. Into how the self-organization of the structure, in fact, it's important for the emerging properties. We've seen a lot of discussions in terms of the emerging, how to understand emerging more rigidity, for example, in a number of networks and in a number of systems. And in a number of systems. And then what are the implications of this for, again, failure, fluidization, etc. Okay, so what I want to talk about is actually a collaboration. It's been a collaboration with a group of very fun people. And it's mainly the work actually of Minas Mikatawa and Bavan Keshovars at the beginning of the collaboration where respectively the students in my group and in the group of Derek Nikili and now, for example, Bel Baband is actually. Bel Baband is actually starting his new faculty at Duke and Minas Postop as okay. So this is a story about gels and gel networks, but the gels we're interested in are gels that form not necessarily polymers, so they form in all sorts of different contexts and they're relevant to all sorts of different technologies because basically you have polymers or proteins or colloids. Polymers or proteins or colloids that form particles, and these particles stick together because of net attractive interaction and solution. They stick together and they form this type of complex structures, I don't know if you can see that, which are basically extremely messy and disordered on all sort of landscapes. They can have these very large pores. They're kept together by physical forces, so they can reorganize a lot, they can flow and they can reconstitute. Can reconstitute, and so that's why actually they're relevant in sort of yes. Can I ask how did you find a gel? So, what I call a gel, it's in the end, I mean, what characterize them once they form a gel is that if you look at the, I would say, this is what I will use actually for this, it's that I measure the rheology in a linear resolution test and I have a G prime low frequency that becomes larger than G w. And that's my job. That's my job. The reason why they are so important, so relevant, in all sorts of things, it's also because, in fact, it's, and probably they have some interesting connection with biological systems or biological relevant materials, because it's a very effective way to make a solid with a tiny amount of solid material. So, you can get, because of this complex aggregation and the type of messy structures that you can form, in fact, you can end up. Form. In fact, you can end up with something that is solid-like with a tiny amount of solid fraction. So this forms, for example, in terms of volume fraction, solid volume fraction of the particles in the solution, it's really tiny. It can be really funny. However, how to make sense of how the structure that you see determines the rheology, it's really very challenging. And it's even more challenging because, in many cases, like here. Because, in many cases, like here, you can actually image a lot of the structure, most of the structure, with, for example, Cofocal Macrosky. You can even image it as you're sharing it. And so, then it's particularly annoying the fact that you still cannot make sense of how certain type of structures or the interactions or just the density of the particles in fact determine the mechanical response that you see. And so, this is the question that I want to talk about. So, to study this problem, we have So to study this problem we have in fact developed a model that allows us, oh the colours are a bit strange, but that allows us to study the formation of these gels in computer simulations. And we want to have a model, I was talking to this afterward, a model that is in that kind of sweet spot, that I have enough complexity of this aggregation process and this type of material that will form, but it's still sufficiently simple that I can actually make sense That I can actually make sense and understand what's happening. And that's the spirit of this model. I don't want to talk about actually the model. I have a backup slide if you want to know more and feel free to ask questions because we study that in a lot of, in a series of paper actually. We have explored the gelation process, the linear even the nonlinear dynamics, mechanics of the system, and we have analyzed all the sort of dynamical processes that you get at different stages of the brain. Get different stages of the argument. But so, what I'm showing you here is this is a model that's based on particles. So, the basic units are particles that stick together because we have attractive interactions between them. We do molecular dynamics type of simulation. It's coarse-grade molecular dynamics. And the particles are immersed in solvents. So, the particles stick together because you have short-range attraction, and then we consider that the contact between the particles. That the contact between the particles in the most general case can be actually quite complex because the surface of the particle themselves can be irregular, they can have some patchiness to it, or they can have just some heterogeneity. The interactions can be in certain cases quite strong. The particles can actually have really adhesion with each other. So, the idea is that when they stick together, they don't easily roll onto each other. So, you have some sort of bending stiffness that is naturally introduced in this model. By in this model. And then you end up through this aggregation process, you end up with the structure like this. Here I'm not showing the particles for clarity, but I'm just showing the bond, the connection between the particles. So you can see that, for example, at a low bound fraction, you can get a network that is solid-like in its vischolastic response, and it's very heterogeneous. And it has heterogeneities in the connectivity that are actually a Activity that are actually a different length scale. And I think that this is a very important characteristic of this type of system, essential to understand the mechanics. So you can change, for example, the density of this type of gel, and then you get something that becomes more homogeneously connected and more homogeneous. And you change the volume fraction of a relatively small amount, and the scholastic response changes of orders of Response changes of orders of multiple. And these are tests in which, in the simulation, we run, we do perform basically linear vispolastic tests. And then, from the stresses and the strain, you can compute G prime and G double prime directly from the particle interactions. Yes? I think I missed what the scale is. So, the scale, I didn't tell you what the scale is. So, the scale here, I'm coloring, I'm showing you basically the network of connection between the particles, and I'm color. Between the particles, and I'm coloring in terms of some measure of the local connectivity, right? And because I want to highlight the fact, and I will tell you more about this later, but I want to emphasize the fact that by including all these degrees of freedom in my model and trying to mimic the aggregation process, I can actually obtain this large-scale isogenetics I was talking about before. I can have regions where I have a lot of connections and the particles are. Of connections, and the particles are tightly connected with each other, interspersed with regions where the connections are quite sparse. And this is just the result of the aggregation process. So what I was saying is that I can change the volume fraction just a little bit and the viscelastic response becomes very different, not just in terms of stiffness, but also in terms of time scale, right, that my viscelastic response has to cover. Cover. And another thing that I can see very clearly in the simulations is that I can now fix instead the volume function and change the rate at which you perform the generation. And then again, you get some different type of jerseys. So this is something that in fact occurs in the experiments, it's seen in the experiments, and makes it so hard to make sense of the reality of these materials because the scholastic response changes dramatically with the amount of particles. With the amount of particles, so certainly depends a lot on the amount of particles, but then with the same amount of particles, it does depend on the kinetic path that leads me to non-agnolicity. Okay, and okay, so this is just to remind me that, for example, in this type of simulations where we have all the interactions and we follow this aggregation process, then we can perform all these serological tests. And one way we have one method that we have used to do that. Method that we have used to do that has been probably completely by from our experimentalist colleagues that developed this idea of doing linear biscuit tests using chart signals. And we have done the same in the simulation. We basically copied their experimental approach in here. And this is pretty convenient because it allowed us to do a lot of these elastic tests over a broad range of jets very rapidly and very highly. And very high. Okay, so for example, I can characterize the viscelastic response, let's say, in terms of tan delta, which is just the ratio between the loss and the storage model. And so again, now I'm having, you know, I'm looking at all the gels that I've put together in my simulation. I have like 11 gels when I vary the volume fraction and I vary the range, the kinetic. The kinetics at which I did the gelation. So, what we call the gelation rate. And so, when I do that, you can see that this logical characteristics varies all over the place. It goes back and forth when I change the gelation rate. And so, can I make sense of something like that, even if when I know everything about this structure? Okay, so one thing that you recognize is that, I mean, not me necessarily, but some of the biologists' colleagues started to see that, okay, they have. They started to see that, okay, they have these shapes that seem kind of similar. So I can actually shift maybe the frequencies, the x-axis, to make these curves follow on top of each other. Can I do that? And in fact, I can, right? And so I can see that all my gels, all my 11 gels, they start to build this type of master. And then I can ask the question: okay, if I keep this. I keep this, so basically, what I'm doing is that I'm shifting the y, the x-axis, right? I'm shifting for each gel, I'm shifting the frequency of a certain amount, okay? And so if I do that, in fact, now I keep this shift in the x-axis, and then I go back to my full bispelastic spectrum, so separately g prime and gw prime, and I shift, I use the same shift that I had for the time delta, and I shift instead. Tan delta, and I shift instead that I play the same game for the y-axis, and I realize that it's not only just the tan delta, but it's actually the full visceralistic spectrum that can collapse into a unique master curve. And this master curve is basically just one type of rheological behavior. So then this starts to create the idea that, okay, these jets are all over the place. The structure is so messy, but there is some way I can make sense of the real. Make sense of the rheological response. And naturally, okay, we think, okay, there is some kind of fundamental rheological model that I can try to build in terms of mechanical elements. And from the shape of the, you know, just as I was talking about Maxwell type of response, here clearly I have some Kelvin void type of response with this elastic plateau and low frequencies. But I realized that if I want to But I realized that if I want to fit the spectrum that I have and the shape that I have of this massive curve, both from my rheological spectrum and from the time delta, I actually have to consider a huge amount of this Kelvin-bond model. So I cannot fit it with one. This dotted line here is what I would obtain from just one Kelvin-bond element. I have to put a lot of them, and also I have to organize them in a European way. So in a very A hierarchical way, so in a very specific way, in which they are hierarchically linked to each other. And then I can start to build, so the curves that best fit my thing, I have to go up to 1,500 type of elements. I can, in fact, recapitulate this type of behavior, which is called the ladder logical model in the logical community, in terms using instead. In terms using instead fractional derivatives and just with the fractional real-time model, which corresponds to this type of scale. Okay, so what does this tell me? Is that there is a hierarchy in the way the time scale, in the time scale that I used to basically rescale my frequencies. Yes. Yeah, quick question. So the challenge to fit this with a single circuit is is it Circuit is it because G double prime is not linear in omega? Yes, yes. And also, there is basically this regime here where G prime and G double prime they have nearly the same slope. That's it's not okay, so then I okay with this study is that in fact I if there must be some hierarchy in time scale and presumably In time scale and presumably also length scale in my jets. Yes. So, what is the slope in that upper regime? Because, I mean, even like the round model, you get from adding an infinite number of maximum models. But the precise distribution of those determines the power law, usually in the upper range. Is there an exponent? Yes, I will come to that in a moment. But in this case, it's zero. 0.68 that we measure. So it's not 0.5 that you will get from the measure. Okay, so the idea is that there is some hierarchy of time scales for sure. I mean, it's not the idea, it's the evidence. But also, so there should be some hierarchy of landscape in the system that probably I should be able to see in a structure, right? And so this type of ladder-like rheology and this type of fractional models we use. And this type of fractional models we use a lot. For example, if I have a fractal structure to start with, then I have a Yarity of length scale, and then I would know where this Yarity of time scale comes from, and that would fit directly in my, let's say, rheological model. And this has been done in a number of systems. For example, a very well-known case is the case of polymer jets, where I have a polymerization reaction and I have that the gelation threshold. It's associated to Gelation threshold, it's associated to actually a connectivity percolation transition. Close to that connectivity percolation transition, the gel, in fact, is a fractal, and that will give me this guarantee. Another case where this has been used a lot is that if I have a colloidal system that starts to aggregate for me with fractal aggregates, then again I have fractal aggregates that be my gel, I know and then I have uh a clear origin of this uh hierarchical organization in the visselastic results. In the viscal acid response. And so the puzzle is that here in our structure and in a number of polar systems, actually the structure, remember, I can image it, I actually can control it completely in the simulation, and these structures are not fractal. So I have a more general case in which my gel is still messy and it doesn't look fractal, in fact, if I try to evaluate that. But I have some fractal characteristic in the logical response. So, where is this coming from? And this is the questions that you. Some and so on, and this is the questions that we're trying to understand. Okay, so because we have studied a lot the microscopic dynamics in this type of gels, what we have realized is that what I guess. When you're talking about fractal versus non-fractal versus how do you evaluate it for whatever? Yeah, so in the you know, because I know exactly where each particle is, what I can do is that I can do some box counting. So I take Some box counting. So I take a subset of my system and I look at how many particles are in that box. And then I increase the box size and I look at how many particles are in the box. And then I get the number of particles in each box. How does it scale with the size of the box? And if I do that, I'm going to show you in a moment. In our case, it's always just scaling with the system size to the to the cube, right? To the box size of the cube. So I don't see anything that is factor factor in my Actually, environment. Okay, so what I realized studying the dynamics, especially in this system, that what I was mentioning before, so the fact that there is this heterogeneity, that is so extreme, and it's very strongly in the local connectivity of the gel. So I have these regions that are very connected, the interspersed regions that are very sparse. That this is, in fact, it's a property that controls a lot of the microscopic. That controls a lot of the macroscopic dynamics. And actually, we found that it controls also a lot of the even non-linear mechanics of the system. And so then what we have done is to introduce and measure a characteristics of this gel that is based on this integral. So what we do is that we can measure in the simulation the mesh sizes, so the distance between two branching points in our network. In our network, measured along the network. Okay, so this is like a topological distance, and we have a distribution of these distances. And when we vary the volume fraction, the density of the particles, or when we vary the gelation rate, you actually change this distribution. And these distributions are exponential, but you can really see that as the gels become more and more sparse and approach, if you want, the rigidity threshold, this distribution starts to develop very long tails, which are non-exponential. Tails, which are non-exponential, and this is because basically you have all these heterogeneities that become prevalent. So the idea is that I can take this distribution of this landscape, and I can look at the variance of the distribution, so the second moment of this distribution, and from this second moment, I can construct a land scale. And what I'm going to try to convince you is that this length scale is actually controlling, telling me something about the distance of the church from the reference. About the distance of the gel from the rigidity threshold, and it's actually controlling it completely, it's this elastic span. Okay, and so that is the thing that I need to look into, and it's not simply the structure that will give me this point. Okay, so first piece of evidence. I can look at the spontaneous dynamics introducing in the simulation, you know, just The simulation, you know, just the little amount of thermal fluctuations so that I can look at the fluctuations of the structure without breaking anything significant. And so, when I do this, I get a distribution of microscopic displacement fluctuations in the microscopic displacement that are very broad and they shift when I change the density of the particles, so the amount, the volume fraction of the particles, or the gelation. But if I use this lens case, But if I use this length scale, I can actually rescale all these distributions of each other. And I can do the same if now I am doing my linear viscolastic test and I'm instead looking at the monotonic motion in the different parts of the structure. I obtain distributions that look about like this, and they are all over the place. But when I rescale the amplitude of the fluctuations in the displacement by this length scale, in fact, which I have normalized. Which I have normalized with the persistence length along the gel branches, then they actually fall on top of each other. So, this tells me that indeed this type of lens scale that is actually measuring how much things are disordered in terms of the global connectivity, it contains all the information about the microscopic dynamics and the non-applimation. Yes, you'll be screened. I can find this place into the left. Um yeah, no, I don't rescale them. I don't exactly remember Yeah, exactly, yes, exactly, exactly. Yes, exactly, yes. Yes, exactly. Yes. Thank you. Okay. So then, okay, so basically what I'm saying is that this landscape contains, it works and it controls the microscopic dynamics because actually contains the information that I need about the local environment and the large-scale aspect to this in an image. And this is what controls the microscopic penalty. Controls the microscopic dynamics. So, if it controls the microscopic dynamics, now I start to think that it could well control the rheology. Okay, and if it controls the rheology, then it makes me think that I could actually think about my gel as made of blocks of this size. And what is happening when I'm changing the volume fraction of the gels and when I'm changing the tilation rate. When I'm changing the gelation rate, is that I'm changing the size of these blocks. Okay, so basically, what I'm saying is that this length scale that I've extracted from the heterogeneity is in the connectivity of the gel, and it affects the heterogeneity in the microscopic dynamics. It's actually growing as my gel becomes sparser and sparser. Become sparser and sparser, and they approach the rigidity fashion. So I start to think that, in fact, the properties that I see in the rheology and the self-similarity that I see in the rheology, they depend on a distance from this rigidity threshold, and then I can measure the distance from this rigidity threshold in terms of the span stability. So is this true, and can I verify that? Verify that? Well, actually, if I take this length scale and I plot it as a function of the volume fraction of the particle or as a function of the gelation rate, then I can see that I get, you know, again, obtain things that vary in the distance rate. But then if I think that, in fact, what is measuring what this length scale is telling me is the distance from the rigidity threshold, and the way in which I can estimate the distance from the rigidity threshold in my system is actually. The utility threshold in my system is actually counting the number of branching points that I have in my gel, because I have these strands that branch to form this network. And as my gel becomes sparser and sparser, I'm actually reducing this branching point. So I can use the amount of branching point to measure the distance from the rigidity threshold. Basically, the thermodynamic limit, the amount of branching point goes to zero as my gel increases rigidity. And so if I do that, in fact, the length scale that I am distracting, that I am talking about, stays with, as a function of this parameter that I can directly measure in the situation. In both cases, if I change the body fraction, no matter if I change the body fraction or if I change the gelation rate, I always recover this type of behavior with an exponent. And indeed, I do get that this landscape is increasing. That this landscape is increasing as the amount of branching point is becoming smaller and smaller, and with an exponent that I can start to estimate from that. Okay, so but yes. Do you know what the physical, I mean is there a physical factor? Like, do you know what the point A scaling is telling you the the actual ancillary factor? Yeah, so what it's telling me, it's very close to what you would get just from random percolation. Get just from random percolation. So it sort of tells me that I have a rigidity transition in the system, which is controlled by the amount of branching point that I have, and that looks a lot like some kind of rubber push. That's what I measure size perfectly. Yes, and let's talk about it. Yes, okay. In your simulation, the everything is perfect. I mean in your simulation that everything is perfect. I know. Yes, yes. Just uh give me another uh uh no no, but I I think this is something very interesting. Okay, so yeah, you're right. I mean in the simulation first I can I can do this because I can measure this sound. I can. And the other thing that I can measure is that this amount of ratchet point, which is actually very, very non-trivial to measure into an experimental system. So you know, I can still dream on. Okay. Okay, so but let me say another thing. If I But let me say another thing. If I if so what the idea that I start the picture that I start to build is that actually I have this block. I have to think about the mechanics of my gel as the mechanics of these blocks which become larger and larger as I approach the original. And so maybe these blocks are fractal and that's why my brainology shows this set. Shows this cell similarity. And so if I have, now I understand that all my gels are actually above the rigidity threshold. They are all rigid. I showed you the shape of the visplastic spectrum. So in fact, I have a non-fractal gel because these fractal blobs are smaller than the system size and they are embedded in all the rest of the structure. So if I Okay, so if I think what should be the scaling now of the mass of the gel in a box of size L, right? If I have a gel that has these blocks of size C, it will be, you know, I I would I would be able to get the fractal dimension out of this only if uh my system size is actually smaller than than the probability length, right? Than the correlation length. But because my system size is actually larger than the correlation length, so these blobs are smaller than the system size, actually, this is the scaling that I should see. So now I start to think that the reason why I was not seeing my structure as fractal is because I was thinking that the whole structure was fractal. But in fact, if I think in terms of this blob, I should see this type of behavior. And so this is the mass of my gel as a function of. Of my gel as a function of the box size, and you can see that different gels, for example, here with different volume fractions, they are, you know, I get this type of scaling that it's always L cube and it's just shift for all the gels. But then if I plot instead my data in terms of this scaling function, which is what I would obtain if I had these fractal blocks, then I can see that my data actually collapsed into a unique slope. Into a unique slope, which corresponds to a fractal dimension that is in fact roughly 2.5. So now I have access with this type of scaling to the fractal nature of the blobs, and I have some indication that these blobs are actually inside fractal, and they have a fractal dimension that is roughly 2.5, which is again consistent with some kind of random approach. Okay. So now if I have So now if I have if it's true that I have these fractal blocks and these fractal blocks fill the space, then my length scale should be related to the volume function of the particles that form the blobs and to the factor dimension of the blobs in this way. And which means then because my length scale I said what it's doing is that it's measuring the distance from the rigidity threshold which I measure The rigidity threshold, which I measure in terms of this amount of branching point, it means that I have actually a scaling relationship between the amount of branching point and the volume fraction of the particles via this fractal dimension and the exponent of microrelation rate. And so if I look at what this means in my data and I measure now the amount of branching point as a function of the volume function of the particles, this is what I get. This is what I get. And these lobes here, again, it's what I observe in the simulation. It's actually what I would obtain if I use, again, the exponent that I taxed from here and the fractal dimension that I measured in the way I just showed you. So it seems that everything is consistent, and now I start to believe that I do have these fractal blocks that are actually embedded in my dweller, and that I was simply not before. Okay, so if there are these fractal blocks, why are they relevant to the rheology? How did you create this type of self-similar type of and so the idea that I'm going to use in this relating cluster, close to the recognition threshold, the type of blobs, links, and notes pictures that Dejan and the others developed. And what is nice about this And what is nice about this picture is that people had understood at that time that when I'm close to this rigidity threshold in terms of a percolation threshold, this percolation transition, not all the bonds in my structure are created equal. But there is in fact a yarity of bonds, and there are some special bonds which are similar connective bonds, which are the bonds that if I cut one of them, I interrupt the connectivity in the system. In the system, in that case, because they were thinking about connectivity. But I am thinking, okay, maybe this is the same thing that is happening here, because this looks like some random percolation, very similar to the connectivity percolation. It's just that it's providing rigidity to my system, so it's in the context of the rigidity percolation. So if I actually think in these terms, then what I realize, and this is what people had figured out at the time, that what happens when I approach this I approach this percolation threshold, is that these bonds, these single-connected bonds, are actually everywhere and they are heretically distributed. What it means is that on any length scale, I can always find one of these bonds. And so what I'm saying is that this is what characterize these blobs in their fractality, that they contain this amount of singly connected form. This amount of singly connected bonds. They connect the singly, they contain singly connected bonds. And the fact that the blocks increase in size means that these singly connected bonds, they become present over all length scale across the system. And this is what actually controls the self-similarity and the hierarchical organization that I see to the logical structure. And so, what I can do is that now I can think about some. Think about some form of elastically active link that lives inside my plumps, and I can realize, and I realize that there is, in fact, a distribution of effective bending stiffness that is associated to the distance between the bonds within this elastic band. And if I construct the modes that are associated to this distribution of effective stiffnesses, what I obtain is exactly the Obtain is exactly the distribution of modes that corresponds to the hierarchical organization of my ladder of my mechanical elements in my labor model. So basically I close the circle and I have understood, I think, what is the microstructural origin of the erratic and the self-similarity, the self-similarity that I'm seeing in the urological response. I know that I'm nearly out of time, but I That I'm nearly out of time, but I just hope to show you some consequences of this. Okay, so then it means that I can go back again to what people have done for random percolation in elastic networks with bending rigidity, because here we have this bending term. And I can use one of this model to actually estimate how the models of my jet should grow with the distance from, in this case, from the perpetration threshold. From the perturbation threshold, in my case, it's a rigidity threshold, and where the distance is measured through my correlation length. So I should see this type of scaling, which then gives me an exponent, so a dependence, so this F exponent that it's around 3.6. And in fact, this is the scaling that I see of my modulus, right? So this is the modulus of the gels, the plateau modulus. It's also the shift. Modulus, it's also the shift in my vertical axis when I was doing my master curve. And so I can see that when I plot this modulus as a function of the volume fraction of the particles or the deletion rate, I get all those sort of things. But if I plot it as a function of the amount of branching point or this other way of measuring the distance from the rigidity threshold, then I obtain the scaling, exactly the scaling that I had predicted through this type of model. What is interesting is that What is interesting is that I can in my analysis there is naturally a time scale that emerges through the construction of the master curve, which is the horizontal shift. So this gives me a time scale that actually diverges as I approach the rigidity threshold and the prediction that I obtain from the now from the ladder model and that I can see it's that I can see in the simulation as well. That I can see in the simulation as well is that this time scale that diverges as I approach the rigidity threshold, it actually scales in the same way as my modulus. And I don't think this has ever been observed, but I think that in principle this could be measured. It could be measured by constructing the master curve in certain cases. In other cases, for example, we know that, in our case, we know that this time scale, it's basically the visceral. Time scale, it's basically the viscolastic delay time. It's the time scale that it needs for the system to realize that it's elastic. And that diverges as I approach the rigidity threshold because I have more and more of these huge regions that are very flocky. And so it takes a long time, and I have to dissipate a lot of stuff before I realize that I am elastic. So it's uh maybe some uh uh scaling prediction that I could test with uh uh microbiology for example. Microbiology for example. So I just want to mention one last thing that if now I realize that I here I have, let's say, in the experiment, because Jean-Fronton is asking me about the experiment, what I have, I cannot measure the distance from the infinity measurement. I cannot measure the C in the way I measure it, right? And usually what I can control is the amount of particles, okay? Amount of particles. And so now I realize that my length scale will depend on the amount of particle, but also the amount of branching point will depend on the amount of particle. But how it will depend, it may change depending on the aggregation process that I have. And so then what this means is that when I'm measuring in the experiment the modulus as a function of the amount of particles, and I see this power load. And I see this power loss because in all these systems I always see very strong power loss dependence on the amount of particles. I'm actually measuring some apparent exponent, which in fact is related to the true exponent that measured the distance from the rigidity threshold in this way. And so what this means is that depending on the specific of the aggregation process, I can actually have a range of exponents that I Range of exponents that I can see in my experiment. And this is, for example, what you would get for your observed F if you have different type of abelation processes to start with that can give different type of fractal structure from which I build my network. And so then I I would predict that I would get a range of uh uh of different exponents, which is indeed what I observe in experiment. In the experiment. And so the fact that I see a different type of exponent in the experiment would actually tell me something about how I built this fractal object in my magnetics. Okay, I think I'm done and I can show you just some conclusions. So basically what I think is interesting here, and for me what has really excited me about the story, is the fact that I think this shows that I think this shows that when I have this gelation and this emergence of rigidity in this very heterogeneous system, there is in fact a subset of my structure that is responsible of the mechanics. And this subset of my structure, it actually can be very thin and sparse and sparsely connected, and it becomes thinner and sparsely connected as I approach the rigidity fashion. I don't see I don't see, you know, if I look at my gel where after it has densified a little bit, I won't see that. My structure will not look fractal. But the rheology and the viscelastic spectrum will show me a sign of that. And so basically, the rheology will show me what the images cannot capture. Okay, I think there's time for one question, the other one's sorry. I've asked a couple and I'll go ahead. I mean in the experiments, typically you can also put in like the poets, like the concentrations. That would be another way to control the gelation. And could you combine that into a scaling parameter that both depended on the volume fraction and the specification? And the structure deliversion. Yeah, I think you can. I mean, it's a very interesting suggestion, but basically our water delision rate is something related to that, but we haven't turned it into a scaling in terms of the depth of the web. But it's an interesting thing to think about. I think it's a bit different, but you'll actually try. The high-frequency rheology, yeah. So did did I did I think it's a little bit more. So did did I did I miss does the stereo actually predict that, Pector? No, it's actually in the sense that, okay, no, there is a, yeah, it, so the exponent. So the exponent that we get is measured in the simulation and then it's not necessarily predicted to start with. However, what is interesting, I don't think I add it here, but we find a very interesting But we find a very interesting scaling relationship between some kind of hyperscaling relating that exponent to the fractal dimension and the critical exponent of the correlational energy. And so what do you think it is? What is the right one? It's in our case it's as I so as I told you is zero point sixty eight and uh in fact uh the prediction that we obtain it fits very well with what we see. It fits very well with what we see. I can show you. I think it would be interesting actually to test that because I've not seen that. I'm just thinking of analogous polymer things. There's certainly ways of getting X polyphony. Right, right, right, right. Yes, yes, yes, yes, absolutely. Since there are some people that are leaving tomorrow and listening to tomorrow's sessions, like me, I just want to say we want to thank the organizers for me.
