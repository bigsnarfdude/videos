And I think the title on the previous slide is slightly different to what I submitted for the talk, but this is the title of our paper on the archive. Okay, so I'm going to start by talking about divergence and thickness. These are two quasi-isometry invariants. Now, Palavi and I have a series of papers looking at questions of large-scale geometry for what I handle Poxida groups. Our first one was on divergence, and we found that very useful. And we found that very useful for getting our heads into the geometry of these groups. So, when we decided we wanted to look at more general families of cocksety groups, we thought divergence would be a good thing to look at first as well. So, I'll review some earlier work by ourselves and others on right-angle costity groups and then move into what we did for general coxyl groups. Okay, so first off, what's the notion of divergence? So, we have two, we've got a one-ended GDP. I've got a one-ended geodesic metric space, I have a base point, and I've got two geodesic rays. And what we want to measure is how fast do these rays go apart from each other, how fast do they diverge. So you pick a time r point, pick the time r point on both of them. So that distance equals that distance.
