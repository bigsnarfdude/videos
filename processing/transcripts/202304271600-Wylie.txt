So our final talk over the afternoon, Will Weime from Syracuse University, and as usual, title on the slides. All right, so thanks, Eric. And of course, I want to thank the organizers for the invitation. This is a great place, and also for the many really good talks we've had this week. I doubly benefit from all the talks before because not only were they great. Because not only were they great talks, but also they defined most of the things in my slides, so I don't have to motivate anything here. I think there's two groups. I didn't know there'd be a quiz, but now there's just the. So, okay. So, the title of my talk is Rigidity of Homogeneous Plasma-Einstein Metrics and Related Equations. This is joint with Peter Peterson, who did this a few years ago. The title of the paper is Rigidity of Homogeneous Gradient Gradient Solid. These draft radiance solitons quantum related equations, but I changed the title for this workshop since it's quasi. But if you're looking for the paper, you have to replace that there. So, um, oh, see, I'm dead. I already did it right now. Okay, so this goes back sort of a long way for me, right? So, the first theorem I want to talk about that we're going to generalize in terms of me and Peter group, right, in like 07 or something, was published in 09, and it says. It was published in 09, and it says a homogeneous grade-reach of soliton. If you have a homogeneous grade-reach of soliton, then M is isometric to N cross RK. N is Einstein, and the RK part is a Gaussian, right? The F is just quadratic, so I guess maybe I should write, right? So, this is the Ricci-Soliton equation, and then the gradient soliton equation is when And what the x is a gradient vector field. So, you know, Christoph gave a really great talk the first day, right, about homogeneous Einstein metrics, right? So we know that there are lots of them, right? But this is also, Christoph said this is a bad theorem, right? Talking about a, this is because we were interested in grading, which is all at once, it tells you there basically aren't any, right? That aren't, aren't you the Einstein ones, right? And I guess that's how we took it at the time. It was very interesting. We took it at the time because we were interested in rich solitons, but then we came back to it later talked about. So now there are many homogeneous Richie Soliton metrics that aren't gradient, right? So what this theorem tells you is that those ones aren't gradient and also, which we saw in Ari's talk, right, they have to be expanding, right? Because they can't be shrinking because those have to be gradient. Okay? So I'm going to generalize this in a couple of ways. All right, so the statement we need to go for. Okay. So the first, since this is about quasi-Einstein metrics, the first way we can sort of generalize this is to talk about M plasi-Einstein metrics, which we've already seen, right? M plas-Einstein metric is something where you have this Bachford-American curvature with the M equals lambda G, right? So just not really a generalization, but a modification, I guess, of this, right? And after me and Peter. This right, and after me and Peter were doing this, uh, Kei-Shu and Wei published a paper in 2011 talking about these and proof sort of virginity results for these M-plot and Einstein metrics and also told us that actually whenever you have this equation, sort of the AVESA, right, you always have an Einstein metric that's a world problem, right? As we've already seen today. So the first, so you know, in case you and we generalize various results about pretty silatons and quasi anti-Method. Free self-ons to M quasi anti-metrics. And proof of theorem one that I put on the board, as you'll see, is really quite easy. So we thought, well, we should be able to do this for the homogeneous case as well. You can see 2015, this was actually the culmination with thinking about this for the three papers. It's a little different, right? It's not so easy. So in fact... Sorry, Will, what does the G sub F M looks like? So the F is just some other manifold, right? So it's just some other manifold with dimension F. Some other manifold of dimension M. Gottlieb. So you start with G, right? And then you can make an Einstein metric on, you know, G is on M, right? Then you have an Einstein metric on M process. Right, the product of M and F. Yeah, that's a work product. Yeah. Thank you. All right, so yeah, so and we worked with Chen Shu Ka. So, and we worked with Chen Shu Ka on this too, and we showed actually, well, theorem one is not true in general for this equation. And here, I should say, yeah, I'll say something about the non-grading case at the end, right? But we didn't have any reason to be interested in the non-gradient case at this time, so we didn't really think about that here. And also, I guess I didn't write it here, but M is positive. I'll talk about the M and the negative case will come up, actually, but M is positive for this. So, actually, okay, this result. So, actually, okay, this result there, one that it has to split as a product is not true, but there's some weaker form of rigidity, which we'll call one-dimensional extension, which I'm going to define in the process of this talk, right? But I'm not going to define it right now. Theorem one means flat theorem originally. Theorem one means pretty easy. Yeah, so okay, what I mean by theorem one isn't true is it's not always a product. It's not always splits as a product where the f is constant. Yeah. And you assume homogeneity always? Yeah, I'm assuming we're assuming homogeneous. Yeah, I'm always going to be super homogeneous until the very end of the slide. Right, and in fact, there are, so there's some rigidity for this M quasi-Enstein case, but there is sort of a recipe, right? So we showed that there was some rigidity here. I guess what I mean here is, yeah, it's a homogeneous, what I mean by theorem is not true. There are homogeneous and quasi-ancrics that are not products, right? Where they have to sign ones, right? And so we've formed, we showed that they have this one-dimensional stick extension structure, and then Romero LaFuente showed that, in fact, the only time you can make these is if you start. Can make these is if you start, you take a one-dimensional extension of an algebraic Richie soliton. So, what I mean by that is if you start with any homogeneous Ricci-Soliton metric, G0, and you take Gf to be your favorite Ricci-flat metric, then there's an Einstein metric that's a work product like this, right, GE. So it's a work product on M times F of this form. So you have So you have a one-parameter family, GR, sort of homogeneous metrics on your each electron. You can take a work product with them, you get an Einstein metric. Okay, and so we showed you this always gives you an Einstein metric, and then Romero showed that the only way you can do this is if you start with an algebra, which is altogether. GD, G0F. Is it GDs or GDs? Is homogeneous? Well, if, yeah, well, just to, yeah, it is homogeneous if f is Euclidean space. But if I choose some non-homogeneous free flat metric, then this would still, so this part's homogeneous, right? The m quasi n-side part is homogeneous, but you have the freedom to choose whatever you talk. Morally, it's homogeneous, and you can do this trick with it, but it does, yeah. So, as Christoph talked about in his talk, knowing sort of, you know. Knowing, sort of, you know, from their sort of amazing work, right, this tells you that if you understand Einstein metrics basically equivalent to understanding these homogeneous Richie solitons, right? And it's kind of the same here, right? By our recipe, if you understand all the homogeneous Richislitons, then you understand all the homogeneous M quasanstein metrics as well. Any other questions? All right, so that's one way in which we generalize that, but that was still 10 years ago or something. So I'm going to generalize, so everything I've talked about so far, it really has nothing to do with reaching curvature, right? Or at least a lot of it did, right? So the more recent project is to generalize this even further. To generalize this even further. And so the setting that I want to work in is we just have a G homogeneous manifold. So that means G is the isometry group that's acting transitively, right, by isometries. And in this situation, right, where you have a Richie soliton and you have an Pazzan metric, and you think of this as an equation for the function, you see that you have an equation for the hashtag of a function, and the hashes of the function should not be invariant most of the time, right? But the thing it's equal to. But the thing it's equal to on the other side is invariant. So the idea is the reason that we're getting these rigidity theorems has nothing to do really with the Ricci curvature, but it has to do with the fact that you have a function f. So in the Greater Ricci Solitan case, you have a function f that's equal to Hessian is equal to lambda g minus Ricci, and the right-hand side there, which I'm going to call Q, is invariant by isometries. And that should be very special, right? Right. Okay, and then in the M classic Einstein case, you have to do something slightly different, which you do this change where you make w be e to the minus f over m. And then the equation looks like hesh of w is w times this change. And so we just want to do this very generally, nothing about asymmetrics or flows. And you just have these class of equations. So I'm going to keep all my theorems are going to have f's. I'm going to keep all my theorems, they are going to have F's and Q's in there. I know the people online can't see them in right over here, but I want to write what F and W are over here. So if you're online, you should write these down at home. So F and Q is all the things where W Q Alright, so then what do you do with this equation like this? Well, you have that S sh equals Q. And so I just let the exometry group act on this, right? So I take phi, which is an element of my exometry group G. So my isometry group G. Alright, well, it's isometry, so that's just G, but it's also an isometry, so that's natural, right? So you get this here, right? So you start with my notation over there, F is in FQ, right? And you have, so here, pi star of f, right, just means f composed of phi, right? Pullback, right, function. So what I have then is I have the, I have the hessian of f is equal to q, I have the hessian of the pullback of f is equal to q. So zero, right? So if I let e be all the e such that such that right f is basically fine space. So if I take two things that are in big F, right, and I take their difference, well then clearly their Hessian is zero, right? But now you have a splitting, right? Because by the Durham theorem, right, the gradient of f is parallel, right? So you have, so constants are always in here, right? So this is a linear space of functions. So, this is a linear space of functions, constants are always in here. And if the dimension of V is k plus 1, then you split your M, it's right, and so then what does this tell me? So, now I look over here. And so then what does this tell me? So now I look over here, and I say, well, either the dimension of v is bigger than one. And then I split off a line. Okay, that's the case we already showed, where in the gradient reach cell time case was all the fat, right? So now you can assume that the dimension of v is one, right? So what does that mean? That means that phi star of f is f plus some. It's f plus some constant, and that constant is going to depend on i. Okay? But this defines a map, right? From your group G to the real numbers, right? It's a group homomorphism, right? So you have this map from G R A and I this group. That's basically the proof of the next theorem, right? Because, okay, so what is a one-dimensional extension? It's going to be a group, a Lie group. Well, a Lie group is a one-dimensional extension, or a homogeneous basis is a one-dimensional extension. If you have a surjective Lie group homomorphism from your group in DOR. So either, so from this, I either get a splitting, right, or I get a surjective Lieutenant homomorphism here. Occur. And of course, homogeneous is important here because if this is zero, right, then the function is constant because I have a transitive group acting on f. And so f would have to be constant. So if f is non-constant, I either get a group homomorphism like this or I get a splitting. And that's the first generalization of theorem one. All right, so now I'm defining for you this is the algebraic definition of a one-dimensional. Is the algebraic definition of a one-dimensional extension? If you're not used to the algebra, I'm going to give you a more geometric one in a moment. So, a gehomogeneous space is called a one-dimensional extension. There's a trajectory linear homomorphism from G to the additive of real numbers. And I need this extra condition that the kernel contains the isotropy, right? So gx is going to be all the phi so that x is some fixed point, right? And gx is all the, I saw isometries. I saw isometries that fix that point, right? You can see if you have a fixed point here, right, then C has to be zero. So the kernel of this map is contains the isotropy. The theorem is just that those are the only two things that can happen. So either you're in case one, which is the case that happens in the Greater Reach Soliton case, or you're a one-dimensional extension, or you can be a product of a one-dimensional extension. So there's some issue here with this. So there's some issue here with the splitting, but you can't do it. You have to split off the lines first. And I mean, really, like, three is technically one dimension. So you could combine two and three together if you want. I believe. So two says you have a code I mentioned one norm is up. Yeah, in particular. In particular, right? That's super special. Yeah, I'll talk about that. Yeah, great. Okay, so. Okay, so, right, and actually, yeah, so that's the next slide. So, what does this mean? Right, this is the easy, this last slide was the easiest way to define one-dimensional extension, but okay, well, first, okay, sorry. First, let me say that can happen, right? So, what's the example you should think about that's a one-dimensional extension? This is a semi-direct product, right? So, you take a Lie group that's a semi-direct product with a left-in variant metric. So, what does that mean? That means there's this phi map from R to the out-of-morph. Map from R to the automorphism group, and you define the product in this way, right, where you twist the product and the H part. And this thing, if you take the projection onto the R factor, this thing does have, this thing's not a constant function, but its Hessian is invariant under left translations. So you can just compute this directly. You have gamma here, it's the element of group, and then the L here means left translation. means left translation by gamma we're in the group so you just apply this to r right and of course nothing happens to the you do that to the r part right so basically it just shifts this function around in the r direction right but if you do that right so here we just have you just have this second last line you have this formula so you take the h in both sides and they're the same right which is just off by a constant so this is really what you should think of as what what it a lot Should think of is what a one-dimensional extension is. If it's a Lie group, this is what it is, right? If it's a homogeneous space, it's basically this. So how do you create these semi-direct products? Well, you start with your Lie algebra H, right? And you can define a Lie algebra that's one-dimensional higher. This is why we called it a one-dimensional extension because we first sort of thought of it in this way, right? You can take a Lie algebra that's You can take a Lie algebra that's one dimension higher. To give you a Lie algebra, I need to tell you what the brackets are. The brackets on H are just the brackets on H. So I have to define the bracket between the vector here and H. You just define that to be the derivation. And the derivation is the thing that's the derivative of the automorphism. And then that gives you a lead group. And then every, or that gives you the algebra, and then every algebra is the lead group. So you get these things. Right, so you get these things, and that's basically what a one-dimensional extension is, right? So, um, except you know, for homogeneous space, you might have isotropy, but you can say that if you have a one-dimensional extension, then this G is a symmetric product, and the M is diffeomorphic to H mod GX, GX again, the isotropy, so we're assuming it's an H, so it doesn't mess anything up there. And then you can think of, so if you want to just think about this more geometrically or analytically, right? It's a or analytically, right? It's a function, it's a homogeneous metric that looks like this, where the GRs are homogeneous metrics on some fixed, or family of homogeneous metrics on some fixed homogeneous space H. I guess I asked, this looks like a combo gene one metric. It is a comogeny one metric. Okay, so I saw it. Yeah, okay. It is. Yeah. So it's a, right, but there's no, there's no isotropy there, so it's just. Right. So it's if you morphic, that's really great. So if you want for it, that's how we put it. Let's go with any one. All right, are there questions about this? That's now the definition, if you want, right? Okay, so then the question is: okay, so we have these in general, right? In the general setting, we're just studying the space F, right? The result is if you have. The result is if you have basically a function whose Hessian is invariant under a transitive group, but if the function isn't, it looks like this. That's essentially the general sort of geometric theorem. So then why don't we get these for reaching solid ones, right? That's because you can do this. You can write down this metric like this. And then it turns out that That if the tensor, the symmetric C tensor Q that you start with is divergence-free, then all of these one-dimensional extensions are just products themselves. It's really just the divergence of, you have this distance function R, right? And you get the, if the divergence of Q is zero, then the divergence of the Hessian of R is zero, and then you put in a Bachner formula, and you get that the Hessian is That the Hessian is zero, yes. So once you have this structure, you can just if you assume that Q is divergence-free, then you only get products. And this generalizes the reaching curvature case, of course, because by this second Bianchi identity, right, the divergence of the reach tensor is one half, which the scalar curvature were in a homogeneous space, right? So the scalar curvature is constant. So the divergence of reach, you have a homogeneous space. So, the divergence of Ricci on a homogeneous space is always zero. So, this is our first generalization. All right, so before I go to W, let me talk about a couple of applications of this theorem, right? So, this is a little bit like Chris's talk. Chris's talk yesterday, right? So we have a theorem about, so we can think about, so one way we can apply this, right, is we can think about solitons to other flows, right? So if you start with a flow that's not the Ricci flow, it's a curvature flow, Q is still invariant under isometries, right? And so this tells you that if you have some flow and you can show on a homogeneous space that the divergence of the thing you're flowing by is zero, then you get this theorem, which works. This theorem one. Always works. This theorem one of the first slide will always work. Okay, so Aaron Griffin, who is my student, had this idea to do this for the box flow. So a box soliton is a soliton to the Bach flow. In our homogeneous space, the equation will just look like for the gradient thing will be Hessian of F is equal to B, where B is the Bach tensor. The Bach tensor is always divergence-free. This is in dimension 4. Free. This is in dimension four. Right, so you can apply this theorem. Now, when you do this, this was Erin's idea to do this. I gave this talk. The only other time I've given this talk in 3D, right, not online, is at Syracuse, maybe in like 2018 or something. She said, why don't you do this with Block Soliton? I said, what's the Black Soliton, right? Did it. But the subtle thing you have to think about is that for Ricci solitons, if you have a product splitting, well, then the two pieces are Einstein or solitons. are Einstein or solitons, right? But for something like the Bach flow, right, if you take a product, there's no Bach, it's not the Bach tensor on the pieces. You have to figure out what that is, right? And so she was able to show in this way that if you have a steady gradient box soliton in some genes, it's black flat. If you have a shrinking one, it's a product metric on H2 cross S2 or H3 plus R2 cross H2. How it found these examples earlier at theater 2x2. Examples earlier at 32x2. And then the classification is not totally complete in the case where you have R, one-dimensional R across something. But she was able to show there's an expanding homogeneous Friday box alloton on R cross SU2. So this is different than Reachy flow. There's no Frady homogeneous soliton on this, but Ricci Flow. And she shows this is the only one where this thing here is unimodular. Much more. Okay. And then more recently, I have another student who's finishing right now, Nick Aing, just depending on his sees. He applies this to the G2 flow. I'm not going to. That would be another talk that Nick would have to give about what the G2 flow is, but it's a flow on seven-dimensional manifolds that's supposed to find metrics with. Um, find metrics with G2 holonomy, right? Um, so it's another flow, right, where people have studied homogeneous uh solitons on these equations. So Jorge Lorett showed that there are Laplacian solitons for this G2 flow on leaders that are not products, right? And student Nick Leanne also had some Dilipotent examples. Um, and Nick was able to show that basically none of the, using this theory, none of these examples are gradient, right? So you also get that there aren't any gradient points here. Again, it's kind of There aren't any gradient points here. Again, it's kind of a bad theorem. We like to find some gradient ones, but we don't see just what's interesting in this case, though, because in the previous two cases, Ricci and Black, the divergence of the Q sort of a priori is zero. You can start from that case, even for solitons that aren't gradient, right? Just metrics like this, right? But these examples, some of these Nicleady examples, the divergence of Q is not zero. It's possible for a soliton to have this divergence of Q not zero, but he chose using. But he chose using other reasons that this structure. So maybe there are examples that are for this flow, it seems like, you know, there might be examples that are gradient in this case, but we haven't been able to find them yet. Okay. All right, so one application of this is you can use this theorem to look at homogeneous gradient solutions to other flows. All right. Any questions? Any questions? All right, so then if I go to the W, right, so now we have this, the M quasi-Einstein equation, right? So now we're looking at S of W equals W times Q. So the model for the F case was product of Euclidean space, right? Because you have these, the Durham theorem, right? You have these Hessian equals zero. Things. In this case, the models are now all the space is a constant curvature, right? Because now you want to take, you think about Q is a multiple of the metric. G, right? This happens on any space of constant curve. This happens on any space of constant curvature, right? So when I guess k is negative, right, you get the sphere, so bada. When k is equal to zero, you get Splitian space, that's the same thing, right? When k is positive, well, you don't always get a hyperbolic space, but if it's also homogeneous, you get a hyperbolic space. And the function is in w. And the the functions in w right are exactly and the the functions in this space w in these cases are exactly the coordinate functions for the natural embeddings of these things, right? So for a sphere, right, if you have heter of w equals, say, minus w times g, right, the functions like that are the restriction of the coordinate functions to the sphere, right? And in planning space, they're just the Euclidean space, they're just linear coordinate functions, and hyperbolic space, the hyperbolate model, and you take the coordinate functions and restrict them to the hyperbolic space and the hyperbolate model and all size. So that's just to explain the rigidity you should get is not a product with Rk, it's a product with a space of constant curvature. And that's the result, right? Is that if you have a homogeneous manifold, this is a metric two gens or now you have a non-trivial. Full of the symmetric two-jets are now you have a non-trivial thing satisfying this equation, right? It either be a space of constant curvature, um, homogeneous space, and the product of the space of constant curvature. You can have some quotients, you can tell which quotients you get, and I'm packaged out for this talk, or you get the one-dimensionalist space. And in this case, there are Einstein metrics, right? There are, as I said, there are quasi-Einstein metrics, so you don't get vergent zero. Zero does even give you sort of extra rigidity. It turns out if Q is Podazzi, you do get the extra rigidity. But I don't have any application for that. A homogeneous space, Podazzi, it's an invariant tensor. So Kodazi is a different condition than divergence, but if you have Kodazi in trace free, then it's divergence free. Or constant trace, right? Kodazi in constant trace, then it's divergence free. So Kodazi is a stronger condition here. People should be. Okay. So, one thing I don't know, but I guess one reason I want to give a talk with this audience, right, is like, are there other cues you could put here that are natural where you could look into this? I don't know of other equations. You can put the box tensor here for you. I don't know what the meaning of that equation is, for example. But if you have equations where you have the hash of w, w times something, this is. This is only a homogeneous space, but some of our work also works on homogeneous ideas, right? So maybe this is helpful. Okay, so that's, yes, and that's sort of what I talked about on the second slide there of the worker. Well, that was okay. So now I'm going to generalize this again. So now instead of looking at just tenths, I'm going to look at the tracery part. So as we've also seen today in the talk, the talks, right, we get an equation like dash of w is equal to w times q plus some function times the metric, right? In the case where you have a conformally Einstein metric, right? So I'll say a conformally Einstein metric. Right, so I'll say I can form the anti-metric is the mining manifold with the function W, so that the, I guess I should write him right on the slide, right? But you know, the little circle, hope you can see it, move back, right? It's that it's a weird right, so the circle just means trace-free part of the tensor, right? So you just take the tensor, q, and you subtract. Q and you subtract the trace of Q divided by the dimension I have times G. And it turns out, you know, if you have a conformal, a metric to your original metric that's conformal, or conformal metric to your original metric that's Einstein, right, it happens if you solve an equation like this, right? Which means you have to stay. So, we also want to study. So, this is also, you know, a nice linear equation. Right, if you think of it as an equation for W, right, with Q fixed, right? And also the Q is invariant. Okay, and so in the homogeneous case, we can also deal with this almost. And here's one thing to point out is that it looks like, again, Quasi-Einstein, right? The Hessian of Warici. But now this M here. But now, this m here is negative, right? 2 minus n is a negative number. Okay. All right. So this is supposed to be more general, but there's kind of a dumb way to make this more general, which is you can just change the q by a function times, or I guess it's a very, so a constant times g, and just say, oh, right, w hat of q is not equal to the w of q. So that's why we have this definition. We call it essential if you can't do that. Call it essential if you can't do that. So it's basically a trace-free version of these equations that's not equal to the trace of a W, right, where you didn't mod out by the trace. I have a notion. Yes. In your original slide where you defined W and you were looking at your space W of Q, you said that W is equal to e to the F over N. So is M still playing a role here? A role here? Like, is it still exponential, or how is that factoring? Well, no, it's just W now. So you could do W as e to the F over 2 minus N, and you get the F version of the equations, right? You could do that back. Okay. Because I didn't really write out this equation. Let's see what it is. But you could write it in terms of f with the same terms, right? And the natural thing to do would be f over 2 minus n. Right, F over 2 is N. Any question? So the second sentence follows from the first. Does the first sentence, the condition on the trace free Hessian, follow from the second component you answered? Yeah. Yes. It's a family. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I want to ask, what happens if n is 2? I mean, the equation doesn't make sense to us. Yeah, n is not 2. Yeah, well, yeah. If n is 2, Yeah, right. If n is 2, yeah. Right. Yeah. n is bigger than 2. Thank you. It's a different equation. There's an n minus 2. Right, yeah. So it's a different formula for when you do the conformal change, it's a different formula. I should say here, too, so we call this conformally Einstein, but I guess we found out after we published the paper, it's also called literature. After we published the paper, it's also called in literature almost Einstein. And I guess the reason not to call it Einstein is a good thing to point out, is I'm not assuming W is positive, right? So, you know, for example, in the sphere, right, you take the coordinate functions, right? Those are not positive. But wherever it is positive in this end set, you have some zero set for this function w where it kind of degenerates. But I'm not worrying about that. And actually, I mean, that's one of the things. Actually, I mean, that's maybe one of the things we had to realize. That's why we do this change to e to the minus f over m, right? It's because now it becomes a linear space of functions. Right, but you've lost the w is positive, but it's better for us to do it this way than to think of f, right? So the end is to actually get like a real dual product metric, you would want to don't have a positive function. So, right, so again, in the homogeneous space, we can do something. This is a hard equation in general, right? But we just want to look at a homogeneous case. And there it becomes easy because you can show that if this thing is essential, then you have a conformal vector field. But if you have a conformal vector field on a homogeneous space, you're a little bit formally flat. So again, there's some, maybe a little bit harder than what I should be. It's maybe a little bit harder than what I showed you right here, but it's also a sort of geometry kind of thing. That's a part of it. So the result is that if you have an essential one of these spaces, then we openly conform it flat. And nicely, Tagaki in the 70s classified one of homogeneous spaces, locally flat. It's basically spaces of constant curvature or the products there of locally formed flatients. So you don't have to think too much about what this says. So, you don't have to think too much about what this says. It just basically says: so, putting this together with our other theorem, what is this telling us? It's telling us either it's locating formula clap, but there's a list, right? Or it's not essential, which means I can go back to W instead of W, trace-free W. So what this tells us is if I want to find, so I want to find conformally Einstein metrics that are homogeneous, and if you combine this together, you get combine this together you get the locally locally conformed flat ones of course are right because they're locally conformally flat they're locally einstein right um so the only other examples you got to look at are solutions to this equation right the hessian w is w over 2 minus n for g minus lambda right so this is like the m quasi equation um where m is negative right so it's like the result i mentioned at the beginning um and in fact when we were doing this And in fact, when we were doing this, we then found this paper by these five Spanish mathematicians, right? Where they do this problem actually in dimension four, they actually do something more. They find the, classify the homogeneous block flat vectors in dimension four. And there's a list, right? So we saw this and we're like, oh, our thing should be in there. And we couldn't figure out for a little while where they were. But it turns out these are one-dimensional extensions. These are one-dimensional extensions, these are examples of the things we've done before. So, I guess I should say, yeah, we can then apply our theorem to this, right? Know that we just have to set into one-dimensional extensions basically to find define them. I read from this that homogeneous button-flat metrics were only found in 2019. Classify it, yeah, yeah. Classify it. I think so. As far as I know, they do other things in this paper too, but it helps. Okay, so then once you have their examples and you figure out how they fit into our sort of onsets, we show these can be generalized to all dimensions, right? And so the question is whether these are all of them, and we don't know. So as I said, I mentioned this earlier, but Mira La Fuente showed the result when M was positive, right? The thing I mentioned at the beginning, that you start with the Ricci solid, but the thing that you have to extend. Solat that the thing that you have to extend to get an M quasi-anstey metric when M is positive is a Ricci-Solaton metric, right? And every Ricci-Soliton metric works, right? So when M. So the interesting thing you find out is that, so his arguments work when m is positive. When m is negative, this doesn't always work. So some of the algebraic reaches all atons, you can't extend them to get nine-stein spaces, and there's just a condition on their scalar curvature. There's just a condition on their scalar curvature. So, their scalar curvature bound on their scalar curvature. So, for example, in dimension three, nil works, right? You start with the reaching soliton of a three-dimensional nil-potoly group, right? You can extend it and you get one of these conformally insane things, but solve doesn't because the scalar curvature is too big. It's just it just comes from the equations. I don't understand scalar curvature in most cases. It's like it. Yeah, it's a bound in terms of. It's a bound in terms of the other data. Lambda, in terms of lambda. I see. So I think right-nail has a scalar curvature of lambda, I think. That's okay. I think Sol has two lambda, and that's not enough. But that's, and then they also have some examples which actually where you start with something abelian. So the H that you extend is actually a Belium thing, so you can. Thing so you can use that. And so we kind of got to the point where someone in homogeneous geometry should look at this. So, you know, Romero finished this problem with M is positive. And the key thing that we didn't know how to do was you have this derivation D in the one-dimensional extension case, and we couldn't show that D had to be symmetric. And if you have this equation, D has to be symmetric. You have this equation, d has to be symmetric, right? 3G is symmetric, but derivations in general aren't symmetric, right? So if you can show when m is negative, that d has to be symmetric when you solve this n class-Einstein equation, then you can get the classification. Prove it up to that. But we can't show that it's symmetric. Well, because we don't know, we've been busy with lots of other things, right? So this is all. So I thought, yeah, so that turned out to be an interesting thing where M-negative sort of came back. Right, that's what I wanted to say about this conformal Einstein question. Okay, so are there any questions? So you have this structure, and we don't quite know all the inputs, but really good in queries. What do you do? What do you get this M quasi-Nset equation when M is negative, right? But it's an algebra question, I guess, now. Dumb question. I'm sure this is a really dumb question. So of course the open issue is whether there's a Bach flat for metric that's not conformally Einstein. So everyone's so these are in every case you're even looking for Bach flat and Back flat. Well, in dimension four and higher dimensions, I'm just looking at so these guys right do box flat, but I don't do it at all. It just implies what I wanted. Yeah, right. I should also say, I mean, the Einstein metrics together, of course, not complete, too, right? I mean, when you do this, the homogeneous, it follows from this that it can't be complete. You take a homogeneous metric and it's conformal to an Einstein metric, the Einstein thing can't be complete. An Einstein metric, the Einstein fit can't be complete. And that's probably true by some shiro or any of the informal field they need to some old results to that they didn't. So, yeah, I have two minutes, I guess, right? So, I was just gonna, we've already seen some nice talks today about the non-brady case, but I wanted to make a couple of comments about. So, all of this, you can see, I really need the function here, right? I really need the function here, right? I mean, because you have to reach a solid on examples where there's no function. So, this is all really for the function, so you can ask some things in the non-gradient case. So, after we did this, Aaron pointed out to us actually that if you think about the non-gradient case, maybe this is obvious to some people that's remembering it, but if you take a compact manifold, then you have, so now I'm not assuming homogeneous at all, right? I have no idea what. Right, I have no idea what this first one or not, but if you have that the leader is q and q is that divergence-free, well, then it's zero, right? So, uh, clouds are this follow when you do, right, this is saying that the divergence-free tensors are interpreting that you like to look at more of those things. So, so in fact, that tells you that, you know, any soliton to some flow on a compact manifold, if things ever screw, it's also true. If things ever free, it's also trivial. You don't have to assume gradients for that, right? So that's nice. And then, as we've seen, what we've seen earlier, right? So you can also look at the non-gradient and quasi-Einstein equation. We have this here, and so Peter Nichetti and Chen Yang Zhu and another student of mine, Alice Lim, showed actually to have a compact manifold that's locally homogeneous and satisfies this. You do have examples. It satisfies this. You do have examples, right? But there is a lot of structure too, because in fact, you can show that x is left invariant and the killer. That's very strong, right? So actually, you can show in this case where you're compact and locally homogeneous, the leader of term actually goes away. And actually, even the x, x is killing. But on the other hand, there are lots of examples that are constructive. And since we last slide, we've already seen today. Right, there's also, so you know, this has been, so as I said, sort of, we didn't have a good motivation before I learned about the, from Eric, about all this great work about the near-horizon geometries, right, and a market field. So we didn't have a good motivation to really think about the non-gradient case. Think about the non-gradient case, but which we've already mentioned in Charmilla's talk, right? We also have this theorem. So now, if you think about the non-gradient case, it's of course in the compact case natural, but specifically natural for the static thing to think about the X being closed, right, instead of the exact things we saw in the last talk. You can, in that case, you can, when M is positive, you can know what everything is, right? So, Christian O'Reilly and Todd did the first one. Todd did the first one, number of these, I guess. And then Eric and Sharmila and Ari and Eric. Eric did the rest of it, except for just showing this last part, which I observed. So Eric gave a talk in Syracuse in November about this, and then I was able to show after that, but actually this is where you get to get it. So that was very fun to get a new problem to think about, right? Problem to think about, right? That's something I got there. Thank you.
