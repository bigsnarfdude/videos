So, yeah, I'm going to talk about a project I've been working on with Alessandro Bervetti at EMAS in Mexico City and David Sloan at University of Lancaster. I guess I'll first just say, describe the plan for the talk. Uh, the plan for the talk or what I want to say. So it is the first essay in the sort of general setting that this project treats is. You can ask when you have a mechanical system, you can consider sort of a more general type of symmetry than you usually consider. Type of symmetry, then you usually consider where you preserve the unparameterized trajectories and ask what you can do with such types of symmetries. And so this theme of the talk, scaling symmetry, is a very special type of symmetry of your orbits that in general may reparametrize, may not preserve the time parametrization of your orbits. And so the main result is that, well, more precise, but when you have such a type of symmetry that we're calling scaling symmetry of a Hamiltonian system, mechanical system, you can reduce it by one dimension onto a type of contact related to a contact. Related to a contact Hamiltonian system. So it's this general sort of framework that I want to discuss. And I think first, so I'll just recall the example that is the one here we've seen in many of the talks is the MIGI blow-up for n-body problems. Well, n-body problems. And in the talk, I'm just going to talk about Kepler problem because it's just simpler to write out the formulas. But you can do this, of course, for n-body problem, the same type of thing, or other homogeneous potentials of force loss. So, yeah, we have our Newtonian usual Kepler problem, and you can get this. You can get this one way you can think of this block is you're writing the equations of motion in a sort of scale-invariant way. So we all know familiar in these Newtonian problems. You have this sort of scaling symmetry. If you scale a trajectory and reparametrize it according to these weights, you can see my mouse if I point. Is it? Yeah. So, this is as well a solution. So, this is the example of a scaling symmetry. And so I'll write it sort of in the way that we can, the way that fits with our general framework we're going to consider is Hamiltonian form. You have the usual Hamiltonian symplectic form, and you're scaling the Q's and P's. Q's and P's as follows for a real number lambda, it's non-zero, and the energy and symplectic form scale with the following weights, right? These kinds of weights that we use will be important in stating the general result. So we have a minus two and a one, and I mean, you could choose various choices, but we decided to normalize things. Normalize things when the symplectic form scales is degree one. Okay, so just to say, so you have this type of reparametrizing symmetry, and so you expect to write the equation of motion kind of split into quantities invariant under the scaling. So these are the natural choices you could make. I just normalize the position and Normalize the position and make the velocity cancel the scaling. And so these are the Maggie equations of motion in terms of these x's and y's. They're a closed system and you parameterize by this usual factor. And there's as well the third equation for the overall kind of size, but we will focus on these because they're close. Because they're closed system, right? You're free to forget about rural. So, yeah, this talk is about the structure of these types of equations that arise in this way from a type of scaling symmetry like this, and they're related to a contact structure on this three-dimensional S1 times R2. So, here is the what we call the scaling symmetry is. Scaling symmetry is well scaling symmetry of some Hamiltonian system, and we have a degree which we'll call lambda capital. So it scales the Hamiltonian by lambda. So it's minus two for the Kepler problem or Newtonian and body problem. And it scales the symplectic form with homogeneous degree one. This condition has a name if you're familiar with it. Has a name if you're familiar with it called Liu-Fill vector field, and it's equivalent to saying that this contraction with D is a primitive of omega. So make this closed. So this is a scaling symmetry. And a Hamiltonian system which admits this, our main result will be that you can describe it on a contact manifold of one dimension less. So, but yeah, so this is just to see how it works for capital problem degree minus two, the one that we brought at the start. And I mean, the reason this type of symmetry is a symmetry is because it preserves unparametrized orbits, you know, just like with the Kepler problem. So it preserves the line field of the The line field of the Hamiltonian flow. Oh, it is very special if lambda is one. Then it preserves parametrized orbits, preserves time. Okay. So because of, I mean, because it's an actual symmetry of the orbits, you can reduce the system. I mean, we're going to just make the simple assumption that when we take this quotient, That when we take this quotient at the space of orbits of D, we have a nice manifold to consider, and we call this C, it's going to be the contact manifold. And yeah, so along the orbits, the direction of XH is just possibly changing according to the weight lambda minus one. So you can project down onto the quotient and have a scale-reduced kind of well-defined line field as your sort of scale-reduced dynamic. Sort of scale-reduced dynamics or integral curves. So, this is the picture for the usual way you would produce any sort of line field with a symmetry. And yeah, so point is now that this quotient space, which we're calling C, is a contact manifold. So, contact manifold is an odd-dimensional manifold with a special distribution of hyperplanes, which I call curly D. So you just project the omega complement of D down to C, and that's your contact distribution. It's just another standard result when you have a Leo Vu vector field that this is something you can do. And so to write To write, describe kind of these reduced dynamics, we're going to use some more structure. So on a contact manifold, you can always, at least locally, and for all the examples it will be global, you can always choose up to scale some one form whose kernel gives the contact distribution. And in our setting here, it's equivalent to choosing. Our setting here is equivalent to choosing a score or what we call a scaling function. So, for the Kepler problem, this is the norm of q to the one-half because the way we chose our weights. So, just something that scales degree one under d. So, the whole idea is now if you pick a scaling function, you can divide anything that is homogeneous of some degree by an appropriate power of rho to have the corresponding quantity on the ridge. Corresponding quantity on the reduction C. Okay, and so yeah, if you pick a row, it's the same as picking an eta. So the way you can see this is equivalent is just that the contact form pulls back to this scale invariant form, where lambda is this primitive of omega that you get by contraction. Okay, so lambda is always degree one with respect to d. Respect to D. And so this quantity is a well-defined scalar invariant, one form that vanishes on D. So you can define a one form on C whose kernel is exactly D, just because that's what it was upstairs. Okay. Okay. Well, let me just maybe before. Well, so the next thing I want to talk about is, you know, we're using this one form because you use such. This one form because you use such a choice to define the dynamics more explicitly than just it's the push, you just push down the span of the Hamiltonian vector field is not so explicit or useful. And so the way we're going to describe how this reduction, the general form is with the notion of kind of contact Hamiltonian and contact Hamiltonian flow so. So, well, you have a contact Hamiltonian. Yes, contact manifold. I'll tell you the definition. So you have two conditions that define a vector field uniquely. So one is that H is the contraction with eta, and that the second condition says that, well, the flow of XH is by contactomorphisms. By contactomorphisms, it preserves the distribution in terms of the one form. That just means that the derivative of eta is proportional to eta. It preserves the kernel of eta. Sort of equivalent way to write this second condition is as follows, just using Cartan magic formula. R. I guess it is r here will be the refield of eta. It's just the natural vector field associated to any contact one form. any contact one form. This is a contact Hamiltonian, contact Hamiltonian flow. And oh yeah, so I put here as well the coordinate expressions. So these are like the contact analog of Darboux coordinates that you use in simple eptic geometry. And this is how the equations of motion look. So S is something you can think of whose Can think of whose which is kind of like action, you know. Integral of s is like integral of the gendre transform of h you have this new kind of dissipation here. So h in con, yeah, I say contrary to in symplectic systems where you have the energy, the Hamiltonian is constant, it's no longer constant unless h is independent of s. So, this is the types of flows that we get down on this scale-reduced quotient. And the way that I want to next kind of talk about how you can think of this, that makes it very natural to how you can describe the flow downstairs by such a system. So the The kind of main point, well, here's sort of the general type of way to think of contact Hamiltonian flows. You know, we have these conditions. Why do you choose H this way? And it's kind of related to this natural construction with simplectification. And the main point in our theorem is that when you have a scaling symmetry where it's m Where it's M and C with this projection to M mod D. You can think of it just like a simplectification. So really this understanding the simplectification and its relation is all you need to know to understand the coefficient of m by d. So what is simplication? You have your contact manifold and you can always produce Can always produce in a standard way a symplectic manifold, which is kind of a principal bundle over C. So the fibers are just a non-zero real number. And what this is just a subset of the cotangent bundle. The elements are the one forms whose kernel gives the distribution at the point x in C. And it's a simple. And it's a symplectic manifold. You just use the canonical one-form restricted to it. Okay. So, yeah, so the point is that this simplectification relates in a natural way to contact Hamiltonian flows. And our picture of M projected to MRD, the fibers are also R. R also R, you can think of it as you know the flow along the orbits of D. So you could take like the E to the S if S is the parameter along the flow of D. And we have this exact picture you have. And so what's the fundamental connection to kind of motivate contact Hamiltonian flows is that if you have any, you know, contact homorphism, a map on Contactomorphism and map on C, which preserves the contact distribution. You can always lift it to a symplectic map of C twiddle and it preserves the canonical one form. So you take any contact vector field that's like going to be the xh of some function of some contact Hamiltonian. The second condition was exactly that contact. Exactly, that contact Hamiltonian flow preserves the contact distribution, and you just lift its flow and you get a flow, a flow on the simplectification by exact simplectomorphisms. And so you can associate a Hamiltonian upstairs, Hamiltonian flow which projects exactly down to this contact flow. And so the contact Hamiltonian is just basically. Basically, something that pulls back to this symplectic Hamiltonian inducing the contact flow h. So, that's this is equivalent to the definition I wrote above in the coordinates with the eta. So, you have some contact vector field, you associate a Hamiltonian and a symplectic vector field on the symplectification. Now, pick any one form you like. One form may not. One form may not be defined globally, but okay, you always have some local section now, right? You just associate eta to as the section in c Twiddle, and you just take is a restriction of your symplectic Hamiltonian to this. This is the same as the definition before. I wanted to say all this because the type. The type of flow we get below is not exactly this construction because we are considering general degrees lambda of our Hamiltonian upstairs on n. So when lambda is one, it's exactly this construction. The degree of lambda is the same as the degree of the Hamiltonian up here on the fibers. You can ask for Hamiltonians that are homogeneous. Hamiltonians that are homogeneous of some degree on the fiber R of R top R cross. And so this is like a special case of Lambda equals one. You get a contact Hamiltonian flow. And if you want to generalize this to a Hamiltonian, which is degree Lambda up here, you can do a very similar construction. That was, I guess, sort of our main contribution to slightly. Contribution to slightly generalized standard construction that you would find, say, in Arnold's classical mechanics in an appendix. All of this is there. So some language. Well, this is what I just sort of said. So, you know, you have a Hamiltonian vector field X associated to the contact Hamiltonian H, and we also have upstairs this H twiddle. And whenever you do this, And whenever you do this construction, the Hamiltonian on the simplectification is degree one up here. So it's the lambda equals one case. There's no reparametrization involved. And so conversely, we're kind of thinking of running this in reverse because we're starting with a Hamiltonian upstairs on M, which can be thought of just like a Hamiltonian on supplex. Just like a Hamiltonian on selectification of M on D. And we want to say that you reduce it to a contact Hamiltonian on this quotient space, which is a contact manifold. So we want to consider something which is not degree one with respect to this action on simplectification. So degree lambda out of stairs on C. And so the construction is So the construction is that sort of generalizes is we're going to, I'm going to, we call it this, a lambda Hamiltonian vector field on C. Although this is our notation. And so it's the same thing. You pick a contact one form. You have a contact Hamiltonian. I already, this is the same. This is just a section associated to eta. So you have a lambda here. Yeah, so this is the only difference. Here, yeah, so this is the only difference. This is the same, but you have the lambda here. And why do you define it this way? Because the orbits of the symplectic, the Hamiltonian vector field upstairs project onto the orbits of this lambda Hamiltonian vector field on C. So this is the way that we describe a reduction more explicitly, right? Explicitly. This is, you have this H on M, degree lambda, and now you can describe the orbits on this scale of reduced space in terms of one of these vector fields, such as this slight twist. And well, I wrote the coordinate expression. The only difference is a lambda here. Okay, okay. Um right so here's our main theorem, uh our main description of this process. Yeah, I kind of was saying already, one of the first results is that M when you have a scaling symmetry D, you can think of it like the symplectification. So it's just like that this. That this case I say here, and you apply this general fact, and that's the proof of this mean theorem. So just read it: you have a Hamiltonian of degree lambda with respect to this scaling symmetry D. If I take a scaling function rho, then I can produce this function on C. This is scale invariant. It is a well-defined function on C, and the lambda. And the lambda Hamiltonian vector field of this function h is exactly the orbits of the Hamiltonian system, project the orbits of this. And well, you always have to say with respect to what contact one form you've chosen, and it's just this one that we saw before. Okay, so some comments. Comments in general, you have a reparametrization relating the orbits upstairs to the orbit downstairs that you project it to in terms of the scaling function. So this is exactly the reparametrization if you're running for the Kepler problem, the r to the three halves that we're used to. And yeah, this is another thing I want to say. This lambda Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian vector fields on a contact manifold, their flow does not preserve the contact distribution, right? Unless lambda is equal to one. But okay, you can modify it to a Hamiltonian flow, or not Hamilton, to a contact distribution-preserving flow in a not too complicated way. So So, on the energy zero surface, you don't have to change anything. And well, away from that, you do have to reparametrize if you want to preserve the contact distribution. So, here's the explicit relation. So, this thing is given by this vector field. So, yeah, remind the notation. This xh is the contact Hamiltonian vector field of h, lambda equals 1, 1. So, this one. So this one preserves the contact distribution. This R is the reap field of eta. It preserves the contact distribution. But in general, you have this factor, which means makes things not in general preserve D when you take the linear combination. But of course, if H is zero or lambda is one, it's just the usual contact Hamiltonian flow, which preserves the contact vector field. Field. Oops. And okay, the way you can reparametrize it is just by taking this factor on h not equal to zero. So this is actually a re-vector field of a different contact one form. Sort of, yeah, just talking about the general structure you get in this setting. Okay. Now, before I kind of want to finish by just talking about the Magi example again, but I want to say one other sort of good thing to know that Hamiltonian systems you can Legendre transform as long as it's natural and invertible to a Lagrangian. Invertible to a Lagrangian, yeah, and you have variational principle, and the same thing is true for contact Hamiltonian flows. So yeah, of course, you have to consider kind of a special type of contact manifold, right? If your Hamiltonian is on a cotangent bundle, you convert it to a Lagrangian line tangent bundle. So it's the same kind of thing. If you have So it's the same kind of thing. If you have this kind of contact manifold, a product, where this is the canonical one form, and this is your contact, well, this is a contact one form defining your distribution. Then you just can always Legendre transform on t star q. Assuming everything is invertible, there's Legendre transform, you'll get a variational principle associated to every sort of contact system. It to every sort of contact system, in particular the ones that we just defined. So let me say this variational principle. So if I have one of these systems that we just defined, this Lambda Hamiltonian vector field on C, and my C is of this form, I can take its Legendre transform and we call this a Lambda-Herglott system. So this is a So, this is a Herglots-Lagrangian, or Lambda Herglots-Lagrangian, maybe to be more careful on TQ cross-war. So, S just stays the same, right? You're just changing P's and P's. And well, okay, so this is your Herglots, Lagrangian. But what's the variational principle? It's kind of a funny problem. Problem. So you consider critical points of this action. But the curves have to satisfy a constraint. So S cannot be arbitrary. If you give you Q of T, Q prime of T then is determined, S has to satisfy this ODE. So there's a constraint like this. And oh yeah, so just like with this Lambda Hamiltonian vector field. Lambda Hamiltonian vector field. If lambda is one, it's the standard thing called the contact Hamiltonian vector field. With this Lambda Herglott system, if Lambda is one, it's what's called what's kind of a more standard thing called a Herglott system. It's just S prime is L. That's, and it's always kind of more natural to think of S is action, but I guess maybe I can show, right? Because we have this lambda here, S is not exactly just. Here, S is not exactly just equation motion for this. Okay, so this is the type of variational problem. It's kind of a funny variational problem, but that's the natural thing associated to this type of degree lambda contact system that we've got. And well, yeah, E is just basically H written in the Legendre transform. And it's important to maybe emphasize that you know we're used to Hamiltonian system, but on these systems, the Hamiltonian and the energy are not constant, they dissipate in general, unless H is independent of S. Okay, so the theorem that we that our sort of main description, you can just apply it in a variational setting by Variational setting by taking the gendre transform of everything and one prime. So, just another way to say kind of the same thing. So, we also, there's a lot going, a little bit more going on here because there's, you have to consider sort of more particular situations than just, you know, you can't just start with. You know, you can't just start with a symplectic manifold. You start with a H on a cotangent bundle, like a natural system. But the corresponding thing is a Lagrangian on a tangent bundle. And we have to consider a special type of scaling symmetry of degree. Well, we have the same thing with degree lambda. So it scales the Lagrangian like this, just like before. But it has to also not just preserve omega or d lambda l, this would be. Or d lambda l this would be just the pullback of the canonical one form under Legendre transformation, right? Del q prime l dot dq. So we consider these because this is kind of equivalent to having a reduction of the base. So this type of condition and a special kind of scaling function it has to admit on the base, you know, on q hat. The base, you know, on q hat, which can be thought of as a function on the t q hat. So we need these two conditions in order to make kind of a nice identification of the quotient in terms of something which has, you know, Hurgot systems are defined on a not just any, it has to be a tangent cross R, you know, special form. So with these two sort of additional conditions, we Additional conditions, we identify this scale-reduced space with a product in a natural way. Q is the quotient of Q hat by D. So these conditions imply that this vector field on the tangent bundle projects to a vector field D on the base. That's the important consequence. So you can just take a quotient here. And yeah, so this S has. And yeah, so this S has an explicit formula. The Herglotz Lagrangian has this formula. So this is, I mean, there's a bit going on. This expression here is invariant under d hat. So it leads to a well-defined Herglots-Lagrangian on this quotient, and you have this lambda-Herglotz variational system. It's just, if you want, you start with the Hamiltonian version and then Legendre transform it. version and then Legendre transform it. So the Hamiltonian side just gives you T star Q cross R for your contact manifold. Okay, so those are the two kind of versions of the same thing that you can use to scale reduce a system. I guess I'll just end. I want to just say the way that this works out with the Kepler problem, I mean really the formulas are great, are good for it. really the formulas are great are good for n-body problem and with different weights different lambdas you can do any uh any homogeneous force law it's a small modification right so this was our setup we have our hamiltonian this scaling symmetry we we we know from the start we take this for our scaling function and yeah so And yeah, so this is what you obtain is just another way to say Magi blow up. Now you have the addition structure that it has this contact one form. So this statement is the lambda equals minus two contact or Hamiltonian vector field of this thing on this contact manifold. For here it's like t star s1. t star s1 cross r right and this is describing the with just the McGee equations that that we saw at the start so yeah here I just wrote the same thing I put I put this new here just to make the formula more compact so yeah I mean this of course it's hard in It's hard in celestial mechanics, right? This stuff is kind of already known. The only part that seems to not be mentioned is that there's, or that I haven't seen mentioned as much, although people do mention it here, is that you have this contact structure connected to the equations. But yeah, this scaling symmetry is, of course, something that, I mean, everyone here knows it. And one of the articles that kind of One of the articles that kind of describes it very nicely is this article of Sean Sinaire. I mean, it's she just says, okay, here's the scaling symmetry, so we can write things in scale-in variant coordinates. And this is Muggie blow-up. So these are the kind of coordinates he uses in this notation. Well, just a different choice of coordinates. And oh, yeah, you can then find the equations of motion if you like. The equations of motion, if you like, just straight straight off, and then I guess, yeah, there's I'll just state the formula, how it looks for the Herglots sort of side, the geometric transform that last thing. So, this is the type of Herglots-Lagrangian you get, okay, and this formula would be the same, both of these first two formulas. Same, both of these first two formulas will be the same for any n-body system, right? I'm talking about Kepler, but you don't really change anything here. S is just in a sphere rather than a circle. And well, for Kepler, U of S is just constant one. So you could also alternately write it like this for the Kepler problem. So you have this kind of variational principle associated with the McGee blow-up equations, which Gee blow up equations, which is something I didn't know. And so that's the well, that's sort of just the formula for it. And yeah, here are the sort of references. This is the one that I just mentioned that talks about the scaling symmetry and connecting them to MIDI blow-up. And well, yeah, you can also. Well, yeah, you can also do this for other problems like other central force laws. And it's kind of, this is another article that kind of explains a variety of examples in a nice way. Armin, this article of David was sort of the motivation for doing this project because he was talking about exactly these kinds of symmetries in. These kinds of symmetries in physics. And so we joined up with him to work out kind of just in a nice, clean, simple way how to describe what's going on. And there are also these articles on B contact manifolds very closely related to the structure that you get by these. And this is our latest kind of article that we, well, preprint we have that describes these constructions. These constructions. So, well, I'll just say, I guess, yeah, so the point of this talk was just to talk about the general setup. I didn't really do any applications or anything. I just told you the formulas of how it looks. But I think this whole setup is something that at this point is just begging to be used. I mean, hopefully you can use it for something. Hopefully, you can use it for something useful, right? You know, it never hurts to know that there's kind of a very natural structure associated to this reduction, and that's something that would be nice to look at in future work. And well, that's all I wanted to say. So thanks for your attention, and thanks for the organizers and all the participants for all the nice talks. I've been enjoying them a lot. So thanks. Thank you to you. So, there are questions. And so, in fact, if I understand with this formalism, you can, in some sense, you can give Lagrangian formulation. Can give a Lagrange formulation to McGuire equation, if I understand a network. Yeah, yeah, it's this sort of, yeah, this sort of a Lagrange type formulation with a constraint, which we call this Hurgwat system. Yeah, that's right. And in fact, I have just a remark. So what you explain now, remember me, the notion of conformal simplicity. of conformal symplectic yeah conformal symplectic geometry i don't know if you know the stuff but and if you think there are some some relation with what you what you explained now yeah i don't know it that well i mean uh we did look at some articles about that uh yeah i mean these are these are transformations that sort of Are transformations that sort of scale the symplectic form, if I remember right? Yeah, so these are certainly very related because this is the scaling symmetry is one of these conformal transformations of M. But it's a very special case because it's scaling it in a very homogeneous way, just theory one. But yeah, one thing that kind of part of the general Part of the general type of question I'm interested in is, I think, more related to that setup, because you would like to know what you can do with just some type of symmetry that, you know, it doesn't have to scale the vector field by a homogeneous degree, lambda minus one, right? Maybe it just multiplies it by a constant or some function, right? Many more general things to look at. But this case kind of works out. But this case has kind of worked out so cleanly, it's nice to just consider on its own. Okay, so I don't know if there are questions from distance people. Can I ask a question? Yeah, sure. Hi, hello, Kona. Thanks very much for your seminar. So I was just wondering when you talk about this D, when you plant this vector. Plant this vector field. Is this in one-to-one correspondence to your H? I mean, can I say it? Yeah, like maybe if I'm asking kind of if I if I have my Hamiltonian system, is there like a unique D or something like this? Yeah, yes, yes, yes. Yes, yeah, so that's a, yeah, I didn't talk about that point, but yeah, in general, it's it's not unique and um. Not unique. And so, I mean, one sort of silly thing you can do is you can always add like d plus any constant multiple of the Hamiltonian vector field and or any first integral flow, it will satisfy the same. And something we thought about quite a bit was whether you can sort of, because lambda. Can sort of because lambda equals one is very is like sort of the basic and yeah, we were thinking if you can sort of change the degree with a different d but it turns out some some systems you can't you're kind of stuck away from lambda equals to one for instance with the kepler problem or the Newtonian problem. But yeah, it's uh yeah, it's it's not really uh uniquely A uniquely defined D. But if you find one, you get this. And there should be some equivalence if you choose different D's to the equations you get downstairs. Yeah, it's a good question. Yeah, that was one part we've thought about a lot. And I think there's still some things to think about. Yeah, describing more explicitly the sort of set of scaling symmetries a given system may admit. May admit. Okay, no more questions. So, if there are no more questions, we thank you. We thank you once again.
