Uh talk about a lot about expectations. This is uh the dream part of the talk and then uh then I will tell a bit about the results and as you will see there is a big gap between the dreams and the results but anyway. So the setting for market projects, so uh we are considering a a number feed at the base and then we also uh al always fix uh the base uh Always fix a base variety scheme, so it's which will be smooth on geometrical penetration. Okay. So variety means separated number of finite type, and I will usually write variety as a genetic point. And also, the original question I want to address is also about the theatrical system. System. So I face FQP local systems. So I recall this is exactly the same thing as a representation of the delta pi 1 of x on any geometric fiber. So I ignore all the problem about base points. Actually, in this topic, base points are not really a relevant problem. So these are just the same thing as continuous representation. Are just the same thing as continuous representation of the entire fundamental group of the base-dimensional QP vector space, and so every write it row. And everything is from Poirier, so each time that you have a scheme Y mapping to X, you have a morphism of the level of fundamental group, and the pullback of X to Y is just given by the composite representation. So I usually wrote it So I will usually write it while. And I will use the notation pi while for the image of this representation. And I will also write this in G1 for the ZAS project. So this is just an algebraic subgroup of the general linear group of QPM. And for when y is X, I will just forget the Forget the notation, so I will use IG for the notation, and when y is x put back to algebraic closure, okay, with right. And just a reminder about societal value and effects. So I because I assume the scheme is geometrically and finite type, we have a short exact sequence. Short exact sequence. So that for now I work like this. So this is induced by the natural histomorphism of schema. And each time that, for instance, you have a point in your space, correspondingly you have Morphist from Pi one as a point which is just a circular group, otherwise it's a few S. Otherwise, you feel X and this composite map is permanent. So it doesn't work, but so the consequence of this is that pi bar is always a normal subgroup of pi and here you have pi x and pi bar and pi x generates an open subgroup of pi. And all these groups are there, this is This is a compact topological group. This representation is continuous. All these groups are compact theoretically groups. So this will be important. And even subgroups and I can modify uh just by conjugacy my uh representation and I can always assume that it takes value j out. That text value j barcp. Okay, so now to formulate the general problem, I just write square for a property of compactic in subgroup in subgroups of GLR of PM and write x squared for the set of. Uh write x squared for the set of uh points um where pi x satisfies its property. And the main question so I would like to address is um what the sorry, what the existence uh of f at the q. Of F as the cupilla plugin statement X forces for the property of the set of k-rational points on X, or perhaps more to three, for the set of points of bounded to V. This is the set of points to residual field as bounded to be D. And in particular, the kind of question I'm interested in is to understand when the special set intersected with the set of correctional points, or more generally the set of points of point interviewer when they are the issued points, or not the issued rather. Yes, so this is a general question I want to investigate. So for application, the main examples templates. Are those arising from geometry? So by this I mean essentially the adact image of constant geometric local system by a smooth, proper projective morphism. And the toy example, I think toy in bracket because it's not always, even in the setting, it does everything. You can think of this morphism as a universal Those are No, the I'm I'm going to formulate uh the conjecture which is uh very will be my uh my frame. So for this I need to introduce just a definition. So I will say that F is uh geometrically L is semi simple and so G is for geometric only, L for Ni and S for semi simple. If the algebra of the image, of the geometric and fundamental boot, is semi-symbol. And I will say that it is geometrically curved in the missing vertices or curve if this is so maybe I should change curve. If so, for every one constant morphism of file from a smooth curve in the bar, the pullback of the PD Clocket sent to see either Okay, so this is just the definition. Of course, an important example is that those look at system satisfies this property. And as a way to this is a complete menu, this is the Sunis that is called a Sunni simplicity theorem plus Artemon comparison. So if you arise on geometry and you can attach to your sheaf uh also uh the simular, the item edge of the simular sheaf. Similar standard by art in comparison, uh the image of uh of the geometric pi one, uh the algebra of the image of the geometric pi one is the based with the QP. Same basically as the algebra of the RC closure of the topological pi one adacher of the last class stem and the unshot that that this is a semi-simple pipeline. Okay, and so and the main conjecture is so assume F is a geologic curve that is possible, then for every integer D, um, the expectation is that Well, the property square is simply that the dimension of pi x in pi is larger than 1, linear. That pi x is not a plan. Then I will just write x squared and we write xf and this is what I will. I rewrite XF, and this is what I recall. The degeneracy Euro class of F. And so the main conjecture is that the set of points of one degree into the general circuits is not as dense. And second, And second, that so if you consider the points which are not in the decional circle, that is the image that is pi x is open in right, then you can consider the index of pi x in right, finite index. And the second part of the conjecture tells that this uh index should be uniformly bounded. So this is for products points of bound interview which are not So, the expectation is that this certain is an act. Okay. Um and I could perhaps mention the sample of execution, so it's a conjecture. This object before explaining why, at least for these one expectation, is perhaps not completely a dream, but still very far from reach. So a sample of applications. So the application are always, I'm going to mention, are always to the Going to mention always to the issue of when I have a smooth proper morphism. We want to understand how some invariants attached to the cyber vary with the familiar. And for instance, the consequence of the first part of the conjecture will be that you have known the high skill density of the degeneracy locus of the motivated gelato of the fiber. Sometimes SF, so this is a set of points of pointed degree, such that the motivated colours loop of the fiber is a dimension strictly smaller than the one at the general fiber. So this uh mode, so the G mode is a motivated uh in the sense of Andrew to have an any conditional uh theory that I can group attached to this uh attached to this this fiber and roughly it includes the smallest this group is the most the largest is the group of motivated algebraic cycles and all the tensor power of your file. So a special case of this instance uh is that you have the non-zero you should have the non-zero skid density of the uh what is called the neuron gem. What is called the neural jump neuron jumping locus. So namely should have non-zero skill density of the neurons etc. So the set of points of 20 degree where the round of the neurons of the group and the fiber is strictly strictly larger than the round of the neurons of a group of the generalization. So this corresponds to uh algebraic uh two devices. Okay, so this uh kind of uh application only uses the first part of the serum, so we don't need the uniform boundedness part. An example using the uniform boundedness part of the two parts. So uh so it should be So it should imply, for instance, the uniform bondedness of the prevalence of the T primal introspection. So if my I take for this proper morphism an avenue schema, I can survive all available varieties and I can And we can talk about the torsion, the rational torsion of the fiber. And the expectation is that if you look at the PC loo of the torsion of the fibers, this should be unit only bound. So by bond elevation, this is a finite group, but Another application is that still in the setting of Abenana IIT, would be the answer. Would be the non-disc density of the locus of the BNIT jump sorry of the rank drop. And uh actually as this uh as this is relying on the We should need something stronger than geometrically some simplicity, which is like geometric perfectness, so we should replace this work. The assumption that this is something simple, by the assumption that this is perfect, but for this, I know it is. Reasonable to expect. I have no counterexample, but and I will mention one case where we can prove the conjecture is perfect in spite of this. Okay, so these are just some applications to motivate this conjecture. So in particular, there are lots of several kind of conjectures about the uniform. About the uniform boundedness of certain invariants. So, here I mentioned the uniform boundedness of the p-primary torsion tabelian dietis. And there is even a stronger conjecture predicting the uniform roundedness of the whole torsion group of abelian dietis. So which I think is completely unrealistic, but this one is perhaps a more realistic. And uh yes, another kind of invariant we can also bound our This is also a consequence of this conjecture. So, but if you have a conjecture, a uniform or LNS conjecture of this type, maybe behind there is this conjecture. Okay. So now So now I would like to explain how this conjecture actually is closely related to a very classical and open conjecture in the fantasy geometry, which is a Bomb diaryland conjecture. So I would like to explain how this conjecture is related to the Bomb diary conjecture by another conjecture, which I mean called the main geometric conjecture, which is perhaps more accessible, and this is where the what I Whereas what I have called to Anabiniana approach the piano. Yet before this, I should mention, so I mentioned the toy example of Fuchimois Laietier. I should mention that Fuchimois Laietier. So the main conjecture for D is one. So the first part was already formulated by Limo and actually a strong variant of so removed formulated the following conjecture, saying that there exist time in many Type in many strict special sobrieties. So that's a set of points in the regional C locus. Actually, this is the same as the projectual I formatting, but you lose a mantel project because you know from Because inbo formulation is special sub-diets of chimois. For those who know special sub-dieties, the setting of chemo varieties are defined by the singular logarithm. So to relate it to the PRD system and the non-portate construction. But this is basically the only occurrence of the main conjecture in the actual form. Okay, so now I would like to explain why the main conjecture should follow from the Mobile Elon conjecture. So for this one, we double a main geometric conjecture. Okay, so for this, so first perhaps I recall the statement of the only conjecture. This is a very simple projector to formulate and a very difficult one to prove. I think it's about formulation. So as and it tells that if as x is of general type, so v So V is a variety of general type over K. Then the set of K-rational functions might be the SQN answer. And there are the two known cases which try some. Mr. Isandi and Unutufightins. And basically, the conjecture is only known for sub-dieties of genal type of vena dietis. In particular, and this is true talkers, it's embedded into search records. Embedded in which I've got audience. And this is the model conjecture. And so, for example, just I'm perhaps not going to recall what is the definition of being optional type, but it basically means that the canonical bundle is big. But for curve, being optional type is the same as being a Curve being of genealogy is the same as being of gender such as now I'm going to formulate this main geometric conjecture. So for this I need to explain a bit a strategy to tackle the main conjecture. I'm going to do this and so I'm going to just to I'm going to just go to general and keys so records that so surprise a Is my image of the representation? So, this is a compact theatrical group. So, inside it, for the moment, I'm going to fix fundamental system.1. So, typically, the first thing is that the current So typically, in practice, type the kernel of the reduction you P to the L map. So pi is a subgroup of GLR of Pn. Just take the panel and solution. So I mean so in particular I want the pi end to be full normal in pine and so intersection and open and the intersection. The intersection. Okay, and for an open source group of pi, so pi is the image of notation. So if u is any open subgroup of pi, I can attach to it the connectivity data cover S. Which corresponds to the inverse image of Muin Pi 1. This is an open single group. So here I'm just using the equivalence between open subgroup at the etal pi 1 and the etal cover for the base schema. And I want to read so this has uh we have this the following properties. We have the following properties. So this just follows from the fact that from the definition of the etal pi 1. So first I define the so this XU is geometrically connected over KU and KU is the the field corresponding to the if you want a group theoretic description of this is just this is Description of this is just this is the Garrett loop of Ku is the image of the image. So you take the pi 1 of X U and use the Pi 1 of X, actually this is an open subgroup, and take the image with the structural map Pi 1 of K and so the image of this is an open subgroup of Pi 1 of K and this is defined to the field of definition Ku of X U1. So if you take the geometric fiber of this or Ku1 This corresponds to the etal cover, so it's an etal cover of connected etal cover of x over k bar. This corresponds to the intersection of u with the image of the geometry pi 1. And the third property That each time that you have a morphism from y to x, so we would like to know when the image of the pi 1 of y is contained in your open checkbook u1. And so this is the case, if I'm in the midfield, this is To the exact cover is okay. So, in some sense, understanding whether the image of PyONFY is containing you should be detected by this property, and this is what we are going to explore. So, the main, now I can basically explain the main geometric conjecture. So, I assume I'm going to assume a case. So here I'm going to assume k is algebraically closed. I switched from number field to its algebraic closure. And so F is still geometrically curved, semi-simple, so I can use geometrically this, because I'm already obviously algebraic measure of K. Then the conjecture is that each time that you take a closed group of phi of co-dimension one, so not open. One, so not open. Then the expectation is that the connected data cover attached to the open subgroup generated by H on the end stem of your fundamental system of neighborhood and dominates a variety of general type or end dialogue. Again, this is quite so simple to state. And so the relation with the main conjecture, so to explain it So for this I'm going to attach to my um chair step a copy of the channel. A level scheme, which are really the generalization of the Schimoire variant view, that's a tower of level structure. So for this, actually for this construction I'm going to make, you have some flexibility, so I'm already going to leave the construction which really gives you the main conjecture as I formulated it. But if you want, you could a priori awaken the main conjecture by modifying. By modifying slightly the construction I'm going to give. So for this, identifying first the set, a finite set of open subgroup of pi for each integer n. So here it's going to be the set of open subgroup of pi with a property which is a bit technical and I'm not going to explain why that's a segmentary, it's just a small exercise. So the condition is that n minus one tenth of Is that the n minus one tenth of the fundamental stem is not contained in neurons, but that the stratum subgroup is easy. And the setting is the nebulous subgroup of by n minus one, because um my this is uh a property typically uh the fact that the fatin subgroup which is the intersection of the maximal open subgroup. Of the maximal open source group is again open, for instance, the property of a compact k digital group. So here, for instance, it is important that we have. And so this defines this. So these sets are finite because they all contain a fixed open subgroup of the topological and also propaletic reboot are topologically finite relative. And you have a natural projective system structure on those finite side, which is just given by sanding you. Which is just given by sending UMA, the symbol generated by the following properties. So first, each time that you have a close subgroup on pi, if uh it does not contain the n minus one term of law. F minus one term of your system, then there exists an open subgroup in this set HN. The jet H is contained to this first property, and the second is one each time that you have a projective system of a consumer group here. Um and if you take the projective limit, which is just the intersection of the H channel then for then this is a cross-group of H of code dimension sorry Of codi mention at least one, so it is not open. And furthermore, you can recover actually Hm from this projective limit in the sense that it is generated by the projective limit and pi n for n margins. So these these are the the properties which make the machinery work. Makes the machinery work. And so with this definition, I can define the level scheme as being simply the union of the X2 value in HNX. So as this satisfaction, this is simply an unconnected metal cover. It I'll cover all today, so and uh so channel called the lever schema schemes F and because I have a projective system structure of the on the H and B, so these are primarily uh Commerily as a projective system structure. For example, a typical example also Tor of Shimodayankas, for instance. But you could take also any Tor of Shimuaya instance. And so this is a property that the exceptional locals, for instance, So XF with so this with this definition of the level scheme. So here you could, as I said, you have some flexibility, you could modify, you could define slightly differently the HMP and you would get some slightly different tower which may encode some different property. But with this definition, maybe the exceptional locus is exactly the image of the projective system of co-rational. Uh system of current rational points, so I should say that right doesn't exist, more concrete. So, if for instance I'm interested in the set of current points on the exceptional logus, then this is exactly the image of the set of current points on my tower. And uh, Motion already, I would say. So this y you have to d do a little argument with the but this is the property I have listed, uh The property I have listed. I'm not going to make the argument, but this is an exercise. And more generally, the small lemma is that is equivalent just because of this property to the fact that the so the image So the image or if you want it for every D, but I see that. And the main conjecture 2 for 1 plus 2 is equivalent to saying that it's in the set of curves. Yes, and the set of correlational points uh on the level N, uh if you are inserting the strong form, the set of points of bonny delivery on the level N are not isolates for my large math. So, uh, already here you see there is a difference between part one and part two of the conjecture. Within part one and part two of the conjecture. So, possibly part one is more accessible because asking this is appearing much worker than asking this. And you also see immediately the connection with the Gobi-Eilan conjecture from this lemma in particular. So the main conjecture Conjecture to metrometric conjecture first of all conjecture. So, Bonier Non-conjecture for varieties of general type and dimension smaller than the dimension of X. One plus two, and if you want to so if you are only interested in part one of the conjecture, we could replace the Bonbier Elon conjecture by a kind of I don't know, I'd like to call it perhaps a projective variant of the Bonbier-Elon conjecture, which we Of the Bonbierillon conjecture, which would be to study the if I have a projective system of IETs of general type, can we prove that the image of the set of the projective system of correlational points under this schema is not ice schema? And I think this question, so I will call this kind of projectima one day long. I think even I think even independently of the conjecture I have stated, it could be a very diaphantine conjecture, which is certainly more accessible. But seemingly it has not been investigated so far. Okay. So in the remaining time, I would like to mention a few examples. A few examples, the very few case, the majority conjecture we have so far. Maybe say a few words about the proof. So, here you will see the gap between the conjecture and the results. So, the non-case, and so when the dimension of x is 1, we have the crossing. So, this is where the chant work is available. So, actually, what we can prove, so yes, I have justified why the I have related I have uh I have explained why the the main uh conjecture should follow modulus the Rubier Elon conjecture from the main geometric conjecture, but it's The main geometric conjecture, but this is just so you have corrected me. So, this is only true for this one because the Columbia Island conjecture is for color of Shannon points, not for points of bony degree. So, the reason why I have formulated the conjecture for points of bonnet degree is that for dimension one we have it. Um the reason is that this is a purely spe seemingly specific to curve, uh because um we have an an invite so We have an invite, so for curve being of general type means being of genus larger than 2, and in that case, the Bombay Eyeland conjecture is one. This is a model conjecture. But for curve, we have another invariant, which is called the unidentity. It's a consequence of the Bombayland conjecture for sub-varieties of abelian varieties, that if the gonality is larger than The gonad is larger than 2t plus 1, I think, then the set of points upon each degree on the curve is also finite. And so what we can prove actually is that Amagawa is a strong form of the main geometric objection, namely that the good identity of the so this is the the key bar. So this is the the K bar unity of x h by n goes to infinity. And so this implies the main conjecture of n so this is original. So this is Louis Julot and the brandy set. And the observation that the set of points of pointed degree is finite if the guidality is large enough with respect to the degrees and attitude. Okay, and so. So, for higher-dimensional IT, as usual, it's more difficult than current. So, just a remark that for the when you are interesting, the When you are interesting the non-direct density of rational points, you can freely replace your base value by the unopened sub variety. And in particular, you may you could assume I don't know if this makes ma makes things simpler or not, but Simpler or not, but you may assume X is. So I think this is a terminology, I don't know, introduced by Jacob and Alexander Schmidt and strongly eparmonic and artinening odder namely that uh you have a vibration into uh here one in curve or Into here in terms of so x is the last term of the finite, so t is the dimension of x. And each step is a tibration to impiability curve. So impiability curve means just either the genus are generous and tumor or genus 1 is minus 1 point or genus 3 minus. point or minus three minus three points or actually pressure so et al pi one is not available and strongly parabolic means that x embeds additionally into a product of parabolic curves and uh Jacob and uh Alexander Schmidt showed that uh these uh uh uh are essentially uh um an elegant in the sense that it can be reconstructed In the sense that they can be reconstructed from their homotopy type. So perhaps reducing to this case may make the situation more tractable because the level schemes themselves are uniquely determined, as I have explained in the construction, by the the geometry of the base scheme and the data of the representation. And this is uh also I should say the the reason for the title of my talk on Adabillian. Title of my talk on an Abelian approach. Anyway, so the only case that can be treated for the moment in full generality is the simplest example of such a neighborhood, namely the product of two apertures. So in case So in that case, the main geometric conjecture we know a little more than what I have the main geometric conjecture as I have formulated it, which is interesting for application and may suggest also that. And I may suggest also that perhaps we can be very optimistic and propose a strengthening of the lane geometry conjecture. So, what we have is a straight min so I write so C I L and so this is uh this uh chance class uh chant number. Channel number of my developer by TR. So here this is a statement, the geometre 16, so I have put back everything to the geometry closure of care. And there is a decoder mere. So either so for to explain the decoder B, so I have my so H I report is a plus circle of quote. Process of two dimensional one and two things can happen. So I note by pi i the image. So you have an algebraic process in character density zero. So to pi one of x, so here I assume x k r is just a product to the pi one of the Of the two curves, what is pi one of pi is just the image of pi one of x, but it has petroleum and beam by putting one on the other coordinate. So this maps to pi just by the product map, and so here I have h. So you can look at the inverse image of h in the product, and then you can project by iron. This is a new white ion. And so two things can happen. So either for one or for two, for either i is one or two. The co-dimension of this is this is a really close subgroup, so this is a somewhat UC case because it reduces to the case of curve. So in that case you can show that You can show that your projective system of the level schema can be put into a projective system of this form and the at the bottom I have a soccer with the navigation. So curves uh lose the negative infinity is n okay so in particular the genus so I should say that if the is large enough, the genus is large enough too, so in particular this becomes large enough, and even the points of point in degree here uh are finite. So and uh the proof of the of this basically reduced to the case of current difficulties, so the interesting case is uh So the interesting case is the other one. Otherwise, the assertion is that the X HM certain are type are large enough, and furthermore More precisely, I should say, but this is the point. We can show that somewhat the square of the first channel place dominates number dominates the second one. I mean, this goes to infinity. Uh yes uh so in particular this uh assertion uh means uh implied so as I've uh said that uh xhi n is a general type uh for this actually you only need to know that you have this uh equality here inequality here and this also for any surfaces so that only those Surfaces, so that only is what's happening here, and that contains only finitely many curves of bonding genus for energy enough, so here so and of course the energy enough depends on the GM. And so, this is actually a consequence of the basic theorem of overgrass and So, the third hypo number of which is an old surrender, and this is, I think, the only case of what is called the geometric non-conjecture. It says that if F is a variety of in R type on the surface with uh with C1 square minus C2 positive, then contains only finitely many curves and smaller than one. And for every gene the set of curve of body genus G is Curve of bounded genus G is the set of curves of genus variance and G is a bounded number and roughly this means that it comes fancy many family things. So you have to work a bit for genes 011 so assertion directly follow from Bologna's theorem and for to get Bogular theorem and for to get to get the finiteness for arbitrary shield you have to work at so I'm not going to say a lot about the proof because I just have four minutes left but the game so the so the statement for the for Perzon so it's perhaps easier to explain Easier to explain because we are interested in understanding. So, I'm not going to talk about the bonalities, of course, this is really technical. But if you are just interesting in, so what you want to show is that the genus of this goes to infinity. And the genus of this, you can compute it from the genus of this, by the Riemann-Harbitz formula. And the Riemann-Harbitz formula, what appears as basically the What appears as basically the order of the ramification groups, and those ramification groups which appear and discover are actually the reduction modulo N or Pn of some subgroup Pi containing GLR subgroup Pi containing pi containing GLR CPN. So you look at your retention. And very roughly, what you have to understand is how some things like this are rather it should be in the end it's the kind of thing you have to understand are cardinal. you have to understand cardinality of sets of these things and the way to prove that the genus of the subject goes to infinity is in two steps. So first it is quite easy to show that the genus of the IC closure, the Galois closure of this cover goes to infinity and this essentially follows from the assumption that the The assertion the the assumption that the the image of of par is uh not um extremely simple. And actually we only need to know that it is perfect in this case. Yes, I should have mentioned that the serum for curves is just for imperfectness. And so and this roughly, if you have general zero or one, this should force for every n at the level at the Gervas closure, this should force pi Pi to be a b n, hopefully. And so this tells you that you have a genus larger than 2 for n large enough, and then just by the fact that h is a closed subgroup, you know that degree goes to infinity, and so the genus, just by the manomits, has to go to infinity because this is gallos. And then you have to compare the genus of this and the genus of this, and for this you have to. This and the genus of this, and for this, you have to estimate this closely related to the estimation of this, and this kind of thing to estimate the asymptotically the cardinality, and somewhat you want to compare it with the reduction modulo n delta. And for this, for instance, the key ingredient is some asymptotic bound for this kind of homogeneous space or compacticly group and the cardinality. Typically group and the cardinality of this in the end boils down to some result of Ser and Dust earlier about counting the number of points of this kind of objects. And what is very so this very roughly the story for curves and for the product of two curves in the difficult case, the one which does not reduce to the case of curves by some By some agro-theoretic reduction, you can reduce to the case where the HN H appear are of the form X1 modeled by a diagonal subgroup acting diagonally and these are called the product patron surface. And it's a very specific situation. For those kinds of surfaces, we can somewhat control the churn numbers of the minimal decimularization in terms of the inertial group. So this is a cover of x1 times x21. And so of the it is dominated by y1 times y2m. Y one, Y two and we can understand the channel numbers in terms of the way the an inertial group of this uh cover and the a conjugate of an inertial group of this cover intersects. So it's much more technical than the case of squirrels, but in the end this both stands to the same kind of argument. Okay, and I can just stop here because Questions? A couple points you assumed the ground field algebraic would close. Sorry? You wrote k equals k bar a couple of times. Yeah. So at the very beginning you said k is a number field. Yes. So it's just two bars? So this is for the geometric conjecture. So somewhat the Bombier Elon conjecture relates the geometric invariant. The geometric invariant, the Codera dimensions, the fact of being of general type, this is an invariant of the X put back to K R. This is so, yes. Any questions? Thank you, speaker again. Let's thank the speaker again. Thank you. Okay, we go to lunch and then the tour. And then tour is a call. And a reminder, if you're giving a lightning talk, I'm talking right now. Just for five minutes.
