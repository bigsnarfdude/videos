So, thank you, Mateo. First of all, I wish to thank all the organizers for this kind invitation. I'm really happy of being here. Well, even if we are not in Mexico after all. Furthermore, before starting with my talk, I wish to apologize since you will not see what at least not at first glance at the fusion in my talk. Diffusion in my talk, which is the main topic of this workshop. But I can say that diffusion can be seen in some sense in the theoretical result I will present you for some higher order elliptic operator arising in the province that I'm going to present you. Now, more precisely, the results I will present you are merely container. Present you are mainly contained in these two joint papers with Alessio Falocchi. And I can say that our interest for partially hinged rectangular plates is related to their possible role in mathematical models for bridges, as it was highlighted in this paper by Alberto Ferreira and Filippo Gazzolov a couple of years ago. Indeed, one can see the deck of a bridge simply as a thin, long, rectangular plate omiga. Thin long rectangular plate omega hinged at the short edges. Well, this clearly reflects the fact that usually the deck of a bridge is supported by the ground at the short edges. Now, within my talk, simply by rescaling arguments, I will always assume that the length of the long edges of the plate is phi, while I will denote with two small l the length of the short edges. Now, from the classical theory of elasticity, it is well known that the bending energy of the plate rise. Energy of the plate rights as in this formula, where U represents the vertical deflection of the plate, sigma is the so-called pressure ratio, which depends on the material by which the plate is made of, and F represents externally. Now, since we want to model a partially hinged plate, it is convenient to introduce this functional space that I will denote with H2 star, which is simply the space of functions that belong to the sovereign space H2 and that vanish on the short term. H2 and that vanish on the short edges. Now, this is in particular a Eber space when endowed with this scalar product. And if we consider the unique minimizer of the energy over this space, we obtain this weak equation that in strong form becomes this boundary value problem, where the equation is clearly the Blake equation. And here you can see explicitly what we mean by partially hinged boundary conditions. Indeed, we have an Avier or hinged boundary condition. We have Navier or inched boundary condition on the short edges, while the boundary condition on the long edges are, I can say, less standard. They involve the third derivatives and also the poster ratio symbol. Now, since we are interested in studying the dynamic behavior of the plate, a central role is played by the oscillating modes of the plate, namely by the eigenfunctions of the biharmonic operator under partially hinged boundary conditions. Boundary conditions. Now, this eigenfunction has been explicitly computed in this paper by Ferrer and Gazolai previously recalled. But what is interesting to notice to the purposes of my talk is that these oscillating modes can be divided into two families, the family of vertical modes and the family of torsional modes. Now, all these oscillating modes have the same analytic expression. You will find You will find, well, you will see a sine of a max times a function depending on y, which is the variable in the direction of the short edges of the plate. But if you consider vertical modes, this function is an even function. For torsional mode, instead it is an odd function. Now, you can have an idea of the different behavior of this oscillating mode just having a look to this figure. You can see on your left. You can see on your left the plot of the first two vertical modes, and on your right the plot of the first two torsional modes. And it is evident that even from these very simple plots, the most dangerous kind of oscillation for the stability of the structure are the torsional ones. Therefore, one in general is interested in trying to control them, or even more in trying to control a possible transition from vertical to torsional oscillating modes. Tortional oscillating modes. Now, this sudden transition is related to the so-called flutter instability, which is a form of dynamic instability that usually occurs when the wind comes up against an obstacle, such as in our case, the deck of the bridge, by producing uncontrolled vortices and in turn by producing this sudden transition between vertical to torsional oscillating. Now, from the classical engineeristic literature, I refer to this. I refer to this book by Rocard. It is known that there exists a critical threshold for the wind velocity that I have named VC at which this form of dynamic instability arises. And it is also known that this critical threshold turns out to be proportional to the difference between the square of the frequencies, namely of the eigenvalues of the oscillating modes involved into the motion. But then in But then, in view of this fact, a possible way to increase the stability of the structure could be that of increasing this critical threshold. And this can be done by increasing the distance between eigenvalues or by increasing the ratio. I just remark, even if it's not the purpose of my talk today, to go back to this result, that in this joint paper with Philippe, Progazal, and Charanzani, of a couple of Pro Gazal and Chiaranzani of a couple of years ago, we have also found a purely mathematical explanation behind this rule. In any case, I simply remark that we have either applicative and mathematical reason to believe that a possible way to increase the stability of the structure could be that of increasing suitable ratios of item values. And from this point of view, it is quite natural to think to, in some sense, to play with the density. In some sense, to play with the density distribution of the plate in order to achieve this goal. And this is basically the reason why we decided to study these weighted eigenvalue problems, where the operator is the biharmonic operator under partially hinged boundary condition I've just introduced, but now we have inserted this weight P into the equation, which models the density distribution of the plate. Indeed, within our analysis, we assume that P belongs to this family of weights. To this family of weights, satisfying some quite natural constraints, well, at least from an applicative point of view, in the sense that we assume that p is always bounded between two positive constants, alpha and beta, which correspond to the two limit values of densities we want to employ in order to build our plate. And furthermore, we assume that the total mass of the plate is preserved. Now, for completeness, well, I must say that indeed there exists really That indeed there exists a really very wide literature related to well dealing with related weighted eigenvalue problems. The eye story goes back to the problems in the one-dimensional case, namely those dealing with non-homogeneous strings and rods. Then there have been many papers dealing with the composite membrane problem, where the operator is the Laplacian under the Richlet boundary condition. And more recently, there have also been papers dealing with the There have also been papers dealing with the composite plate problem, where the operator is the biharmonic operator as in our framework, but it hasn't been mainly studied under the classical Navier or Dirichlet boundary conditions. Now, as you can imagine, one of the main difficulties when passing from the second to the four-order case is represented by the lack of maximum principles that usually occurs, for instance, when dealing with the biharmonic operator. I can say. The biharmonic operator. I can say that in our framework, things are somehow even much more involved since we are dealing with these boundary conditions that have almost not been studied before in literature. But to be honest, I must say that we can take advantage of the very simple geometry of domain we are dealing with, namely we are dealing with rectangular planes. In any case, if we come back to our weighted eigenvalue problems for what I have so far recalled. I have so far recalled. The final goal of our analysis will be that of looking for density functions, maximizing, or at least increasing, suitable ratios of eigenvalues. Now, the choice of the eigenvalues that have to be considered in this ratio usually comes from real structures in the sense that there are low eigenvalues that usually occurs. Now, in order to achieve this goal, let me to look for density function increasing suitable ratios of eigenvalues. Increasing suitable ratios of eigenvalues, so we have followed, well, at least to begin with, a strategy based on combining numerical and theoretical results. Indeed, we first select suitable density distribution by solving certain optimization problems for eigenvalues. Now, rotally speaking, the idea is to look for a density function, first increasing the numerator and then decreasing the denominator. Increasing the denominator. And then we compare numerically the performances of the selected density in increasing suitable ratio of eigenvalues, and in turn, for what I have so far explained, in increasing the overall stability of the structure. Now, in my talk, well, this is today, also for a time reason, I will focus on presenting you some Presenting you some purely theoretical result we got for the simplest of the optimization problems we have studied in this framework. Namely, I will focus on this simple looking minimization problem, the minimum of the first eigenvalue, and for our weighted eigenvalue problem. And I will keep the occasion to present you some theoretical result we got for the associated Elliptic operator. Now we can say that this minimization problem can be considered in some sense one of the most classical optimization problems when dealing with composite membrane and plate problems. Indeed, we can take advantage of well-established tools and arguments already exploited in this field to deal with similar problems. Similar problems. And indeed, by adapting these kinds of arguments to our framework, with some, I should say, non-trivial changes, but with not such great difficulties, we first approved this characterization result for optimal pairs. Where by an optimal pair, we simply mean a couple of density and eigenfunctions, such as the optimal density achieves this mean. Density achieves this mean. And the optimal eigenfunction is an eigenfunction corresponding to the first eigenvalue for this particular density. Now, what we prove is that indeed there exist an optimal pair, such as the optimal density and the optimal eigenfunction, are related by the analytic expression of the optimal density. That turns out to be this stepwise constant function. Now, this stepwise constant function. Now, these stepwise constant functions are, I should say, familiar to people working on these and related topics. They gives, well, this kind of statement gives the useful information, well, at least from an applicative point of view, that optimal plates have to be built only by exploiting two materials, the one at the density alpha and the one in the density beta, which are the two limited values of densities of material we want indeed to employ in order to build our plate. Employ in order to build our fleet. But the weakness of this result is related to the fact that the precise location of these two materials is not really given in the sense that, as you can infer from here, it is given in terms of the characteristic function of, for instance, of this set S, which is given in terms of a suitable sub-level set of the optimal eigenfunction, which in general is not explicitly known. Therefore, if Therefore, if we want to find more precise information about the location of these two materials, a further analysis has to be performed in order to investigate qualitative properties of the optimal eigenfunction, such as sign, simplicity, monotonicity properties. And from this point of view, as I have already remarked, the main obstruction is represented by the lack of maximum principle that usually occurs when dealing with the biharmonic operator. When dealing with the biharmonic operator. And this is the reason why we decided to focus our efforts in studying the validity of the positivity preserving property for the partially hinged plate problem. Now, this property is clearly related to the validity of comparison principles. Indeed, we say that the partially hinged plate problem has the positivity-preserving property if a non-negative load F in On negative load F into the equation leads to a strictly positive solution to the partially hinged break problem. Now, from the theory of higher order elliptic operators, it is well known that usually the validity of the positivity preserving property depends on the geometry of the domain and on the choice of the boundary conditions. So, for instance, if you consider the very same kind of domains Same kind of domains we are dealing with, namely our rectangular plates. It is well known since this paper by Kaufman that, for instance, if you consider the biharmonic operator under Dirichlet boundary conditions, the positivity preserving property does not hold. Indeed, you can see in this figure, for instance, the negativity in this colorid region. While if you consider the same equation, but under Naviaba. Equation, but under Navier boundary condition, the positivity-preserving property holds. And this clearly follows simply by exploiting twice the maximum principle for second-order operators. Now, by means of very simple numerical observation, we saw that a similar situation seems to hold under partially clamped and partially hinged boundary conditions. Indeed, we always saw in our numerical observation negativity. Observation, negativity occurring under partially climbed boundary conditions, while positivity seems to be preserved under partially hinged boundary conditions. Now, in view of this numerical observation, we decided to study further the validity of this property. At the end, we indeed prove that the partial hinged plate problem has the positivity-preserving property. As you can easily infer from this, As you can easily infer from this statement, the proof of this result is achieved by showing that the associated Green function is strictly positive. Now, the proof of this result is achieved by performing suitable estimates below of the Green function that we were able to write down explicitly. Well, I should say that we were able to write down the Green function explicitly in the sense that we were able to write down its Fourier expansion. Write down its full expansion as it is given in this formula here. Now, well, clearly, it's not such an easy matter to study the sign of a function starting from its Fourier expansion, and indeed it was not easy at all. The crucial ingredient in our proof was the proof of the fact that this coefficient phi L mu and red are strictly positive and strictly decreasing with respect to the index of the series. Respect to the index of the series. You can just have an idea of the behavior of this function having a look to this plot. Now, I can say that the proof of these very basic properties for this coefficient is, I should say, the most difficult part of the proof, well, at least from the technical point of view, in the sense that the explicit form of this coefficient, which is given in this page, is really very evolved. Indeed, it takes many months, many change of variables. Many maths, many change of variables, and I should say also some clever ideas to come out from this computation. But at the end, we got these nice properties, and we can start by estimating our grain function. I must say that the proof was not yet done in the sense that many other technical steps were left, but at least the first step of the proof can be very easily explained. We simply split the series in this way, and we saw that the And we saw that the first coefficient is positive. Then we estimate below the tail of the series by exploiting all those nice properties we know of the coefficient. And by means of this elementary calculus inequality, we immediately got the positivity in this red region. Well, unfortunately, at this first step, there were this white region near the short hedges, not covered by the positivity result. In order to fully In order to fully this white region, we have exploited some symmetry properties of the green function, as you can infer from here. And then we have adopted an iterative scheme based on subsequent estimates below in order to prove the positivity to the short edges. This is the most difficult part of the edge. Well, part of the estimates. But the idea behind our estimate is simply that as far as we go near these short edges, we saw that the sum of a larger number of low coefficients was positive. Therefore, we can rearrange all our estimates and at the end we got the positivity. Now, once the positivity has been proved, we immediately obtain some, I should say, interesting. I should say, interesting consequences from it. So, for instance, by exploiting the positivity-preserving property, we prove that the first eigenfunction of our weighted eigenvalue problem is of one sign. This can be proved, for instance, by exploiting the dual cone decomposition technique. And furthermore, we prove that the first eigenvalue is C. Now, once more, these are two very basic properties for the first. Basic properties for the first eigenvalue that are by no means trivial or obvious when dealing with the biomonic operator. Now, if we come back to our minimization problem, we can also exploit the positivity of the first eigenfunction, for instance, to rewrite in this nicer way the set alpha, where we have to locate, for instance, the material at intensity alpha. And furthermore, by exploiting And furthermore, by exploiting the positivity of this function, we have also proved this partial symmetry result for optimal pairs with respect to the midline of the plate, namely with respect to this red line. Now, in few words, what we have proved is that basically two situations may occur. Either the optimal eigenfunction is symmetric with respect to this red line, or it is concentrated. Line or it is concentrated on one of these two half plates. Well, in view of our characterization result, the same kind of symmetry must hold also for the density distribution of the plate. Now, the main ingredient in our proof, which is achieved by combining, I should say, all the new ideas, the old ideas come, but not only from this paper. Well, the main ingredients were. Well, the main ingredients were polarization, which is a two-point rearrangement technique for function that we have exploited only with respect to the midline of our plate. And we have combined polarization with the exploitation of a suitable dual problem, which is written here, which basically gives us a variational characterization, well, an alternative variational characterization of the first eigenvalue in terms of this maximum. Value in terms of this maximization problem. Now, the advantage of the introduction of this dual problem is that in this way we can work with L2 function. And this is quite convenient when exploiting polarization, instead of working with H2 function as it should be if we consider the variational characterization by means of the Rayleigh quotient. And another interesting effect coming from this dual problem. Coming from this dual problem, is that once more a crucial role is played by the grain function of our problem that we have almost explicit in the sense that we have its Fourier expansion. Indeed, the last ingredient in our proof, well, not the last, but another, I should say, fundamental ingredient, was the proof of some reflection properties of the green function we have proved with respect to the midline of the plate. Respect to the midline of the plate. They are listed in this realm, and I can say that in particular the first one is once more very technical to be proved. And the reason is the fact that we do not have the explicit form of the green function, we only have this Fourier expansion, and the coefficient of this expansion are really very important. Now, the technical difficulty we encounter in this, in the proof of this inequality, Well, in my opinion, are the reasons why we were not able to got the whole symmetry for our optimal plates. In the sense that, unfortunately, we were not able to prove this kind of properties when moving the plane. And this does not allow us to complete a suitable variant of the moving plane arguments and finally get our symmetry. Well, the symmetry for our optimal plates. Now, the fact that this is only a technical difficulty is also confirmed by the numerical solution of the problem. We got by exploiting a simple iterative numerical scheme, which is basically given in one line. At each step, we rearrange the density in order to increase the L2 weighted norm at the density. To weighted norm at the denominator of the ray equipped. Then, in this way, we obtain a non-increasing sequence of first again value that converges to the numerical solution of our problem. And as you can infer from this figure, the numerical solution of the problem is indeed symmetric with respect to the midline of the plate, thereby confirming our conjecture. Now, this numerical result will conclude. Well, conclude my talk. Therefore, I thank you very much for your attention. Thank you, Lisa, for your nice talk. I should also thank the participant, those of the participants that are still here. Those who survived. So is there any question? I have one. When you were mentioning this positivity property of the green function, can you go back to that slide? Yes. I don't remember what was the operator, which are the conditions, the boundary conditions. Yes, yes. It's not this one, but okay. So you have the biomonic operator. So, you have the biharmonic operator under this. Well, the first line is standard, I should say, under boundary condition. The second one are much more involved. Okay, so my question is, is there any way to extend this result to higher dimensions? I think it can be possible, but an idea of. An idea of first of all which kind of domain. I think that for some hyper cube or something, something can be done. If I should have to extend, I will probably start from the variational formulation. So see if there is an analog or something. Because in this case, as far as I understand, you said the proof is by hand. The proof is by hand. Yes, another fact that is by no means trivial that we have exploited is that we were able to separate variables, which is not so obvious when passing to the higher, well, to higher order problems. This is related to this hinged boundary condition we have on the short edges. You should ask to Filippo if there is some application. Philippo, if there is some application for higher dimensions. I don't mind about application. I don't think this was just from the mathematical point of view, it would be okay. So, any other question? So, if not, let's thank Elvis and all the speakers.
