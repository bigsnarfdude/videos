So I will talk about discuss our shapes of endomorphism rings for supersing realistic curves. So the idea here is can we just work with endomorphism rings and their shapes and then decide whether what we are looking at is a super singular niche curve or not. Such basic questions. Such basic questions. So, to recall endomorphism ring of supersing reality curves, they look like this: 5p is 3 mod4, then it is minus p minus 1, 5 mod 8 minus p minus 2, and 1 mod 8 minus p minus 2. This is all well studied and implemented in stage. Using this we can create a quaternion algebra and just forget about the elliptic property and forget. About the electric process. For example, for t equal to 191, we actually use magma. To compute all the maximal orders, unique maximal order classes, it has 15 of them. Similarly, we can talk about like the subject cases of trace 0. And these are the basis for Z1 for the one of the maximal order. And we can also talk about the intersection of dual. Talk about the intersection of dual and trace. So, different kinds of lattices we consider: maximal colour, and the lattices inside it. And for what do we need in by shape? It's still not clear, but to start with, we consider the fact that let us say shape is something given by the ground metrics. So, most of our experiments or computations were involved trying to find a pattern in grammatics. Pattern in grammatics. So we did gram metrics for various orders, maximal orders, and that trace zero lattices. And after that, we got interested into whether if a basis of one order is and basis, there are two bases of the same order or something like that. So can there be change of basis metrics between those two orders? Between those two orders, so they are two different orders with their basis, and we have a change of basis metric. How does shape is affected, or how does the gram matrix affected between them? So, we did a change of basis matrix computations for different basis of all the maximal order. And then, like I said. Like I said, so given a so the main question we are trying to answer is given a grammatic or rank 4 of 3 for the letters of rank 4 of 3, what can we say about, can we say it is coming from a maximal order or can we say it is coming even from an order? And if we know it comes from order, we can check discriminant and say it is maximal or not. So that is easy fine. And other questions we talked about was what are the smallest norms. About what are the smallest norm elements in the endomorphism ring. And similarly, in small norm bases, if we can find and the trace zero lattice, similar portions are ground metrics, we computed for different times and tried to look for patterns. And one of the patterns that we observed was one many of times only one column turned up. Time only one column can draw to be rational and all the rest are to be integral. So that is not something we were exploring. Yeah, that's all I have to say what we did in this holy race. Can you repeat the last thing that you said at the end of the questions about some parts being rational and some parts being integer? Yes, I can show you some extension. So we were computing these COVID-19. These series of basis matrices, and at one point we reached a conjecture that only one of the column is going to be a rational number and all others are integers. But we are not too sure about this relation holding because we have to do more experiments. So that is one observation we had from many examples. Thank you. Do you have an idea about that? idea about that first? Yeah we first start that we start from a much more order that we know but that was in 28 or 0 basis. And then we can buy one everything as a bit rational focus or we can strategy. And the number one was each other. Doesn't this depend on your choice of orders? You can conjugate the order. Right, right. So so we we can change the market basis too, but it's it's just good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I changed several times and still have two progressional columns for one example only. Oh, by the way, you only have one problem that's confessional. Do any normalists say anything about it? The denominators in the matrix. The denominators. Ah, denominator. No, we didn't really look at that clearly, but we actually used the denominator in the okay, so again, so we start from the order we know 728. We multiply by amplify an integration about which rational coefficients. About the trash and I have to not make this maximum or it should be somewhere else to be in the code because all the matrix of y inside already form the other and each we have a bit to make it and the denominator of that element of the the product form that we write out to be integral element which you have to choose the entry to make it mean the one another slide. I was going to ask if the motivation for the project was like equidistribution of shapes of the number of fields or something. Is that what you mean by a shape? Like are you hoping for some kind of equidistribution with very quadratic form or like From the first one, we know that to maximal basis of to maximal are both basis of the one in algebra, so it should be the changes only something like one or minus one. So we think that maybe some form one by just acting on this matrix, okay, all others should. So, I mean, isomorphism classes of maximal orders in the Quaternion algebra of discriminant P or bijection with these Turner quadratic forms that you're looking at. Any thoughts on? I know that you've worked on this kind of stuff. Some distribution. I don't know, I guess you have to figure out what matrix group they're coming from, right? Is it like SO? Group they're coming from, right? Is it like SO something or other? Like, you actually have a quadratic form? I don't know. Like I have questions I will answer just quickly. The thing at the bottom, can you tell if a grand matrix is the grand matrix of the maximal order? I mean, you can just compute the ternary quadratic form associated to an. Write a form associated to its trace zero subspace. And if that form has discrete P, then yes, otherwise. Maybe there's something about a level two, but I think it should be level one, discrete P. From the biomarking is discrete. And then... And then. Yeah, because it's a disc, like the Clifford algebra gives you a discriminant preserving bijection. gives you a discriminant preserving bijection between ternary quadratic forms and ternient orders of yeah orders and turning the associated cover delta so the discriminants are the same so your maximal order is discriminant had better be p if it's maximal and so if your turnaround quadratic form is discriminant is p yeah I mean or you can just compute the determinant to get p squared from the biomatrix to the Yeah, I can talk about it. I'm unmuted. Any other questions? So, shall we if it's just
