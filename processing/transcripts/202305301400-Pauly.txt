For many thanks for the invitation here to this wonderful place. It's really great to be here and to learn new things. So my talk will be about very stable bundles. So this is actually not new. I mean, very stable bundles were introduced in the 80s by Rienfeld and we'll give the definition right now. But they But they got somewhat rediscovered recently, a couple of years ago, because they appear to be also interesting in the mirror symmetry and giving brains. And so I will try to describe this towards the end of the talk. Towards the end of the talk. Okay, so the talk is about very stable bundles. Let me precise that I will work on curves. So the original situation for X bundles. So, in order to fix some notation, I will call C the curve, the underlying curve. So this is. The underlying curve. So this curve will be smooth, projective. Okay, it will be work over the complex numbers. Also, I can work over arbitrary fields, any characteristic if you prefer. I will denote by g the genus of this curve of Riemann surface to one for some just. For some just to simplify the situation, I will suppose that the genus of this curve is at least two. Also, we can say something for elliptic curves or projective lines, but this is somewhat special. Okay, so also in order to fix notation, one of the main players in this story is the moduli space, parametrizing vector bundles. So, what is N C and D? C and D, this is just the moduli space whose points parametrize some vector bundles. So these are vector bundles over C and suppose that's the rank of E is N and the degree of E is D. So I have fixed rank and degree. And in order to have And in order to have some protective variety parametrizing such vector buttons, I need to impose some condition which is called sorry. Should I close this? Okay, so I have to impose that my vector bundles are semi-stable or just, I mean, some particular case of semi-stable bundles is stable. And since this hasn't, I mean, since the audience is not only composed of algebraic geometers familiar with modelized spaces, I think it's useful to introduce To introduce, I mean, to recall the definition of semi-stability, so a vector bundle is called semi-stable if, for all sub-vector bundles of this E, the slope of F, which is defined to be the quotient of the degree by the rank of F is less or equal to the slope of E. So we have So we have just an inequality for semi-stability and a strict inequality for stability of bundles. So this is not a big restriction because any vector bundle, there might be non-semi-stable vector bundles, but you easily can reduce, I mean, relate your vector bundle by the Hardana C-man filtration to a collection of semi-stable vector bundles. So this is not a big Vector bundles. So, this is not a big restriction. So, you cannot get all bundles, but still a big family. So, we have we can construct by GIT a projective variety. So, it's a complete variety, it's compact, project variety. And we know its dimension. I'll just give it for sake of complete. Sake of completeness, it's n squared g minus one plus one if genus is at least two. Okay, so this is just some nice projective variety, might be singular. Let me come now to the main property. So, the definition of very stability. So, E is called to be very stable. So, I already defined. So, I already defined stability here. So, very stable is something more. But surprisingly, it will not be defined in terms of slope, inequalities on the slope, but in terms of something completely different. So, this definition is due to Drienfeld. And as I've said, it goes back to the 80s. So, Dreenfeldt defines a very stable bundle to be a bundle, it's very stable. It's very stable if E does not have does not have non-zero indipotent Higgs fields. Now, what is a Higgs field is already introduced this morning. So, it's just a section. Just a section, global section of the endomorphism sheaf of E tensored with K, and I should have said here that K is the canonical bundle with the dual of the tangent sheaf. Okay, so you we see, so and phi, so I should first define my objects. What is phi? Phi is just an OC linear map. An OC linear map from E into E tensor K, so just the global section of this vector bundle. And what means nilpotent? Nilpotent means that, well, I just have to check this to define this properly. I can compose phi with itself, but I just add here phi. So I get phi tensor, some identity on the canonical sheaf. identity on the canonical sheaf so i get phi squared i can iterate this as much as i want and define any power of phi and of course sorry should pick up power line yeah yeah thanks okay so if i take the i'd power of phi i get the map an oc linear map from e into e tensor k to power i and i say that phi is nipotent say that phi is new potent if there exists an i positive such that phi i is completely so the natural definition of nil potent endomorphism and the index of nilpotency is the smallest such Strictly positive. Okay. So the first question one can ask: well, why is this called very stable? Because we don't see any slope inequality here. And the answer is surprisingly easy. Let me give it just now. So how is this connected to stability introduced by Mumford and Narasimhan's shot? Narasimhan's also a long time ago. So, this is one of the first properties. First property is that very stable is in fact also stable. Okay? Sorry, Kerry is well the name very stable. Okay, so very quickly, if by bundle is not stable, I have instead. By bundle is not stable, I have in some sense to give you a nilpotent Higgs field. So, where does this nilpotent Higgs field come from? So, if E is not stable, not semi-stable, it has some sub-vector bundle which has high degree, which destabilizes this. So, let's call this sub-vector bundle F. F is a sub bundle. Sub bundle so we can look at the quotient, which is also a locally free sheaf. And let's tensor this exact sequence by k. So I just copy it and tensor with k. Now, very quickly, what happens if E is not stable? Well, it has some sub particle which has high degree. Which has high degree, so degree of very large. This means that the degree of E over F is small, but then I have a bundle with small degree, and I would like to map it into a bundle with high degree by Riemann Roch. Just having some this low degree and this high degree bundle, the Bundle the bundle of homomorphisms from this one into that one will also have high degree. So by Riemann-Roch, we have at least one section. Okay, so the section, we call it U, and that's our nil potent Higgs field. I just take here the composition. So my Higgs field is just the composition of pi with this. Of pi with this non-zero homomorphism u and I compose it with so this is nilpotent because you can easily check that if you square it it's completely zero image here it's fk will be contained in the kernel of phi okay so this is a nice it's a very easy argument but i'd like to give it just to connect non-existence of Connect non-existence of nilpotence Higgs field with stability. The other property of very stability is also related to this, which is also exploited in some papers. Means that very stable. So if a bundle is very stable, its substantial Stable, its sub-bundles are quite nice. So it means this regular maximal sub-bundles. So let me very quickly state the situation. So I fix my bundle E and I will look. So it has rank N and degree D. rank n and degree d. And I look at all sub-bundles having given topological type, so rank n prime and d prime. Okay, so we know since Gotendig that there is some protective variety called the quad scheme of E which parametrizes such bundles. Okay, so this is the open D Quad scheme, but it's not very nice. But it's not very nice. It's in general, if E is general, it can have many irreducible components, which might be non-reduced, etc. So the only thing which is known is the expected dimension, which is given as the Euler characteristic of homomorphisms from F into the quotient vector. But for general E, it's not clear whether this expected dimension is actually the real dimension. It's just some number coming out of deformation theory. Okay, so for general E, so if no condition is imposed on E, and if, so let me assume that, if this expected dimension, if the expected dimension. If the expected dimension of this quad scheme is zero, and if E is general, then E has a finite number of maximal sub bundles and And now the surprise is that if E is also very stable, then this quad scheme parametrizing sub-bundles is actually smooth, so meaning et al. as a zero-dimensional scheme. As a zero-dimensional scheme. So it has no multiplicity. So, meaning that if E is very general, the set of maximal sub-bundles is as nice as possible. Okay, and again, this is quite an easy consequence of this, because we know that if we take a sub-bundle, the Zariski tangent space to the squad scheme is just The squad scheme is just the homomorphism from this bundle into E tensor F. And again, if E is very stable, let me come back to this these two diagrams. So if E is very stable, we cannot have a homomorphism from this quotient into that one because it would give you a nilpotent Higgs field. So home from E. field so home from e to f into f tensor k is zero but then you see that if this homomorphism if there are no homomorphism from e mod f to f tensor k by cell duality and Riemann Roch and using vanishing of this you immediately see that this space is also zero and this means that your quote scheme is eta okay so let's come back to things which may be more Maybe more close to Higgs bundles. The third property is actually existence. I mean, now we know that very stable bundles form a subset of stable bundles. So actually, we have some points in our moduli space, but we have to make sure that's the That they really exist, so that this subset is non-empty, and it was done in a fundamental paper by Lumo 88. Actually, existence of the mesh table is the consequence of something which is much more important. It's about the Nipoten code. So we know there exists an open subset of this moduli space. This moduli space, this is open corresponding to omega is the set of very stable bundles. So how do we show that? That there exists an open subset of very stable bundles. As I said, this is a consequence of the Hitchin system. Some properties of the Hitchin system, which is really central for us. Very central for us. So let me recall the basic objects. Now I introduce modelized space of Higgs bundles. So Higgs, C and D, what is this? This is an algebraic variety. It will be quasi-projective whose points correspond to pairs E phi. Okay, so E is our vector bundle as before, rank N. rank n degree d and phi will be our Higgs field so it's just the global section of and E and so K and again in order to have some algebraic variety parametrizing such pairs you have to impose some instability condition that they are semi-stable modulus some equivalence and this was already introduced this morning I mean Already introduced this morning. I mean, this morning we had Pauli stable, Pauli stable, but this is more or less the same. Now, let me repeat this: what is, I mean, this morning we saw the Hitchin equation involving the curvature and the bracket between the phi and phi adjoint. Now, let me give you on the algebraic side the condition of thermostability. So, again, we impose the slope inequality. It's exactly the same. Slope inequality, it's exactly the same as before, but we restrict it to phi invariant for any f subset of E, which is phi invariant, meaning that phi of f is mapped to f tensor x. So we see that we have less constraints for a Higgs band. So this means in particular that we can find pairs, Higgs pairs, E phi, which are semi-states. Which are semi-stable, but whose underlying E is not semi-stable. This corresponds to the thing we observed this morning: that one term of this Hitchin equation might not be zero, also if the sum is zero. Okay, so we will see this later in this talk. Okay, so we have a nice quasi, I mean, let me say, so this is a quasi-projective variety, it's not projective. Projective variety, it's not projective, only quasi-projective. And the thing which will be important for us is that the dimension of this Higgs moduli space is twice the dimension of the underlying moduli space, which will be just a consequence of the fact that an open subset of this Higgs moduli space is the cotangent bundle of n. Coming to that. Sorry. Sorry, still don't demand that N be your co-I think I will never ask NT to be cooperative. I mean in that case it will be smooth, but even it's not smooth you can extend the simple form. You have enough material to conclude what we need. Okay, so let's come and introduce the Hitchin map, which was not introduced this morning. So let me do it. Morning, so let me do it in detail. So, the Hitchin map is a map which goes from this modelized space of Higgs bundles and takes E phi to the coefficients of its characteristic polynomials. So, explicitly, this means that we have the coefficients of this characteristic polynomials are Polynomials are global sections of k to power i for i going, so I'm not fixing the determinant, so it's from one to the rank. And the determinants, so are this is h of e phi, this is a vector and its i component is just, I mean, now you have the choice, either you I mean, now you have the choice. Either you take the coefficients of the characteristic polynomials, which is just the trace of the i's exposed power of phi, or you can take the trace of phi i, which are easily easy to compute, but they are equivalent up to some algebraic automorphism of the Hitchin base. You can transform these guys into this one. Okay, so it's completely. To this one. Okay, so it's completely equivalent. So, this is what is called the Hitchin system. And it has many properties. Let me just state this. I mean, this took, of course, the result of work of many people. So, what I want to say. So, this is the Hitchin map. Is the Hitchin map? One of the properties which we will use later in this talk is that it's a proper map, meaning that this is not a proper variety, but the fibers will be proper. So they will be complete varieties. It will also be flat, also a property which is important for us. And I mean, already going back to Hitchin, he Already going back to Hitchin, he described the general fiber of this map. It's an abeyan variety, which can be described as the Picard variety of the spectral curve, and so on. So what will be important for us is, of course, nil potent Higgs fields, and Higgs folks, nil potent Higgs fields are, of course, contained in the nil potent cone. So, what is a need potent cone? It's just Neil proton cone. It's just the fiber over zero of yeah, it's just the fiber of the hitching map over zero. So this is just defined as a sub set of this sub phi is an impotent because the potent is equivalent to having all of its having its coefficients of the characteristic polynomial equal to. Coefficients of the characteristic polynomial equals zero. So this is more than a subset, of course, it's a fiber of an algebraic morphism between algebraic varieties. So it's a sub-scheme, sub-scheme of our moduli space. And contrary to what happens for the general fiber, which is an abelian variety, so it's a reduced, irreducible variety, even smooth. Irreducible variety and smooth. Here it's the most horrible thing you can dream of. It's highly not irreducible. It has many irreducible components. And the irreducible components are not, in general, not reduced. I mean, there's only one which is reduced. So it's something which is, I mean, in terms of algebraic geometry, quite difficult to To describe, I'm coming later back to this problem. Okay, so let me try to show, convince you that very stable bundles exist. So third property which I will need is the symplectic form. So if there exists a symplectic form on On the smooth locus of this modular space of Hicks bundles, and which extends the natural symplectic form on the cotangent bundle. The natural symplectic form on the cotangent bundle of The cotangent bundle of our Higgs moduli space. So this could be explained. So this is a sub, it's an open subset. Sorry, so it's just a subset, it's a dense subset, whereas this, so if I restrict attention to the stable open subset, which is a smooth variety, can look at its cotangent bundle, and this will be. Tangent bundle, and this will be a subset of a dense subset of the Higgs borderline space because the tangent space to the borderline space is the H1 of the endomorphism sheaf. By sad duality, it's, I mean, the dual H1 by side duality is exactly the space of fixed fields. So this means this shows that, and here we have on any cotangent bundle, we have a natural syntactic form, and we can extend it to. And we can extend it to the smooth part of the Higgs buckets. Okay, and then let me now state Le Monde's main result. So, Lehman, in this paper on the nilpotent cone, one of his assertions is that the nilpotent cone, so the fiber over zero of this Hitchin map, is a Lagrangian subfarring. Separate of the Higgs bundles, meaning that all of its irreducible components will have dimension exactly half of the dimension. So this means that any Any irreducible component, let's call it C, of this Nipotent cone. Also take the reduced structure has dimension equal to the dimension, I mean half of the dimension of the modelized space, so it's the dimension of this. The dimension of this model space of vector points. Okay, now in order to proceed, I need some additional assumption which seems natural, but unfortunately we cannot check it for any irreducible component. It's the following assumption. Let's call it a star. Any we suppose that any bundle I was good. A general so I assume that a general Hicks bundle in this irreducible sprint component has underlying a semi-step. Okay, so as I've said, the button. So, as I've said, the bundle, the Higgs bundle, even if it's semi-stable, does not imply that the underlying bundle is semi-stable. So, we ask that a general bundle has that property. But unfortunately, so this is true if for rank two and three, any irreducible component has a property, has property. Property, but if the rank is at least four, we don't know. So we can have irreducible components of the Nippoten component where no having no underlying semi-stable vector boundary. Okay, but anyway, let's assume that this would take such an irreducible component. So take So take C satisfying this. We can look at the forgetful map. The forgetful map, okay, forgetting the Higgs field will give us a rational map into this moduli space. N moduli space are vector bundles. So this is just forgetful. Forget. Forget phi. Okay, so it's a rational map because of this fact that the underlying bundle is not necessarily semi-stick. So let's concentrate on this irreducible component and let's look at the restriction of this forgetful map, which I call pi. Okay, so of course I get the subset in this model. In this modelized space, I close it up, I get the closed subset of C, and what we can say is that the dimension of this sub-variety will be strictly less than the dimension of the moduli space, because the fibers here will be at least one dimension. Why? Because if I take a Higgs bundle E phi, I can. A Higgs bundle E phi, I can always multiply the Higgs field by some complex number T, and I get another nil potent Higgs field. Okay, so this is also in C, and they are also in the same fiber. So the fibers of pi have dimension at least one. So if I project something. So, if I project something which has dimension exactly equal to the model space, the dimension gets one lower, and I end up with something which is contained in a divisor. Okay, and it is now clear that if I take the union of all these images of the irreducible components. and c is one connected component and yeah yeah yeah but i want some new non-zero new proton so this is not a good point i take yeah of course you are right c different from nc we take a component yeah i take so there is one Yeah, I take. So there is one distinguished component of the need potent cone, which is, of course, the modelized space with the zero hits field. I do not take that one. I take any other irreducible converts. Of course, it's not true for the modelized space. Of course, you are right. Okay, but then we say, let's look now at Yeah, let's take off now the union of all irreducible components. Then, what is this? This is exactly the locus of non-semi-stable. It's almost by definition, non-very stable bundles. Okay, because a non-very stable bundle is precisely a bundle, semi-stable bundle having a new protein. Semi-stable bundle having a nil potent text field. So it comes from something which lies in the nil potent code. Okay, so these are non-very stable bundles. And since this closed sub-varieties have dimensions strictly less than the dimensional, this will have with this will be a closed subset, closed strict subset. Of the modular space. Okay, so, and I will denote it by the letter W because Donaghi and Pantev call non-very stable bundles, they also call them, Wobbly bundles. So it's just a new name for this non-very stable bundle. So to summarize what I did. So, to summarize what I did, there exists a closed subset in our modular space parametrizing mobile bundles, non-semi-stable bundles. So, meaning. So, meaning that the complement is an open subset, which is, of course, not empty. Okay, so let's come, let me give now one, maybe some motivations for this. So, why is it interesting to look at this? Well, the first motivation was related to something very natural, which you do when you are in front of. When you are in front of a rational map, which is not a morphism, you try to resolve it into a morphism. So, for example, look at this rational forgetful map. You forget the Higgs field. So, you can ask, can I resolve it into a morphism? First thing you do is you look at the indeterminacy locus. So, you look at the subset of unstable. Not semi-stable locus, so it's a set of semi-stable Higgs models such that E is not semi-stable. Okay, so what you have to do is you blow up this unstable locus, but you blow up this unstable locus inside the Higgs moduli space. You get some new variety, and you repeat the operation if your new map here is still not amorphous. Is still not amorphous. So you blow up successive unstable loci. And the theorem, I mean, now it's a theorem, it was a conjecture by Bonaghi and Antev, now it's a theorem by Anna Peon, says that the image of the exceptional divisor is precisely this mobile locus inside this multi-space. locus inside this model space. This also called quite quite nicely the shaky locus. And it was conjectured that shaky bundles are wobbly bundles. Okay. Oh, that's true. Okay, so this still gives another description of wobbly bundles. And one conjecture which I find very nice is a conjecture, sorry, it's still a conjecture. So it's still a conjecture, which is attributed to Drindfeld, maybe not correctly, but Le Monde in his paper on the Nilpoten cone says that Drienfeld showed that, I mean, let me first state the conjecture. This conjecture says that this closed subset is pure. Pure of co-dimension one. So, what does it mean pure of co-dimension one? All irreducible components, all of its irreducible components have co-dimension one. So, they are divisors. Okay, so this gives you a nice divisor in this model space, and for me, Devisors in this model space. And for me, this is interesting because once you have a natural device, I mean, these are kind of natural, it's just a subset of stable bundles having nilpotent cones and nilpotent Higgs fields. So this gives you a natural divisor inside the modelized space. And you want to explore the geometry of modelized spaces. It's very nice if you have some canonically defined objects because you can look at the linear system. Complex because you can look at the linear system associated by this, and you embed your modelized modelized space in projective space, and you have some nice geometry related to this W. Okay, so that's a conjecture. So, what is known about this? So, known results. Not much, but I mean, okay. Okay, maybe before I should give some other properties of wobbly bundles, I forgot to do that. To that other properties. This is also a result with Anapéon. Let's restrict attention to semi-sue stable bundles. Okay, so in this case, the tangent space At E to the modelized space is exactly, and cotangent space is exactly the space of Higgs bundles on E. Okay, and this is of course, this is a vector space. This is contained, of course, in the Higgs model space. Okay, so we have a natural, it's just the cotangent space. The cotangent space at this point E, and then we can give a characterization of very stability in terms of a topological property of the subspace in here. So we say that E is very stable if and only if this vector space, I mean the space of all Higgs. Of all Higgs fields is a closed subset of the Higgs model space. It's closed in this Higgs model space. Or in other words, you take the closure, you get nothing new. So you stay with the E. So this is, of course, a nice characterization of very stable bundles. And I would like to convince you that it's true. Like to convince you that it's true. I mean, I'm not giving the full proof, but I will write, let's see, the negative part. So if E is, this means that if E is wobbly, so not very stable, inside you can find limits in this space of Higgs bundles, which are outside V of E. V of E. Okay, and this again is nicely related to Nielpotent Higgs fields. So they give us a new method of creating limit points outside this. So this will be strongly related to limits of the C star action on the neat protein cone. So let me give you an elementary way of looking at this. Okay, let me give you a sketch. Okay, let me give you a sketch of this sketch of this. Let me take a wobbly bundle, so not very stable, so a bundle having nilpotent Higgs field, and let me try to show that this will have a limit. You can find a family of Higgs panels having a limit outside V of E. So suppose that That E of phi is wobbly. So it's meaning that phi is nilpotent. And for simplicity, I suppose that the rank is two, just to make the argument easier. So what does it mean? If you have a nilpotent rank two vector bundle, you can, an easy exercise, you can show that This is exactly the same thing which appeared in the first part of my talk. For rank two, any Nikrotent Higgs field is actually of the form which is on the blackboard. So you can find, you can write E as an extension of M by L. Now L and M are two line bundles, and your Higgs field is of this form, okay? So your Higgs field. Okay, so your Higgs field can be written as projection followed by some map from L in M into L K, followed by I. Okay, now let me give you an what will we compute? We will compute now this limit. Take E phi by nil potent and I multiply my phi by I multiply my phi by this complex number t and I map t to infinity. What comes out? Well, first of all, this exists as a limit because my map is proper, because this means that the nil potent cone is a complete sub-variety of the Higgs band. So if I take any limit parametrized by p1, map t to infinity, I can close, I mean, any. Infinity, I can close, I mean, any family can be closed up by P1. So this limit exists by properness of HMAP. So it exists, and I want to compute it. How to compute, this is more or less what we do. I mean, this and this is one important fact underlying the proof: the following. So we do the following. I take. The following. I take epsilon, an extension class of m by l. So epsilon varies in this vector space, and it parametrizes all extension of m by l and u is also varying in the moduli space, so it in a vector space, parametrizing maps from m into l Okay, so we have a natural map from this direct sum. So we have this vector space, and we map it to the Higgs bundle, E, the nil potent Higgs bundle, E epsilon, and this phi. Phi is just this. So this is mapped into V of E. Okay. Now, what happens? Okay. Uh okay, so what we observe, let me call this into a Higgs C and D, call this capital phi. So what do we observe? We observe that if we multiply both the extension class and the homomorphism by T, this will give us the same Higgs field because if Because if we multiply the extension class by t, this is equivalent to multiplying pi by t inverse. So if you multiply here by t inverse and u by t, the composition will remain constant. So this explains this equality. So we get a map from the projectivization of this space here. Or maybe I need this. Or maybe I need this. So, what does that mean? That I want to compute now the map when t goes to infinity. But by this property here, this is the same point as multiplying the extension class by t inverse. So, if t goes to infinity, t inverse goes to zero. So, my extension class will go to zero. So, this means that this x bundle will X bundle will be the map from M into L K, but the extension class will be zero, so E will be the direct sum of this. So this means that we have, at the limit, we have L plus M with this but this near protein. And of course, this does not belong to V of E because the underlying bundle is now E epsilon. I should have said that I assume E is I assume E is stable. It's a non-split extension. Okay. Let me come now to the known results. As I said, this will be a short list of results, so I still have time. Known results. Well, apart from two and three, I mean, rank two and rank three, I can. In rank three, I cannot say so much about the story. Also, I'm not really optimistic about proving this conjecture, but let me give you some results. For n equals 2, this was already worked out by many people, starting from Hitchin, Rienfeld, Sadius, and Palt. The result is the following. So let's call delta. So let's call delta the degree of what I have used before the homomorphism from L M into L K. So this will be an integer and we can completely describe the range where delta varies. So delta varies from 0 to 2g minus 2. So this inequality Minus two, so this inequality comes from stability conditions, and we also assume that delta is congruent to d modulo two, and this holds if our first result, I mean this was known a long time ago. I mean, this is completely known if delta satisfies. This condition, the new potential cone, so delta, sorry, the new potent cone is the union of C delta and delta varies between zero and two g minus two, and delta is satisfies this. Satisfies this. And the Wobbly locus is just the image of C delta for the same interval, but I just take delta bigger than let's say G. Okay, it's the same property. So what do we see? We see that the new potent cone has, roughly speaking, G or G minus one irreducible components. Irreducible components. Only half of them, you see, we just stop here and G. Only half of them will give you irreducible components of the mobile divisors. So actually this, we can check that these are actually divisors. So Jeanfeld conjectures is okay. These are now divisors in this modular space. Okay. And let me also say that while the other divisors, I mean, if delta is strictly bigger than G, something unexpected happens, we have irreducible components of the neat potential, which do not give. which do not give, I mean, which gets contracted. The fibers have dimension strictly bigger than dimension strictly bigger than one because of what? Some elementary reason. By Riemann Roch, delta is the degree of this line bundle. By Riemann Roch, this line bundle will have at least the dimension of this. M and K will be strictly less, bigger than one, explaining. Bigger than one, explaining why the dimension of the forgetful map have a dimension at least two. Okay, but C of delta, if this happens, if delta is bigger than G, they will be contained in the last one. So C, last one or the first one depends on G. Okay, so what do we expect? I mean, we started the project to carry out all this. To carry out all this for n equals three, but then we run into some difficulties. So we need to know, of course, we need a good description of the irreducible components of the new potent colour. And then, of course, something unknown, something is unknown, but the story is not complete because. Because so we have this Biernitsky Birula stratification of the Nipotent cone. Okay, and this says the following. The irreducible components of the Nipotent cone are in one-to-one correspondence with the irreducible components. The irreducible components of the fixed point set, and this is just so, what is a fixed point set fixed point set of the C star action on the nil potent cone. This is, I mean, this was already carried out by Simpson. This is what is called a Hodge bundle or variation of Hodge structure. These are just bundles. Are just bundles which are direct sum of vector bundles, so that's the underlying vector bundle. And the Higgs field is sometimes they are called also chains, are just maps from one factor into the previous one. So this means that the Higgs field can be given by a matrix in this basis. basis given by so diagonal zero and upper diagonal u k u12 uk where ui is an o c linear map from ei into the previous one so this is also called chains so you can look at moduli of chains and only recently by so we're saying that some of the the ranks Some of the ranks of those form partition dependents exactly exactly. Okay, so this is just as a set, and so of course, this is not irreducible. This is not irreducible, but the irreducible components, irreducible components, this is a result by Christian and Bosek. The irreducible components are classified are classified by Are classified by what is called a type. So it's a sequence of ranks R0 to Rk. Ri is a rank of EI and D0 as to DK are the degrees of this. So for each type, there exists a mode here, usable common. Types exist as mode irreducible common, but it's not clear whether this really exists. Okay, so let me write down this for n equals three. So for n equals three, okay, let me, yeah. So the fixed point set of the C star action on the neoprotein cone. Potential cone. So I decompose it by type. So it's we have F3 components and F21, yeah, F12 and F11. So what I, the subscript here are just the ranks. Okay, so meaning that this here, so this is just, I mean, this is just the moduli space of Brank's rebundle with. Of Brank's three bundle with the zero Higgs field. Okay, and the components of the new potent cone is now what is called the downward flow. I don't have time to explain this. Just give the definition. Okay, so here we have this is F minus is what is called the downward flow. The downward flow of the fixed point locus F. So, what is this? This is a set of bundles F, no, E phi in the new potent cone such that the limit of E T phi when T goes to infinity is exactly belongs to F. So, remember my computer. So remember my computation for rank two for one special bundle when t goes to infinity. So these are all bundles which go when t goes to infinity are mapped to this F. Okay. And the Biernitsky Birula certification says that the nil, well, says, among other things, that the nil potent cone can be decomposed as downward flows to this fixed point flows. So we have a reasonably good description. So, we have a reasonably good description, at least in rank three, but in any rank, we don't know which types occur. So, for each type, there exists at most one irreducible component, but as I've said, the picture is still not complete. So, but I still don't have time, so I last result. So, for n equals So, for n equals 3, we have reasonably good description. So, the result is as follows. F2 minus, we also have a description in terms of C delta when delta ranges in some given interval and the Wobley locus of type 2, 1. Of type 2, 1, meaning that the sub-bundle has rank 2 and quotient 1. I mean, that's the type of the nilpotent, the iterated kernels of the nilpotent Higgs field is given by of C delta when delta now varies from g minus 1 to g minus 2. And here for the same reason, we stopped earlier, because if delta is big. Because if delta is bigger than g minus 2, for the same reason by Riemann Roch, we have the set of homomorphisms from 1. I mean, this is, I didn't have time to explain this, but it's very similar to the rank 2 picture. The dimension of this is strictly bigger than 1, explaining why the forgetful map has dimensions. Dimensions at least two. So you get something which has good dimensions, at least two. Okay, so let me also finish. I'm sorry, I apologize. Let me finish with one remark that so I define very stable, very stability for vector bands. Quite recently, in a paper by Hausel and Hitchin, they extended this definition to any Any fixed bundle in the fixed point set of the Nipotent core. So these are just the chains, sum of line bundles, and they generalized the characterization of very stability in terms of, so they call it the upward flow. For them, bundle, a Higgs bundle is very stable if the upward flow, which I didn't define, intersects. Flow, which I didn't define, intersects the core, the need protein cone, just in one point. Okay, and they use this in order to compute the multiplicities of the component C delta of some encoding curve. Okay, I didn't have time to explain this, but yeah, I stop here. Thanks.
