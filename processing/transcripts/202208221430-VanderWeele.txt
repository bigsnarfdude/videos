For the use of surrogates, I do want to suppose to extend both an apology and an explanation insofar as I'll be presenting work that is in fact somewhat dated based on paper published discussion paper in biometrics in 2013. And I really haven't done. 2013. And I really haven't done much work on this topic of surrogacy since then. But Leila asked me if I was willing to present. And then so I was curious to return to this work, but also motivated in part by kind of the developments with regard to the FDA approval of the Alzheimer's drugs and whether we might be running into kind of similar surrogate paradoxes there as has perhaps aroused. Has perhaps arisen in past work. So, as I was going to reflect on this paper and other work, I feel some of the methods work I've done over the years has had fairly widespread uptake and others not. And I think there can potentially be at least two or more reasons for this, one of which might be just the methods not all that helpful. It's not all that helpful. But perhaps, secondly, there's not been adequate translation. As I was reflecting on this question, I feel papers on methods, papers where I've done something then for the clinical audience have often had much greater uptake. But certainly this paper from 2013 in biometrics has been one of the greater disappointments of my methods work. And so far as I think the results are of interest and potentially. Are of interest and potentially useful, but feel the works really had pretty much very little penetration in terms of what's actually being done with surrogate. So I'm going to return to the results, but then offer some speculations as to why I think the results are clinically useful. But I hope to move through the technical material fairly quickly to hopefully allow some time for. To hopefully allow some time for feedback, for conversation, for alternative viewpoints. Again, it might just be that the criteria being put forward here are not, in fact, all that helpful in practice. So is this a matter of that, the results not being useful, or just inadequate medical translation to date? So I'll present a couple of motivating examples, probably many familiar to this crowd. Some of the other definitions or criteria put forward for surrogates. Put forward for surrogates and the central technical result, and then some kind of broader speculations on the sociology of surrogacy and the process of coming to communal consensus. So I do think, and I'll come back to this later, I do think what we can do empirically with data and assessing and evaluating surrogates, what we can do statistically is important. But I think with surrogates, there's always an element of extending. An element of extending beyond the data. We're running a new trial in a new population or with a new drug. We never know whether the empirical relations really are going to extend to this new setting. So I think we're almost always moving beyond the data themselves. And so it's important to come back to this question when we are moving into a new setting, when we don't have data on the outcome, when is it reasonable to proceed with a surrogate? So kind of the example that I got in the interest in this work to be. The example that I got me interested in this work to begin with was that of ventricular arrhythmia strongly associated with mortality. Three drugs found to be associated with lower rates of ventricular arrhythmia, tested in randomized trials, found to reduce ventricular arrhythmia, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but then subsequent trials found that use of these drugs increased mortality. So here in these trials, arrhythmia was taken as a surrogate for mortality, but things went terribly wrong. But things went terribly wrong, possibly up to 50,000 excess deaths to the use of these drugs. So, we might formulate this problem as: you know, when and how can it be that a surrogate is strongly associated and correlated with the outcome, the treatment has a beneficial effect on the surrogate, but the treatment ultimately has a negative effect on the outcome. This situation is often described as being one of the surrogate paradox. Trickular arrhythmy is an example of the surrogate paradox, but I think these examples really strongly challenge. These examples really strongly challenge whether we should be using surrogates as outcomes. And again, to put to my mind what's going on with the Alzheimer's drugs, we're perhaps coming back to these same problems. So, you know, various criteria and definitions for surrogates have been put forward. Again, I think this will be moved through this very quickly since I think it's review for the vast majority of you, but we've got the apprentice criteria, sort of the test of the effect of the treatment on the surrogate should also serve as a valid. The treatment on the surrogate should also serve as a valid test of the effect of the treatment on the outcome. Proposed the criteria that S is a surrogate, effective treatment A on outcome Y. If Y is independent of A, conditional on S and S and Y are strongly correlated. And I think the criteria are perhaps somewhat recently suggested by ideal sorts of scenarios where if there really were no direct effect of the treatment on the outcome except through the surrogate, Then, once we condition on the surrogate, we should indeed attain the independence. But complications arise if there are common causes, and I'll come back to this point of the surrogate and the outcome. If that's the case, even if there are no direct effects, we would observe association between the treatment and the outcome conditional on the surrogate because of the unmeasured common causes of the surrogate and the outcome and graphical models. Outcome and graphical models or conditioning on the surrogate as a collider. I think, in part, arising from these considerations, an alternative, more causally notion and criteria for surrogacy was developed paper by Frangakis and Rubin using the framework of principal stratification, if we're willing to work with potential outcomes. And we let Y1 and Y0 denote the outcomes we would observe under treatment and no treatment, respectively. S1 and S0, the values of the surge. Zero, the values of the surrogate we would observe with and without treatment. And for any individual, we only observe either S1 or Y1, S0 or Y0, but at least conceptually, we can imagine both of these. And the principal stratum is just a group with the same values of S0 and S1. So the notion, which I, again, I think is conceptually quite attractive here, is that what we want for What we want for what they define as a principal surrogate is that if there's no effect of the treatment on the surrogate, these potential outcomes, and there should be no effect of the treatment on the outcome itself, sometimes referred to as a criteria of causal necessity, the sort of these notions and approaches, further, hudgeons, many others as well. And again, I think on conceptual grounds, it is fairly attractive. And this does seem like something we might ideally want. It's difficult to. Want. It's difficult to identify these quantities, but sometimes we can get kind of somewhat sensible bounds. So I'll come back to this as a potential criteria for surrogacy shortly, but Lawrence and proposed an even stronger definition of the surrogate, which is essentially using potential outcomes that if we fix the surrogate to a particular value, little s, then there's no effect of the treatment on the outcome. That's not. On the outcome, that's not through the surrogate. Essentially, no direct effect of the treatment on the outcome, not through the surrogate. So, this can be formulated in different ways. Factuals or no control direct effect of the treatment on the outcome, not through the surrogate. Treatment is an instrument for the effect of the surrogate on the outcome. And one can show that a strong surrogate in Lawrence's sense is also a principal surrogate. The paper that really got me into this literature on surrogacy was this paper by Chenin colleagues. Was this paper by tenant colleagues showing that you could have cases where an apprentice criteria satisfied principal surrogate, even a strong surrogate under Lauritsen's definition, and yet the surrogate paradox still arise. If you make judgments about the effect of treatment on the outcome based on the effect of treatment on the surrogate, you get things in absolutely the wrong direction. And they gave conditions. Conditions for Lawrence and strong surrogate to avoid this surrogate paradox. But these conditions given by Chen et al. required still no direct effect of the treatment on the outcome, not through the surrogate. The surrogate saw has to be kind of a perfect mediator. And for anyone who's been engaged in mediation analysis, it doesn't happen very often. Very often. So, while I think the criteria are interesting, I just don't think they're applicable to most cases in reality. But again, what was also striking about this paper was that these examples of something satisfying the Prentice criteria, being a principal surrogate, being a strong surrogate, and still manifesting the surrogate paradox. And it's pretty easy to construct simple examples, at least if S has three or more levels of this. Or more levels of this, where you know, for maybe 10% of the population, this treatment doesn't change the surrogate at all. For 50% of the population, the treatment increases the surrogate from zero to one. But for, let's say, 20% of the population, the treatment decreases the surrogate value from two to one. If the underlying mechanism for the outcome were such that the mean of the outcome were 0.1, if the surrogate took level one, and it were one itself if surrogate took level two and Itself of surrogate to level two and zero surrogate ticks level zero, so that you know there's a pretty substantial effect on the surrogate on the outcome when moving from s is one to two, but less when moving from s is zero to one. If you have an example like this, then one can look at the effect of the treatment on the surrogate. That is indeed to increase the surrogate 0.3 on average, and 50% of the time it increases it by one, 20% of the time it decreases. Time it increases it by one, 20% of the time it decreases it by one. So we have a positive effect of the treatment on the surrogate, and we have a positive effect of the surrogate on the outcome. But if we look at the effect of the treatment on the outcome, that's negative because although 50% of the time the treatment is increasing the surrogate from zero to one, and that's increasing the outcome by 0.1, 20% of the time, the treatment is decreasing the surrogate from two to one, and that's thereby going on to decrease the outcome. Going on to decrease the outcome from 1 to 0.1 by 0.9. So the average treatment effect of the treatment on the outcome is negative. And yet, in these examples, the proportion explains 100%, the proportion mediates 100%, prentices criteria satisfied. We have causal testity and sufficiency in the principal stratification framework. So it looks like all of our criteria are good, and yet the surrogate paradox is still manifest. And we get the wrong answer by relying on the effect of the treatment on the Effect of the treatment on the surrogate. And so, you know, I think this is troubling, but it sort of pushes us hopefully towards, well, what sort of criteria might make sense, what might allow us to avoid this surrogate paradox, and yet also hopefully allow for potential direct effects of the treatments on the outcome, not through the surrogate. And so the result that was put forward. Result that was put forward in this paper was that the expected value of Y given A in a randomized trial will be non-decreasing in A, so the treatment will increase the outcome if it's the case that the following three conditions hold. And this is now allowing for potential direct effects of the treatment on the outcome. It's allowing for potential common causes, unmeasured common causes of the surrogate and the outcome. And the outcome. These are sufficient conditions. These are not necessary, and so I'll be coming back to that point as well. But if we have the following three conditions, that why conditional on A S and U is non-decreasing in A, in other words, conditional on S and U, that direct effect itself, if it exists, is positive. It's operating in the direction that's consistent with the effect of the treatment on the surrogate. Treatment on the surrogate to the outcome. So, if that's the case, the direct effect, if it's there, is positive. Second, expect the value of y conditional on AS and U is non-decreasing in S, so that we actually have a, once you've conditioned on U, we actually have a positive causal effect of S on the outcome. S and Y aren't just positively correlated, but there's actually a positive causal effect of S on the outcome. And then, thirdly, if the If the probability that s is greater than s for any given value of small s conditional on a and u is non-decreasing in a. So, in other words, if we have not just a positive average causal effect of the treatment on the surrogate, but it's shifting the whole distribution upward, sometimes referred to as distributional monotonychastic dominance. If all three of those conditions are satisfied, Conditions are satisfied, then we will avoid the surrogate paradox. The effect of the treatment on the outcome we know will be positive. So, if those conditions are met, the surrogate paradox cannot arise, the effect of the treatment on the surrogate will be in the same direction, at least, as the effect of the treatment on the outcome. And that third condition of distributional monotonicity, not just monotonicity in the average treatment effect of the treatment on the surrogates, essentially needed to get transit. Needed to get transitivity so that it's not the case that the treatment positively affects the surrogate for different individuals than the surrogate positively affects the outcoming. And that was kind of what was going wrong in the prior numerical example I gave. But in terms of trying to understand these criteria and then translate them into a clinical setting, we can ask: well, how can the surrogate paradox arise? It can arise if we're not. Surrogate paradox arise? It can arise if one of those three conditions fails to be met. Maybe the first condition fails to be met. Expect the value of Y given AS and U is not decreasing in A. In other words, there's a negative direct effect of the treatment on the outcome, not through the surrogate. That's one way it can arise. Second, it might arise because the expectation of Y given ASC and you is not non-decreasing in S, so that we have that positive correlation between S and Y, not because of a positive causal effect of S on Y. Positive causal effect of S on Y, but because of confounding, so that that correlation really doesn't correspond to indirection the causal effect of S on Y. That's another way it can arise. Or it can arise because of failure of this distributional monotonicity, if kind of this transitivity fails, so that the effect of A on S, positive effect of A and S might be different for different people than S can positively affect Y. Why? So these give rise, I think, to three questions one might ask to try to rule out the surrogate paradox. So I'm kind of moving from the mathematics now to something that might be, questions that might be posed intuitively, that might find their way potentially into a clinical setting. Again, we might ask three questions. Ask three questions. If we're trying out a new drug or we're moving to a new population from adults to children and we're thinking about running a randomized trial where we only collect data on the treatment and the surrogate or biomarker of interest, not the outcomes we ultimately care about, we might go through a series of three questions. Might there be a detrimental, negative direct effect on the treatment of the treatment, on the outcome, not through the surrogate? Question one. Question two, might that positive association we've Might that positive association we've observed between the surrogate and the outcome be due to confounding rather than an actual causal effect of the surrogate on the outcome? Two, question three. Might the treatment affect the surrogate positively for different people than for whom the surrogate affects the outcome positively? That's that sort of question three. If we can rule all three out, if we can say no to all three based on kind of subject matter knowledge, then we can rule out the surrogate. The surrogate paradox. We will know then that the in a trial of the treatment on the surrogate will get at least the direction right with regard to the effect of the treatment on the outcome. Importantly, and again, I'll come back to this once again, these are sufficient criteria. If we can say no to all three, then we can definitely rule out the surrogate paradox. But if the answer to one is yes, we just don't know either way. Surrogate paradox might not be manifest, but it might. We perhaps want to be more cautious. But it might. We perhaps want to be more cautious. So, retricular arrhythmia example, in art, there was a negative direct effect of the treatment on the outcome, not through the surrogate, treatment on mortality, not through the surrogate. But again, it can rise potentially through any of these three other explanations. So, I mean, in thinking about the use of surrogates in practice, through some sort of mechanism, often a research community will decide. Often, a research community will decide it's okay to use a certain surrogate as a proxy for the outcome we care about. And I think it would be interesting to go into greater detail on the sociology of surrogacy. How does this process take place? How does this come about? Sometimes it seems to work well. CD4 count viral load for mortality and heavy AIDS treatment. I think it's going to work reasonably well, but sometimes it's failed and has disastrous consequences, particular arrhythmia and mortality. We'll see what happens with these Alzheimer's. See what happens with these Alzheimer's drugs. And I think one way to view these questions as just posing an additional set of criteria to be involved in trying to shape community consensus. Again, might the treatment have had a negative direct effect, not through the surrogate? Might the association of the surrogate and the outcome be due to confounding rather than an effect of the surrogate on the outcome itself rather than a causal effect? Might the treatment affect the surrogate positively for different individuals than for whom the surrogate affects the outcome? Surrogate affects the outcome positively. Once again, if the research community, based on their subject matter knowledge, can answer all three no, then I think that's very reasonable to proceed with something as a surrogate. But if the answer to one or more is yes, I think there should be pause with regard to do we really want to proceed in this manner. It doesn't mean the surrogate's necessarily bad, but I would argue we should proceed more cautiously. Should proceed more cautiously. That the surrogate paradox might be present. So, these Alzheimer's drugs might have a detrimental effect on Alzheimer's, not through the biomarkers that have been assessed. Are we sure the biomarkers on the outcomes really reflect causal effects rather than confounding? Might the Alzheimer's drugs affect the biomarkers for different individuals whom the biomarkers affect? Individuals whom the biomarkers affect or are related to. Alzheimer's disease itself, can we really definitively rule these out at this point? Might we have even in some cases evidence to the contrary? So, you know, to my mind, I do think this result potentially provides a set of intuitive guidelines to maybe help guide folks. To maybe help guide the practice in the use of surrogates. I'm not at all claiming these are the best questions out there. It might be better questions to ask. And maybe the mapping between the technical result and the questions is a little too loose. Or maybe there's more we can say by also making use of empirical data. But I mean, I do think it's important to have some. Think it's important to have some set of further conceptual criteria, subject matter criteria, that we can pose. Because, once again, while I do think empirical work is extremely important, I think usually with surrogacy, we're always making some sort of leap. And so we want questions with regard to when is that leap beyond the data reasonable. So, you know, I think if we don't have this, we're going to keep in terms of practice rather than the statistics. Rather than the statistical and more technical results, I think we're going to keep making mistakes, similar mistakes again and again. So, again, I'm not entirely sure whether it's just these questions aren't all that good or all that helpful or impossible to determine on subject matter grounds or maybe something better is out there or if maybe, and I didn't do this with this paper, a paper translating the results to a more clinical audience would have been valuable. And if that's the case and someone's interested, I could potentially be open to. interested i could potentially be open to to collaborate um you know i i do also want to acknowledge that you know this avoiding of the surrogate paradox is really a um a kind of a low bar we certainly don't want a surrogate which manifests the the surrogate paradox but ideally we'd want the surrogate to do a whole lot more to be able to predict in some sense the effect of the treatment on the outcome based and the effect of the treatment on the surrogate for different um uh subgroups i'm not at all saying this is all we want but i do think Is all we want, but I do think it's sort of a minimum standard, a minimum bar, avoiding the surrogate paradox, asking these questions to help us do so. So I'll stop there and I think maybe got five minutes for questions, comments, disagreements, critiques, and so on. Thank you all. Thank you, Tyler. That was great. That was much more optimistic than I was expecting. More optimistic than I was expecting it to be. And I found it really interesting that you feel like this paper didn't have an impact because I feel like everyone who works on surrogate markers, I guess, in the statistical world is very well aware of your paper and the limitations that you describe and make very obvious. And I remember reading your paper and the discussion that followed and feeling very sad about the whole area of. About the whole area of surrogate markers, but it was such an elegant paper and the discussion back and forth, and then you coming back that basically it's like, well, we can't just give up on surrogate markers because it doesn't help for all of us to say, oh, these assumptions are too strong. All of these methods break at some point. So we just shouldn't do it because people are still going to do it. So how can we? How can we contribute to the field and help them do it better if it's possible? I could ask a question, but I'm going to open it up for others first. Oh, someone. Oh, okay. Mark, do you want to? You can unmute if you're okay with it. Sure. Yes. I wrote my question in the chat box. I wasn't sure we could, you know, interject orally, but. Interject in orally, but Tyler, thanks very much. This was a very interesting talk. And I was just wondering, I mean, although I think it's really interesting to sort of list the conditions that might need to be fulfilled for a surrogate not to have the paradox, can you actually answer these questions in real life situations? I mean, do you have the data that will allow you to answer these questions, or would you have to answer these questions? You have to answer these questions in a sense from a biological plausibility type of point of view. I'm just wondering how I was thinking of my example in pathological complete response. I just would have no idea how to answer the three questions that you raised. Yeah, no, I think it's a very good and reasonable point. And I think in many cases, probably the answer is, well, yeah, it would be difficult to. difficult to to uh to to answer them but i think even an awareness of of that is is important and and if that's the case then i i think we should indeed proceed more cautiously it doesn't mean we abandon uh a surrogate but um you know i i would say we don't make fda approval decisions based on the use of a of a surrogate in in in most if we don't have if we don't have a sense Don't have, if we don't have a sense as to what the answers to these are. I mean, I think they could also potentially help guide what sort of biological or subject matter knowledge would we need to, maybe if we can't definitively answer these, at least to Shed. Because you mentioned that there was in the cardiac arrhythmia example, you mentioned there was a direct effect that caused the paradox. Of course, now you know this, but you probably know this because you had a lot of data showing this direct. Lot of data showing this direct effect on the true outcome that wasn't expected. Yeah, again, I would say until we have subject matter knowledge that we're fairly confident, maybe we're never going to have complete confidence, then yeah, let's proceed cautiously. And then, you know, let's think about what sort of biological, clinical, subject matter knowledge might be helpful to establish these. I mean, if we To establish these, I mean, if we were continually asking these questions, you know, this is speculative, but I think it's possible we'd realize: oh, well, some of these we can sometimes answer, and this is how we might do so. You know, I guess going back to Layla's comment about the penetration of this paper, I suppose there's maybe a distinction between kind of within the methodologic community versus in clinical practice. And I just, I don't think these questions are being. Think these questions are being posed regularly in the use of an evaluation of surrogates. So that's more what I was commenting on. And again, speculating, is that because they're just not useful or to Mark's point, it's always impossible to answer them? Or is it because they just haven't made an effort to kind of do that translation work and get those out there to the clinical community? I mean, if it's the latter, it may be worth returning to this and seeing what sort of. May be worth returning to this and seeing what sort of translation work can be done. And can one, I guess, back to Mark's point, come up with examples where maybe the answer to some of these can plausibly be offered or retrospectively could have been. Right, right. Yeah, I mean, I think your idea of a practical paper for more of a clinical audience, I mean, I'm not aware of one. I mean, I'm not aware of one. I'm certainly aware of some papers that have, you know, not in journals like biometrics that kind of on a larger scale just talk about the limitations of a surrogate marker, whether they're, you know, leading us astray. But I am not aware of one that has like a checklist that's like, here are the questions you need to ask. And if you can't answer these or you're a little bit sketchy on some of these, then you probably shouldn't. Then you probably shouldn't actually use this as a replacement in a trial. I haven't seen anything like that. Someone else has. Please send it. Okay, thank you. I'm going to move for time, but again, we have
