So what's the setup? So the setup is going to be, I'm going to start with the universal Picard variety over the Mausolear space of curves. And I'm going to fix what I would call an Abuja-Cobi section, AJ. Okay, so just the section. They all have this form. They all look like a canonical bundle twisted by The canonical bundle twisted by the markings with some multiplicities, which I'm going to be keeping track of by this single index A. So that's my abbreviation for this. And Isabel explained here talk, you know, we have these summaries inside the universal Jacobian, and this WGRD, which I'm going to be write with an open symbol here because I'm working over smooth characters. Simple here because I'm working over smooth curves. These are the pairs of a curve with a line bundle, such that the line bundle has more than r plus one than any independent sections. Okay, and as was mentioned in his talk, this variety is a degeneracy locus. So this peak has a universal curve and a universal curve. Curve, and the universal curve is a line bundle. This thing is a degenerous locus for this Plutary complex of the phase. And as Nadit pointed out, every time you have something like this, it carries a virtual class. And so this has a virtual fundamental class. Metal class, which I'm going to be writing with a lowercase w. And I think Alex is going to say a lot more about this. But let me just write down the definition is just given by some kind of determinantal formula. So this is supposed to be some kind of Kind of polynomial expression in the term classes of this term complex. Which polynomial expression is not so important. So I'm going to use the Adult-Compi section now to induce a class on MTM which I will just be recording. Recording the decides of a symbol A. And my goal, right? So, the goal is to study extensions of these classes to MG and R. Extend to the model space of model errors, selling errors. And there is a proposal on how to do this due to Due to Pagani, Recolfi, and Monzel, right? And they say how should we do that? They say let's embed TM, side and TM bar. And let's also deal with the Jacobian. So if you've worked on this subject, you you kind of recognize that this is not that's kind of a subtle problem, but but there is answers, there are some pretty good answers. Some pretty good answers. So, what they tell you to do is to go to what's called a compactified zacobia. Okay, so I don't I don't really want to get into this. I mean, this is some choice. Choice of what's called a stability condition. But all I want to deduce from this kind of convectification is that it's pretty nice, it's like a It's pretty nice, it's like a proper communication. And it also, and sorry about the board board, but I'm gonna put it up here. So it also carries its own universal curve and its own bubble. Alright, thank you. It has its own universal curve and its own universal bundle. The only difference. The only difference is that this curve is now a little bit more complicated. It's no longer what's called a stable. It's no longer a matter of a stable curve, it's what's called a quasi-stable curve. But it doesn't matter, right? I still have the same gadget. So I can extend the class on the Jacobian and get the analog of this WTRD open. I get the WTR, and now I'm decorating it with a choice theta. And now I'm decorating it with a choice theta, since it records the degree anyway, which is defined by the same formula, okay? Same determinant or formula applies to the universal bundle here. And I still have a a rational section. So actually I can still put this back. So maybe let me put this here. So that's the definition. These are the main classes. These are the main classes. But today we have the WTRA theta and we have the Kulberts, the WTR thetas from the compactified Jacobian. And now there's a conjecture in the same paper by Patiano Ricoff in Bazel, which says that. Which says that these classes here, W T R A thetas, are tautological. And there is a natural extension of this conjecture, which is, let's say, a dream, which is can we calculate them? Okay, so so. Okay, so so yeah, I I cannot attribute this question with the yeah first small request to write as a bit of a larger even larger, okay And the other question you said that you have to enter A as a rational you will have to explain how you decide. You will have to explain how it's like. Yeah, sure. So if I have a rational map between two smooth proper varieties, I can form the closure of the graph. So I have mark. I can take the graph and close it in the product. And so I can pull by a Q to closer to the graph and then push forward. That's good thing is. Okay, so this is the conjecture, and here's the dream, and you may ask why. Why do what's the motivation? Of course, everyone has their own motivations. The motivations that I have are that when you look at r equals d equals zero, and the appropriate status is the condition theta, which I won't get into, this construction recovers. Recovers the double gramification cycle from Remsen's talk. And this is really a very central cycle in Gromo-Witten theory. It's very important to, let's say, a subset of humanity. So anything you can tell about this is interesting. And my other motivation is from so my other motivation is from the impossible. So when R and D are impossible. Are impossible. Right, so when they're. Can you write a little bigger? Sorry? Just write a little bigger. Sure, I will try, but I'm not saying it. I'm just saying RNDR. I'm saying R and D are impossible. So in the sense of feasible stock, where the WGRD is empty, right, so they're in the bad range, and you can say, how on earth can that be interesting? Cannot be interesting. But the reason is that then what you have is that this class is zero. And if you know that it's in the tautological ring, and even better if you have a formula, that means you have a relation in the tautological ring. So that's a tautological relation. And maybe let me say that the conjecture. But the conjecture and the dream are known in this case. So, in this case, they're known by Gromo-Fuiden theory. The fact that this class is tautological, that the DR is tautological, was proven by Father Pandey, maybe in 2000. And then, let's say 15 years later, and then another 7, there was an extension. There was an extension to a formula, right? So, so, so there is, in fact, a formula for this, which I've kind of started to write here, but I actually don't want you to dwell on it. The reason to have the formula on the board is to give you an idea of what the formula might look like. So, this is a formula called Pixton's formula proven when k. So, what I mean, when k here is zero, it was proven by Ganda Pixton. Was proven by Janda, Pixton, Deripande, and Swunkin. And for arbitrary K, it was proven in this work of Bay, Holmes, and Riband force. And anyway, so what does the formula look like? It says that, okay, if you look at a stable graph, then you have a gluing morphism from kind of a product of moduli space. From kind of a product of moduli spaces of curves to mt and bar, then you have some combinatorial gadget called the weighing mod r. So that's just a function from the set of oriented edges of gamma to z mod r z, and they're supposed to satisfy some conditions. And then you assemble them in this huge rational function. And this function just involves integers, tautological classes. Tautological classes and these gadgets. And then the theorem is that if you look at R large, this becomes polynomial in R. And you can extract the constant term. And the constant term of this expression actually computes. So that's a formula in that case. But anyway, I don't want you to dwell. The only point of having the formula is so that you can have some idea of the complexity that goes into idea of the complexity that goes into such a formula. So I'm gonna even erase it. And maybe the theorems for today, so there is two theorems. So there is theorem one, which is the conjecture is true. So this class is untautological. And there is theorem two, which is joint with Alex. Any colour? It's actually, we also have formulas. It's also explicit formulas. So this is kind of what I want to explain. And it's going to go in a sort of roundabout way. It's going to go through logarithmic geometry. Which geometry? Rich geometry? Really great geometry. Yeah. And so this is the kind of problem that I want to study by this log intersection theory. Okay. So maybe, let me say a couple of things, log intersection theory. So what's the like, maybe let's isolate the form of the problem. So I have Let's isolate the form of the problem. So I have a normal crossings pair, XD, which is MGM bar with its standard boundary divisor. I have the component of the divisor, which is MGM. And I have a cloud, let's call it Tai view, and the charming view, which I want to extend to tau complex. But as we discussed yesterday, for example, so when you give So, when you give me such a pair, I have a lot of operations I can do with it. So, I can look at any logarithmic modification of x. And from the point of view of logarithmic geometry, you should not, right? You should not distinguish. But of course, when you work with the child groups, the child groups do distinguish. The child groups do distinguish algorithmic modifications. So the field says, okay, so maybe instead of looking for an extension with ring of x, we should look for an extension of the following, the log jar of x, which was in fact defined in Einstein code. So we should look at this co-limit of algorithmic modifications and try to find an extension of the class there. So maybe let me. Class there. So maybe let me just remark: what is a class in this object? Well, a class is just a collection C of y of classes for any sufficiently fine log modification x with the property that if you pull it further back to some xi of z, the system is compatible, and so for all. And maybe let me give you an example. So, an example would be: you can start with normal correspondence squared, and you can start with a cycle of the class. You can start with some cycle Z of U, the cycle is U. So then you can make a class in any log modification by taking the closure. Modification by taking the closure of the cycle in Y. And in fact, this procedure produces a class, let's say log C Unlike Child. And in fact, this class is kind of non-trivial in the sense that if you were to start with a closure in X, this would not be the same class as the class produced by this. That's the class produced by this process. So, what this is saying is that there is some blow, and eventually there is some blow where the class becomes transverse and therefore study levels. And second example is the love that is discussed. The law we are mentioned in the Rento's talk. In the Renzo's talk, which is kind of an extension of this class DR, which lives in some blow of Mg and bar. And in fact, the common theme of both of these operations is that they're what's called refinements. They're refinements. So that means that if I take this class in log chow, I mean I have push forward here, chow x. So if I So, if I were to take this class and push it forward, I would recover the closure of the cycle in X, but the other way around is not true. I cannot recover this class from the closure of the cycle in X. And the same is true for the log D R. So if I push the log DR down to MTM bar, I recover this class, but the other way around is not true. Okay, so So let's keep the question. Sorry, is it any better? Can you hear me any better? Okay, so let's let's give the why. I mean, wh why would you want to do that? And well the the answer is just simply that this this cycle this Simply that this cycle, these definements tend to be better, and they tend to be better behaved. So, for example, Renzo discussed this talk that this log PR cycle in fact is connected to double Hurwitz numbers. He discussed this multiplicativity. This SLM invariance is out of Homo's Pixel-Schmidt. And maybe let me report what I think is. What I think is maybe the most striking application of this was really I'm gonna record the last the last of this so there's three papers citing here that we don't think it's becoming too small to read the names okay so the names are Herr, Frankenathan, and Urundodil Kumar and McKinnon. Three theorems, but I'm just gonna go with the last one. I think they have the same flavor. And what the theorem says is that we log the other. Sam, you've written the last part of my name very small. So we have the log rom of hidden theory of Tori varieties. And so any logrom of hidden theory of a Tori variety can be calculated via this class, whereas the it is not true that you can do that for the TR. So maybe let me say that. Let me say that, so I mentioned theorem one, theorem two. Maybe let me put here theorem epsilon, which is this W G R A thetas have lifts, so you have refinements to log charm, and as stated. And as stated, this is a meaningless question about the theorem. What's the second word in the theorem? Oh, recutters. Recutters. Yeah, so any log promoted invariant of a toric variety that you might want to calculate, you can calculate if you know how to calculate this cycle. And it's very much false without law. This has to do with this irrational invasion. Do with this irrational invariance that was mentioned yesterday. Anyway, so maybe I should mention. Yeah, so if you take, let's say, a toric variety of dimension n and you want to compute the virtual class of log stable maps to v, you push it forward to mtm2. You want to push it forward. To, if you want to push it forward to an TM bar, that's recovered by multiplying n of these things. And that's the and so I mean a log norm of it in variants is given by some kind of virtual class times something. And this virtual class is basically exactly product of n of this. Of any torque varieties, if it's p1 to the n. Talk correctly as if it's P1 to DN. So that's what Byrason invariant would tell you. That you can reduce the calculation to P1 plus P1 plus P1 and so on. The DR is the virtual class of maps. I don't really want to go into the property that we could just say here's the push forward of this class where it's called plus to P1 on to MGM bar. To MTM bar, but if I were to take an arbitrary variety here, product formula fails. But if I put log product formula is restored. So the one-dimensional case recovers the arbitrary case. Anyway, so the statement theorem is that log the error is recovered by Ramov-Wooden theory on a torque, right? It's log. It's log, that's log. That's log. By is log. No, no, no. The log is log. What you mean as by is log. So there's no function with that. Is it the other direction? It's really the other way, right? So you need to know one cycle to compute the evidence coming. Technically, both. Either way would work, but we have four logi and we don't have to. No, it's just higher trouble parsing logos. It's not, again, the log looks a lot like five. Sorry. So, so, so, so, so, theorem. So, maybe our good is writing a lot of theoretical variance. So, maybe I should say a little bit about the structure of this theorem which I call epsilon, because it's really not that hard. And it says that these W D R A thetas that I defined do have such refinements in log java. Do have such refinements in Loch Chow. And as stated, the theorem has no content. But the point is that these refinements are particularly nice, so they allow you to prove theorem 1 and theorem 2. Okay, so let me try to explain now how do you get a handle. So how do you get a handle? A class in this thing, and so on. So, so how do we do it? Class in log child. And the answer is basically tropical team and I only need And I only need a small piece of tropical geometry. So I need two things. So, my tools, I have two tools. My first tool is at least the version of tropicalization that we use in my world, which takes a pair Xt and produces a rational polyhedral complex, like Renzo described in his talk. Described in his talk, and you should think of this as capturing geometric info, geometric information. And the second piece is essentially the homology theory on this Tom complex, which is the algebra of these polynomial functions on this Russian-Pochron complex, which also, as Reneza explained, comes to the mark to x. And you should think of this as complementary. And you should think of this as something that's a function of the way it's going to. Channel? Channel? Well, what is the meaning of these wise polynomials that you're thinking? Where do they do they bend on the cones or do they can yeah maybe maybe I should write a cone-wise polynomials Okay, so how does that help? That helps because there is a perfect correspondence between log modifications of x and subdivisions complex complex. So the problem of finding a log modification becomes combinatorial. Becomes combinatorial, and in fact, you know, I find it kind of okay. So, let's leave it at that. And then I also have a way to make cosmology classes based on combinatory information. And I think Forenzo didn't really discuss the map, and I won't either, but maybe let me give you a feeling for what kind of class. A feeling for what kind of classes come this way. I'm going to do this on a picture, but I'm going to talk as if it's a general thing. So you look at the normal cross-sum thing and you look at the stratum and you can normalize it. Picture does nothing. So some uh some a normal stratum here. Then we can find the torsor. We can find the torsor that trivializes the monochromatic group. So then, on this torsor, the normal bundle of the mod 2x splits as a direct sum of line bundles, as many as they could mention at the start of. And then what you can do is you can take an arbitrary polynomial of the first second class of these normal bundles and push it forward. And push it forward to X. And in fact, the ring generated by these classes is precisely the image of this convoluted formula. Okay, so maybe I know that there's not a lot of detail here, but maybe we can make a little start. I don't know, maybe we can make some comparisons with historic geometry, Lord Geometry. Lower geometry. So torque geometry X determines, sorry, X is equivalent to its tropicalization, which is its fun. In the log theory, X just determines the Fun. But then, of course, subdivisions of the Fun are toric modifications and this is still true, right? And this is still true. So this is what this is saying. This is saying that and then finally, the convex polynomials on the fun of a third variety is the same thing as the equivalent powering of the variety. And there is a map from the equivalent theory to the normal equivalent theory. And here I have a map that is just, let's say. A map that is just, let's say, similar and some similar features. You can make this analogy a little bit more precise, but I don't want to today. So the way I think about it is that X is some kind of algebraic reference space. And knowing this reference space algebra algebraizes all the combinatorics relative to its optimization. Relative to the substance. All the prices. So, how do, yeah, so maybe how this works, and then maybe we can work it out for the WCFs. So, so okay, so so suppose I have this So suppose I have this psi of u and tsau of u, and I have some psi of x and tau of x, but I have also chosen a refinement. Well, sorry, more tau of x. So how can I understand this refinement? And it's basically two steps. So step one says you choose A model, Y and the representative. I mean, remember, what is a class here? A class here is a class in a sufficiently high flow. So you find one, which means find a sample find a Find it, solve the tropical problem to find the correct subdivision. We're trying to find a way to describe a class in log channel sufficiently well that we will be able to write a formula for it. So exciting. There is some kind of existential ambiguity in these classes. I'm saying there's some class and some blow-up, but I want to write a formula. Some blow-up, but I want to write a formula. So, how do I do that? So, I have to make things concrete. And the way we make things concrete is: first of all, I solve a tropical problem which lets me know at least the fun of the thing that it lives on. And the second step to write the formula in this ring child of y. But this is actually not. But this is actually not really trackable. And it's not really possible to understand this ring general. However, if you start with any sum ring of the towering of X and your model here to do the topological ring on M D and Y, then you can define the same kind of method for Y, which is just Which is just the pullbacks of the topological of the R elements times the combinatorial classes on the near thing. So step two is show that this class lives here and find the formula in this ring. So this is actually how these theorems are proven. They show that this lifts, this This lift, this refinement, in fact, live in this kind of things, and the formula is written in this language. Okay, so so let's let let's kind of apply this. Let's uh Let's find the refinements for the WT's. So, how are they constructed? That's a form. So, I had this n was inside mt n bar and I had chosen this compact side Jacobian And I was pulling back this WGR headers from vector fighter heterogeneity. So there is something a little bit unpleasant in this diagram, and the unpleasant thing is that this sexon is a fact, a rational sexon. So the idea here to find the local The idea here to find the log lift is to reject this diagram and replace it with a better one. So this is the algorithmic picard that was mentioned in Jonathan's talk yesterday, and in in fact we don't we don't need to know almost anything. We don't need to know almost anything about this. I'm just gonna mention, but this was nice, it was proper, smooth. This is nicer in the sense that it's proper, smooth, but also proof. And now I actually have a section. This is the key property. But now I have a section to log in. So really, the refinement of the class should be. Class should be the pullback under the section of whatever class WGRD you decide to define in the towering of logbook. But now there is a problem because I mean as was mentioned you pay a price here for this group action. Here for this group action. And the price you pay is that this space is not representable. Kind of similar to what happened in Patrick's. So it doesn't make sense to talk about these child groups. However, this space is not that far from prepresentable. Like in Jonathan's talk, this space in fact has a lot of In fact, it has a log modification that's representable. So, in fact, it makes sense to talk about the log chart of log peak. And if you think about it, what is a class, right? Okay, so what are the log modifications? So, okay, so a log modification of log p is the same thing as a component. It's the same thing as a as a relative case of pink in the sense of let's say Manford and Falding's chai and so on okay and so what is a class in the log τ of log peak? It's just a class in any sufficiently defined order identification But that is further compatible with pullbacks. And it is a theorem, in fact, of the theorem of Andreo Pagani. And maybe I'm I'm giving you the interpretation of this theorem in joint work with Garita, myself, Martin Olivers, Filippo, Jonathan. I'm not going to spell the name stuff. So that's a logification. So in fact, I'm back to square zero, right? So to give you a class, I have to choose a sufficiently fine blow-up and give you a class there, but that's a sufficiently fine. And give you a class there, but that is afficiently defined workload, and here's the class already defined by Nicola and co-authors. So I haven't accomplished anything. However, in fact, that's not true, because what this tells you is that the algorithm section, the pullback, is supposed to be a mark from the torque child of empty fire. To the load of pink to the load of NDM bar. Can I make a small correction? I like very much to be cited. I think it is a pro pachine in I'm really sorry. If I just put P it would have been fine. Sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm not sure. I've even made this joke before that it's gonna get complicated now that there are these combinations. I didn't think I was going to be. Okay, so here I didn't gain anything. But what this perspective tells you is that in fact you get this for free. For free. So, this is supposed to be a function from log tau of log pick log tau from T and bar. And what this means in practice is that any time you have a space with a map, let's say that is a copy section, I can pull this back and then I get the log modification here. And this log modification comes. Comes with the resolution of the section. Automatically, definition, when I mean it's appearance, no definition is that the definements call it log wt theta simply um of wt theta. I think that if they leave, now at the time of the blowout. MgA theta, was it just the closure of the graph of your rational average could be rapid and then normalized? I think it is the normalization of the closure. Okay, so all right, so I have defined the classes. I have defined the classes. So what was my paradigm? My paradigm was, so now I want to get some handle of them. I want to be able to say something about them. And I had two steps for how to do this. First is that you should find. First, is that you should find a subdivision with a good model, right? And two, you should try to express it in this ring. Let's skip this. So, so in fact, so Xen, can I tell you one thing about this theorem? Theorem? Of the one, two, three, four, five, seven authors. So it's separate. Yeah, it's separate, right? So like the, I mean, the paper of Andreo Puccini is... Is that the explicit construction of the top horizontal error? No. So there's two papers. Yeah, so one paper does this, and then what does the other paper does? And the other appears this, but not in this language. And so the. So Abreu Pacini is the horizontal arrow, right? And the right vertical. Abreo Pacini's two papers are the top horizontal and the right vertical. And then the M M U V W is it's just interpreting, recently. It's just interpreting this. But I should say, I mean. So, meaning they did not construct it as the final product as well. Yeah, they did not. Yeah, in fact, the construction, this construction, the paper is quite difficult. Paper is quite easy. Okay, so so how do we get a handle? Okay, so how do we get a handle in these classes? I said that we should solve some tropical problem, and this problem actually is very well known in the tropical world. So if you look at my diagram, I basically have two of these reference spaces. So remember, I was thinking of X as the reference space that makes Luminotorius simple to break geometry. And here I have two. I have the M T and R and I have the log I call the logic. And I can look at the topicalizations with the norm, MZN trop, which I'm going to write. And for logic, it's not that we want, but I will explain actually I guess you know it installed in some way. And I'm just going to describe this relative to anti-trop. So, if you think of what a point here is, it's a graph together with a length assignment on its edges. So, this thing has fiber over this point, dark groove of this metric graph, as in Nathan's talk. So, this is the space of divisors T download. Gamma modulo tip following. Actually, if you think about it, right, so because now my graphs are not combinatorial graphs, they really are metric graphs, I need to be careful with my chip firing. I need a kind of a more delicate version, which if you think about ends up being the same thing as the group of peace persons in front. The group of least resent functions of the class. So, my diagram here also. Maybe we can kind of extend this picture. Do you mean linear fight? No, peace with the So so so this picture can be kind of extended, log modifications of log peak, which are relative modifications of peak, and they can be also thought as polyhedral structures on tropical peak. And this diagram here has a tropical international As a tropical incarnation. Here you put tropical peak. Here you put the fun of peak theta, which is a moduli space in tropical geometry. It's the moduli space of pairs of a quasi-stable graph and a theta-stable divisor. So if you don't know what these words mean, it's okay. It's just a kind of graph with a divisor on it. Here I have FDN control. FGN stroke, and the section becomes just a multi-degree of that metropolitan section of the altercal section. And what's happening, I'm going to phrase this, is that I have this family of real tori out here, which you see, okay, I promised at some point that tropicalization is a Rasmushedral con complex here. Is a Rashmohedral conflict, here it's not, and that's an incarnation of the fact that this space here was not representable. But the theorem, in fact, this is the theorem of a curved spin, right, is that in fact this moduli space gives you a polyphenol decomposition here. Please. And perhaps I have a totalization of mg and r, which I will just draw as a line because there. Because limited ability drawing, and you see what happens is that this line is not a tropical morphism. It maps into unions of cells. So the space here, the front of this space here, is just the commonly found. There's nothing to it. I just have to cut this space into all the pieces, all the parts that this crosses. All the parts that this crosses. And if you think what this says, right, if you think what this says is this thing is also a moduli space in tropical geometry. It's the moduli space of quasi-stable graphs with a piecewise linear function that takes the multi-degree of the algebra. The uploads a copy section and simplifies it into something that's data stable. What this means, and it's the same, the logarithmic thing, is the moduli space of not quasi-stable transfer, but quasi-stable curves with the same alpha, which allows you to twist the abel-decobi sector. So it allows you to twist the other cover section to something that's detestable. Okay, so that's my step one, right? I want some explicit description of what this thing is, and it's simply this tropical modular space. And my step two And my step two would be to try and first of all show that the classes that I have defined, pullback of the Wg R thetas here, live in this ring, and then I should try to calculate in this piecewise polynomial argument. Can I just make sure I understand? So, in the beginning we had the A, and that gave me a device. And that gave me a divisor on that. This now gives me a divisor on the graph. Yeah. It's a multi-degree of the marked curve. I mean, it really gives me a divisor. And now you're saying that that may or may not be theta stable, but there's a unique way to move it to something theta stable. And I keep track of that piece by saying. Yeah, except not an empty embarrassment. Right? In order to. Not the like for a six for one tropical curve. For one tropical theory there. That that's the apparel achievement here. The piecewise linear function is not in the argument. That's why there's an option, you have to display all of it. Even if I know the edge lengths of the problem. I mean, isn't the map a like set-through medically like I think. So I think you have to register it somewhere. You have to set the value of the function of the V. But isn't sigma, I mean as a set, sigma and mg and trucker the same? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, so I said it's definitely for one truck, for example. Yeah, yeah, not true. Yeah, I agree. That's great. Yeah, but but I should be easy to find. But anyway, that's not so bad. Okay, so so maybe I'm kind of short in time. So maybe let me try to explain. First of all, now you know I have this theorem epsilon, which had no content. It said that I have a lift I leave of the classes that Nykola and Rikolfi and Monzel defined to Lao Child, but there was no reason that there is content because I didn't argue why these are better. So first of all, let me tell you why these are better. And the reason is just that simply now the log WT R A theta can be calculated by Grossman's fremont law. This is now a deterrent locus. So it's a deterrence locus for the following bundle is the Abletobi section twisted by all of the two space and f function. So this is a moduli space. It also carries a universal curve and carries universal curve. Inversal curve and cuts, inversal is present function. So I can just twist and calculate. Right? So I can compute by dropping the command. Oh. And now I was 100% run out of time if I tell you. How to try and do that. So, I think we have two choices. I can show you a formula for this for the R equals D equals zero case, which does not use Grotten-Equiemann raw, or I can explain the form with Grotten-Nuclear-Raw. I cannot do more. Can I ask a question that's neither? Yeah. It's part of the point that the original, like, if I push back, if I don't refine, then it's known or It's known or expected that I cannot compute this by GRR. So, I mean, what would you? I think you can probably prove this, right? You know all the line bundles. Prove this not hard. Yeah, I think you know all the line bundles on MTN and you can compute I mean, you know. Okay, yeah, yeah, okay. It's going to be false for some. Going to be false. Yeah, so at least the natural candidates will definitely give the wrong answer. The natural candidates. So for example, if you do this, you get the only thing. And alpha only exists on the blog. Alpha only you can only fix it. You can only exist on the block. Okay, so let me. I don't know about this. So let me isolate the problem. So I have this. So formally, the problem looks like this. So I have a function that cares. So empty and banana. A family of curves, so MG and Baron, universal family. Then I have a log modification of that MGHR. And then I have the universal pair algorithm, which is a log modification of the pullback. And I have a line bundle on C, and I have a way to twist it on C prime. So what is asked is to compute is to compute the germ character it's called this i of L twisted alpha and so it is a class in R star as graph so so maybe let me put it as a theorem so this this is with with Alex and I Polo So, what this says is that, first of all, in fact, we have found that in this Broton the Kuban-Roch problem, this was polynomial language is not quite sufficient. So, because what happens when you try to calculate these expressions, when you start, you have the exponential. You have the exponential. You start doing more, you have the exponentials of trend points of selection. But then you have these trends that come from the specific clear how this combine with each other. So it is not the case. So it is not the case that if you take a piecewise polynomial from C and you push it forward to S, you will get a piecewise polynomial. So it's not true. It's not much like this. So the theorem goes by concounting for all the functions F C an algebra. Algebra is we haven't named yet, let's name it provisionally: the algebra of piecewise topological classes on F, together with an isomorphism of this algebra to the strata algebra. And this contains that these were polynomials which correspond to the normal detection of the strata class distribution. And the map from this algebra. And a map from this algebra to this ring RX. So I'm saying that there is an isomorphism, but it's kind of exotic. 2, if there is an explicit formula computing computing a towering sorry computing uh tau of minus r pi lower star of l alpha in the string of two space the olives black space and in fact we d we actually do not know I mean of course every given answer we can translate the straddle algebra but we don't know how to write the the formula in the straddle algebra. Formula in the struggle algebra. So, I mean, as a corollary, you get these theorems one and two. And let me just a couple of these formulas just to give you an idea of what they get and the eyeball too. Oh, I see. So I'll proceed. So it is too long, and it has the right to be off. Yeah, so so so you know okay, so my the original motivation was log DR and relations. And a couple of months ago we were at Dan's birthday conference and I asked one of them, what's your favorite relation? I was kind of trying to show off a little bit. You know, I was trying to to get some I don't know some attention. And you know, she said the W D V D. And you know, she said the WDBD. And I was so happy because she didn't call my bluff. You know, she could have so easily said some relation in genus 3, but I mentioned 6. But now I can show you, for example, what we said. I can do the WBDB. And you see, okay, so what does this kind of calculation look like? Of course, you cannot follow it. Like. Of course, you cannot follow it, but just I want to show you the shape of the calculation. So we have M04, which is just P1, but we'll forget about that. We just look at the tropicalization, which is this little triangle. And then we'll choose the ramification vector to be 1 minus 1 minus 1. And then you find that this MTA theta in this case is M0 for tropics, that no blow is required. zero for tropics that no blow is required, but there is a function. And when you twist down, and you do something to create a row, you get some expression. This is some way to calculate in this algebra, what we're talking about. But what you get at the end, when you run this calculation, is that psi 1 because this piece was in L function. And then you can change the roles of the markings 2 and 4 and 3 and 4, and you get that psi 1 is the other one. One is the other one, or the last one. Then, if you change the rows of the points 1, 2, and 1, and 3, what you get is that psi 1 is psi 2 is psi 3 is n of the point of volume. So this is how you get all the relations in M04. Of course, M04 is a very easy example, but anyway, this is some method to get a kind of algorithmic. So next I want to show you an example of calculating the dr and there, so here I'm in genus one and I choose ramification vector two minus two and an appropriate stability condition and this tells me I need to do this blow-up. It supports this function over there and then if you work it out, And then you work it out, and what you're going to get from this profit-de-Kim-Roch approach is this formula here. It's 2 psi 1 plus 2 psi 2 plus psi 1 minus 2 psi 2 minus lambda minus this piece with inner function. And in fact, you know, we have some work with David and Pandari Pandey, Vixen, and Johanna Schmidt, where we computed the logarithm. This is what I wanted to show you. Is what I wanted to show you, but I decided I ran out of time. And that would produce a different formula. It would have the same kind of shape, but it's a different formula. So this is a different calculation of the same class. And the fact that they're the same is equivalent to the relations pi 1 equals psi 2 and lambda equals the relations of 12 and 1 to 1. And the last thing I just want to show you is a co-dimension 2 calculation, which I'm not doing because. Which I'm not doing because it's kind of long, but I just want to point out one feature, and this is here: this alpha q over 6 term. This is the first term that starts where this diagram starts becoming complicated. The reason I'm putting there is just to give you an idea of what an element in this new thing of these waste total-scale classes may look like. You see that there are these classes you don't understand. on their face a bit like nonsense. But anyway, these are kind of generators about it. Okay, I'll stop here. Thanks for else and the L's are the lengths of the size of how your side glasses pull back your. No, so that's a formal symbol. But that's a formal symbol. That's a formal symbol, but there is a map. So there's a map into, well, I can rewrite. There is a map from this algebra into my total logical director as pi. Then this formal symbol actually does not map anywhere by itself. But the expression le2 times psi e2 does map standards. Into those maps. Yeah, this is why the isomorphism of the strata outer brace cannot exotic. Is this calculus coded? Calculus is not coded. I would be right, it would be really nice if this calculus was coded and you s you're surrounded by a sheet so much. Yeah, but there's only one sheet. But I'm not very convincing. So we we coded uh the other formula? Coded the brother formula and then Sam asked me to code this formula, but then he didn't, he was not pushing on it. You can help. If it's not as luck, it's really horrible. So do you get the Getzler display on the nose? Yeah, well, on the nose, probably not. I mean. Okay, so you can prove that you get the right dimension. You get the generator of the vector space span by Getzler modula previous reliables. Because one of the constructions of the Getzler is also by a Kirwitzy type things. So I don't know actually what the Getzler is in the nose even. All I know is that, yeah, you can get a relation that's definitely equivalent to Getzler. And that just comes by taking, I think you just take two exponents. 2x1, minus 62, minus 63, minus 640. And then you choose your state of blow up. I think the status of coding this is that if Sam is willing to learn ADM cycles, we are willing to help him get it going. But if Sam wants Willing to help them get it done. But if Sam wants, like, what happened so far, where Sam said, please code this for me, and that's not happening. Yeah, I mean, probably the time that I asked you, it was a little premature. Probably still a little premature. Well, let's thank our wonderful speaker. Did you forget? Did you wait a session? Yes.
