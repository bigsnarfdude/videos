So, the point of this talk is: we're going to start with this knot, the figure eight knot. We're going to take a satellite, we're going to construct this invariant, and then I'm going to show you how to read it. There's already coffee. Wow, great. Okay, but more formally, the questions that I want to answer are the following. What is this object? Why would we construct it? And you can read that question with as much. And you can read that question with as much disdain as you want. I get that a lot. How did we construct it, and then what revisited? What do we do with it now? We'll start with what is this object. So border floor homology is a homology, Hager floor homology theory for three manifolds of boundaries. Uh-oh. Due to Lipschitz, Ushboth, and Thurston. Due to Lipschitz, Urshboth, and Thurston, and now it's dead. And now it's bad. I meant to do that. Really jumping here. Just pressing it a little too hard. Surely letting me go in. Okay, let's just go. There's some great. Okay, and it's associated with three manifolds with boundaries. So to some three-manifold with non-equipped boundary, we can associate a differential gradient algebra associated to the boundary surface. And then using Surface. And then using that algebra, we can construct differential grade modules over our algebra. And in general, sometimes these come in the form of A infinity algebras, but I don't want to talk about anything A infinity today. And it just turns out that my diagrams are nice enough that everything just turns out to be a differentially gradient module. Yes, so these modules are referred to as our bordered invariants. And I think that the plural, this pointer is really fun, the plural is a little bit misleading because these Is a little bit misleading because these invariants are not distinct. It's actually just the same invariant interpreted in two different ways, which we'll talk about in the next slide. But before we do that, talk a little bit more about our algebra. So when our boundary is toroidal, as it will be in all of the structures we're looking at today, our algebra is called the torus algebra. It has two minimal item potents, and that has to do with the handle decomposition of the torus, the handle decomposition of two one handles. And then And then often people use this quiver to describe multiplication in the Taurus algebra. So there are six basis elements that you can get using this multiplication. And then you modify the zero ones. That's not so important. It's just so you sort of recognize what these symbols are. But the point about the eigenpotence is a little bit significant in that all modules over this algebra will split as the direct sum of two F2 vector spaces, meaning that the generators will have. The generators will have like a not-zero ideal connection either for iodine not or iodine wind. So, a little bit more about the bordered invariant. One version is the type A structure. It is technically a right A infinity module, but like I said, today they'll just be differentially graded modules, so we don't have to worry about it too much. And they're equipped with multiplication maps, and that's what these things are. So, you'll notice the word write, the handedness. The handedness has to do with what side of your module you're multiplying with the algebra. And then the other invariant is a type D structure. It's a left differential module, maybe the structure map and multiplication software. So the handedness is supposed to sort of make you think of the duality, and the point is that we can use these, that these admit a pairing theorem. This is again due to Rich Bottom Thurston's original paper. And the pairing theorem. Paper. And the pairing theorem can be expressed in this way. If I have two manifolds of boundary, M1 and M2, I could take the type A structure of one of them, doesn't matter which, and the type V structure of the other, and take the A infinity tensor product, and I'll get something of the equivalent to the closed Hager floor chain complex CF half of the three manifold that I get when I glue the boundary of M1 to M2 with some orientation reversing diffeomorphism. Diffeomorphism. And then the point here is that the A and D sort of like batch up. This theory extends to like bimodules and trimodules just so long as when you're taking this tensor product, you're sort of identifying which boundary components are matching up. So if you have a bimodule, you'll have two copies of your algebra, and you'll either have the type D D, type D A, or type AA structure. And you get to choose because, again, they're all encoding the same information. There's no information you get from a type A structure that you just. Information you get from a type A structure that you don't get from a type. Just so you can see what they look like, here is a type D structure. And then from the type D structure, you can convert it into a type A structure. And so maybe what you'll notice is there's a slight difference in notation, just that your type D structure, we use coefficient maps and the type A structure, you actually just write what the algebra elements are, and then there's an obvious increase in complexity when you switch to the type A structure. When we switch the types. But again, the benefit of having both is the pairing theorems. So we return to our object, and we're able to answer the question of what? It is a left differential module associated to some three-manifold in the total boundary. And in fact, it is associated to a not complement in S3. And here asked the question: what, what? And what is the not-complement in S3? It's this specific knot. It's a satellite knot. Thick knot is a satellite knot where Q is the major pattern and 4.1 is the figure eight. And Alex already gave us a nice background on these objects. Okay, why in general? So this question is asking like why would you do this? Why is this construction useful? Is this construction useful? Why do we have to pass the word of floor philology? It seems like kind of philological work. And the reason I'm doing this is because I want to construct a knot floor complex. I want to answer a question about smooth comportions of my satellite knot, maybe generally satellite knots. And so if you knew nothing about knot floor homology, which I don't think is anyone in this room, you might ask the naive question of why can't I just take my knot floor complex and get the knot floor complex of a satellite knot? And there's just no well. And there's just no well-defined way to do this. Word of floor homology via immersed curves seeks to do this for cabling, but there's just not really a well-defined way to do it for patterns in general. So instead, what we have to do is translate our not for a complex to a order invariant, do a computation in the realm of order for homology, and then translate it back. And the reason that we're able to do this is that the type, that's a really bright yellow, the type D structure of a knot complement is closely related to the knot conflict. Is closely related to the not flow complex of the not. And there's like a really well-defined algorithm to sort of translate the languages quite easily. Again, motion size one. So that's why this construction is useful in general. But why in particular? Why this knot? This knot is of interest because there is a result of Cochrane, Franklin, Hedden, and Horn that says for every knot, the zero surgery of our knot and the zero surgery of the image of the knot under the major pattern, our homology coordinate malator. Our homology coordinate relative to gradian. So it's a natural question to ask whether the knots have to be concordant. There is a conjecture in the Kirby aqualute, bicurbian aqualute, the Kirby problem list, that said if two knots have the same serial surgeries, then they are slightly concordant. So if we take same here as sort of relaxed to be homology coordinate relative to Rodian, actually Cochrane, Franklin, Pedden, and Horn gave a counter example. But all of their pairs of knots were infinite order. So a natural question then. So, a natural question then would be: what if we start off with a torsion knot? First of all, it's just interesting to study the order of satellite knots where your companion is torsion. It's not as well understood as when you start with an incident order knot. There would be implications for this question, and there's implications for construction of Yisui that I'm not going to get into now, but it's just generally an interesting question. Why do we not want the not-for-complex in this case? So, I sort of already mentioned. That I want the knot for complex, and I alluded to it being because I want to know something about the concordance, but I sort of lied. I lied to you. And now I'm coming clean. So when our knot is rationally sliced, and our pattern is unknown, meaning when I take the image of the unknot under my pattern, it's unknotted in plus three. My satellite is going to be rationally sliced. And if you know anything about concordance and variance, that makes you sad. And the reason for that is because a lot of And the reason for that is because a lot of the well-known concordance invariants, for example, tau, epsilon, are rational concordance invariants. So when I have a rational slice knot, they'll just vanish. And in fact, some smooth concordance invariants vanish for this not as well. The S variant epomology due to rasmiosin vanishes. The phii hemomorphism, converted to momorphisms due to Hong Kang part and estophogen also vanish. Or that might not be the right. Or that might not be the real proof of this. This is how I can park. Sophrogen showed us that we can use local equivalence class of the almost IO decay complex of a NOT2 obstructor. So I'm actually just getting the NOT4 complex so that I can get the IO decay complex. But that's not the point of this talk because that doesn't give me a nice picture. So you'll have to ask me about that later if you want to know more about that. Okay. So the answer to Y is a little bit convoluted, but we're going to compute the bordered invariance to compute it's not more complex, to compute it's involved. It's not more complex, to compute it's embodied, it's not more complex, to construct intrusion. And when I say compute the border of invariance, I very specifically am going to make this computation, and that's where this big tensor product comes from. You might notice I swapped out tensor symbols, but maybe don't worry about it if you're worried about it, you know. Now I'm doing the box tensor product. Is there any questions? Good. Let's construct this. How? So this is the So, this is the type-based structure associated to the complement of the figure eight. It's not totally complete, but you don't need to worry about that. And this is, it's small on purpose. It's just a really big bimodule. The writing is small on purpose. This is a type DG bimodule that was computed by Levine and it's associated to the complement of the major pattern and the solid torus. So, recall that I told y'all that these modules will split based on their eigencode and action. So, this is how they split. Action, so this is how they split. And for example, I'm just going to do one computation because we're going to have all day. But the image of A tensored with this bimodule, since A has non-zero iodine-0 action, I only need to look at things with non-zero iodina action and take the tensor product. And I get these connected components. And then once you continue through, you'll be able to concatenate everything all together. You'll be able to concatenate everything all together and get one big complex. So, the how is box sensor product? What? Oops, revisited. What do we do with this? So, you might notice in this diagram that there are several arrows that are bolded and that these don't have coefficient maps. And sort of morally what's going on here is this is a place where the type A structure and the type D structure of the boundaries that we were gluing on like match up perfectly. Like matched up perfectly. The coefficient maps come from the other boundary component of the type D D bind module, and they just sort of get carried along. And what this means is we can isolate our unlabeled edges and then homotopy them away because the invariant of these modules is just the homotopy equivalence class of them. So as long as I have something homotopy equivalent, I'm happy. And also, in particular, that will make it easier to translate back to non-floor homology. So I'm not going to write all of the translations. So I'm not going to write all of the change of bases, but what you do is you go through, you identify all of them, you perform change of bases that either just delete certain edges or insert new edges, and then you can't, well, I'm just going to show you where the connected components end up being. And some of them might seem like a little mysterious, like how could that connect there, but it just, you know, once you're deleting a lot of these edges, you just, you get new edges in. So these are what you end up with your connected components. With your connected components. And then here is this same diagram simplified. So this is a type D structure, but I've drawn the shapes sort of suggestively. I mean, in general, when you're doing this kind of computation and you're not keeping track of grading, there's no reason that you would draw them in these certain shapes. Everything can just be like a circle. It's just a diagram. And in fact, I'm ignoring grading throughout this whole computation because it's just not very helpful to keep track of. But I've drawn them in these shapes because. Um but I've drawn them in these shapes because when I convert it back to not floor homology, these are this is sort of the geometry of the model complex. And so in order to figure out where these shapes go in the plane, because again I have no grading information and so I don't necessarily know how anything is going to appear, how these acyclic complexes are going to appear in relationship to each other. So I just have to use what I know about how classical invariants behave under satelliting, including the Alexander polynomial. Including the Alexander polynomial and genus, and then I just have to decate orify the Alexander polynomial, and I can come up with two possible cases for what my nostalgic complex will look like. So here's one model. Yeah, that's all I need to talk about today. Oh, that's what I do. I actually had a bunch more slides because remix, and then I like did the involutive, but well, that's the whole point. Yeah, that the reason I did that was so that I could do involve. Maybe you're asking for ordering volume. Well, if you can do involutive computations, yeah, yeah, but yeah, so the whole point here. Yeah, but yeah, so the whole point here, and maybe I'll just jump back to it. So the point is that this not clear complex, like I said, all my concordance and variants vanish, and so maybe it's not so useful for detecting anything. But my IO decay, well, so involuntative, maybe do a little tangent, I have some extra time, invaluative hydrophilology gives you this invaluative map on your not for complex. It's a misnomer because it's not an involution on the nose, and in fact, where it fails to be an involution is Where it fails to be an evolution is where it's interesting for proofs like this. So when iota k squared is furthest from being the identity, we can get an element that we can say, you know, somehow looking at the tensor product of the iota k complex of the unnaught and looking at the any number of tensor products of the iot k complex of this, I'll never have a local map between them. So somehow, yeah, when it fails to be an evolution, I can detect, I can. Be an evolution I can detect, I can detect that structure for a game. So, for example, the involutive, not the floor. Or the involveative floor for a splice of, say, two brick. Yeah, yeah. I think, yeah, I was just gonna say that in the cases where you're IO decay, where everything banishes. Your iota K, where everything vanishes and IOTAK squared is still trivial. Irving's going to talk about that on Thursday, but you can pass to the order, you can pass to the double branch cover and do an idea argument. A local argument up there just to be involved on your influence. What do you mean by obstructing torsion? So, right, maybe I'll write it out. Not green, ever okay, turn. I think this is what. This is white. So you can show that there doesn't exist a local map F from, we'll call it Cu A of U, and that'll be A and K complex of the n-naught, to any number for any n of maybe this is naught. And the way that you abstract torsion is you show basically that no such local map will be. Basically, that no such local map can exist, and we know that if two naughts are important, then a local map has to exist. So, if such a map cannot exist for any n, then no number of linear combination of this not is going to be finite. Okay, so mazer pattern of figure eight is infinite larger. That's right, that's like the main range model. Yeah, and so not this, that answers that question earlier about. What was the relation to the What was the relation to the zeros concordant? Yeah, so the figurate knot and its major pattern, there are zero surgeries or homology coordinate relative to the radiant. So multi-comport isn't where the radians are in the same homology class, and then the two-not radians are in the same homology class. But it's not only not only are you non-concordant, but one's order two.  What is the piece in the middle? Wait, are we talking about the cube? Just the manifolds that you're. Oh, yeah. So I have a module that is just, so the CFA is the module assistant. Well, I'm going to be single pages. You have two. Are you talking about this? And you're using that, and you get the complement of the satellite. That's right. Yeah, so I have that's the complement of the pattern in the solid torus. The complement of the pattern in the solid torus. So I have two boundary components: one coming from the solid torus, the other completely coming from the pattern. I glue the boundary component corresponding to the pattern with the boundary component of my companion knot. And then the resultant. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Is it possible to calculate the Is it possible to calculate the complexes associated with iterated nascent patterns on the page? That's a really great question, and if you stay tuned, you'll see a paper on the archive from the inventory about that. Yeah, you can. I've done it for all of them, for this family, and I've done it for like several people. Very linearly? Well, it's going to be a little bit hard to show that. I'm going to have to do like all of these things, which is a mess. There's no obvious way to show it, but basically, what happens, and many of you can steal this, it's not on the archive yet. But what happens? What happens is you get some number of extra boxes, but all that happens to this complex is like it lengthens by one in each direction, and that has to do with the structure of the phi module. There's something sort of, if you are familiar with border phonology, there's no element of the algebra that looks like this in the phi module, but every time you have an extra edge in the type A structure, In the type A structure that looks like this. So you never have to concatenate these, is the point in the type A structure. So somehow, each time you iterate, you're not really increasing complexity all that much. You're just lengthening the edges by one, but then your iterate is not all that more complicated than your previous type-based structure. But if the if the edge is lengthened by one, it's a little similar to Am King marketing style. Yeah, I think it will be. It's dual, but yeah, it's similar. I mean, they show they're linearly independent, so we're gonna. That's right, yeah, that's right. Yeah, it's just the complex, but yeah. So the statement's supposed to be the Q to the K of 41 and Q to the L of 41 are not concordant? Yeah, so it would just be this argument, except that there's like some extra subtlety with it because they're all infinite water. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right. Yeah, that's right. That's right. Yeah, yeah. Thanks, Sally, again. I think there are any examples. That's a good list that are like speaking. Or you guys can be better for the money. Because if you went through the maser counter, you gotta wake your A, I really gotta answer. Yeah, yeah, I mean, that was like at least two hours. I don't know what I think I can jump in.   No, so there's still a lot of things. Four or five years ago, what happened in the last five years?
