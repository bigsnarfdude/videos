Thank you very much for the invitation to be here for this very nice workshop. So my title is a bit more ambitious than what I'm actually going to talk about today. But let me first fix a bit of notation. So I would denote by delta some arbitrary sequential complex on n vertices. S will be the polynomial ring over an arbitrary complex. ring over an arbitrary field k and variables and by k of delta I will denote the standard ring of this initial component. And my main goal and my main result is about matroids. And for this talk a matroid will be just a simplicial complex which is not empty, so there at least the empty set is there, and which satisfies this this extra axiom. This extra axiom. So, the linear independence in linear algebra. So, if you have two sets, two phases of the citricial complex, and one has less elements than the other, then you can always augment this smaller phase with an element with a vertex from the larger face. Of course, there are a lot of ways to do given the There are a lot of ways to do give a definition of a maintraid. There are a lot of equivalent characterizations. I think this is maybe easier to remember based on linear algebra. Okay, so my goal in this talk will be to describe the first cotangent module for the steady Reesner ring of Minitro. So I will denote this just by T1 of them instead of T1 of Q. Instead of one of the kill you have. So before I jump right into this, let me give you a bit of motivation. So essentially, I'm interested in T1 because there's a set bijection between T1 and the first order deformation of the affine scheme defined by this ring up to isomorphism. So don't worry. Don't worry too much about this if you haven't seen this correspondence before, but essentially a first-order deformation is a perturbation of the equations of this fine scheme, let's say, so of the generators of this ideal with some parameter epsilon, where epsilon comes from this ring of dual numbers. So epsilon squared is these are the first order deformations. These are the first-order deformations, the tiniest deformations you can imagine. So, and such that, of course, the final over the closed point is the standard Reisner idea that we started with. So, this is the idea that this is the motivation for looking at T1. So, okay, let me say a bit more about what T1 is. So, let's take another hop definition here. Take another hop definition here. We can think of T1 as the co-kernel of this map. So essentially, you have to compute this module here, comes from I2 into the semi-Reisner ring, and model out the derivations, the k-derivations of S. And the point is that, of course, the Stanley-Riesner ideal is multigraded because it's generated by a polynomial ideal. idea. So this means that also this home module is multi-graded. This is also multi-graded. The kernel will also be multi-graded. Thus T1 is a multi-graded, so Z to the n-graded module. And I will denote its components like this. And I will split the multi-degrees of this integer vector, which has both positive and negative entries, into a positive part minus a negative part and Negative part, and to do it in this to have a canonical way of doing this, you need to ask that that supports artist job. So for those of you who were here yesterday, you maybe have seen these two results of Altmat and Christophersen yesterday, so I won't spend too much time on it. So essentially, Altmat and Christophersen give And Christopherson gave a combinatorial slash topological method to compute these vector spaces, so these multi-graded components. And I will mention two of their results here. The first one is that unless these conditions start here are satisfied, T1 vanishes in that model. So, and the conditions are that the positive part is supported at a phase. Is supported at a phase. The negative part is a 0, 1 vector which is, let's say, supported on the vertices of which appear in the link of the positive part. So it doesn't have to be a face in the link, but only vertices from the link have to appear there. And given that it will be a 0, 1 factor, from now on, I will abuse this notation and either write B for And either write B for the vector or for its support, so for the cell. Okay, so this is the first remark that you can restrict to this Fermi Master's situation. And the second part that I would need to do is that if these conditions are fulfilled, then the multi-graded component in degree A minus B is isomorphic. Is isomorphic to the multi-degree graded component degree minus the minus B of the link of the support. So you can somehow always localize. And if you want to have general statements, then it's always convenient to just look in purely negative multi-degrees. So remember that my goal is to say something about you aren't for gate, right? You are for matroid. And the good news is that whenever you have a matroid, the link of every phase is also a matrix. So, this in particular, this method is well suited for, let's say, classes of simplicial complexes where all the links are from the same class. Another example would be triangulations of spheres, for instance. You can always do things like that. But we will look at matrix today. Okay, so here. Okay, so here on this side will be our first year and let me just I will leave this up here just just to make it easier to remember. And I will also fix some notation which is not standard for arbitrary simplicial complexes. But even if when delta is not a matroid, I will still denote a set of facets of delta by d of sub delta. By B of sub delta of the basis, and the set of minimal non-faces by C of delta, by the circuits of a nature. And here is our first theorem. So I obtained this theorem with William who was a master's student in Berlin at the time. So it has two parts. And essentially, it gives upper bounds for the dimension of this vector space for arbitrary simulations. Space for arbitrary simplicial complex. So I have an arbitrary simplicial complex. Again, because of alpha and equipers and it's enough to consider the 0, 1 factor and also to look in, given that this is for really every central complex, it's enough to look at T1 in purely negative degree that so there are two situations. There are two situations. The first one, when B is a phase of the complex, then the dimension of T1 in degree minus B is the minimum between these two numbers. It's smaller or equal than the minimum between these two numbers. The first one is the number of non-faces in the link of V which are not non-faces in the deletion of V. And the second one. And the second one is somehow the opposite. So it's the number of facets in the division which are not facets of the link. But it's something that you could, let's say, even in a bit larger examples, you could compute by hand just by looking at the R number of basis of those two things, even different cardinalities because you're not taking away anything. Sorry? The basis in the deletion, if you have something that is not trivial, If you have something that is not trivial, a frank R or have one dimension and the basis of the league, or smaller the basis of the wait, okay, so let me give you this example maybe. So let's take the one-dimensional simplicial complex like this. Let's take B to be this vertex, then you have the deletion. So delta minus B is this. So it has two edges as B. So it has two edges as bases, and the link is this. So this dimension, you just remove this, but you get the edges. And the link is the three vertices. So in this case, there's no intersection. They don't have to be contained. But sometimes they I think that it's true that usually you don't need to take all of this, but I think there are some extremal cases at least where you need this. But we'll see that actually for actually this is, I think this is really in some extremal cases. The important part of this bound is this, the counting of non-phases here. Because for matroids, we'll see that you can really ignore this part and just look at Can really ignore this part and just look at this and even phrase it a bit enough. Okay, but there is an upper bound for the dimension of B. One for arbitrary syntaxial complexes in terms of circuits and bases, let's say, of facets and not and when B is not a phase, then this is a fairly easy situation to see what happens. So essentially T1 can be at most one dimensional and only in some very special case. So if In some very special case. So if the cardinality V of V is greater than 1, and delta is the joint of the division of B with the boundary of V. So somehow this B has to, if it's a non-phase, it has to be a minimal non-phase disjoint from all the other minimal non-phase. This is the only situation when you can get T1 for a non-phase. Okay, so this. Okay, so this is our first result is an upper bound in general on this dimension. Let me make one remark. I've hidden some things also yesterday in that description with relative hormology. So if I denote this number here by a big blue n like this, and if the cardinality of v is one, then you can actually subtract one from this upper bound. One from this upper bound. So you get a slightly better upper bound whenever this m is not zero, obviously. If it's zero, you don't get minus one. So this is a small remark, but which will be relevant in the next slide. And before I state my main result, let me just phrase the idea of the main result here. So the idea is that this bound holds for every simplicial content. Every simplicial context. But if delta is a matrix, then this bound is either reached or the multi-graded component is zero. And not only does this happen for matrix, it's a characterization of matrix. So these upper bounds are reached or zero if and only if the central complex is a matrix, which I will make a bit more precise on my next slide. But before I say, But before I say that the main theorem, let me introduce two more pieces of notation. So first of all, whenever I have a 01 vector, which I think of as a subset of n actually, and I call it cycle atomic for delta, and I did mean that if and only if b is If and only if B is either disjoint to or contained in a circuit. So for every circuit, B has to be either contained in that or completely disjoint. So this is this is a think of vertices for it. So if B is a vertex, it always satisfies this property. It's either in a cycle or it's... And then for every B, I will also denote by C. I will also denote by C delta of B the cycles in delta which contain B. So the non-faces containing B. And okay, here is our main theorem. So it says that whenever I have a simplicial complex on n, I have three equivalent statements. The first one is that delta is a matroid. The second one is that The second one is that the dimension of P1 in the degree minus EI, where EI is the canonical vector, so 001000. The dimension of these multi-graded components has to be the number of cycles containing i minus one. So the cycle structure. And in order to include a situation when i is also a colu, I have to take this maximum here because if it's a colu, This maximum here because if it's a co-loop, then there are no cycles through i, and then this number would be minus. So, this is it. In order to check if something simplificial complex is a metric, you have to look at the dimension of q1, either in n separate multi-degrees like this, or you could just look at q1 in the global degree minus one. This would also, and you compare that with some number. Compare that with some numbers of site, like number that you compute by looking at the side. So, this is, let's say, this is the condition which makes it easy to check if something is a matrix. But if this happens, then you can tell what the dimensions of all the other multi-gradient components are. So, for every A and B in N to D N is joint as we had them before, then we can say what the dimension of the multi-graded piece of T1. Multi-graded piece of Q1 is for delta. So it's either zero if star is not satisfied, star was this condition of alpha in this one version, or if B is not cycled at all. So if there's a cycle which contains only parts of B, then T1 is 0. If B has cardinality 1, then it's this number here that we saw from part 2. We saw from part two. And otherwise, it's just the number of cycles which the number of cycles in the link of the support of A which fully contain B. So you just have to count cycles containing the support of your negative part of the multiple degree. So this is the main theory. It's actually the equivalent factor. It's the equivalent characterization of military in terms of T1 and gives also a full characterization of T1 in terms of the cycles of the breeds. How much time do I have? Five more. Okay, I can finish with my show you one more theorem. So there's this notion of algebraic There's this notion of algebraic rigidity, which was introduced by not sure it was introduced by them, but it was studied for synchronial complexes by Atman B. Herzog and you in a paper where they tried to find classes of syncritial complexes for which T1 vanishes. And they find some nice families, especially families of edge ideals where this happens. But it seems to be a hard problem in general to establish where it's. Establish a con well, let's say, especially to characterize when T1 vanishes. So, which simplicial complexes are algebraically relieved, which means there are actually really no deformations of the fines. But it turns out that for matroids, this is really easy. And the class of matroids for which T1 vanishes, which are algebraically rigid, is very small and very insignificant. Very small and very insignificant. So, delta consists only of loops and co-loops if t1 vanishes, which means you have essentially a synflex and then some loops, so vertices which are not there. This is it. This is if and only if for algebraic rigidity when delta is a matrix. And the second part, which is also again something specific for matroids, is that as soon as T1 is not zero, then Then you can, let's say you have no idea how your matrix looks like, but you have a full description of T1. Then you can fully recover T1, just, you can fully recover the matrix from T1. So you can say that something is an independent set if and only if some multi-graded piece of T1 is not red. And in particular, two matrix which are not isomorphic have also not isomorphic have also different q1. And this is something that that does not happen for arbitrary simple complexes. So in general you cannot you can say some things but you cannot say a lot about the simple combinatorics of the simplicial complex just by looking at the but for matrix you can do okay so so I heard in a podcast that people judge the experience of People judge the experience of a presentation by the last ending. So, my last slide would be
