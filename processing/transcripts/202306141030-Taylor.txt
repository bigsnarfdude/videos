 Okay, welcome back for day three of the meeting. And for the first talk, we're happy to have Scott Taylor from Colby College, and he's going to tell us about spatial graphs and rich number of satellite knots. Okay, great. Well, thank you to the organizers for inviting me. And to those of you who are here in Oaxaca in person, it's great to eat with you and see Oaxaca together. And thanks to those of you online for joining us. So I'd like to tell you about. So, I'd like to tell you about an ongoing project with Maggie Tomova at the University of Central Florida. And in some sense, I'm going to tell this story in the reverse direction from how it actually happened. But, oops. There we go. There we go. So, I want to start with some classical constructions. First, I'll just remind you of some terminology. Just remind you of some terminology. So, a satellite knot, I'll call it T in a three-manifold, is a knot that's contained in a solid torus. And we require that the boundary of that solid torus, which is called the companion torus, the boundary of the solid torus has to be incompressible in the exterior of T, and T is called the satellite knot. T and T is called the satellite knot. If we look at a longitude of the Taurus, that's called a companion for the satellite knot. A satellite knot can have many companions, but when we are thinking of a particular companion, Taurus, we can talk about the wrapping number, and that's just the minimal number of times that T intersects a meridinal disk for the solid torus. The solid torus. There's a very particular case of this construction, which is when the wrapping number is equal to one. And that happens exactly when our knot is a composite knot. So wrapping number one means that there's this redinal disk that intersects the knot exactly once. And if you compress along that disk, And if you compress along that disk, you get an essential twice-punctured sphere that separates some factors of the knot. There's an invariant that has turned out to be very important. In some sense, it's kind of the knot theoretic version of a Hagard splitting for three manifolds, or the invariant is the analog of Hagard genus, and the surfaces involved are. And the surfaces involved are versions of Hagar splittings. Oops, what happened? There we go. Sorry. I went out of presentation mode. So the bridge number of a knot in the three-sphere is just the minimal number of maxima that you need when you're thinking about height functions for the knot. Functions for the not. There's another definition that there's another definition of bridge number that's useful. And am I pushing the wrong button? Am I pushing the wrong button? Oh, is it? Oh, I see. Okay. Oh, okay. So maybe I'll just point with my hand. So if you look at a Um, if you look at a so our knot's in the three-sphere, and if you look at a sphere that separates the minima from the maxima, that sphere divides our knot into two trivial tangles. And so you can also think about building the knot by starting with a trivial tangle. That's a tangle where the arcs are isotopic into the boundary. We start with two of those, can have however many bridge arcs in there that we want, and we glue them together to get our knob. them together to get our naught in the three sphere. And then the bridge number is actually just the minimum of half the number of punctures where we minimize over all possible spheres dividing our knot into these into trivial tangles. And I put a zero here because that's the genus of the sphere. So this definition goes back to The definition of bridge number, I think, goes back to Schubert in the 1950s. Yeah, great. The definition of bridge number goes back to shoot. The definition of bridge number goes back to Schubert in the 1950s, and Schubert proved two really great theorems about this. The first one says that bridge number is minus one additive. So if you look at the quantity bridge number minus one, that's an additive invariant for the knots. And the second one is that if we have a satellite knot, then the bridge number of a satellite knot is at least the wrapping number times the bridge number of the companion. And Jennifer has. And Jennifer has a really nice proof of this, of both these facts from 2003, papers from 2003. I want to take a closer look and see why you might actually expect to have theorems like this. And at the very end of the talk, I will get to new results. But I'm eager to share a new perspective that we came across as we were thinking about this. So for the additivity of bridge number, For the additivity of bridge number, one inequality you can get by basically just stacking your knots. So you put each knot in bridge position, and then you just join a minimum of one of the knots to a maximum of the other knot. And then if you are thinking in terms of maxima, you can see that the bridge number of the connect sum is at least the sum of the bridge numbers minus one. But even just looking at this structure, But even just looking at this structure, what you can see is that you have this essential surface, this twice-functured sphere, separating the factors of your knot, each of which has its own bridge surface. And that's an example of thick and thin surfaces that show up in the theory of thin position. On the other hand, if you're thinking about bridge number of satellite knots, you might start by putting your companion torus. By putting your companion torus into some sort of bridge position, and then, like, inside that, you might put your satellite knot into bridge position with respect to this Taurus. If you think about it, that actually not the right way to do this. You won't get the inequality you want. But on the other hand, you can kind of see that maybe there's some way of relating maxima of the satellite knot to maxima. knot to maxima of the companion knot. And the ideal situation is where you actually just have, you know, like a cable knot and you just have these strands passing right through here. But there might be some handles where you have complicated things going on. But if you had a cable knot and if it was arranged this way, you might see that you might expect the bridge number of the cable knot to actually equal the wrapping number times the bridge number of the companion because each maximum for the companion Maximum for the companion gives you a wrapping numbers worth of maximum for the original knot. Well, if you're trying to prove this, what you would want to do is take your satellite knot and put it into bridge position. So minimize the number of bridges and the tangles that you're dividing it into. And then you somehow want to arrange the torus so that the torus. That the torus is intersecting the bridge sphere in disjoint disks. And if you can somehow arrange your torus so that it looks like this, then you'll, if you think about it for a little bit, you'll get the inequality, you'll get Schubert's inequality. And this is basically how both Schubert and Jennifer approach the problem. And Jennifer explained to me how Schubert does this. And it's sort of a very long, complicated process of arranging the torus. Of arranging the torus. And then Jennifer analyzes a foliation on the torus, and it's a much simpler method to end up at the same result where your torus looks like this. I mean, as you start to think about this, though, like you can see that there's going to be a challenge because like your torus might not look like this when your knot is in, when your satellite notes in minimal bridge position. The torus might crash through all kinds of ways. You might have to sort of Kinds of ways you might have the sort of annuli coming back through themselves some number of times, you might even have like little disc bubbles up here, and so you need some way of dealing with it, it seems. Well, it actually turns out, and so as Megan and I were thinking about this, it occurred to us that actually you don't need to control the entire torus. It actually turns out that it's enough to find just a single handle. Just a single handle, a single annulus. We'll call it a crushable annulus. And what we need is that sort of there's this disc here that you don't have more of your torus passing through. You might have some bits of torus in here, but they have to actually just be annuli that kind of come back on themselves like this. Turns out that if you can find Turns out that if you can find a single handle like this, then that's actually enough to get Schubert's inequality. And so let me back up and say something about why that could possibly be the case. Why do you just need to arrange it so that your torus has just a single one of these rather than the entire torus being like that? And the technique is basically thin position. So very long story here. Very long story here. Um, the work of Kabai and Sherlman Thompson, and uh, we were particularly influenced by a work of Hayashi Shimakawa. Um, and Ken explained the idea of thin position for uh Hagard splittings yesterday, and it's the same basic idea here, but with bridge surfaces. And so, the idea is that you are going to try to use compressing disks, or in our case, more generalized versions of. More general generalized versions of compressing disks to try and push like maxima down and minima up. And when you do that, you create the thick and thin surfaces. So the thick surfaces are a lot like bridge surfaces, and the thin surfaces are hopefully incompressible surfaces. And some time ago, Maggie and I actually managed to show that there is a method. Show that there is a method, a way of doing thin position, which is not, which is different from what these folks are doing. But there is a way of thinning so that at the end of the process, your collection of thin surfaces contains twice punctured spheres giving a prime decomposition of your knot. It might be empty if your knot was prime, but if your knot's composite, there is a collection of thin surfaces that will do this. That will do this. So, classical ways of thinning won't do this necessarily, but our method of thinning will. Furthermore, this actually works in basically all three manifolds. It works not just for knots and links, but also for spatial graphs. And the key thing is that you can actually use thin position to see that your knot is composite. Okay, well, satellite knots don't need to be composite. Composite. Oh, yeah, right. So I wanted to say something about. So we introduced this invariant, which is related to other invariants out there. But basically, it's you look at the number of times your knot intersects the thick surfaces, subtract the number of times it intersects the thin surfaces, and then you also look at the Euler characteristics of the thick and thin surfaces. Then surfaces. So if you're interested in bridge number, those surfaces are all spheres. This part here is not so interesting. And it actually turns out that for knots in the three sphere, when you minimize this quantity, you actually do just get bridge number minus one. And so this perspective actually leads to a new proof that bridge number minus one is additive. Is additive. Basically, if you just kind of keep track of all your characteristics and like the net number of punctures, number of punctures on thick surfaces minus thin surfaces, it'll eventually work out with some careful arithmetic. Okay, well, what about satellite knots? So, the idea is that if you can arrange your satellite knot in a minimal bridge position and And simultaneously arrange your companion torus so that in one spot it looks like what you're hoping the entire thing looks like. You go through and actually you just get rid of your knot that was in that handle and you replace it with a spatial graph. And you give the edge here the weight, a weight. The weight, a weight that's equal to the wrapping number. Now, I mean, you kind of ruin your knot when you do this, right? But you can actually show that if you keep track of weights, the wrapping number of this new spatial graph is omega. It's like a weighted wrapping number, which was what it was for the original. And this graph is actually still. This graph is actually still in bridge position. But now your torus is what we call cut compressible. And so you compress it, and now you've suddenly turned your companion torus into a summing sphere. And you can actually see that the See that the part of this edge that lives outside the summing sphere is actually basically the companion knot. So to get the companion knot, you actually have to take this arc and then join it up by something living on that sphere. And so if you now apply this other, this like thin position machinery, but for these weighted spatial graphs. These weighted spatial graphs, you end up with a picture like this, where you'll have a summing sphere that more or less is equal to the compressed version of your companion torus. You'll have this arc that was outside the that corresponded to the companion torus, and that'll be in bridge position on one side. Be in bridge position on one side, and it has weight omega. And then on the other side, you have some kind of mess, but it's in bridge position. These little bits here, well, first of all, they may not go straight from vertices to the summing sphere. They might actually crash through other thick and thin surfaces. But these bits have weight omega, and then all the other edges have weight one. Weight one, and it turns out you kind of to get the arithmetic to work out right, you have to make the quantity you're keeping track of a little more complicated. But basically, it's like the thing you can look at is like omega times the net OER characteristic. So that's like the negative Eureo characteristics of the thick surfaces minus the thin surfaces, and then the net weight, where now instead of just counting punctures, we keep track of the weights as well, but we take the weights on the thick. As well, but we take the weights on the thick minus the weights on the thin. This quantity does not change under thinning. And that's actually kind of like, I haven't told you exactly how to do the thinning, but it's actually ridiculously easy to prove. Like it's just like a sentence. And so the idea is you started with the original satellite thing, and you found one crushable handle, you crush it, whatever was in the Crush it, whatever was in there, you crushed down to this single edge of weight omega. You now run the thin position machinery, and you get this. And this thing is actually additive. And so if you're a little careful, what you kind of end up seeing is that this quantity for the new graph, I actually have a typo here. That should be a minus, like minus omega there, but. Like minus omega, there, but the arithmetic is unpleasant, so I'm not going to go through it. And so it doesn't really matter if my slides are slightly wrong, but the paper will be right. So you look at the crushed version here. The thin position machinery actually then breaks this up into the piece for the companion. The additivity result breaks this up into the piece for the companion knot, plus this other mess. For the companion knot, For the companion knot, you just have this one edge that has weight omega. So this is basically equal to omega times the bridge number of that knot. And then there's this factor coming from the Eureo characteristics of the spheres in this case. Right, there was that divide by two in the formula I gave you. That's why this is a minus one instead of a minus two. One instead of the minus two, but I also forgot the omega there. Anyway, like that will cancel with this, whatever the right number is. So you have your result as long as this quantity that you're looking at for this lower part is non-negative. And at one point, I just thought that would work, but it's actually not super easy. It's not terribly hard, but it does turn out that this is positive. out that this is positive. And so the philosophy is that you can use spatial graphs to turn questions about satellite knots into questions about composite spatial graphs. And then if you have additivity for a connected sum, you can turn that back into inequalities for the satellite knot. So, in the context where everything was spheres and you're just working the classical setting, this actually, subject to some of the machinery, it actually gives a pretty short proof of Schubert's inequality for bridge number. So, we've been interested in the question of: can we get a Schuber inequality for For a higher genus bridge number. And you might worry because there are known counterexamples. So there are 1-1 knots. So these are knots that have a bridge position with respect to not a sphere, but a Hagar torus. And you have a single bridge on either side. And so there are 1-1 knots that are satellite. And if you had Schubert's inequality, Inequality. Well, this contradicts Schubert's inequality. And it turns out that actually that's actually the only problem. So the theorem that we're able to show is that if you have a three-manifold that's either S3 or a lens space, then either you Then either you get Schubert's inequality. So this is the wrapping, the, you know, the traditional wrapping number. And so your genus one bridge number of your satellite knot is at least the wrapping number times the genus one bridge number of your companion. Or you have this other case where the companion is actually a torus knot, which is what it is in Hayashi's examples. And it was actually known before that if you have a satellite 1-1 knot, then Hayashi's construction is basically the only construction that produces 1-1 satellite knots. And so, like, one way of looking at our work is that actually, that's also the only obstruction to proving a Schubert inequality for. Inequality for higher bridge number knots with respect to a genus one surface. So I will stop there and happy to take questions. So what happens if you consider a genus II surface, the complement of the note instead of the compressible torus? Yeah, so I've thought a lot about this. I think there's hope. This, I think there's hope. Like, I think you may be able to get a Schubert-style thing for like genus two companions. The problem is actually in finding the crushable handle. So, in the genus one case, we have to do a lot of work to actually produce even a single crushable handle. And there are various parts in that work where, if you had a genus II surface or even Had a genus two surface, or even worse, a higher genus surface. That it's a little questionable if it would work out. I think it might. And so that's one of the things I hope we can explore. But yeah, the business about the crushable handle. Like if you can find a crushable handle, it'll work fine. And that'll work. Oh, actually, wait, wait, sorry. Actually, wait, wait, sorry. For higher genus bridge surfaces, a crushable handle will work fine. For highest gene, for higher genus companions, you would probably need more crushable handles because you have to get back, you have to be able to get down to summing spheres. So if you just had a single crushable handle for a genus 2 companion, you could end up with a twice-punctured torus, or you could end up with two once-punctured tori. And the, you're not necessarily, I don't think there's any guarantee those things can show up as thin levels. So you would need to find more crushable handles to crush those down. And I think that may be hard. Probably is very hard, but maybe doable. So can you give us something? Sure. Yeah. So that's actually so that's been published. Actually, so that's been published. Um, and it's um the idea is to um thin using uh both uh compressing disks for a thick level, but also um cut compressing disks for some, uh, which are more or less the same thing as like orbifold compressing discs. So, compressing disks that intersect the knot a single time, and then um, you also you will. Um, you also allow this to actually um it like I think if you just are thinking about like pushing maximum down and pushing minimum up, your thin and thick levels are all going to be concentric spheres. But if you work with the disks, you can actually end up with non-concentric spheres, giving you kind of like a tree structure, kind of like the fork complexes in Hagar splitting theory. Um, Hagard splitting theory, and so there it basically comes down to like two differences. One is the fact that you have a tree structure, and the second is that when you use these cut compressing discs, you can end up with bits of your knot that are cores of one handles running through things. And that's why, like, the when I needed that one. When I needed that one factor to be non-negative, that's why it's not obvious because you end up with arcs that have endpoints on only on thin surfaces and don't intersect thick surfaces. So it ends up being kind of technical, but one of the things we were able to prove a while ago, which has been published, is that if you slightly modify the The what people now call goodbye width. If you to use sort of our thin position kind of structures, the new version of width is actually additive under connected sum, whereas Blair and Tomova showed that Gabai width is not additive under connected sum. So it's a slight different perspective. It's a little more thinking in terms of Haguard splitting structure, like generalized Haguard splittings, rather than. Like generalized Hagar splittings rather than in terms of maximum and minimum. Any other questions from the online? Okay, so if not, let's thank Scott again for a great talk. Got again for a great talk.
