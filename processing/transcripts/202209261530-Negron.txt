About um finite generation results for bi-dimensional hop algebra. Go ahead, Chris. All right, uh, thank you so much for having me. I've been flying around and stuff, so I couldn't quite make it there. Hopefully, I'll be able to see some more talks in the next couple of days. So, yeah, as it says, I want to talk about some font generation results for fine-time off-algebras. I have something 20 minutes or something. So I'm not going to try to do anything too crazy here. I just want to talk about what's going on and maybe look at an example in some detail if I can do that. And even though I don't have much time, I'm happy to be interrupted by whatever questions people might have. Okay, so if I understood correctly, we haven't had a talk about this. Understood correctly, we haven't had a talk about this particular topic. So let me just give you a little background. So what is this? Now I'm going to write finite generation conjecture for the third time. I don't know why I would do that, but so this is formally by adding off an austeric as dated by Dated by them. I think this was really made possible by Friedland and Susslin, where they ask this as a question in their paper, or they say, they assert that they don't know. They say, I don't know what the answer to this question is. But the statement is that, you know, that for any. So, for any finite dimensional Hof algebra, and my field is whatever you want to be, maybe you can make it algebraically close if maybe that's more safe. Doesn't seem to matter too much. And some A rep B, I always mean finite dimensional. The extension algebra. The extension algebra look at the self-extensions of B let's take the graded one is a finitely generated algebra over K also for any other W If I take extensions from V to W is a finally generated module over this algebra. Okay, so you might see this in some other settings stated where I look at like the tensor unit. The tensor unit, so the base field, and I do something with that. This is a version which you can write for any algebra, any kind of representation category. So let me just make a remark. I have the trivial wrap K and finite control. Central alpha map. So I can think about this kind of just the special representation, which is the unit object in this tensor category. Okay, so in this instance, so when I satisfy this, I'll say, I'll say rep A or A itself has a finely generated cohomology. Okay, so obviously this is a conjecture for some reason, so let me just give you some background. So this conjecture is based on some classical, not really classical. Not really classical results. So this, okay. I can't really tell if there's a question or not. So if I'm going over somebody's trying to ask a question, I'm kind of steamrolling you, just assert yourself, you know. So, okay, a theorem by Friedlander and Susslin. From 1997, so they say that for any finite group scheme, so I'll say okay. So for any finite group scheme G G. So you might think about this as just anybody, any Hof algebra, which is co-commutative. Finite dimensional and co-commutative. A REPG, the same thing as modules over the group ring, has finally generated cohomology. And another, so that's like kind of a, that's really classical in the sense that these are giving you a symmetric tensor category. I consider kind of this dichotomy between symmetric tensor categories and non-trivially graded tensor categories as being classical versus quantum. But then you also have a quantum result, which is Ginsburg and Kumar 93, which says that for Just says that for the small quantum group, and I don't expect that people know what this means. So this is a fine-dimensional Hof algebra over the complex numbers. So this is this is sorry, I should have said this is finite characteristic. Here, this is finite characteristic. So, this is some fine-dimensional half-algebra with complex numbers, which I'm associating to a simple Lie algebra, SLN or something, and some choice of a root of unity. This is quite a popular individual. This has finally generated cohomology. And just an example for the type of, so okay, whatever. So Whatever. So, in this class of finite group schemes, would you have in particular finite groups? So, you have kind of all of kind of representation theory of finite groups and finite characteristic. Of course, you want the characteristic of the field to divide the order of the group in order to get some interesting cohomology coming out. But this is a massive class of fine-time Hof algebras, a massive class of what you have. A massive classical do you have some kind of theory to understand deeply. And they use a lot of theory, they use kind of polynomial functors in order to understand this. This is just one person here. There's an interesting side note, which given my abundance of time, I'll just indulge myself in going on the side note. It's much harder to have a non-semi-simple finite-dimensional Hoffa over the complex numbers than it is to have such a Complex numbers than it is to have such a thing in finite characteristic. This is why, in this kind of setting, I only have one example in character zero versus a whole plethora of examples in finite characteristic. So though this does not look like an ample amount of information about character zero, it's like a huge slice of the kind of things that we're gonna, that we can even look at. A pretty substantial slice of the kind of things we're gonna look at in CarSU zero. In Carr zero. Okay. Let me close the door real quick. Okay. Okay, so since the 90s, we've seen kind of actually, first of all, let me just take a second here. I'm going to sip the tea, see if anybody. Maybe I'll do an example, okay? Maybe I'll do an example, okay? Or just say the type of rings that you get out. So, for example, for SLN, I also have the Lie algebra SLN. And a finite characteristic, there's characteristic P, I have the SL in one, which is sitting inside of SLN. So this is. And so this is maybe I should include my coefficients here. Let's go FP bar, p bar, p bar. So I have a certain finite group scheme that is sitting at the identity, so it's non-reduced and finite. And if I look at the self-extensions of the unit, Of the unit p bar one uh I guess fp bar fp bar. So this is going to be functions on the nil potent cone. So n equals add nil potent cone inside of SL N F P R. And I won't, if I look at the corresponding quantum group, it has the look at the corresponding quantum group it has the um for sln and character characteristic zero it has the same uh it has the same coordinate uh uh self-extensions so not only do you have this finite generation in these examples you actually have you can kind of describe cohomology at least in the cases in which you understand and it should be if you give me something lead theoretic the cohomology is something lead theoretic which i'm which i'm getting out um so it's not just some kind of goofy ring you're getting out you expect Goofy ring you're getting out, you expect to get something out which actually reflects something about what you put in, which is not the case if I look at like, say, Hopshock homology of some fine-dimensional algebra. Usually I just get out, goop, get out nothing. I get out something, but okay. So since the 90s, we've seen something. You've seen quite a few more examples. Okay. Okay, so I guess I have like eight-ish minutes. So you have 30 minutes. Oh, I have the full 30 minutes? Yeah. Well, I thought I had like 20. Okay, I thought 20 minutes. Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you. But if you want questions, maybe like 25 questions. Yeah, that sounds like the reasonable, reasonable thing. For reasonable, reasonable thing. Okay, so I'll just go over some results that we have by all sorts of people. Stefan. So I have myself here. So I won't necessarily feature prominently. I don't know why I wrote my full name. Okay. Skibich, actually, Angiano, Pefsova, Weatherspin. There's another paper with a MASNAC. Okay, so the point is just that there's all sorts of people who've been looking at this. And so the conclusion is that if you give me a Hof algebra, I understand Hof algebra, fine-dimensional one. I understand, I can check this fine generation property. I can check and verify. This finite generation property for cohomology. So some the most interesting ones were this results of this kind of collective. There's two papers here. I think for the any pointed Hof algebra with abelian group of group-likes, that I can check this. There is continuums worth of such. Continuums worth of such kinds of Hop algebras, breaking down into vast classes. So, this work is the Kerasik zero result, which is on the scale of this Frielander-Susslin result. This is an extremely kind of robust thing. This is basically every single hop algebra in character zero, which I have any understanding of. And Stefan and Vi have a Fon and Vi have a result which is quite interesting because it leaves the abelian setting where I look at pointed Hof algebras with non-abelian group group likes. That's the only result that I know in that regard. And these results of myself and Eric have to do with taking Driftled doubles of some kind of quantum style Hof algebras. So Driftle doubles of finite group schemes. So we have quite a bit, we've gone someplace since then. We've gone someplace since then. Okay. So I assume that there are none, but let me just stop for a second to see if there are any questions. Okay. Sounds good. So the question which is in my mind, so you know, I don't have any kind of amazing theorems. Amazing theorem to tell you. A question is in my mind, which is, you know, why? And I won't really answer this question at all, but I want to think more deeply about a particular example. So why am I going to have this kind of finish generation of cohomology? What does this even mean? And how might I, maybe I can think about this in like a different way. How might I maybe I can think about this in like a different way? So let me just go back to a particular example just to see what we can get. And I'll write down a conjecture, which maybe we can think about. So let's take a TQ. Q is let's take L3 to one. Let's take L3 to one and the complex numbers. So this is the tapped algebra. So TQ is just C G X G to the L minus 1 X to the L equals 0 and G G X minus Q X G. Okay? G. Okay. And let's take a q to be tq. Let's just take this in times. Okay. So this is a nice Hof algebra where X is G primitive, G is group-like. So delta of V is GG, delta of X is X times 1 plus G times X, or G, G times X. Okay. Okay, so a corollary to okay, so what's cohomology in this case? Let's see, see, this is just going to be a polynomial ring, calcium's functions on affine space. Generators in degree too. Okay, just a symmetric algebra. y1 maybe to y yeah so each one of these factors of the taft algebra gives me one one factor of this thing here so corollary to results of bezerkup and kauf and ginsberg a general result of theirs from 2007 you can kind of extract this out of here so the first Here. So the first point is that this Cohen algebra ring is formal. So in fact, OAN is isomorphic to derived endomorphisms in Q star. Okay, so that's the first point. The second point is that this formality exists kind of externally. It can kind of externalize this formality. So there exists a fully faithful triangular embedding from quasi-coherent sheaves on AN into the output DG sheaves into some kind of just the derived category. I'm putting the DG there because it exists. DG there because it exists at like a DG level, not just at the level of triangulated categories, AQ. So let's just call this form. So if I think about this, why is this a kind of externalization or lifting of this kind of formality result? Well, it's because the endomorphisms of the unit here are going to go, oh, which I should say, which sends. O A N maps to the triple representation. So I'm going to take the endomorphisms of this isomorphically onto the endomorphisms of C in the derived category. If I'm at some VG level, that's the derived endomorphisms. But not only do I have that, I have, in fact, this embedding of this category of sheaves. Of sheaves. Okay. So, and okay. So, a conjecture which one can try to think about. So, in fact, this formality of functors is functor is, I'll say, central hand. I'm not so sure about this central property, but it should be in fact monoidal. And so that DGGAQ, so this should become a sheaf of tensor categories. Categories over affine space. So you might have seen this like sheaves of categories, sheaves of tensor categories. It's not actually that deep what you're talking about when you say these words. All I'm saying is that all I'm pointing out is that, why does this keep happening? All I'm pointing out here is that I have an action of An action of quasi-coherent sheaves on this onto this facilitated by this monoidal embedding. The interesting thing is that now that I have this, I can take, I can kind of base change my category. And so that's where the kind of sheafy structure, the kind of local structure comes in. And the, you can think about the, so the, so the, um, so, so kind of, uh So you have in this case the opportunity to think about dualizability conditions conditions for this sheaf of categories. This sheaf of categories. And what I'm talking about is in reference to Urshad Jordan Snyder Jordan Safranoff Snyder. Um, okay, so So, the main conjecture in this case is that this kind of geometry that's coming out from the finite generation conjecture has something to do, can you kind of externalize in terms of this functor? And I expect this functor to actually be a kind of a monoidal functor. And this conjecture prime is that a general version of this holds in general, or there is a general version of this. There is a general version of this. Oh, a general version of this claim holds as well. Okay, so a nice thing about this particular example is that you can just kind of check it directly. Let me just kind of leave that as my kind of main point is that you should. Is that you should, in fact, have this kind of monodal functor, which is kind of externalizing some of these kinds of geometric perspectives that you're getting on tensor categories from this function generation conjecture. I'll just say that now that you have this kind of external perspective, as a result of Pefsovin Witherspoon, no, yeah, Pefsovin Witherspoon from, they have two papers. I think the last one was from 2016. Papers, I think the last one was from 2016, where they described there's a kind of way to talk about the topology of this category. And this functor is, in fact, in terms of the topology of this category, a homeomorphism. And that's also would be kind of generally expected. And so for me, this is a bit more intuitive that you think about, because there's, like, for example, this Brochet Jordan Snyder paper is about that, you know, if I start with a Is about that, you know, if I start with a kind of fusion category, it has a certain kind of dualizability. It's, it's like it's kind of like a dualizable sheaf is like a perfect sheaf, satisfies certain kind of dualizability conditions. So kind of the hope with this example is that we can kind of explore some of these, this kind of external way of thinking about this final generation conjecture, maybe have a more intuitive way of thinking about this, which maybe will give us some leverage in general since we kind of don't have any at this moment. Anyway. Anyway, again, maybe not I think too kind of specific here, but let me just stop there. Feel free to think about finding aeration conjecture if you like. I think it's fairly interesting. So thanks very much. Can you tell us about the Lien's conjecture? Yeah, so I kind of changed my mind a little bit after I wrote the abstract. But so DeLines conjecture would say that these derived endomorphisms, kind of in general, so these would be like an E2, if I'm not assuming any braiding, right? These are like E2. I need to ring. And then I need to make some decision about what I mean by QCO. So, in this formal case, I'm lucky. I can just talk about this. I need to make some decision about what I mean by kind of what kind of modules of this I'm taking. So the lanes conjecture says that this has a kind of an Ean structure for n equal two or three, maybe in the braided setting. And so the proposal would be that, in fact, you have a map from, if you like, EN modules. Ean modules into my category, which is furthermore kind of monoidal, which reduces when I look at the identity to giving me this kind of Ean structure on the derived unimorphisms. So kind of expands that just a little bit. I was hoping that that functor would also be this term central, so that, like in this case, you would have a lift to the center of. To the center of this particular derived category, which is then now an E2 category. So I'd have kind of E2 she's on this E2 scheme going to this E2 category. But yeah, I'm not super sure about that. But the kind of domain here, I think, probably you want to take E2 modules over this E2 ring. So yeah. Yeah, maybe if that answers your question there. Thanks. So, Chris, I guess my question is more like kind of elaborate on what you said about a sheaf. You said something like you can do a dual sheave is the best you can have, something like that. Could you elaborate on that? So, what I was saying was that, um, so. So, I think I want the, you know, I'll talk, I'm happy to talk about this stuff, but I think the concept is that my claim that this is monoidal. Okay. There's all these other kind of crazy things I'm talking about, but all I want to say is that this is monoidal. Now, the these kind of dualizability conditions, so what I was saying was that if you take a, just like a, take a ring, commutative one, r, and think about modules over that ring. Think about modules over that ring. And then the, let me see here. I would take the derived category of modules over that ring, commutative one, that's monoidal under the derive tensor product. So the objects which admit duals under that tensor product in the derived category are perfect sheaves. So that's, and if you're like, if this is like a regular A regular ring, that's the same thing as saying, like, you're coherent. So it's a kind of a finiteness condition. And so that kind of, although it doesn't necessarily make so much sense to talk about a coherent sheaf of categories, you can talk about whether something is dualizable, right? It could be dualizable as a sheaf of categories over, in this case, QCO and. So that was all that that comment was. All that that that comment was thank you. Yes,
