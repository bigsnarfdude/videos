Thank you for the introduction. Like many other speakers, I would like to thank the organizers for the kind invitation. It's my pleasure to have the opportunity to participate in this exciting conference in such a beautiful place. Today, I'd like to present our recent study of solving a class of stochastic image problems. Problems for wave equations. Specifically, today I'm going to talk about an inverse around the potential scattering for the biharmonic wave equation. And the talk is based on the joint work with my former poster, Fund Xu Wang. And here is the outline from my talk. I will begin with a brief motivation and the problem formulation for the underlying equations. In order to describe the potential. In order to describe the potential, the random potential, I'd like to uh talk about so-called the generalized Gaussian random fields. That is the mathematical model for us to rigorously describe the random potential. Then I will talk about the direct problem and inverse problems respectively. Finally, time allows, I'll talk about some of our ongoing and future work along this line of research. And as we know, humans problems And as we know, inverse problems are to determine unknown parameters in PDEs by using external measurement. And we know that inverse problems are non-linear and year-post. So that's why we are very challenging. By year-post, we may not have a uniqueness. By even, we have a unique list, but we may not have a stability. So that is the issue we have to consider for a general inverse and problems. A stochastic inverse problem refers to inverse problem that involves uncertainty. Problem that involves uncertainties. And the statistic modeling has been introduced to mathematical models for plenty and reasons. For instance, the environment might be unpredictable, or we may not have a complete knowledge of the systems and or the measurement, or the measurement may contain noise. So we have to consider the stochastic modeling, then we have to study stochastic PDEs. Then if we study the corresponding inverse problems, we have to encounter stochastic inverse problems. We have encounters the test inverse problems. So, besides the deterministic and counterparts, and we have learned nine, we have learned the oppositeness and non-linearity, we have to handle the actual difficulty of randomness and uncertainness. For deterministic and problems, this is uh the modeling for uh stochastic PDEs and involving random fields. So we have some kind of underlined operator that L. For instance, L might be on the Laplacian operator. In that case, this might be the chemical cohesion, or the L could be on the double curve operator, this is for the matrix coefficients. In this talk, I'm Cohesions. In this talk, we're going to consider so-called bi-harmonic wave coefficients. In that case, the L is a bi-lock logic. And we have the wave number, the kappa, and we have some fields involved in these PDEs. For instance, the Q might be used to describe the median. In that case, we have random media and problem. Or we may have under the the row. This is for random potential, that is the focus of my talk. Potential that is the focus of my talk. And then we may have right-hand side of F, F represents the source. For different quantities, then we may have different problems. And for this term, the rule of U, physically, there are two interpretations. One is that, and this term might be interpreted as some kind of external force, a linear force, which is added to the system. A system. Or this term might be represent a multiplicated noise because rho is a random field, and then a u itself will be a random field. So that might be an interpreted or multiplied noise. Then this is very difficult to problem. This is so-called random rough path and the problems. And there are two problems we need to consider for this model. And for direct problem, we want to determine the W field based on the given Dobbin equation. Based on the given governing coefficient, so if we know the operator, and we know the wave equation, and then with the random either medium, continue, or a source. For such a problem, since the Q, rho, or F are random fields, the regularities would be very low. If we have very low regularities and the well-posed base is not guaranteed for this and underlying model. So we have to uh know what kind of a regularity what would be lowest regularity What would be the lowest regularity where allowed such that the problem is well-posed? Even though the problem is well-posed, then we have to study what would be the regularity. How smooth the solution is, such that it makes sense for us to study the inverse problem. So that is the issue for the direct problem. For inverse problem, we have to determine the statistics of those random fields. So it doesn't make sense for us to determine each realization of those random fields. Instead, we are interested in Instead, we are interested in statistics of those random fields based on the measurement which is related to a wheel field. So we want to infer the statistic of the random fields of those quantities based on the statistics of the light ment. Of course, we have to deal with the year possibly, so we have to know when the problem has a unique solution. Besides that, we have to Besides that we have to also under uh handle the unsolutions. Uh we have to deal with these stochastic differential equations. For the deterministic part, in this talk, I'm going to mainly focus on the run the potential problem. In other words, and we will assume that Q is under fixed, Q is given, the source is given, or Q is under determinist, and F1 is under determinist. I'm going to F1 is the determinist. I'm going to assume that the row is a random field. So, this is called the random potential problem. For random potential or random media problems and the many metal work, which have been done for deterministic case. So, if you heard the talk by Unter on Tuesday night, and the EIT problem is a very typical on the immersed problem. By using the transformation, the EIT problem can be reduced to the immersed potential problem. But that is for deterministic setting. And there are And there are many other work which has been done for different wave coefficients, including the Havelholes coefficient and the elastic wave coefficients, and as well as the Maxwell's coefficients. Those are about either the medium problem or potential problems. Relatively speaking, there are other very uh work which has been done for the stochastic and uh uh immers potential world median problems. Potential work median problems. So, those are the recent work about the Schrodinger equation with the Hamilton equation involving the random potentials. And we've recently done the random potential problem for the elastic wave equations. And this talk will be focused on the biharmatical equations. This is the equation which I've been doing recently. It turns out that the biharmatical equations have many significant applications. Might be significant applications in the thin plate elasticities. For instance, aircraft wing. Due to a lifting force, and the aircraft wing will be burned and may oscillate. And this is another application for the backhand we collection. This is for an offshore and runway. During the takeoff or the landing of aircraft, and when we have a fort. And then this and the runway may. This and the wrong way mirror and oscillate. So, in order to describe the oscillation of this and the wrong way and the biharma wave coefficient, and would be the right model to do it. And recently, there are some physicists who have done an experiment for the broadband elastic cloaking. The in contrast with optical cloaking, this is very real re realistic in the sense that it's very easy to fabricate. That it's very easy to fabricate and materials to have this elastic and coating. And this is a picture taken from this paper, the physical revelation. So they fabricate this and concentrate the circles. And those circles are made of elastic material with different modules, young modulus. But this is very used materials in practice. And then if you want. In practice. And then, if you want to cloak something inside of this domain and you send the wave, you basically want to be able to see this. So, this is a very realistic device to have this elastic clothing. And I think this idea has been has very important applications for the smart building. For instance, we know that along the west coast or in the region of Japan, there are a lot of In the region of Japan, there are a lot of earthquakes, and they can design materials such that they can reduce the damage of the earthquakes. This is numerous smart building. Alright, let's look at the problem formulation. And we can see the stochastic biharma equation, and here we have this and the binocular logic. It turns out that the biharmarical coefficients is very challenging, not only mathematically but also numerically, due to this bi-laplagic operator. Biologic operator. We can see this biharmological wave coefficient, and you will represent the displacement along the third direction. And we have the wave number, the k, and we can see the very general biharmonic wave coefficient. That means, and we consider the damping term, so the sigma. And we have the potential, this term, the oral term. Again, this term might be represented as some kind of a linear node. In a node, which is an In addition, which is input to this system. And then we have this delta source or excitation. And here we assume that rho is a generalized Gaussian run the field. I will be more precise about this model or this notation. Listen, I said we have to study two problems. But before we can solve the universe problem, we have to study the direct problem. The direct problem is to study the well-posed means and the regularity of the solution for a given potential. Right for a given potential. So, what would be at the lowest possible regularity for the potential such that this question is well posed? So, it has a solution. Once it has a solution, we want to what would be under regularity of the U. That's the for the problem. And the inverse problem is to determine some statistics of this potential row based on some measurement. And here is a picture to illustrate the problem. The problem. Suppose we have the potential which is relevant, potential, but it has a support at the D, and there is an excitation. This is for the point of source, the excitation, and it will generate at the scatter wave. And then we measure the wave in this domain. This is for external measurement. And this is the domain, this is open set and has a positive distance away from the support of the potential. And based on the measurement of this wheel-filled. Of this wheel field, we want to determine the statistics of the potential. That is an excursion of the problem. Okay, so in order to rigorously describe this and the potential, random potential, we have to talk about the Gaussian random fields. Let's consider this real-value centered Gaussian random fields. By centered, we mean that the expectation is zero. So if the expectation is not zero, So, if the expectation is not zero, then that can be also considered. For Daussian random field since assume that the expectation is zero, then we will be interested in the second moment, the covariance. So we begin with the simple is the case. This is a white noise. White noise is one of the most commonly used stochastic processes. So we assume that this round potential rho is given by this form. We have the B B is the brand motion, the B dot is white noise. The B dot is white noise. And there is a smooth function in front of this, in front of B dot. That means this function A is used to describe the fluctuation of this and the perturbation of the white noise. And we know that for white noise, and it has a certain regularity. So this is the exact space to describe the regularity of this partition. And the D here is the dimension of the problem. The epsilon is an arbitrary positive number. So this is the negative. So this is a negative index. So this index describes the differentiability. And which is negative, that means it's rough, very rough. It's not a function, it's a distribution. And P is an this index is to describe the integrity. P is any and the real number bigger than one. So this is one result. And since we assume that this is the center of the Gaussian random field, then we're interested in the covariance. So as long as we know the covariance and we know our random field. And the random field, the Gaussian random field. So, this is how we define the covariance in this operator. So, we have two test functions, and since rule is rough, it's a distribution, we use this and the dual product. And each one is a random number, and we take the expectation. Since this is a white noise, then we can use the inter-isometry, and we can prove that this operator, after we take the inner product, that is given by this. Which means that the A is exactly described as a covariance operator. Exactly describe this covariance operator very under a very compact way for any given two attest functions. But this notation is not convenient for us to generalize it. So another way to describe covariance operator is to treat it as a pseudo-differential operator. And this is how we define the pseudo-differential operator in this and the free and the transform. And here C is so called the symbol. Then if we compare these two notations, we can easily verify. And we can easily verify that the symbol is given by A squared, which means that if we treat the covariance operator as a pseudo-differential operator, and this the symbol exactly describes by the fluctuation. So that is an equivalent way to describe this covariance operator. But this description is much easier, it's more convenient for us to generalize and the white noise generalize and discussion random field to more. Field to more, okay, to wider and broad class of random fields. Another reason we want to generalize it is that since the white noise is so rough, if we simply consider the random source or random median or random attention, then the solution or the model may not be well posed. We may not have well posed on the problems. So then we have to consider the general case. Then we want to know for what kind of rival. For what kind of regularity, for what kind of potential, or random and randomness, random potential, or random medium, random source, then the problem is well posed. So that's why we have to consider a generalized case. And this is still the notation for the covariance operator, but since this generalized Gaussian Ragnar field is no longer the white noise, so they may correlate it. So we don't have thisometry, but we Ito isometry, but we still can make use of this and pseudo-differential operator to describe the variance operator. In this case, the symbol is going to be more on the complex. So there are two parts. This is called the principal symbol, and this is the low-order term. For the principal symbol, there is a smooth function. This function is called the macro correlation strength. So that's used to describe the fluctuation. And this is a And this is a smooth function. A natural question is that if we use this model, we use this notation to describe the random potential, what would be the regularity? So we want to know, we want to answer the question, what would be the regularity of the load? And obviously, the regular load well depends on the principal symbol. So in order to answer that question, we may introduce the notation or the definition introduced by Marty Lazas and his collaborators. Introduced by Marty Lassas and his collaborators. A Gaussian random field is called a macro-locally isotropic of order M. M is exactly the order given in this principal symbol. That is M. M could be positive, could be zero, could be negative. It's any other real number. And we see that it's a micro-locally isotropic of all the M if the covariance operator is a pseudo-differential operator with the simple principles given by this. Principles given by this. So, this notation is very abstract. It does not help us to figure out what would be the regularity of the rule. Instead, we consider this sort of a more constructive way for the model, and we consider the so-called fractional Gaussian random field, which is given by this. So, we have that this is a white noise, but there is a fractional Laplace acting on the white noise, and with a certain number, the index. So, as we may see that if Index. So we may see that if M is zero, this is just a white noise. If M is on the positive, this is not rushing to the negative power, that is for an integration. So the idea is to smooth the white noise. Then the regularity would be higher. But if m is a negative, this is going to be under Laplacian operator, fractional Laplacian operator with a positive power. So then it would be even rougher than the wise normal. It would be even rougher than the wise noise. It depends on the index. Then we're going to use this and the fractional Gaussian field or the model to describe this random potential, which is given by this. It turns out that this fractional Gaussian field, this model can describe a vast range of random stochastic processes, depending on the dimension and M. For instance, if D is 1, M is 2, and this is H2, it's just brand motion. Just random motion. Or this one and this two this is reduced to west noise. Or the H1 can be used to describe this fractional branding motion. So it really depends on those parameters. And we can show that if we use this notation and this covariance operator for the random potential described above has exactly the same principal symbol as the notation given by. Earth than notation given by Mati Lasas and his collaborators, which means that we have the same regularity for the potential. Moreover, we can show that according to the index of M, if M belongs to D2D plus 2, then the rho belongs to the holder continuous space. So that means the potential has a higher regularity. Of course, if when the M is bigger than T plus Q, then this is going to be more smooth. Going to be more smooth. And we're not interested in this case. And we consider this case, the rot case. So if F belongs to the negative infinity D, then the root belongs to this surface space with negative index, because M is less than D. The smaller the M is, the rougher the potential is. So that is the model we're going to use to describe this random potential. I have to speed up. Speed up again. This is by harmonic under the wave equation. And then we have this complex, we define this complex wave number and we have some relation between the real wave number and the real part and the complex part of this wave number. So that is the relation between those three quantities. And we can see the fundamental solution for this bi-harmonic, the wave question. It turns out that this is very complex, and therefore. This is very complex, and there are two parts. These two parts come from the factorization of this operator. But basically, this part can be used to describe the wave part, and this is for the modified the handholds and the part. So with a very complicated, the fundamental solution. And as we understand, even row, the direct problem is to determine you, right? It's to study whether the problem, this problem, is on the well post. And we can show that. And we can show that if the rho is the model given as we described a moment ago with this range, then the direct problem admits a unique solution in this space. Almost surely. And then those are the range for the differentiability index, and this is for an interpretability index, and this is for the differentiability index. So very complicated, and the ranges. The ranges for those parameters. Moreover, the solution satisfies this Ipamana Schunga inquiry. So that means for all those kinds of range, those are the parameters, then the problem is well-cosed. Basically, this is what's the same QRS. So you don't need the the the process to be have definite signs like or No, no, no. We don't could be positive, could be negative. To be positive, it could be negative. There is no regularity. No, no, only regularity. Only irregularity in the smooth list. So the idea of the proof is to study the corresponding inflation equation. And it turns out that the proof is very complex. And one of the major steps is to study the unit continuation. The reason is that this unit continuation involves the bilabla-chain operator. This is not usual. This is not usual. Another is that the row is very rough. So, this is one of the major steps of this of the direct problem. And based on this and the different Schumer position, we're able to study the inverse problem. It turns out that we have to study so far the Bohr and the series. And then we can show that if we use consider the Bohr series, and the Bohr series is convergent. And the Born series is based on. Okay. And the Born series is based on the previous and studied and the Nikma Schunger equation. Then we can split the field. U is the total field into the scatter part and this is the instant part. Instant field. This instant field is a Punice function. For the inverse problem, the rest of the steps would be analyze all those and the terms, which is given in the status field. So here is the expressions for those terms. And here is the picture, and we're going to illustrate, explain a little bit about the picture for solving the inverse problem. So again, we want to determine the potential, which has a support. And then we're going to measure the fields in a domain of U. U has a positive distance away from D. Away from the E. And here is Y is the location of the excitation. And we're going to measure the field also at this location. That means that we use so-called back scattering data. And we send the wave, and we measure the wave at the location where we send the wave. That is the expression of the scatter field. It has different parts. This is the leading part, this is the second term, this is all the remaining part. Then we have analyzed all those contributions of. Have analyzed all those contributions of all these three terms to the numerous problem. And those are the specific expressions for the different terms based on a series. This is the result for the leading term. So we can show that the energy, this is the square of the magnitude. We don't need the phase information. This is the expectation. The expectation of the energy of the field under this and the scaling. So we take the average, the K is and the wave number. During this and the average and when the K goes to infinity, this is in a high frequency regime. And that is equal to this. And phi is what we are going to reconstruct, is what we are going to determine. This is for correlation strengths of random potential. And we have this two. Random potential, and we have this kernel. And the kernel does not have a singularity, right? Because the z belongs to d and u belongs to u. The x belongs to u, so they have a positive distance. So there is no singularity for that. Moreover, if the sigma is zero, if the median is not absorbing, it's non-attenuation, then we can show that we have this and the so-called opportunity and the result. We can replace the expectation by only a single. Expectation by only a single realization. So there is no more expectation. And here, this result is true and almost surely. This is numerous or disc and result. And I'm going to skip the proof, but in order to show uh the obedience, the one of the important steps is to show uh the fields are sort of asymptotically and uh incorrelated for different wave numbers. Correlated for different wave numbers. So those estimates are the key to show the autodescency. For the second term, we can show that there is no contribution. And this is also under, there's no expectation. So this is true for any realization. This is under valid, it's true, almost surely. So we don't take on any expectation for the field. Again, it For the field. Again, it involves only the energy of the field. I'm going to have to speak the detail of the group. One of the major tools we use to prove the result is to use the so-called weak product theorem. We have to analyze the expectation of those four terms of the potentials. The next result is about the contribution of the remaining term. And we may also show that there's no And we may also show that there is no contribution coming from the remaining term as well. And this is relatively easy because we can analyze the norm of the operator, such that there is no contribution, as a win-win goes to infinity, and this is zero. And when we combine all those on the previous result, and we show that for the inverse problem, and we have the following unit result. The left-hand side is our data. For general sigma, and then this. Sigma and then this is an expectation of the energy of the scatter field. When we take the average with respect to frequency, as a frequency goes to infinity, it equals and this can be treated as our data, then that equals on the Russian side. And since there is no singularity for the integral of kernel, then that means if this is data, this data can determine the phi uniquely. Uniquely can follow by using this result. Moreover, if the sigma is zero, then what? When the sigma is zero, then we'll have this or this result. So, left-hand side can be replaced by this integral. There is no expectation anymore, which means that statistically this is stable to uniquely determine the phi. So, that is the result for the inverse problem. Do I have time? How much time do I have? One minute. So, let me just very briefly go over some of our ongoing. Go over some of our ongoing future work along this line. And we've done some random source, random potential and random median problems. For random source, we have some linear operator. And according to the different mean operator, we may have an Hamilton's coefficient, Maxwell's coefficients, or biharmatical equations. And this is a relatively easier problem because this is for additive noise. Or if the potential is random, then we have this is a non-linear frame. Non-linear, right? Non-linear inverse problem. Also, this noise is a multiple-gain noise, so it's much harder than the random source. For random potential, we've done this under elastic wave version. And the most difficult problem will be in the random media. So in that case, the Q is random. In that case, and the machine operation or the Bohn series doesn't work. Series and doesn't work. Along this line of research, we only have some results for the direct problem. We show that the Hamburg's equation and the inverse equations are well opposed for the direct problem. But we don't know if this is true for Maxwell's equations and for inverse problems. This is completely open. All right, thank you very much for your attention. Thank you, Peter. So maybe we can actually have one question about I just want to make sure. So
