Right, thanks, thanks, and thanks very much to the organizers for the invitation to speak and just to be here in the workshop. It's been pretty great so far, and I'm really enjoying it. I was going to say that today has been a Super Tuesday, but I think that's only in the US. It seems in the more sophisticated Canada, it's a Dirac Tuesday. So I'll have to up my. So I'll have to up my game, but we'll see how it goes. So I'm going to talk about a computation in K-theory and just want to briefly say the outline. I just want to I will start with some motivation. This will be sort of quite classical. And then I'll do a brief review of the framework that I'll be working in, which is the Nicolas Schulzer framework at T C and then And um and then I wanna sketch as much as possible the the uh computation that I'm after. So the the goal of this project was to to take this new uh uh framework for what uh understanding what topological cycle chemology is and just put it to use in uh in uh what is in fact a classical computation due to Hessel-Holton-Madsen, which I'll get to. Meds, which I'll get to. So let me start with part one, the introduction. So just very big picture, algebraic K-theory has many invariants, has sort of the, I guess, the tension between this being very interesting. So, in this case, it's very interesting, and so the payoff of that is that it's also very hard to compute. And so this talk is concerned with the computation of this and with the classical method of using trace maps. To get at algebraic K-theory. But just so as a piece of background, Quillen proved that the K-theory of an, so let's take R, a regular ring, then in the K the Then the K-theory sees no difference between the affine line over R and just K-theory of R itself. So this is A1 invariance in the regular case. And so let me just rewrite this in terms of the notation I'll use for the rest of the talk, and in terms of relative. Use for the rest of the talk in terms of relative K-theory. So this is saying, you know, if I take the fiber of the map that quotients out the ideal generated by the variable, then I get the trivial spectrum. And so you might ask, what about Other types of invariance, other invariance properties for K-theory. And there's two, the obvious ones that sometimes hold in sort of cohomology theories. And I'll focus on the one that's most relevant, namely mill invariance. So you can ask whether or not K-theory has nil invariance. So this is the question of whether or not the relative K-theory of an ideal inside a ring A, which is non-potent, whether or not this is zero. And the answer to this question is not. So, this question is no. No, but this is the slogan. There is a slogan in the that failure of uh Of K-theory to satisfy narrance equals the failure of Tc to satisfy null invariance and this It has a similar slogan for the situation of excision, which I might mention at the end of the talk if I have time. But this is concretized through the theorem of Dundas-Gobert and McCarthy. Which says that if I have a subjection of rings with a high nupotent, then the cyclotomic trace induces an equivalence between the relative K-theory and the relative topological cyclic homology. And so, using this theorem, Hesselholt and Madison proved, actually computed K-clearing in that in this kind of case. So theorem, which we have somehow Milsen says if K is a perfect zone, let K be a perfect field characteristic P, then the relative K-theory in odd degrees of the truncated polynomial algebra. The truncated polynomial algebra of truncation degree E, so relative to the ideal generated by the variable. So I'm measuring the difference between k-theory of the truncated polynomial algebra and just k-theory of the base. And this is given as the big bit vectors into base field K modul the image of the youth Hashivon and the even groups are trivial. So they actually prove more than this, they also allow K to be regular over Fp, but I won't be dealing with that case. So in this talk, I want to Get a modern proof of this result. So, this is the result that I want to give a new proof of. And to do that, I'm going to do that. And to do that I want to tell you or to remind perhaps a bit about the Nicolaus and Scholz framework for TC. Thereby also give a definition of topological segregation. So for us in Schultz to find To define a symmetric monodule infinity category of so-called sequence homic spectra. And I'm going to just deal with the p-complete case. And I'll call this category six per p and the objects in here are very simple to describe. So we get a p. We get a p-complete spectrum X with an S1 action together with ethnic ground. To the next one, equarium map called the Frobenius. From x to the take CP, so I look at Cp as the subgroup of S1, and I have the S1 action here, and here I naturally have an S1 mod Cp uh action, but I identify that with S1, and and I and I require uh the existence or I require the the extra structure of such a of such a map. Structure of such a map to give you a p-complete synchronic spectrum. Okay, and the maps are the obvious ones, equivariant maps that make a commuter diagram. It's going to be these for genius maps. And the S1 infrastructure is the same. The S1 incovariance of this map means that I have an induced map on the fixed points which I also call phi p. And in the case in this case where we have the complete p-complete spectrum and let me also assume founded below. Let me also assume founded below. The S1 fixed points of the take construction can be identified with the full take construction of the circle on the spectrum. This is again a theorem used to Nikolausch also. And um the definition that I give. So for x and p complete sigmatomic spectrum, c c of x is defined Is defined as the homotopy equalizer. So let me introduce notation here. The fixed points I'll call Tc minus of X and the take construction Tp of X. So So, from the fixed points, I always have a canonical map to the take construction. And now over here, constructed the map induced by the sicatomic structure with cyclotomic Rubenius. And you define Tc of X as the equalizer. And so given A ring A over F P. It's probably no surprise that CH of A gives an object in here, gives a P complete synchronic spectrum, and I define C C of A to be C C of this ring, or rather the Glass and Schultz definitely. And that theorem In this special case, is that this definition of top-module secret homology of a ring A agrees with the classical definition. We'll just give it to Richdett, Skyn and Madison. Are there any questions so far? So let me just say that uh before so now I want to move on to talk about the computation, but but uh why is this a very nice definition? Because both of the two, so I have to now compute these two terms and do some linear algebra to compute this equalizer, and that gives me a computation of Tc. And these two terms. Tc. And these two terms both have spectral sequences that approximate them. And because they're defined purely sort of homotopy theoretically. In the old, in the classical definition, one had to deal with sort of genuine stable equivariant Homozappy theory and actual fixed points. And it could get quite complicated. Okay, so now moving on to the Okay, so now moving on to the case at hand, let me let A be the truncated polynomial algebra and by the ideal of the generator. So the observation gets started. This is for a while I'll be following. For a while I'll be following the same strategy exactly the same strategy as Hessel-Holt and Manson followed. And that is to observe that A can be written as a points of monoid algebra points at monoid algebra where pi so E is Pi sub E is the monoid on x, x squared, and so on, with a base point zero, and such that x to the zero, so if you do the ordinary monoid algebra construction, but sort of in the pointsed case, then you recover the truncated polynomial algebra. And the great thing about this is that you can do this That you could do this formal construction of the points at Monero algebra over the sphere spectrum. And then you can recover A by just tensoring back up to K. And this is good because CHH as a functor from algebras to sigma sonic spectra, maybe let me see to decomplete signal-sonic spectra is symmetric monoidal. Or admits symmetric monoidal. Minoidal structure. So we get an equivalence of syncotomic spectra between what we're after, THH of A, and THH of 5 to the spherical monomigring, spherical monoming algebra, which are denoted. Which are denote as the cyclic bar construction of pi E, because this really is just the suspension spectrum of an unstable space. So here, this is just the ordinary cyclic bar construction that you can do for any monoids. So this is an S1 space. An S1 action. And indeed, I also have a Frovenius, kind of a unstable Frovenius, which now lands in the fixed points. But after taking suspensions background, I could go to the Tate CP construction. I just want to mention, so what this does. Want to mention so what this does: if I have some element in the cyclic bar construction, I can just repeat it P times and now I have something that's clearly fixed by the by the C P action. So, to understand THH of A, we need to understand the We need to understand the THHK homology of this space. And so what we do, how to do that, first decompose this space. And S1 in covariant decomposition as a sum of spaces that are called P of M. And how do we define that? So in terms of the cyclic power construction, what's an element in there? It's just a smash of various powers of i. Powers of i, let's say t plus one of them. So let's say this is non-zero, then each non-zero element looks like this. And I declare it to be in the m space only if the sum of the powers is exactly n. So for instance, x squared, x matched x cubed. So x maps, x cubed smash 1 is in b of 4 and so on. And let me remark here, so note that i tilde takes something which has some, whose sum of powers is equal to m to some. Powers is equal to m to something whose sum of powers is equal to p times m. This was the p diagonal map here. And what gets us off the ground is that the the homology of this space here This space here. So the coefficients in some green is just the Hartial homology of the points it truncated polynomial algebra over the ring R, you know, viewed as an R algebra. And this was computed by the Buenos Aires Cyclic Homology Group. Cyclic homology group consisting of Uccione, Guccione, Edondo, Sovotana, Villa Mayor in 1991. And so to state their result, you can So, they don't only compute this, but they also compute the decomposition in terms of these spaces here. So, they decompose the Hartio homology and get a result for each of the individual spaces. So to state the result, let D be the floor of M minus 1 over E. minus 1 over e and there's two cases I'll only focus on the case where e is remember is the exponent the truncation exponent if it doesn't divide m in this space p of m then they show that the homology is concentrated in two degrees in degree 2d At degree 2d and 2d plus 1, where it's free of rank 1. So the homology, let's say, with coefficients in any ring R over R. And uh they also compute the the charge of of this uh space. Space. So, right, I have something in degree one, and I can pick a generator IM, and then I have a S1 action, gives me the charge. And I'm very happy actually, because there's no reason it's called capital B, but there's too many capital B's, so maybe it's called D, but then I wanted to preserve my lowercase D, so Q. Of my low case D, so Q is much appreciated here. And the result is simply multiplication by M. So that's what the action looks like. So in other words, you can choose generators Y and Z such that the common operator X by multiplication by M. And there's a similar for similar calculation in the case. Similar calculation in the case where E does divide M. But in other words, to try and not get too bogged down in the details, I'm going to leave that case aside. Are there any questions about this? So we now know the homology. We wanted to compute the THHK homology. And so to do that, we use the fundamental theorem of THH, which is trickst, periodicist T. So in the case at hand, the perfect for a perfect field of characteristic P P the statement is that homotopic groups of THK is, so I guess free on a generator of spin one, so a degree two generator, and um minus one, minus one. Minus one? You know, Ben Franklin had some convention. So now this is, of course, very easy to compute the THHK homology of some space, at least such a simple space as this PM. So the THISE-GROGE spectral sequence now computes computes this spectra for us. So we have something free over the Fixed over the polynomial algebra where this has now Over the polynomial algebra, where this has now degree 2d, and this is 2d plus 1. So let me say this is again assuming e doesn't divide m. And again, you get a similar computation in the other case. So now we almost know, yeah, let me just recap that what did we have? We have CHH of A is given as Is given as TJH of k tensor in space, which splits up. So we can bring the splitting aside, so we have a direct sum of the spectrum of this form, and we understand the homology here. We knew that this is a cyclotomic equivalence, so we just need to understand something about phi B on the right-hand side. On the on the right-hand side of this. So we state that as a lemma. So right so the shape of this This the Frobenius in terms of this splitting here. And as I mentioned, going from M to P times M So I continue to call it phi P, maybe phi P of M. So this is induces A I star isomorphism to star greater than or equal to 2d plus 1. So the reason for this is basically since it's known, I think also due to Hesse Holton-Madsen, that just in the base case, Just in the base case, this is the connective cover. In other words, a pi-star isomorphism in degree zero and about. And so, you know, then you basically tensor on a space which has a very small homology, and that shifts this isomorphism property up a little bit. But the main point. Little bit, but the main point is that it's still an isomorphism in high enough degrees. Okay, so this I now sort of has now I've assembled enough information about the sick atomic structure of THA2A to Of THA2A to continue the computation. So the next step, right, is in the formula is Tc minus in Tp. So let me just first note that we saw that the connectivity or the homology of these spaces is going to infinity as M is. So this direct sum over here. Direct sum over here can be written as a direct product, which means that we can compute the bring the fixed points inside the product. So let's see. So, to understand Tc minus, we need to understand the S1 fixed points of each of these spaces. Of each of these spaces, and likewise for the tape construction. And so I'll call this Tc minus of M and this T P of M. And the lemma tells me that phi going from Tc minus of M to T P of P times M is a pi star isomorphism again for star. For star large enough, I mean the same range, right? So the fiber of this map is some orbits and they preserve the co-connectivity property. And so I get this, so this co-connectivity is preserved when I take the fixed points. And what this allows us to do is to make an induction argument. So we have we want to compute each of these as m varies each of these components here and we now have a a way of A way of understanding Tp of something larger from Tc minus something smaller. So the proposition is the following. So let's separate out the p-add evaluation of M. So let M prime be relatively prime to P. Be relatively prime to p. Whenever I write a prime, I mean that the thing is relatively prime to p. And I remind you, D here was the floor of m minus 1 over E. Again, there's a case. So if E doesn't divide M, then the result is that the odd T P groups T P groups are given by the finite length, sorry, the P typical bit vectors of length V. So V here is the p-adic valuation of M. Similarly, for Tc minus, we get the same result in high degrees. In high degrees, so no, I guess that's low degrees. Right, yeah. And we pick up one more length in when r is bigger than d and the even groups are trivial. I think this is the main main new argument for our sketch of proof on this. So uh going to use induction from V and using the tape spectral sequence and the homotopy And the homes hobby at this point spectral sequence. So let me just remind you what they look like in this case. So I call the take spectral sequence E hat. So computing for some S1 spectrum, computing its state construction in terms of the Homes of the group. The homotopy groups, and then with a variable t which sits in degree minus two, zero. And this is mapped in from the fixed point spectral sequence, which is unlike up here, this is a half-placed, half-plane spectral sequence. This is just Spectral sequence. This is just concentrated in the. So here X, you know, is bounded below spectrum. Maybe it's Z linear. Right. And the canonical map here is an isomorphism in low degrees. Ah, and the D2 operator is a very good deal of the 20 Operator is given in terms of the charge, so it's T times Q of alpha, the common operator. Unfortunately, I think I have to, well, if X here will be T H H K tensor E of M. Enter E of M and the E2 H looks as follows. We have zero below the line two D, where we have this generator y and then we have a generator z in degree 2d plus 1 and then we have And then we have Big Stats element x and so on. So this was the Titan group computation. And then we have this element T Laurent generator. Right. And each dot here is a copy of the base k. Here's the d2 differential. And now let's start the deduction. So I'm going to have to erase this. And all right, so for P equals zero, we can compute P2 on Y using the theorem of the Buenos Aires cyclic homology group to be To be, well, it's m times t times zm. So this was the multiplication by m. And so in this case, it's an isomorphism because v being zero means m is in fact, well, m is equal to m prime, right? And so I have a multiplying by something which is prime to p. And so I want to conclude. And so I want to conclude that that's actually the only differential that I need to calculate. Of course, I could also have something going on with the generator Z. And so the lemma I need is that C of M is an infinite cycle. And the proof of the lemma? Uses using an S1 equivariant map from the integers for the p completion, say, to THH. So we think of this as the cyclotomic trace. As the cyclotomic trace. So if you p-complete K-theory, the cyclotomic trace is, so say P-complete K-theory of FP, that gives you ZP. Now you can map from that into THH in an S1 equivariant way. So that gives you this map. Now the good thing about it being S1 equivalent is that it induces a map of spectral sequences. So if I wanted to If I wanted, so I want to compute, I want to understand something about Tp of M but this gives me a way to attack it by just looking at the Dp homology of the of M. Take as one construction of that. And so here this is a very simple two-page. Simple two-page. Now we have two lines, this line and that line, with a copy of Z everywhere. So this trace map here maps them to the Max them to the E2 page that I'm looking at. Now you can just see here that Z of M just cannot have any this just has two lines. So my Z of M is always gonna die under any differential and it's hitting the guy down here. This is a map of spectrum. It's hitting the guy down here. This is a map of spectral sequences. So conclude that any differential will always kill C of M. So that's the end of the lemma. Right, and so I guess multiplicativity or maybe the module structure. Multiplicativity, or maybe the module structure of the spectral sequence over just the same spectral sequence, if you were just over the base ring k, then allows you to conclude, finishes off the whole differential structure, in this case v equals zero. And so everything dies. So the E3 page is zero, so since there's no extension problems, and indeed that was the claim. So Tp of T equals 0, M prime, I want it to be the vectors of n0. To be the vectors of length zero, which I define to be zero. But now the good thing about it is that why did everything die? Because the CM here was hit from the first quadrant. So if I now look at the E3 page computing the T C minus Minus in this case, then I don't have this differential here. These differentials are missing. So I have something surviving on the spectral sequence. So it looks like just a copy again. Again, there's no. Just a copy again. Again, there's no extension problem, so C C minus here in odd degrees. And in the induction start is just a copy of k, which is indeed the vectors of length 1. Okay, so that was the induction start. I wanted to go through that in detail because you really see the structure of the argument here. Here. So the lemma didn't depend on my induction hypothesis. It's perhaps a bit confusing that I, but anyway, it doesn't depend on the induction hypothesis. So I always only have to determine what happens to y in order to compute this spectral sequence. Right. So maybe let me indicate how the induction step goes. And I'll just draw a diagram to explain roughly how one does this. So suppose We know the propositions that we know what Tc minus of M and T P of M is when for some fixed V. Then I now use this Frobenius map from T C minus. So this Frobenius map doesn't induce a map on the spectral sequence. Map doesn't induce a map on the spectral sequence, but it does allow me to go up one step from the Tc minus to the Tp. And the lemma that I had was that this is a pi star isomorphism in high degrees. Specifically, you know, it was this 2d plus 1. So I'm assuming that I know. So I'm assuming that I know everything, or that I know the Tc minus case, then I get by periodicity of the tape construction. I know what the answer is here, okay, but then I have the spectral sequence computing this, and since I know what the answer of that spectral sequence is, I can deduce what Introduce what the spectral sequence must look like. So you can figure out exactly when the spectral sequence has to collapse. So it doesn't any longer collapse at E2 or 3, whichever you can. Now you may have to go further out on Y before it it dies. But you can see how far out you can go because you know what the length uh of the bit vectors that you that you that your that your answer is out here. Your answer is out here from the induction hypothesis. Okay, so good so far. That gives us TP, but we also want to know Tc minus in this one step up. And of course we now have the canonical map, which doesn't shift degrees. So and this is an isomorphism. So I again also think of it on the spectral sequence side. So again, I start with knowledge here. I use, I conclude what this is in high degrees, which gives me what it is in every degree, which then tells me what the spectral sequence must be. And then I now truncate the spectral sequence to just, like I did over here, to just. Like I did over here to just look at the second quadrant, which is the homotopy vector sequence, and then I conclude what Tt minus is. So that's the structure of the computation. Are there any questions about this now? Okay. Okay. So the definition The definition of TC was given as the equalizer, or maybe the fiber of the difference between the Frobenius and the canonical map. And now you just write out slightly more carefully here. Now let's divide this out into the P primary part and then divide in for HP. For each P, what we know, we know what this T C minus is in each degree, and T P then has a similar shape and a little bit of a data. And so since I've, when I do it in this way, then the Frobenius map, the canonical map respects all the gradings here. And the Frobenius map stays within one M prime component, right? It's just adding more p-adding valuation. And looking on homotopy. Same reviewarm plus one. I guess I stated it as you now have, you know, you now have some product of bit vectors of increasing length. Right. And so here it's V, and at some point becomes V plus 1. Sorry, let me write it like this. And you know that the phenus and canonical sort of disagree. Sometimes one is an isomorphism when the other one is just divisible by P. Divisible by P, some power, and in the opposite direction, depending on how far you go. And so you just can figure out what exactly has to happen. And I guess the result of this sort of linear algebra is Is if you get some product. Let me see. Right, so now you have to, I've been leaving out the case where E divides M, and you also have to deal with that case, and that introduces a bit of clutter into this, but the result is bit vectors are some length which depends. Are some length which depends on all the data involved. I call it h. So primarily it depends on m prime. And now this is just a classical decomposition of the big bit vectors here. So this part is somehow very formal, has nothing to do with the rest of the proof. And that finishes off. And that finishes off the TC computation in this case. So, sorry, it's a bit vague, but I wanted to end on time. Yeah, so thank you very much for listening. Questions? So so the the previous the previous computation I Yeah, so the main point, I guess, is that in the previous conversations we needed to do. Basically, to understand the actual fixed points of these spaces here. And so you can't make do with just knowing the homology of the space. You need to have an actual genuine S1 intervariant model of the space. Gotcha. And in this case, the truncated polynomial algebra, that's quite tricky to do. So this was what Hesselhalt mentioned. Was what Hesselhalt just managed to do using some polytope theory. But we don't need that at all. Cool. Yeah, of course not. That just saves you. So you okay, so you just know that you were working over a perfect field of characteristic D and you just know the homology of the cyclic bar construction. Of the cyclic bar construction. If you know those two things, what are the other barriers to applying this approach to any pointed monoid algebra? Right, so this space B of M here has very simple homology just in two degrees. So you can understand what the spectral sequence just degenerates immediately. But for more complicated monoids, it might still have some interesting splittings. So, for instance, for hyperplanes, instead of Hyperplanes, instead of, I mean, this also works for coordinate axes. But for hyperplanes, the homology of the natural splitting is much too large for the CDS proximal sequence computation to work. At least so, you know, for it to easily degenerate. Other questions? Other questions? We'll have a coffee break and the next talk will be at three. Hold on, okay. Okay, all right.
