Okay, we just immediately started. So, our next speaker is Professor Zhang Yongping from the University of Science and Technology of China. He will talk about the three boundary constant P-min curvature surface intersecting the pencil sphere. The pencil spirit. Let's welcome Professor John. Please go ahead. Well, thank you for your introduction. And thanks to our organizer for the invitation. Today I will talk about the free boundary constant immuncroat surface intersecting the Panosphere. This is my joint work with Jin Pan from my university and Jun Sheng from Wuhan University. Wuhan University. I'll first introduce the Riemannian case of free boundary surface, then go to the CR case. If time is permitted, I will talk about a conformal event by Yamius functional. Here, let me start from the remaining case. For simplicity, let omega be a topological in the occupant space and m is boundary. Sigma is the surface in omega. So, the minimizing problem is to minimize the area of sigma, allowing the boundary of sigma to free. The boundary of sigma to free to free move in M. But another string is sigma divides omega into two subsets of precise volumes. So the sigma is a critical point of the minimizing problem if and only if the mean curvature of The mean culture of sigma is constant and sigma intersects M also also the normal vector field of sigma restricted to the boundary of sigma is tangent to m so here are some features of examples. So let omega be the The unit ball and M is the boundary of the unit ball. That's a unit to sphere. The first example is a total geodesic disk. And the second class of example, spherical caps. Another well-known example is the unique critical. The unique critical catalog. There are also other examples. I will mention the first two are the stable ones. So here the first two papers give answers for the three-dimensional case. And the work by Guofang Wang and Char. Work by Guofang Wa and Choi Xia for higher dimension. So now we come to the pseudo-hermission case. So N here is the pseudo-humission manifold, three-dimensional. Zeta is the contact one form. Cassi is the contact distribution and the G is the compass structure on C. On QC, the T is the river battery field. The volume of the pseudo-emission manifold is induced from the level form and the Webster metric. So the waveform is theta-wedge d theta. So usually we denote the Talaka-Webster connection by lambda. The occurrence space in the remaining case will be In the remaining case, we will be replaced by the Heisenberg group H1. So, here is the explicit form of the structures. In particular, the volume form of the pseudo-emission as the Heisenberg group is the same as the Oklahomian space. So, here's the volume form that we will use. And when I consider surface in the pseudonymation manifold N, N3. On the regular part of sigma, on the surface sigma, that means well the contact distribution does not coincide with the tangent plane of sigma. For the regular part, we can take the creativistic vector field E1. So up to up a sign is unique. And the Lagrangian normal is applies a compact structure to E1. There's another important angle function, alpha. function alpha. So it's defined by t plus alpha e2. It's a tangent, it's tangent to sigma. So we now have the tangent frame E1 and this one, this one is also normalized to the little nth. And the remaining outer normal is mu can also be written in this form. This form. So another quantity is the area of sigma. Here we take the area called p area. So it's defined by many mathematicians in several ways. So here's two forms of Two forms of the P area. The first one is looking at the first variation of the enclosed volume. So in the variation taken in the Lorentzian normal. So here we see the here is the two form E1 wedge theta. Here is actually the P area element. Another one is take the Another one is to take the horizontal parameter of omega. So if it's defined by the integration of the divergence of x, x is has less or equal to one, but it's nice in the contact distribution. So one can see it's actually the It's actually this form. So both are called the P area of sigma. So alpha is the angle introduced. So in this reference. So when I already have the volume and the P area, the minimizing problem. The minimizing problem in the CR case is already. But the answer, to answer this question, what's the minimizer? We need the notion of p-min curvature. So it's already defined by many people. It can be written in this form. So it's a Talaka-Webster derivative in this way. Derivative in this way. And also, it can be seen from the variation formula of the p area. So, stated in this formula. So, now I state the minimizing problem is similar to the remaining case. So, here the area of sigma is replaced by P area, and the volume is. And the volume is same as induced from the Webster metric. And the boundary of sigma is free to move in M. The answer is the critical point of this minimizing problem. If only if the p-mean culture of sigma is constant. And the second condition is the Lagrangian normal restrict to the boundary of sigma is tangent to m so both are comparable to the remaining case. So here's our definition of Our definition of the free boundary constant p-variet surface. So, if only if they satisfy the above mentioned two conditions. And here are some simple examples. As the Romania case, we can see so the chronicle case is. This is the unit sphere, two sphere. Here we replace that by the pencil sphere. So pencil sphere can be written in this, has an expression in this form. So it's rotational symmetric about the t-axis. And the two important properties of the pen sphere is one is constant p-minkurvat, and the second one. culture and the second one maybe the it's uh as a parametric set of the of this ratio of the of p area and the volume of of of the the domain bounded by the boundary so firstly example is that the plane disk given by t equal to zero given by t equal to zero. So this one is actually a p minimum surface. And the second one, second class is the panosphere caps. So actually for each T0, each T0 and it gives this circle. So it's a round circle on the panel sphere. They are exactly Exactly one pencil spherical cap as a free boundary solution to the so both the examples I introduced in last two senators are rotational symmetric. So we go on to try to find another some other examples. So rotational symmetric constant of P-min culture surface has to be classified by Vittori and Losales. So one class is a half-plane. So in this A half plane. So, in this case, we have the plane disk solution, free boundary solution. And for the planosphere, we have the pan-sphere spherical caps. And for the cylinder, it's also constant P-ming curvature. In this case, there are no free boundary solution. And there are also catenoid, CR catenoid, which is P minimal and has this. P minimal and has this explicit forms. In this case, there are no free boundary solution intersecting S1. This is different from the Riemannian case. So in the Riemann case, we have the visual catamoid. And the remaining case are Nutoid and butiloid. So they are so the first one is rotating this curve, this curve along the t-axis, and the second one is this rotating rotating this curve, the second curve. So for this, we can have for some for some some for some range of r and t or t uh we can we can find the free boundary uh solutions so i think i still have some time um actually i i saw uh professor gober will uh will give a talk on we give a talk on conform conformal event by Yamius functional. I think it's also my pleasure to share some common interests. So here I can I try to find some conformal event. conformal event function of connection by by unormalization of Yamius connection. So here that E is a bundle and A is a connection on E. This one I assume this is a Yami's connection. So that and the And the bundle is over some conformable compact Einstein manifold of dimensional D plus one. And G is the CCE metric. So by Yamius, I introduce this fundamental terms. Here F is the curvature of A and here is Here is a square of the curvature. F can be written in A, first order in A. And G is the CC metric. Rho is the special defining function. And here is the Yamius equation. Delta lambda is the formal joint of the Of the covariant exterior differentiation. So to find the conformal, so I will first introduce a simple model. So here is the Maxwell equation connection or I say connection over the hybrid space. So this is a dimension of dimensional of dimension set. Dimensional of dimension seven. So here is the hyperbolic space in this form. So rho is the rho is the up plane model. And A is a solution to the max A written A in this form. So I from one to six and the rho is the zero. six and the rho is the zero direction so a0 is the connection uh applied to the row direction uh there's one uh one gauge fixing so we can assume uh a0 is is uh vanish so then by by the maxwell equation uh the maxwell connection The maxweight connection has this expansion. So here A0 is the D share data. A2 are the coefficient of rho square can be written in this form. So here is just the joint of the curvature of A0. of A0. And A4 is not a local term. Actually, there are also obstructions to the smoothness, to the maxwell solution. So in the dots, it contains lock term in general. And actually, Wheaton in his paper considered Consider the form of consider the connection of this form. So here is I, so A0 is, so his exam, this form is very, it's actually very enlightening. So he used the use a gauge transformation and assume A0 is Assume a0 is a zero vanish, and here is special is it's not dependent on x. So, very simple case model. Then, so for this under this assumption, a is very simple in this form. Actually, here is the global term. Here's the global purely the global term, actually. So for our actually for our for the equal to six here is uh actually compare is uh it's this a4 term um so this can also be viewed as a Neumann data of the next wave connection so in general in general if X is a CC space and if we denote the the conformal inference The conformal infinity conformal infinity, the representation of the conformal metric by G hat. So it's G0, just G0. And if A is the Yamier's connection, then we can also, near the boundary, near the conformal infinity, we can also use this sketch. Uh use this gauge so by solving ODE ODE systems. So then I a1, that's the coefficient of rho is also zero. And A2, the coefficient of rho square is also has this form, same as the last model. So then the Yami. So then the Yamius functional. So here is the Yamus functional over the so for the subdomain rho bigger than if no that has this expansion. So the sorry, here is one over if no square and here is the first the leading the first leading divergent order divergent coefficient is the Yamius function of the deletion data. And the second term is a long term. And the coefficient actually is conformal in by Yamius term. Yes, it's a one derivative. the one derivative higher of the of the of the curvature and here is the rich curvature and here is the scale curvature of f square okay i i stop here thanks for uh thanks for listening okay uh are there any Are there any questions? Oh, I have one. Go ahead. Minimal surface in the Heisenberg meeting the pencil sphere. Does the stechloof eigenvalue make sense on these surfaces? Yeah, that's a good question. We have thought about it, but probably. About it, but we don't figure out this. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. Do you consider surface as a boundary of your problem? Long-compact surface as a boundary? Non-compact boundary service as your free boundary, yeah. That's that's so hard. Okay, uh, you mean this uh here, the boundary of n is not compact, yeah, yeah. Uh, what happened? What happened to chemical? So far, we just considered the case, the boundary is pencil sphere. Okay, thanks.
