And when we launched Mexico, for this particular part, and that is the way it is modern in this provider, but in Mexico, they are. In Mexico, they are and these topics in the idea of a project in the utilization of utility and automated cellular authors that are very mathematical, and the one that passed if we don't have people established. And established when people there. If it is a mathematical model, with quadratic, cada quadrito, a representative geographical representation, and cadaver rose that if more people are established, and the idea that if we go as public policy, and we have a problem that the supremacy is. But what we have the project Claudia and their department that my doctor is in the chat and doctorate. So if you don't present me and with an idea that the evaluation, I don't know. Well, presentation that is. Well, no presentation that is indoctrinated, no. And so, but presentes this same presentation and the department of recursors acquisperos, but not your model, we utilize to distribute well and apply, utilizamos, and margins. Nocturnas for the technology. No, no, no, I have my entonces there, but this les gusto el model and many calculos, and total que yes, how the backbone of the maner que designaron, how construir new. Construct new lines of lineage, but you know, if you can decide and telegraph differente, and I study in the optimal constad, with this existential, and I think that they are relations with inundations and whatever. For the models that are going to be all the costs of technology, the utilization of the idea of all familiar and interaction with the idea that the agua several days, and you have graves in the manera that is. In the manera, these models interact with costs where there is much. Mathematics to create new models that function better in these regions. Talenton is now in the practice one doctor super theorical of partial experiences and And this product, like, and eventually this was one of my simulation that you have to pick, or that impression, but we are coding that simulation as if a presentation are distinctions and. The verse of Ariba is the three dimensional and cost like when the fluid and there are vegetation in that circulitos how the flujo. So we are rapid production vegetation, etc. So my doctor can learn various publications, but not the corazon and so And then Boston, I was at Harvard study change. And what is the Stockholm are the utilization to create the atmospheric model, and the idea of what we can regular countries of. Contaminants in the atmosphere, and their satellite is very contaminated, how we move if the people in Cadiz who are reporting that candidates and because if you are distiendo, there is a problem. Well, yes, students, four years, and Quattro años and for diverse racones do not continue specifically because the form that I analyze the models are not consistent with the manner in which the people utilizable interpretation, the other maid of merit, the models, and mathematics that is a political case because much. Politics, because many people work in that, and hospitalities for people that statistic, families will be a lot patient, and the state of Manera whatever and vegetable eventually what the ideal and the mercies. This empire, the medicals, because it was platinum in hospital places, people who target the chambers, and the idea that no, no, no, it is my objective. But, but, now, between the investigation that is a crucial moment that medicuenta que día hair cosas de epidemiology. Tubo que ver con la pandeme decemo eneme. The pandemic one that is original in Mexico that somehow some other people, but if you have good, that is not, but I think that is how you start, but I did the context of product, many of the things that we can do with. But how is that in a context of mathematical context? This is like the methodologies that appear in what I said. So statistical, and Statistical, and with statistics, no, not combinatory profound, if it is quite specifically the people who have platforms in the mañana. In fact, now what I have seen the description or basically when we are. Or basically, when we are interacting with the computer, or with the computer, we are dealing with our digital world, and we have the positive and many collection of data collection. And so, the idea is that this information is the great company, this positive, and positive because it has. Because Facebook is y ten Twitter, and well, if you're not per Facebook, it's for Yo y in the masters on Snapchat. And other things, but the things that the company grands like are this information for the idea is if we are capable of utilizing information that these companies collect with. Collect with a medical and resale public. So the explicit directly are the question, mathematics that have a moment of crisis in the public, as a penny in COVID. So I serve 20 COVID and 20 in these threes that will present much of COVID. As many of us during COVID. Tabajem muy deceros muy decerca con el CDC que el centro de infermedades prevention de Center for Disease Control and Prevention. And specifically, the types of questions that are in the tomatoes of decisions of public decisions, have this graphic non-tien much, that the decimals are like. That spaghetti queen of these groups are the people who have symptoms of influence in unidospids, and this specifically can be a realization, it's one of the years. Those are the verde, if you think, one thing that is a limitation of Una limitación de los methods of how surveillance of monitoring epidemiological monitoring gracias is that the data will be results. Today in this instance when people are hospitalized in Goaja, for example, there is a decentralized logic, so for engaged that. In this specific centralized system, the people who work in hospital, but not more people, people utilize other manners to decide how to have elements, medicals, to infer and hospital of their intuition. Of intuition. So, what do we pregnant? For example, perspectives, the utilities, the mejorability that is now casting a prediction of it. Well, that's the approximation, or in two ways, and this platform, when all these experts are. When all these experts, because I live on COVID, when COVID, I'm planning to see good, no? But now there are all the sabbaths that we can see the cases, and more vocals, and you can work to distance, etc. So, this manera interacts with. And I pregunted very constantly, which will pass in the process two years, and we preguntan who are going to be the epidemia, or this broth local in the time. And well, we see much with the variants that we have, and I know that we need the work in cosmos. And well, this. And well, this era of prediction future, how we can imagine, can be in many space, and city, hospital, etc. So, well, when COVID is very interested, work with many people, many experiences. Most people many experts, and the people of politics in these unions exist in the meteorological system that we have distinguished there, is the NUA. So, when the NOAA says that the passage because they will see tornadoes, so in the population, and if it is manifested, And if you manifest, and have a very debastor, a EPA. And that are banned and necessary, and the plantamos government passes if we have an association or a entity in the pedigree, we will see the epidemiological level because the CD. Demiological because the CDC, the center of prevention of hermetades, is like the EPA. So that passed, because I found it well, where they are as real, and anticipated, that will not mandate us, you have to predict influencers, when people are infected. Persona informs about the precision absurd, and that we have here this in the time, and in the goods of predictions, and we are more pose the coincidence, so that. So, what happened? And here we have two temporal horizons, here is a horizontal two future and what is the one that very queer very, and everything, the people vast, that have the telephone, and you will see influences not one thing. So, also complicated with the So, a complicated case with the epidemiological prediction is that if I go to a identification case or evolution, for example, and that we can all encourage us, and you confirm because I have a predictions that are all informed, we are good, and that can be my predictions were not caso. So, we can identify and say that the words that are maintained and the news, no? So, there are this attention very full between goods, but the interreaction and change in the future, between the two, these graphics can be ordered, but not the same thing because in the climate we plan. But in general, this with the champions of the verse, we don't change the trajectory as a peroxide. Well, there are things that are condidas here, the only thing that is the model new supercomputador, but what you do is that in parallel to all good questions, you have good medications. And so, the split of meteorological units that para goods for unidodeless, in Haguay, what passes in Mexico, that passes. O que pasa in Mexico, what is etc. So all this read of observation is constituted parallel. And so that is political in what parallel. So that pudo. So and well here. And well, here for the people that have biomate the traditional manager of epidemiological prediction, fundamentally an article that is published in my differential model of McKendrick that many cultures and distinctions or issues. The R, which is like the model that the mathematics, the utilization, or this model has many positions and frequently to bear many observations, well, but así como tenemos una de observations of meteorological, but like. Meteorological methodology, but as infirmities, to see when people are infirm in a data moment, we are one of these verdicts, and the bushes are concerted frequency because people who have chronicles, and if we put all the people, the project is vaccinated, they are not utilizing mathematics, for example, a To discover one method of observation that are representative, there live in the statistical and everything that we compressed, not where your sensors to identify the dynamic trajectory of a system that system for differentials. So, a lot of people who work in this mathematics, I also work on this, but not going to be today. Today, we can pero today in specific voice with utilizamos information that do not originate with public to give us a very graphic, and insist like the discussion. The discussion can be the telephonites and all telephone information. These ideas like information to that myological epidemiology can be used for a decision. So, if planning, all this, because the ultimate positive. I positively put an attention, and this is, but this has a gusanito here when their country, the mirror, when people are hospitalized, in cadaver, one of the unidestations, that we interval confidence, etc. And that is a video. Etc. And that is a video in the queen we are doing predictions that we have with four semanas future, and that is that the curb negro que es la que que observo que dentro de conito pues for us otros es un exito porque que decir que lo que simos functiono saler. Soar cuma semos eso, tú espaci es cundormir, vu que la parte technique, no. Technique, no? This is for influenza sí. Energo del 2. Y escripe stationary, ok, es stationary. Dima? Els biejes or bueno. 3mente, but lib. Triniform, but also the children. Those who COVID, I think, not more like the children are digitized. I think, but I think you're still working if the children affect. So, well, for the queen creates, voyage gradually. Voyager gradually more information so that in the moment that the capture sufficiently, and especially in the crisis if you expertise, and you can decide continuously, but the cases are information of many complementarities and in principle that we are correlation to determine how many thermometers. So, for example, No. So, for example, we are talking people in Twitter are queuent infermos that have been. For example, when people are buscando in Google that what are the influence or what they are remedios for the influence. When people in this case, they are all and sex, how social. The question, for example, we are like information medical information of doses, for example, for medicaments, in this case, we have a system that is a private system that the administration of hospitals like. In the present in the news, like a very terrific, but the rapids, that one significant, but news, but no. So, we have many information complementary, and if all these para influenza and we can't bear as when COVID we have all the data to empendas, to be para COVID. Yes, you could have one of the. Because we have bueno in jarbarníamos a manera de jalar de jalar los actaments. Interesting, we are language, and we are statistics or people, and we articulate how to generate estimates. Estimated influences in various locales in Twitter, no? No, total, no, era, una in the cases era 5% and especially the 5%, we have what localization. But that promos que todas metolos estamin para. COVID-19 when COVID is more preparatory. So, let's go basically how people are camping investigation because I really think that this and many people, and one of the most important works in this investigation, can Google. Google, what people are. And the user who is reporting the CDC. With the important. With the important distinction that this curb narrow, this is empowering, and the curve is faced with two. And they will continue how these unessociate in collaboration with Sudan Africa. In the pandemic, as Sudafriend, you see this the most. We are the number of people who are busy on the internet, the palette. And the negro is the people that detect inferred. Insisto differences that are disposed to be the next director of Roja Negro, a estimate, which is going to pass. And the Google Flu Trends and this graphic that can be like the user that we can with many Google because when their technology of Google is infirm. And here one in one and Google can be the pandemic of 20 years and the affected many countries. And one of the most great critics can enter these unidodes, this system of Google system that we have. We have Google that detected, and infirm detectors. For the people who are not, or not, many more critics that you have and not have to see with the people who are informed. First, you are interested, but the money here is Google rapidly to respond because their idea that we are using the terminals and so you confirm us. So, during two years, reinternal systems that pagan, because it is not during this pandemic, and they will understand that you cannot. But what uses that in the middle 30, in this case, but the more of what you did, so that also. Y perollos in this enterament to say a report, not when they are in the population. So that is a sincere computation in the unojibo clarity when they have racon. What you find and we will expect. So, this and what you did, so the nature is other articulated, but where Google can. So, and a collaborative event is a very prominent article in where this technological technology is. This technological del Gugno, but in parallel, I have a whole class of linear and because we are algorithms the problem and the data problem because we want to finalize and change and And this is in the context of what is the notice of all of these data and that the tools are a basic and well, you can start, but there will be a little history. A regularization, but remodels that can multivariable. So, that is many predictors. Muchas variables independently, which is used in this case to predict the flu, and then And we have to understand this atmospheric chimney and climate change and weather forecasting. In essence, and for the people who control, because we have a what machine learning reentry of dynamic managers can influence the. Puad influenced the things that your species will explain your variable important and if that is relationship, in the values because we have evaluated if the people who are candidates as online, because it is or clinics, so if it variable is invariant in their relationship with the variable that you are standing in, no. So, And so we have Google, and we are using utilization as to their methodology, to make it with respect with what they publish, and the same checks and decisions that are like not competing with us. But if function, no? If function, so with their data, and we can do a mejor and peg, and compared with the features in the data, but to our presentation with a good algorithm, and data mejors that Google entons or ellipse is good for various races, but one. Various, but one is because we are gaining Google, and the time in addition. But the other thing is because we are like the Gurus of the data science, and all data, and our simple and part of the exercise that we have in the course, and then the methodologies are a articulate paper, and And the nature because we have Google the target, who don't review science and vaccination, and all that, and the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. That is what they are buying in medicine. No, no, but we mandaron two seconds. We mandaron two reviewers, a moment nicer than reviewers, because we have my public possession scandal, who are two. All that public and people have no, and it's not based on the past, the contact with the contact, or. After your code, here you go. And not yet, and I would say in English that all the words, the repeats. All that Google eventually is not yet, if we publish and say, but we are going and their blog that i will see the mejorrs. But what I do is But I would say more data, because we have more data, like the idea and I enlighten within Google, the dimensions in the all reverse. And so, I think a request to the review of articles that Google are all here, all that people, and how the scientists, how we are. And the scientific, like, are narcissists, because the mathematics are men, but the mejorn, no, that is more with the community of mathematics. They are narcissists, the scientists are diocese, in this place that ideas. So, we have collaborated this profession in statistics and. This makes the idea and published an article. Well, I was in the review of the final conflict because I don't know if they don't. Today, we have realized classes, so we are. Because publicamos are in this and what you want, here when public articulate, I am Google, I think that will be this major Google trend, that is technological tools. But all the moving to this you have this and us, and the period and things, etc. And we are in the period because there are opposites, which are the same to the porn, but things that are for the CD. This is when I understand that my predictions are not Google, because the interesting things Google, I loved this, whatever. So, well, the cases that we have in the chambers, what is happening, and And we have receptors of all this information, but information and empathy encouraging features and that we are mandating the data and so that we are very good. Si, so you're not the chaos, no, no, totally queen for sentences. Well, how we want the science as well, and the gust and the sense as modified, because we are experts in it. So, my dad is not this. So, we will bring. So, we are going to administer that coffee of the coach, so as to find what Google and our mathematics are from the limitations. So, well, Well, what is the first like reproducible, how the Gulf to people are infermas, the very title that insists for choices that have a little bit of a certainty, and the consistency specifically. The crisis consists specifically in utilizar the numero de person in Mexico to predecir 2 people in this epidemiological section of Mexico and the business of the Internet of Internet for the exercise of Torque. This Turkey de jar los datos como este course improvisando verda. This website of my work, M y quedegato ache cedito e. So, if you can see the browser, the navigator of the Internet, we don't have everything. The audio more efficiently because. Electric can see. Um they can be okay. This is Wnto mighty. Mighty.org. O que licente internet no lost tubundo no ver esto da no, but my custor. So if you want here. Understand the paste, but here it is here in Mexico, and you seem a local course map. If the pico There is a document and here, with this aquí, because all the universe, but you can see here, okay. Well, So, there are instructions and idea of the course, okay? Namas lose ashía, but not all and ignored. We have to have this in this aquifice exercise here of a folder, and there is the exercise. Folder and this one has the instructions to order. So that is a data that you will see. That's a separate value. So, And the instructions of the case is here in the exercise one. No, it's a little bit. So that if you have these solutions. That's not that they want. Develop our dispones, shell folder, and see the link.  In contrast to the GitHub of Mighty, well, this Sotro is yes, I think the solution is not a problem, no. So, other links, okay? Why not? Well, this meeting is this link, the point: it's Guild Hobo Mighty Love, Mighty Love Tismit Vaín 3. What if I have a 1990? Yes, we are definitely. This public and aqueous, one PDF. Ok? Yes, yes. Y well and. And well, and data that data. These are what very exciting, but here the solution is also for Python and AR y told. This also possible solution in the market to be able to cosmetically. So, if you go in the d'Andegoy, this is here to the description of. There are the description of what are the indications of what data is the data that needs to be. But if we don't, if you can excel, if you can, but  A vehicle in the building here for the todos. And basically the instructions are cos sensitive to a plot of the data, the plot of when you. And create a lineal regression that maps in infections reported by the future. And that means y estues for decir in the future, cases that are reporting the Secretary of Salut. No, no, yes, parties es como pones pantalones, no?  No, it is the matrix for the transport and normal yes that is here, no. Here, in my class, if you are in the past, the 50s would be like a reason. From the polling of Ida, the other solution is that if you want to enter the average, you can interact with the work. Now, this is the people who are coming with me. This is the class of general introduction to applications, as for the Erasi, as for the nada, but nada, no. And one of the resolves in four minutes 3 segments, the first dependency of that, is that it is possible to do what you are. And that is the same thing. It is the privilege, yes, or when two courses, like people who have mathematics, that have some people who are there, I code a vehicle, or in Excel, of course, I think in Excel, and it has a A scatter plot in the busquezas, in the infections, you know that separation can fit a line and. Yempo, I like the course that I see, and very rapidly the more difficult things. Yes, it would have been aquí enabled for the sake of GPT over. Abstraction. Catherine has GPT, so it is valid. Es valido. Ensum nan estáciendo. Ah, okay. Puedo entos este compartir la la sí.   In a browser, the publishers collab and interpret the podigos or poderana directors and the language. Sorry. Yeah, you know, I didn't make it, I think. Okay, yeah, the yeah. Okay, that's good. See? I've got liberty, yes.  Once the dissector is sector in this colour model.    You're doing something else, right? You're doing something else? No, I'm just trying to take the linear model. Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah. Right, right, right, right. Okay, good, good, good. Okay, and this means the graphic, no? So we have the data. The other is that they don't have a linear regression that is what they question, and the one that comes. There is a function, the linear regression. This in Excel, if it is linear. Well, that is a plot of the two columns that are a scatter plot. Because we want two columns. The columns that deny this. That is a column, and the other cancelled this good column of searches. And what we are two and a half plot, we have to do this, and you insert where we are. So here one of them is. Las views que das y others are the cases. And I can see one local problem. And the pronouns that are very. So I think here the transformation. While the transformation of this, there is this. Uh, inverse, because you see the cases here that all the historical data, the recommendations for the first three years, of data, and the utilizing linear errors. And the utilization is linear if you want to say nothing for us. What are we doing? And  Regression queen of the various para speaking other que mapes the searches acash here el leg esteemed all this data one that is observed of the case and the relationship that we have the searches to the number of cases. The number of cases because we have more cases there, but if you search there, you can infer when infections are.  Ah, I do record my brother. No. That is encouraging, but. This is collaboration for this part, but not hello. I'm going to start the doors.   Number of columns, one and the other dengue is passing and more. Yes, but there are a regression between searches to the cases. Yes, okay. Well, first of all, That I mean, because here this concept.  24 25 20 more than 6. Well, the important thing that are two points octavos pointed with 3 octaves. But this is a flowment. And that's why I think the complemento, no, it is for the test because one responses. Okay. Ah, okay. The two are like.  This is what you have to give variables, you can do X train with Y train. Train. That's not variables. This relationship of this or what we are doing is that it is not. Ah, that's what it is. The target of the white train and the other X train. Come on. Rey Vamos. Okay. Just well, you have to afrust. Afrustrother, nos queen 5 cominutos. So, we are going to be able to do that. Yes, I recover the fetch because it can be independent as the arrays are ordinary consistently, so that with the change, the views are allowed, if you have the biennial, but a very rapid value. If you explain it. If you explain the colours of the colours, the regression of the column to the column is like the variable that we have to divide. The two queens with the three. Yes. I think the number that learned is on the linear regression. Uh-huh. And why in Elixon was the engineering? Y elixir dengue yeven y logos for regression model fit and slope blah blah blah y senos no no, but the master puid, well the slope doesn't private. If you can check it possible. Is 25? If it was the regression of all the time periods, here we are 3. So, desidando queen. No, no, no, that's not connected to Corby. The RSV. The RSV to Atlanta? Okay, super. Wow. And that is in the question. Well, no semo idea, no security, but Would be like pretty much. But interestingly, I have a paradox, exactly. Exactly, this is the wastewater, no? Tengo have this in hospitalizations, and it is valid what we are talking about the number of infections, what are the people who are numerous infections to the distinctions, and utilize various things and we. Utilamos varias and we inferencia. If the code is here, if you work with it, our work is very important. And the supermathematic and what we have in the world. We can investigate. Because it was much with CFA with Lil and George and with Jason. Jason que suena el que está con el estamos ajando y quiero que estimen escero que nos tamos está. But no desum in this plática, but also and that mode of the city very much. Y per toda. And chique, no secret in Spanish, but if no, No, it's yesterday. Well, we'll see because I'm going to give the child, but what initial initial is what has happened that. Well, it is how we can obtain these as the dependent label. This is the one that we have to live in, if we don't access a medicine of the secretary of the entonces regression. Where is here not to do the business and are the cases? And that is the line, that is a ot. And the idea is if we don't utilize that, because the other thing that you utilize. And you have to simple as my variable, the only thing that we know are not searches, not with the infections, Las infections will be queued from the lineage, but the rock is not. And this was like what Google decided or because one with the searches and when they have the manera queues Google. So Google, no? Digo, trans complicated with the program, but the concept as the massive piencen, immediately is like a podium esta estimate of prediction, for example, that the data is disponed with facades. And that we see that the idea of the big data, data, or mejor, in this case, particularly what functions observe the relationship of people as business and when. How yes, if you are influenced, if there are more complicated para fluid for coronavirus. But a case, if one has a god in which regressions of the searches to the cases, and increment the training set, and the prediction of the future of dynamic, mejora based. Mejora based the presence of mañanas and silence that their code functions. Well, you can see shift, but. Existence shift, but there are simple synchronized synchronization. We are today, and when we are developing, you shift if in two minutes, we are saying that I think in the same way that you report. If you are what you are saying, it is very important. What have you But how we are doing that, I think that what the imposition has. When the escape with a virgin, if we have to shift. I have quantified. Love. Ok. Reguntas? Yes. No, no, no, well. And then we can say. And then if you don't see it, because the searches have a very ridiculous and gustarian queue to buy, no? The point that 2 says the Google has one malitos to detect the searches, but conform the passage for a memorandum. And so, also in the series as great. Un como gradually increasing this training, no? Puedes a serlo un shifting, like a moving window, yes, yes. Your normally para legislo, the passamos aque because also a multivariable region. And that means a little para covets with four. No, there is other methods. That is how first in 2006. And we are very distinct. But what is how a mathematical concept? But we are the criticism with Google with that question: the fish well not exactly that Google and because we want to see a little conqueror. Incorporated data assimilation and weather forecasting. Yes, it is important to do because the models of climate models, if you lose correct a future and correlate with what is midiend. So we don't have the 20 in the mañana, and no, and I think I'll say, the 2006 or if you Prior, no, because you are similar to the information constantly. And so, in our situation, the target will be there, and the paragraph. So, that is not Google, and that is one, and how this is organized the incorporation of information can be frequently that the climate change. Well, majority, the views of all, and especially what I said, if you want to pass COVID, because what we want to do is that when we are very prone, we are apart from thermometers in many ladies. Termometros in many of the population. Or we have Google searches, but we have Twitter, we many other things, and the things like one of these informations, no, because temporal scales are a dellas, for example, no. So, this has one that is when we utilize machine learning and. Okay, I don't know. Yes, yeah. Obediums.
