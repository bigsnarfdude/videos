So this is a it's not so this is a joint work in progress essentially it's all written down but with Jean-Gi Liberat from Toulouse in Arun from Michigan State University. So what they did roughly is that they were working with elliptic curves defined over function fields and here I want function fields and here I want to stress that function fields not just finite over with constant field finite but any field also it includes Q and characters in zero okay so they had bounds that depended on the let's say the arithmetic nature of these these fields that was better than some bounds that you always get so now just get more specific and the the work we do is it's generalized And the work we do is generalizing this to evolve variants and also improving the resulting variance. So briefly, some direct context. You take small case, but it could be a field characteristic P. So P can be 0 or it can be a prime different from 2 and 3. For technical reason, you can avoid these two graphs. So C is a curve that is defined over that field. Is a curve that is defined over that field. I'm just going to put NICE, and if you're interested to know what NICE is, is their geometrical properties so that the curve behaves well. Okay, and it has a genus C, so we can think about the projective line, for example, if you want. Here's an example of such life. It has genus zero. So I'm going to work with function fields. And here, function field is, for example, f or these are. These are examples of that, and then all the others you look at finite extension of this finite sparable extension. So an electric curve for us, it's going to be enough to know that it's some objective curve given by an equation of the form or n squared cortex cube plus a x plus b. A and b, the coefficients are rational functions, and you have some point identity that Point identity that it turns out that if you look at the set of points of the curve, so the set of pairs x and y that satisfy this equation. So this, okay, so if you assume that this quantity is called the J invariant that you can get using the coefficients, so it's kind of the discriminant of that cubic that's going to be on the denominator. Uh, that's going to be on the denominator, and you have some coefficient, something relative to the coefficient A as a numerator. So, this gives you a rational function. So, an element of this field, k of c, and if you assume that it's not in a constant field, so this is a genuine rational function, which is constant, well, you have interesting properties, and then we are going to assume that for the rest of the talk, we're working with that same, okay? Where we work that setting. So it turns out that this set of points that satisfy this equation, so x and there's x and y such that this is true, plus the what identity that I mentioned, this set forms a group, forms an Embelon group, and it's a theorem that is finitely generated under that assumption. Okay, so because of that, you can use the structure theorems, you can decompose your Structured pairs, you can decompose your group into a free part with a finite range and a torsion part. The torsion is a finite default because it's finitely generated. Okay, so this is what we need to know essentially about pairs. So you can would like to know, for example, what is that three? Like how many copies of Z we have inside of that? There's often to be a hard question. There's often be a hard question and it's somehow related to the famous personal direct conjecture that's still good in general. Um so at least you can try to get upper bounds like that, which is also not trivial. And yeah, so this is about that the talk is to try to get good balance or at least even balance that works always. So there's a bound that's called geometric bounds. Geometric bound that is coming from something called the Day Collective Standard Verde formula. That formula is not this formula, but it implies that you always have that bound. So again, G is the genus of the curve, and the conductor is some kind of, what's the device, but it's something that gathers the information of, if you look at the elliptic curve, and you let's say Let's say you reduce the coefficient modulus of primes, you get a curve defined for field, and that curve can be singular or not. If it's singular, then the kind of singularity will be encoded in that conduct. And so you counting how singular it is or what kind of singularity. So this is an integer. So this bound, it's called symmetric because Because it does not depend on k in the sense that if you look at the finite extension of k or even if you take k bar, this is still true. So regardless of the bound, this data does not depend on the bound. And so you want the goal is, okay, so you have that, and you will want to do better than this if you consider just Just a specific case or a specific extension, right? Or try to do that. As I'm going to be in fluid, talk about four. Okay, so one thing to make it at least explicit somehow, if you take a finite field, if there's this guy here, that quantity is the degree of the L function that is associated to, for those who are aware of that, that's exactly the degree of the L function that is associated with the actor. And that's it. And moreover, so ESD tells you we have an equality here. So this is, so remember that. So this is, so remember that, okay, I didn't mention it, but um so when you have non-constant chain parent, the L function is actually a polynomial. So here I'm writing what's the order of vanishing of that polynomial at the value t equals 1 over t. So BST is saying these things are equal. It turns out that over a function filled with finite constant field, we know this is always true that we have that value. Always true that we have that there. So it's just to parenthesis, this is true. And that's to give you a kind of understanding of what kind of, what is this representation? So now we want to have a bound that will depend actually on the field representative. So I'm just going to introduce some quantities vaguely, unfortunately, but Unfortunately. But some animal numbers are some kind of measure of that the local events that you get within the leptic curve. They have been classified by Kodara and are related to some behavior of some fibers if you consider the elliptic curve of the surface. But I guess so. You have some group, it's called a group of components of the curve. And it turns out you can just you can split it into some smaller Split into some smaller groups. And the order of these guys, these are the megamong numbers. But these are fine. Everything is finite there. These are the order of these all these small groups are the megawatt numbers. And so depending on what kind of... So remember when I was saying take care of you look at the curve module prime, it can give you a curve that's singular. You have different kind of singularity. Additive reduction is when you have a cost. When you have a cost, as I said already, so you have a specific team or you have you have also a node, a null curve. So, depending on the type you have, this is the kind of order you expect to have for these groups. And what is nice is what is nice is that you can actually compute these guys. This information can be computed algorithmically in the setting of algorithms. And the setting of analytic curves is called this algorithm. Okay, so if I give you an elliptic curve, you can, using that, you can give me this data. So you can tell me what is the order of this. This is implemented in MacMan for the subject. So their theorem was about the curves. So the setting was, you have, so L is prime, just to make it clear that's what I'm saying. L is prime difference with the curve. L is prime different from the characteristic. K is a perfect field that in their setting was different from 2 and 3 the characteristic. And this is the absolute Galois group of the, it's called the geometric field. So instead of having SQ per, like, instead of having SQT, I'm putting in bar. So I'm looking at algebraic, a given algebraic culture. And then I look at the absolute And then I look at the actual group. We're assuming that the action on this was transitive. What kind of group can act like that? It's not too etc. Just a few different. But actually, this is what acts like this Can I trace it? So that that zero here is that point and everything I referred to initially. That point NFT referred to initially. The bracket L means I'm looking just at the points, the torsion point of order L. So the points that have order. Remember, this has a group structure. So you're looking at the torsion sort of group of elements order divisible by L. So if L is at least three, then you have this kind of rate. This information here, so everything there, finite dimensional vector spaces over L. This is... Is that guy, but I'm looking at the output. Okay, so this is a finite dimensional vector space. And so this is what this represents. So this, I can compute an explosively difficult curve. The Picard group are, I think for most people, you would be happy if I say a class group, because that's what this is. So you take the visors, you put out like divisors. And D and C, sorry, D and E plus. D and D plus are given explicitly. So these are curves. This is given by the equation psi of L of X. So this is called the L Division polynomial. Its roots are explicitly the x coordinate of the point where L of the elliptic curve, customer, L squared minus 1 divided by 2 because L is different. And D is given, which is an extension of the other one. So you're saying that you want. You're saying that you want your x, so you want to consider the points, one point of order L. So you have this condition, it's a root of order L on that elliptic curve. So that's basically what it is like. So you have a condition like that. And for L equals 2, simplifies a little bit. So you will replace your D plus by C, so the base curve. And the D is moves. The D is that cubic problem. So, to give you an example, if you don't know anything about Picard group, in that setting, let's say C is P1, the Picnic group is Z, so it's torsion free, so this guy will go away in that example. So this is something that we call an arithmetic refinement of the geometry found. Because if you look at K bar, so look here, there's no K bar, right? So, look here, there's no k bar. That's a function. If you put a k bar, it will give you the bound that was given by Hugs and Center, which you'll believe. So it is arithmetic in the sense that it's worth that bound if you look at K or some finite extension. So they prove that it's always a refinement of the geometric bound when L equals 2 and when equals L equals 3 if you assume If you assume that there's no cubic root of unity in the constant field. And sometimes they were able to prove that for bigger L, and some examples that also found another example that's true for elements. Okay, so that's what they did. They worked with L dick curves, and now we're going to more general, and we'll replace the L ticker by abolid varies, and we'll get rid of some of the assumptions. Okay, so the context is actually the same, or almost the same. So you have a perfect field. You have again, this is the same nice curve as before. You can take it what we want. Now you look at an abelian variety, so that's a generalization of an electric curve. One of the most known examples is a Jacobian. So you take a curve and you conform the Jacobian. So that's one example of Of kind of abelian group structure, let's say, and has some dimension, elliptic curve equals d equals one. And there's something here. It's kind of the constant part that is inside that L variety. So the 10 formula is the largest angular sub variant, okay? It can be defined over 10. We don't want that somewhere. So we're just going to assume that it doesn't exist. Well, that is. Doesn't exist. Well, that is true, maybe. It did exist very true. And you have a similar geometric problem. Like, if I put a one, that's exactly the same thing. And conductor can be determined in a similar way. There's a way to write that formula if you don't assume trivial phrase, but the work is more involved, and we decided to focus just on the constant terms because it's also an analog is one would say the natural. Let's say the natural generalization of what was done before. So I have to talk about neuromodels because that's related to, well, that's how you express precisely some of the properties we want. But I'll try to at least highlight what you want to know about that. So let's say I have a nebula paradigm over my field. It's just a different addition for people who know algebraic stronger. Algebraic geometry, but I have another variable function field. I have a neural model. Okay, and so basically, what you want to think about in the error model, I can draw everything, is so that's something that somehow model what the curve is. In the sense that if you have, so let's say you have your curve here, and you have your neural model. Your neural model here. If you look at the point, look at the five, like so all the fibers have some are going to give you some kind of group. So for example, in the case of elliptic curve, most of the fibers, so you have a map between the two things. Most of the fibers in the place of the elliptic curve are going to be elliptic curves. And so make physical intervals. So, like, physical examples, this is going to fit in the raw model. Most of the things are elliptic curves over finite fields. Or, yeah. And over the resident field itself. And the other fibers are going to be like GM and GSL Taurus and Division. But it's kind of modeling what the curve is that it's being here. Behavior. So it has a nice property, it behaves like a group. And what's useful is that this group of points is like the group of force of the element variation. And so you have other things you can define. So this is the connected component that consists at its A element. You can define the quotient. You look at the torches. Now I'll just take the end result. So now the difference is here we're not going to Now the difference is here we're not going to assume anything about the crypto state except that L is different. You have an equilibrium with the same assumptions. And okay, so if you assume that you don't have torsion over that geometric extension, for the heavy elementary parity and it's two volts, there's a meaning for that. For the dictor, that's the same thing. You have a bound. This is the same thing that you have before, but there's a bound. The same thing that you have before, but there are non-trivial reasons why this is the same guy here. This is a detail completed group. I assume most people are not familiar with that, so we'll give you at least a description in terms of the alpha comology. And this is to tell you that the information you have balanced there is also the invariance of the thing you have balanced there, by the absolute log. So, here's what I wanted to say: that group has an explicit description in this form. So, this is a kernel. So, this is a kernel flow. This is Galois homologics. That's how you can describe it. For large enough, this second jump disappear. And over the function field case, this is the seminar group. So I'm bounding, at least for a function field, positive character, say I'm bounding by the dimension of the summer group. And you have an exclusive case, so hyperlight terms have been treated. So hyperlink dictators have been treated. So hyperlink dictators are just like dictators, but maybe that's not correct to say that, but I mean the shape of how they're defined. So y squared equals a neurotoic, a neutral polynomial of the green, and you have a bound that is very similar to what you had for the elliptic curve case. And instead, you're having a Jacobian. So the Jacobian of the curve is. An absolute curve is an ability. So explicit curve. The case example when this is sort of fine-billion example. So you have elliptic curves that you know the bound that is like that and now we have elliptic hydrolliptic curves. And so you see that the assumptions most of them have been freaking out. I didn't talk about. So just with that dude. So the result is true for most of the L. For most of the L, because you have just finite torsion. So, if you avoid the torsion and if you avoid the characteristic, this is true, that bound. It's true for any characteristic, including zero. And it improves also their results with L-ticker, because the L-tickers are examples of evaluative parties. We assume something about the induction of Gaunt group, we didn't say anything about it. So
