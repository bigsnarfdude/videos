Well thanks to the organizers for organizing this and inviting me to talk. This has been a really good couple of days already. And Shrobana talked a little bit about precision in the waveform context. I'm going to talk about whether there is evidence for precision or Precision or anti-aligned black hole binaries in the data so far. And what I'm going to do in the talk is try to subvert a little bit the focus of this conference on ML and suggest that there is still a lot of value in more traditional approaches that target sort of robust features in the data. Okay, so let's say But let's first talk about what we understand about viral black hole mergers so far. We have data from three observing runs, which is public, and we broadly understand the mass distribution of mergers. We know that there's a maxima, a global maxima at about 10 solar masses, another bump at 35 solar masses, and there's like a dip there. And we also know that there's a preference for equilateral. We understand. We understand that the merger rate now increases locally with red chips, and at non-zero, at smaller chips, it's actually higher than what it is locally. We know that spins are small compared to, especially compared to what we see in X-ray binaries, which suggests that maybe there is a different population that is being selected for when you look at what is merging in the Hubble Dem and what is not merging in the Hubble Dem. So these are all very interesting things. These are all very interesting things. But there are a lot of things that we don't understand. We don't understand, in particular, the specifics of how you go from two stars to binaries that merge in a Hubble time. And in part, this is because the theory is very rich. There are lots of potential formation channels, but all of these formation channels have low. Information channels have a lot of aspects of physics which are uncertain. There are many modeling uncertainties, many knobs to turn in software. So one way we can try to understand this physics in such a scenario is ask what robust signatures can we look for. And I would argue that these modeling uncertainties and all of this makes it Makes it much more interesting for us because there are things that we can say that we can learn using gravitational waves that we wouldn't know otherwise. Okay, so this plot from this graphic from Shanika sort of captures the two quintessential formation channels that people talk about. So there's the isolated binary evolution where you start with two stars. With two stars which in a binary already isolated from everything else, and they undergo your usual solar evolution. There's a mass transfer, there are some tidal effects maybe, and eventually they go supernova one after the other, and you end up with two binary black holes which slowly inspiral and merge. The other quintessential formation channel is what's called a dynamical formation channel. And these are mainly cluster-based channels, blob-break clusters. Cluster-based channels, globular clusters, interstar clusters, etc., where you have two black holes that form independently but then get captured through in-body interactions within the cluster, and they form a pair and then eventually merge. There are, of course, several other potential formation channels that people have proposed. Theorists are very creative. So you have AGN disks, hierarchical triples, primordial black holes, and so on. But one interesting thing. One interesting thing is that in a lot of these formation channels, the alignment of the spin of the binary with respect to the orbital angular momentum tells you something about the formation of the binary. And so spin tilts and precession in general can serve as a potential discriminator between formation channels. So this gets us to the question of whether So, this gets us to the question of whether we have seen a precision measure. And several people have touched on this, talking about events already. But in general, precision is subdominant and measuring it is hard. And Hoy et al. in particular did this very careful study where they looked at all of the binaries that we have so far and calculated what SNR essentially of the binary. Essentially, of the binary of the signal can come from precession and created this sort of p-value plot. And what they find is that GW200129 is essentially the only event which has any significant p-value of it being, of it having signs of precision. But not so fast. And when we, Payne et al. did a very careful study of where the evidence for precision. Evidence for precision is coming from in these binaries. So, Derek touched on this a bit in the morning, but what they find is that support for precision only exists between a very narrow frequency band within in LIGO Livingston. This in itself is perhaps not very surprising. Livingston was more sensitive than Hanford at this time. But what we do know is that Livingston data was corrupted at the time of 200129 was corrupted. Time of 200129 was corrected by electro-optic homogeneator glitches. And in this paper, they show that based on how you subtract this glitch, you get different values of chi P, chi P being the precision parameter which measures in placement. So yeah, the jury is still up on this. So, well, okay, we can ask maybe, is there evidence for precision at the population level? At the population level. And at first glance, it looks like there is. So these are plots which show the population level distribution of the two effective spin parameters that we usually use. This is the effective inspiral parameter, the mass weighted average of the spins projected along the direction of the orbital angular momentum. And this is the ski-p parameter we saw in the previous slide, which is a We saw in the previous slide, which is a measure of the in-plane spin. And both of these seems to suggest that there are some binaries, some fraction of the binaries, which have some in-plane spin or have an anti-aligned or have a tilted, I mean an anti-aligned tilt, sorry. So for example, chi-p, it seems to peak kind of about there. And this is, in particular, even more important. Particular, even more important because we measure chi-effective very well, and it seems to suggest that there is a fraction of the population which has negative chi-effectives, which can only happen when you have at least one component being anti-agonic. However, again, not so fast, Rollette et al. showed that when you try to model chi-effective with using a distribution which explicitly includes a non-spinning component in the form of a Component in the form of a mixture model, you get a posterior that sort of peaks at zero, and you don't really have any evidence for a negative chi-effective that part of the population is consistent with zero. And some of you might have heard about Fuller and Ma and this idea of efficient angular momentum transport in stars, which suggests that this hypothesis suggests that stars like lose. Suggests that stars lose most of their orbital angular momentum through winds and during the supernova and whatnot. And so you should not really have a lot of binaries which have a large spin. And maybe this is supporting that hypothesis. Shanika conducted a similar study using component spins. Using component spins, Component spins, but again, with this sort of mixture model kind of analysis, where do they again find a large sort of spike at zero and not a lot of evidence for population at negative high effectives? However, Callister et al. argued that there are degeneracies in these multi-component models which can artificially boost up the zero spin excess. Um, the zero spin access, and they demonstrated by having spikeless catalogs, spike being oops, sorry, spike being that sharp delta function-like feature there. And they demonstrated this using spikeless catalogs, which still seem to show some recovery for a spike. And okay, so now at this point, you might say, this is all very confusing. Is this really what's going on here? What's going on here? And so, this is kind of the question that I want to ask at this juncture: is: can we build a robust but flexible parametric model which sort of bypasses these issues with other models, which is not based on mixture models, but which can, based on how the data looks, it can support either a spiky feature at small expense, or it can have a tail at negative hydrologics. And the answer is yes, we can, but let's take a step back and ask before we do that what signatures we should expect in this chi-effective distribution when you have multiple formation channels. So I would like to divide all of the formation channels into two categories. First one is what I call random. These are formation channels in which the alignment carrying is random. So nuclear clusters, drug near star clusters, maybe hierarchical triples. Maybe hierarchical couples. Preferentially aligned channels where you have some degree of preferential pairing. And the thing I want to do here is be very agnostic about what this preferential pairing looks like. So this is a schematic plot which shows the tilt distribution for these two channels. And for a random channel, you have a uniform distribution in tilt, whereas for this sort of preferentially aligned channel, you can have some distribution. Again, we're not making very small. Have some distribution. Again, we're not making very strong assumptions. So now, if this is what tilt distributions can look like, what can a chi-effective distribution look like? And can we find any robust signatures in chi-effective distributions without making strong assumptions about what the tilt distribution would look like? So we can sort of look at two extremes to see, to consider useful signatures. In the first extreme, Useful signatures. In the first extreme, I think of a case where there is a, and remember, these are all multiple, I'm looking at cases where there are multiple formation channels. In the first extreme, I look at the case where there is a large random component and a small preferentially aligned component. In which case, you can have something that looks like this, right? You can have the random component, it has to be symmetric about zero because pairing is random. Whereas this preferential L and you don't know what it looks like, it's just smaller compared to other. Compared to other. Or maybe you have something like this, where you have a chi-effect, where you have a large preferential random component and a small random component. So these are, again, schematics, they're illustrative, but these do tell us something about signatures we can look for in this sort of, in the case where you have multiple populations that are contributing. So you can have things like asymmetry about the global mode of the distribution, right? So asymmetry about the global mode. You can have asymmetry about zero. You can have asymmetry about zero in both of these cases. You can have some sort of multimodal structure. So looking for signs like this can help us test if there are multiple channels that are really contributing to the data or if it is just the one channel. Okay, so for all of these reasons, we introduce what we call this Q-normal model for effective spin. This is a simple parametric model. You take your usual normal distribution. You take your usual normal distribution and then you add this term, which is an error function, but that it has a special, it has an extra parameter, eta effective, which allows you to independently move the two tails of the distribution. So these independently adjustable tails allow you to capture skewness. It's flexible enough now to capture both an anti-aligned population and a population with a zero spin axis. Population with a zero spin access. It is uni-modal though, so it's not satisfying all the, it's not looking for all of the conditions that we looked at in the previous slide. So, what happens if you use this model on public data? So, this is data, this model fit to the first three observing runs, data from the first three observing runs, and what we find is that this is skewed towards positive chi-factor. However, the However, the mode of the distribution is consistent with zero. So, if you remember what it looks like for the Gaussian case, the mode has sort of moved back and now it's lying squarely at zero. But there is support for an anti-aligned population. The rise here is much more rapid, but but it's not i i the data the model seems to suggest that there is still a strong step for uh some population at negative hierophantics. Population at negative chi effectives. And remember, this is a model which could have looked like that. It could have had a very sharp drop at negative chi-effectives so that it's entirely consistent with having positive values and a spiky distribution of zero, but it doesn't seem to prefer that. So because this model doesn't really make a lot of strong assumptions, we can make some robust conclusions from that. Make some robust conclusions from this. So, this data, this model seems to require that at least 20% of the population has a negative chi-effective. And this is consistent with some of the default models that we used in the VK analyses, the truncated Gaussians and so on. And I've tested like a couple of variations of models which have this sort of skewness, and our conclusion seems to be fairly robust against these choices, against modeling choices. There's also an excess, of course, the skewness also indicates that there's an excess at positive values. And you can then ask what's the value of this excess, right? How much more mass is present here compared to the corresponding value there? And if you think about it, and that turns out to be at least about 12% for this model. But if you think about it, this should be a very conservative lower limit on the fraction of. Lower limit on the fraction of the aligned population without making any assumptions about what the aligned population could look like. Because a random population cannot give you any excess in one direction or the other. And as I said, we've tested another model which can also have skewness. So this is parameterized very differently. And this also seems to have reached very consistent conclusions. Asymmetry is about 13%. Is about 13%, and at least 22% of the population in this model has high effective less than zero. There are also interesting things about this asymmetry that we are finding and the chi-factQQ correlation that a lot of people here probably have heard of. But just to recap, we found that, or Calceratol at first found, that chi-fact2 and q. Found that chi-effective and Q of binary black convergers have this sort of anti-correlation, whereas you get to higher chi-effective values, you get to more and more asymmetric binaries. And actually, this by itself implies the presence of an aligned population because this is behavior that you won't get if you had only clusters, for example, contributing to the data. But if you take the marginal distribution of this correlated model and ask, okay, Related model and ask, okay, what does the chi-effective distribution look like when they marginalize over Q, you also get this sort of skewed model that looks very similar to what we recover just based on our skew normal fields. Okay, as I said before, we did not, the skew normal model alone does not account for the fact that this distribution can also be multimodal. Also, be multimodal when you have multiple populations. And this is something that we tried to test here by including a mixture model. So, lambda AL here is the fraction of BBH monitors from an aligned channel. And here we are assuming that there are at most two distinguishable populations that are contributing to the data. The random channel can be modeled as a caution because it has to be symmetric with a mean of zero. mean of zero and we use this q normal distribution for the preferentially aligned channel so it has more general shape and placement. So it turns out when you put this, use this with data from the first three runs, we find that pi effective is not really bimodal. In fact, the posterior on lambda l peaks at either 0 or 1. So it's indicating that the data is consistent with either a large. A large, so let me actually use the plot to explain that. So we can ask if the posterior lambda L is kind of bimodal, what do each of the modes look like? And that's what this plot is showing. So the plot on the left is a PPD of all of those samples in our population run which have a lambda AL less than 0.5. So this is the most. So, this is the mode where you have the random population dominating, and this is kind of what it looks like. And this is the other case where you have a preferentially aligned population dominating in your posteriors. And remember, as I said, lambda L is bimodal. So, it's peaking at small values of lambda L and also peaking at large values of lambda L. Both of these suggest that spins are small, there's no real There's no real, really large excess at zero, and there's no strong evidence for bimodality in the chi-effective distribution either. Okay, so yeah, so just some final thoughts. In the individual event, if you look at just individual events, there's no conclusive evidence for precision up until. Session up until GWTC3. But population modeling seems to suggest that there is a presence of anti-aligned binaries, and at least 20% of the binaries are anti-aligned, and 15% are preferentially aligned. And I want to reiterate, these are like, I think, fairly strong conclusions at this point. And that sort of brings me to the second point that I want to make, which is looking for robust signatures. Looking for robust signatures can help us make clear-cut statements. And this is, I think, especially true in population analyses because we have so many formation channels and so much physics that we don't understand, a lot of uncertainties. And so, something like this would be, I think it's worth doing in the future because I don't think we'll understand populations very well anytime soon. And so it's, I think, something like. And so I think something like this is complementary to things like simulation-based inference, per se, or different ML techniques that we can use for understanding populations. That's all I have. Thank you. Okay, good. A very nice question. So when you said that the finance will give you When you said that the finance will be preferentially aligned in AGNDs, is it true in general? Because if the mergers are happening in a migrant tract in an AGNDs, they won't be preferency aligned. Also, it depends on the age of the AGNDs and the age of the binaries itself. So claiming that the binaries will be pregnancy aligned in an agent, there are carriers to be correct. Yeah, I mean, I'm not saying that binaries are necessarily aligned in an agent desk. Aligned in an AGN disk. I'm saying it is possible that AGN disk can give you preferentially aligned binaries. Right? Okay. Yeah, I'm not saying that. I'm not asserting that. Have you tried varying the mean of the first couple sheet? Did you do that? The mean of the first couple sheet. As in the mean of the random population? Yeah, so you have a picture of one skew normal and the normal center. Yes. So if you allow the first meet, the normal distribution meet the parity. But you wouldn't expect that for a cluster or a random channel, right? You won't, but just from just to see if so so if if you allow it to vary, then this means that you're just imposing a prior and then you need to set it to zero. Prior, that need to set it to zero. I was just wondering if that can affect your inference just from an analysis perspective. Not entirely sure, because if the distribution looks like a mean, if the total character distribution looks like a mean which is offset from zero, right, then the posterior can converge to like a small lambda or a large lambda al and this eta l. And this etaile being close to zero, then that would give you a population which looks like a Gaussian with an offset, right? So I think the model itself has flexibility to sort of move there. That is what the data is suggesting. So a single Delhi then would still mean that your model can look at the model. Yeah, it can look at all. So can you flash your final slides or something? Just thinking, I'm just trying to get a take-home message. So how does these two statements compare with the latest model-based population inference? The 20% binaries are anti-aligned and 2% are potential line. How does it so what is the corresponding statement from the latest, greatest model-based Model based by model based, do you mean like what the LBK has done? Or updates of that? So I think I don't know about this. This is consistent with, so with the, within the, the, the default model that we put out in GWTC3 is this Gaussian model where we assume that the chi effective distribution is is is like a symmetric Gaussian. Is like a symmetric Gaussian, right? Or unskew Gaussian. And with that model, also, you'll find at least about 20% of the binaries at least are undialigned. So in that sense, it's consistent with that, but inconsistent with these spiky models at zero that some people seem to be finding. Just follow up with that question. So this 15% of the band is. Question: So, this 15% requirement differentially aligns is something new we found from the data, or others have also found something. I don't know if anyone has commented on that, but it's not something that's coming from just this model. I mean, you can do what I did to get this, right? So, if you all this is, all that's coming from, all that's doing is is saying what's the mass on the positive side, what's the mass on the negative side, and subtracting that. And that's where the 15% number comes from, right? For this it's 12%, roughly it's 15%, depending on which Q normal model we use. But anyway, so this is something that we can use for, we can do for any model. But at least for the different skew normal models we've tested, they all seem to sort of converge around this 12 to 17 percent number. So, which is where like all the LBK papers, that pop population paper, they mainly focus on the finding how many of them are anti-aligned or some misalignment. So, I guess the statement you are making is that at least 15% of the population is aligned. Aligned. Yes. Yeah, I think in part because finding anti-aligned binaries was the tricky part. Like we always knew that there were binaries which have close to perfect alignment. That was never in doubt, right? Because finding binaries that are anti-aligned or finding the fraction of the population that is anti-aligned that was hard. But I think it is still useful to have this sort of like conservative lower limit on uh the fraction of aligned binaries of protection. I like batteries, a potential look at the O4B population paper and you focus on in terms of alignment on just the inferences on the spin tilting, a lot of high-effective, it's about 50-50, right? The numbers, 44%, have spin tilts negative. So it's like there there's a subtlety here in that you're teasing out two kind of different components, right? And you're one that's preferentially aligned and one that's kind of symmetrically aligned, right? That's kind of symmetric, right? And so your symmetric one also has a bunch that are aligned. Yes, but that's why this is conservative, is because we are not saying what is a fraction of the population that's aligned. We are saying what is the excess that is aligned. A symmetric distribution should give you equal number at both negative and positive values. So one thing I can't tease out of this paper quickly is there's the fraction, right, between the isentropic spin tilts and the the isentropic spin tilts and the preferentially line spin tilts. So you just the read-off from that fraction what the LPK both repopulations number is for the same thing, right? Yes, I think you can. Yeah, like I said, this number is not something inherent at this level. I'm just saying, in terms of Ajit's question about what has been done before, at least with this, which by now is somewhat old, right? But at least for the LBK. Hold, right? But at least for the LBK O3B populations paper, you could take the fraction that's in the preferential line, and everything else is in the isotropic component, so that was equal on each side, and you could count the SS in the line. And unfortunately, it's not plotted, so I have to dig up the parameter. Uh well, you're getting set up. Um I just wanted to ask I hope everybody received an email about uh oh well, with a link to a Google Doc about uh Thursday's uh tick About Thursday's thing. So, if you're interested in saying something or want to talk about something, please add to that. Okay, two more talks and then we go to dinner. So, hello, everyone. My name is Amitesh, and I work with Anrada and a couple of other collaborators, and Lieutenant Kunsar.
