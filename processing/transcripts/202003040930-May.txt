I forgot if I were equivariant. Off to a great start. Equivariant is not as assumed. It's just assumed, I guess. Not the piatic hodge structure, I think. Thank you to the organizers for inviting me. It's already been a really fun conference, and I've never been to Banff before. And I've never been to Banff before, and it's awesome. So I'm really excited to be here. And I want to tell you about rational equivariant K-theory. And so I should say that all of this work is joint with Anna-Marie Bowman, Christy Hazel, Jocelyn Ishak, and Magdalena Kitzwarth. And the main theorem in this work is that for a finite abelian group, not as necessary. Not necessarily C2, if you've seen my talks before, for a finite amelior group. There is a unique naive commutative ring structure on rational aquagariant complex behavior. I forgot equagariant again. I forgot equivariant again. I'll just put a G there, and then you'll know that it's equivariant. Okay, so I think that the proof techniques that we used are a little different than the usual sort of thing to prove these kinds of things. And so I want to tell you a little bit about the proof and first sort of set the stage in the non-equivariant case. Okay, so in general, spectra are complicated, it turns out. I guess that's why we study them. And when you write And when you rationalize, of course, things get much easier. So, Sayre observed this and computed the stable homotopy groups of a rational sphere spectrum. And he found q, of course, in degree zero and zero else. And I'd say that's considerably simpler than the non-rational story. So that's quite a bit nice. Quite nice. And then And then I want to use this work of Shveda and Shipley that says not just in homotopy, but actually a more rigid structure. So in fact, they prove there's a colon equivalence. I guess really a zigzag of colon equivalences. between modules over an island-break-mclane spectrum and chain complexes of modules over the ring that you started with. Okay, so in particular, if we take the sphere spectrum, well, Sarah tells us that that is Sarah tells us that that is the Librum planned spectrum for Q. And so we learned that rational spectra, there's a zigzag of colon equivalences to chain complexes of vector spaces. Okay, and I'll just denote this little sub q for that whole zigzag. It's a complicated thing. Okay, and Thing. Okay, and this is now a nice algebraic category that we can work in, and in fact, it's a really nice algebraic category. So, in fact, if we look at any chain complex, any rational chain complex, then we're going to find out that it's formal, which means there's a different kind of zigzag. So, there's a zigzag. So there's a zigzag of quasi-isomorphisms between our chain complex and its homology. So thinking of that as a chain complex with a differential being zero, and there's some chain complex we can put in between. And so we might as well just take that simple chain complex. Okay, so this really tells us that this category of chain complexes is just graded. It's just graded vector spaces over q. It's not so complicated. Okay, so rationally things are really quite nice. But of course, ring spectra are even more complicated than spectra. And so we want to study rings. And Shipley showed that this zigzag of colon equivalences in their previous work did not. Did not, it wasn't a symmetric monoidal zigzag of colon equivalences. And so she came up with another zigzag of colon equivalences that gave us algebras in, I'll just work in the rational case now, so in rational spectrum, a zigzag of colon equivalences to there's so many categories pulling around, I'm mixing them all up. Okay, to algebras, of course, in this category we're working with. In this category, we were working with. So, gene complexes of rational vector spaces. Okay, and of course, here, what do those look like? We usually call those rational DGAs. Okay, so we do actually have a monoidal version of this, and if we want to study ring spectra rationally at least, we could just study them over here in this algebraic category. But now things are a little bit more complicated. So, in particular, not every DGA is formal. Every DGA is formal. So this study of rational DGAs already is a little bit more interesting. Not yet. Yeah, so I didn't say anything about commutative yet. I just mean rings. But I'm getting there. That's after this remark. Okay, so all I want to do is. Okay, so all I wanted to say is that not all DGAs are formal. So in particular, well you can come up with all sorts of examples, but if I look at, if I have anything with non-trivial massy products, well, to compute massy products, you need things that support different. Compute massive products, you need things that support differentials, and so this definitely tells you that your DTA is not formal. Okay, so things are a little bit more complicated here. And the commutative case, as you asked, that's really what we're interested in. And so Richter and Schipley proved that if you want commutative algebra objects in rational spectra, well, then you get a zigzag of closed. Well, then you get a zigzag of colon equivalences to commutative objects in our algebraic category. And maybe let me just say, well, I'll write it. So commutative chain complexes. And now here, that really does mean C DGAs. So graded commutative DGAs. Okay, and in fact, this is already true at the DGA level, so certainly I could find non-formal things. I could find non-formal things in CDGAs as well. Okay, I'm seeing some funny looks, which usually means I've made a mistake at the board when I'm teaching. Are we okay so far? Okay, good. There's a parentheses. Oh, here. That's so quick part. When you try to compile, they are. Thanks. Okay. So, what was the point of this whole story? The upshot is that when I look at CD. When I look at C DGAs rationally, this is an algebraic model for rational spectra. Well, for commutative rational ring spectra. Okay, and so I might hope that it's much easier to study things in this algebraic setting, right? Turns out algebra is also hard. Is also hard. But at least there's some hope that this is quite a bit simpler than thinking about spectra. Okay, so that looks promising. I can just play around with chain complexes. The downside is that this zigzag is really quite complicated. So in practice, it's really quite hard to take some, your favorite rational commutative ring spectrum and send it over and find out what CDGA you actually have. What CDGA you actually have. Okay, so I'm going to say that that's like sending some x over to theta x. That's what I'll call my algebraic model of this thing. So this is some C D G A. And the question is, what is it? How do we compute it in our favorite examples of rational spectra? Okay, I actually mostly don't know how. Mostly don't know how. So that's unfortunate because, like I said, this zigzag is complicated. It goes through several steps. But by pure luck, I sometimes can find an answer. So we do know not necessarily what we get at the end immediately, but we know that the homotopy of X, our rational commutative ring spectrum, is going to influence. Commutative ring spectrum is going to inform what C D GA we have in the sense that this should give us the homology of this C D G A. Okay, so I know the homology of the chain complex I'm after, and the whole idea is if I can compute the homotopy groups of x, which are hopefully easier because it's rational. So if we know pi star of x and And we land over in CDGAs and we find out that this thing that we got is formal. I guess it doesn't make a difference whether I put the homology there or not, but let me just call that theta x. If it turns out that C D G A is formal, then I do know what it is. I might as well just take it to be the homology. Okay, so Then we can identify theta x. Okay, so that's the game that I'm hoping to play. As an example, I like to have lots of examples in mind. So say I take any C D G A, I'll call it A, and I know that I end up with the homology of A concentrated in degree zero. Then actually, this is going to be for me. And the proof is fairly easy, so I might as well tell you about it. I'm going to take my A, I want to find a zigzag to the homology of A, and I can just put in the middle here the zeroth truncation of this CBDA. So this is just A in all positive degrees, and in degree zero, I stick in. Positive degrees, and in degree zero, I stick in the zero cycles, then in zero goal of that. And this, of course, includes into A, and will be a quasi-isomorphism. And there's a map to the homology, and that's also going to be a quasi-isomorphism, and so this thing is formal. Okay, so I guess that tells me if this is some ring, then when I look at the Eilenberg-McLean spectrum, and let's work rationally so that we can make these claims using this zigzag of polar. Using this zigzag of colon equivalences, I send that over and I get some rational C DGA, which I'll call theta of that thing. And I might as well, up to equivalence, just take that to be, its homology. And so I can just take that to be R, concentrated in degree zero. And then, of course, the differentials are zero because everything is zero. Okay, that one I'm silly. Okay, so Eilenberg-McLean spectra are sort of, we know. Spectra are sort of, we know the model here. They're unique. Okay. That's, of course, not the case that I'm interested in. So I want to look at K-theory. In particular, I want to look at complex K-theory, and let's rationalize. Okay, so that periodicity tells us the homotopy groups here. I guess it actually even tells us the homotopy groups integrally. So pi star of Ku is the integers adjoin a bot class beta and its inverse. So here the bot class is in degree u. Okay, and if I want the rational version, The rational version, then I find that I can just tensor with q, and so of course I have q adjoin beta and its inverse. Okay, so I know the homotopy, which means I know the homology of the chain complex I get. And in fact, if I take any C D GA, rational C D G A, of course, I'm really always working rationally here, with With the homology given by what we're after, so q of 9, theta, and its inverse, then this is going to be formal. Okay, so let's prove it. Well, I'll tell you most of the proof, I suppose. And the key is that this chain complex is very nice. It's concentrated in 80 degrees, it's easy to take. It's easy to take a resolution. And so, in fact, the Casole complex will give us a resolution. Maybe, let's say it gives us the zigzag. So what do I mean by that? I have my chain complex A. I'm trying to get a zigzag to its homology, which we know is Q divided beta and its inverse. And I want to put something in the middle. And what I can do is take In the middle, and what I can do is take the free graded commutative C D GA. Wait, I think I said commutative too many times. Okay, but the free, yeah, you know what I mean, right? Okay, so I want to take the free C D GA that sort of has this as its homology. And the problem is that I don't necessarily know that beta is actually invertible in A. I only know it's invertible up to some boundary because I know it's invertible in homology. So I can't just map the homology over. map the homology over to A. So I'm going to put something in between that looks like Q adjoin gamma. Gamma is going to play the role of beta. I'll put in a gamma bar to be beta's inverse. And then I just need to identify those actually as each other's inverses. So I'll put in a class y. And so I have this polynomial thing that's the free DGA, free C D GA on this, tensor and exterior on y. Here gamma is in degree 2. Here, gamma is in degree 2. Gamma bar, of course, is supposed to be beta's inverse, so it's in degree minus 2. And y is in degree 1. And of course, that tells me from rated commutativity that y squared is 0. So that's why I have exterior on y. That was really a free thing. And what am I going to do here? I'm just going to set it up so that d of y is 1 minus gamma, gamma bar. And I find some lift of beta over here. Some lift of beta over here, and that'll give me a positive inverse, and I can map gamma over to beta here. Okay, so this thing will be formal. Quick! I guess that ends the proof. It's rare I think that I can fit a proof into a talk, so I'm excited. Okay, of course, what is the problem? Okay, of course, what is the consequence that we learn from this? We send Ku rationally over to the algebraic model, and we can just take this to be equal to Q adjoin beta and its inverse, the chain complex with differential being zero. I guess really only the C D G A differential being zero. Okay, great. Great. And by going back through the zigzag of colon equivalences, because I know this is unique on the algebraic side up to a zigzag, I know it's unique on the topological side. And so I guess we've learned there's a unique commutative, by which I mean the infinity ring structure. On, and I guess we've played this game now for any. Now for any island rib and clan spectrum, where R now has to be commutative ring, and also rational Ku. Okay, by the way, this whole thing would have worked if I just had beta and not its inverse. So this also works for little Ku, the connective cover. I would get the same kind of statement. All right, that turns out, I mean, it was very easy to prove, and in fact, It was very easy to prove, and in fact, it's not necessarily so interesting. Baker and Richter proved something much stronger. So they showed actually there's a unique E infinity ring structure on Ku without rationalizing. And they showed a bunch more. So, okay, of course, when I rationalize, I'm not really surprised that it's. I'm not really surprised that it's still unique. But all right, that's nice that sort of makes sense in the context of what we've said so far. We haven't contradicted anything. And this proof uses, I think it's Robinson, but certainly some obstruction theory. So it's quite complicated. And in the rational case, we got this nice, very easy proof. Is that theorem really stronger, or is it just different? I mean, like, if you rap, how do you know that if you rationalize? How do you know that if you rationalize, there's not just unless you, unless you does this theorem really imply that after you localize, it's still unique? I believe so, but I haven't, I didn't actually think about it that hard. I don't think it does. Maybe it doesn't. I guess because you could have an E-infinity structure that, or on the rational one, that did left, that did left. Ah, okay. But if we go there, we go. Well, somehow I feel like in their paper they mention the rational thing. But I'm not sure. I don't remember. I haven't looked at that one in a while. So they certainly prove it for not rational KU. I think they might prove it for rational KU, but at the very least, I guess what I meant by stronger is this feels like a more important object to me. Harder, but you feel like it's not. Feels harder. Okay. Feels harder. Okay. So, what was the goal of our project? Well, the idea is that we want to understand this situation equivariantly. So, we were really thinking about what is the image of equivariant rational Ku in an algebraic model. Okay, so now I want to tell you about the equivariant story. Of course, ring spectra are complicated, and equivariant spectra, I think, are maybe more complicated. They're certainly more complicated than just spectra. And so this story is a little bit more complicated. And ultimately, I want to get to the commutative ring structure. And there, I think equivariantly, it's safe to say that things are extra complicated. Say that things are extra complicated. So, anyway, that's what we're after. So, Margelena showed in the equivariant setting that there's a zigzag of polon equivalences. Well, between now, I want to take rational G spectrum. Want to take rational G spectra or G spectra and then rationalize. And here I really mean genuine G spectra. So of course here we have lots of flavors of equivariant spectra. And I want to look at the genuine case. And she showed there's a colon equivalence, or really zigzag of colon equivalences to this category that's a product of a bunch of categories. So this is going to look like a bunch of chain complex categories, much like we saw. Categories, much like we saw in the non-equivariant case. But now we have to take into account the equivariants, and so these are Q-adjoin WGH modules. And here, of course, WGH is the bile group, so that's the normalizer mod H. And I guess that sort of makes it clear, but of course, I mean here that H is a subgroup, and these parentheses mean that I'm looking at conjugacy classes of subgroups. Classes of subgroups. Okay, so we have a nice algebraic model. G is finite. Yes, G was finite the whole time. Okay, yeah, so in the genuine equivariant setting, I also have this nice algebraic model. It's a little bit more complicated, but really this just means. More complicated, but really this just means sort of I have a bunch of these kinds of chain complexes and now they have some equivariance. Okay, and I believe that this proof uses the old zigzag and then zigzags, like it zigs and zags some more after that, and so this is even harder to trace through what anything is going to look like in this model. And I should also say this was preceded by work that suggested this might be true by Greenleaz and May. By Greenleys and May. May, I meant to say John Greenleys and Peter May. I'm not trying to take credit here. Long before my time. So they showed that the homotopy category of rational G spectra is equivalent to a category of graded G mapping functors where you rationalize. That looks like a very algebraic thing, and of course, I expect that to some degree because when I look at the homotopy of one of these G spectra, it's valued in machufunctors. So I expected macu functors would be involved. That's no surprise. Okay, the proof uses this idempotent splitting of our Burnside ring, well, really rationally. Okay, so tensor with Q everywhere. And we get an item potent splitting of the burn side ring. And the burn side ring acts on everything, so that's going to give us an item potent splitting. I skipped a step. I skipped a step. Hold on. I was backing up. Of macu functions and spectra. And what I was supposed to be telling you about just now is that the category of macu functors, rationally itself, so here I have graded macu functors, and each one of those gradings is gonna split into a product over conjugacy classes. Over conjugacy classes of subgroups of hub adjoin file group modules. Okay, so this is where I use the item photos king. And then putting all those graded macu functors together, we get this homotopy category of rational G structure. So let me just give some notation for what that looks like. So down here at the bottom in this Machufunctor setting, I take some Machu functor and there's an item potent in the rational burn side ring, and then I apply that to my Machu functor, and then I take the Gmod H part of this new item potent Macu functor. Okay, and so I just end up with a vector space. Oh, but it's not just a vector space, it has a bio group action. Okay, so that's how I get my QIDOIN. My QA Join file group module. Okay, but unfortunately, now when you look at the commutative case and you take commutative objects in rational g spectra, then you don't get that that's colon equivalent to commutative objects in the algebraic model over here. I don't want to write this full-on thing every time, so let me. Every time. So let me call this. Does that color show up? It just looks the same as the other color. It looks the same as the other colour. Which is really what you want in a color. Does that one show up? Okay, so I'm just going to call this A of G Q for my algebraic model. Okay, and so commutative objects in this A of G Q, these do not model commutative objects. These do not model commutative objects in G-spectra. And what I mean by that here is I want genuine commutativity. Genuine commutativity. And so I can't just take commutative ring objects on both sides. Okay. I got lost in my notes, so let me catch up to myself. Oh, and of course, genuine communitivity, I mean that. Genuine communitivity, I mean that this is the best kind of community. I have all the norms, all that stuff. I can do as long as we're using any other type of community, we're just for the people at home, okay. But if I'm not using with general commutativity, like if I'm just like, you know, the infinity objects in these rational g-spectra, is that then the same thing as the commutative? Yes, and in fact, uh John and Magdalena proved that okay, so they showed that if you look at naive commutative objects in rational G-spectra, then indeed there is a zigzag of colon equivalences to commutative objects. To commutative objects in this algebraic model, which of course, remember, I'm using this notation for this product of chain complexes that all have bile group actions. And this thing decomposes as, maybe I should write, is equivalent to, the product of a bunch of C D G A's. Well, they're not just rational C D G A's, but they have an action of the Bilo group as well by algebra maths. Okay, so Okay, so indeed, if we just take naive commutative, then we're good. And here, of course, we've seen that this is an algebra over an E infinity operad, but with a trivial g action. So I guess none of the norms. Could you say what's, I'm confused, what is the difference between naive and gen and computativity? So, in the genuine case, I should have all the norms on my spectra, and in the naive case, I have none of the norms. So, I just mean that that rational equivalent spectrum is an algebra over an opera that's underlying E infinity, and I give it the trivial G-action. Yeah. Have I said anything false? No. Not really. Genuine means like you can rigidify, you can make it a strictly Rigidify, you can make it a strictly, you can find a strictly commutative model. Yes, yes. That's complicated. You can't do that. I mean, that's true, but it's true for both of the things. And there's different categories with where the rigid models are different homotopically. I have to admit, that is not my area of expertise, so thank you. Excellent. Okay, so what I want Okay, so what I want to do now is send some x over here, over to, I'll still call it theta x, but of course this is the equivariant thing. This is going to be the image in the algebraic model. And that's really a bunch of chain complexes. So maybe I could call it theta HX for each conjugacy class of subgroup. And I just mean that I really have a bunch of C DGAs, one for each conjugacy class of subgroup, and each of those. Continuously class of subgroup, and each of those have an action of the five group. So is there actually like a fix for this non-equivalence? Yes. Okay. To be continued. I want to talk about, I just want to say one more thing here, and then I will tell you about the genuine case as well. I like that you guys are anticipating everything I should have been going for. I receive I should have been going faster, I guess. Okay. That part's unprepared, and you're just answering up. Brands out. All right, so I just wanted to point out that when I look at the homology of this thing, of course I really mean the homology of each of the particular C DGAs that I have. And I can think of this as the eidem hoten applied to the homotopy mackerel. applied to the homotopy macu functor evaluated at g mod h. And that's the same as applying a homotopy to the item potent applied to my spectrum. Okay, and just to give us a way to think about that, that gives us the homotopy of the geometric fixed points of our spectrum. Okay, so that's what homology of these chain complexes is encoding for. Okay, so now the genuine case. Now, the genuine case, in recent work, in fact, I think this is fairly recent, like 2019. So, but then in an even more recent work, perhaps, or around the same time, Wimmer gave us a model for the genuine commutative situation. Now, it's a little bit more complicated in a way. So, what he showed is that there's an equivalence of E infinity category, or E infinity category. The other kind of infinity categories. So I can look at commutative, now I mean genuine commutative spectra, equivariant spectra. And what is that algebraic model? Well, he calls this orb C D G A Q. So these are a bunch of rational C D GAs. Rational C D GAs, one for each. Oh, I was about to say conjugacy class of subgroup, and now I'm not sure if it's conjugacy class or the actual subgroup. It probably doesn't matter. They probably end up being the same. But okay, so I have a bunch of rational C D GAs, and I also have maps between my orbits, and so I have maps between those C D GAs here, and those should be algebra maps. So this has things like some chain complex. Some chain complex, really C D G A, maybe at the trivial subgroup. And okay, I'm going to show my true colors. I really just think about CP. So maybe I have one at Cp. And there's a norm in the genuine case. And so here I end up with a shadow of the norm where I have this algebra map between these C D GAs. C DGAs. Okay, and I should also say that we can think of this previous version where we had a bunch of CDGAs over, that were modules over QJoin the file group, that really this is the same as this orb C DGA category, where I only take automorphisms. And those automorphisms give me the actions of the vile group on each of those C DGAs. On each of those CPGAs. So these have actions of the vial group and also these extra norm maps. Whereas these are a bunch of chain complex that are separate. They don't really see each other, except that they were built from the whole spectrum altogether. Okay, so I think that part of the reason to do this in infinity categories is that geometric fixed points maybe don't play so well with model categories. But let me not say more about that. You said it was more complicated because it's an infinity category. Complicated because it's an infinity category, but one thing that's less complicated is that it's just one, it's just a functor, it's not a fixed stack, and it knows what you think. Yeah, so in a way, this is actually just a really nice model. And if we know the geometric fixed points, then we immediately know the homologies of all the things over here. I guess that was true before, but maybe we have a hope of just computing straight across. Okay, I have to admit, I don't know how to do that. So for now, let's go back to the naive case. Okay, so really what we're after is how can we calculate what we get in this algebraic model for some of our favorite spectra. And of course the one that I'm most interested in is rational equivariant K-theory, at least for this particular talk. But why not just do this for all of them? But why not just do this for all of them, right? Find all our favorite rational equivalent G-spectra and see what we get. Okay, so one of the things that we want to use is this proposition that I think shows up in Schmena's book, which says that this really just gives us kind of a fast way to get at this inempotent splitting on machu functors. So for a macu functor m, I want to find. I want to find this item potent applied to my Machu functor and evaluate at the G mod H spot. And Shweda says you can actually just look at your Machu functor at the G mod H spot and mod out by transfers coming from smaller subgroups for proper subgroups. So in particular, I could look at HQ for the constant vacuum object. So this just puts a Q everywhere. So this just puts a q everywhere. And the transfers are the identity. So, all right, that was a pretty fast calculation. We find that isomorphisms, but they're not the identity. They don't have to be the identity? I mean, I think up to isomorphism, they are the identity. I can't identify. Let me work. I can't idea. Let me work out to X more. Perhaps. Okay, so the point here is we have Q at the E spot, because there are no proper subgroups. And then after that, we killed everything. So, okay, this is not really a linear tuple, but we have zeros everywhere else. Okay. And I really sort of brushed something under the rug here because really what I just did was compute the homology of all of these. The homology of all of these things, right? But this is trivially formal, even in the equivariance, and so that really is actually our honest model. Okay, great. Finally, let's get to the one that we're after, which is equivariant K-theory. So I want to look at KUG rationally. And I meant to look this up and I forgot, but I think this is. And I forgot, but I think this is due to Siegel, please correct me if I'm wrong, that the homotopy macu functors of KUG give us the representation ring macu functor really rationalized. We can even say this statement integrally, but I'll just work rationally for now. Join beta and its verse. Shouldn't shouldn't that loss one be constant of q? Because h q is the rational sphere. HQ is the rational sphere. And this isn't the rationalization of the sphere? No, so the rational. Very good. Thank you. This is the, I guess with the G on it, this is the Burnside Machiefunctor rationalized on the verbal spectrum. And actually, since you brought it up, I wanted to do that example, and in the interest of time, I skipped it. But if I do that, then, of course, the sphere spectrum is the unit. And so I should get the unit over here. And that's just going to look like. Here, and that's just gonna look like a bunch of Q's where I do this level-wise tensor product. So, we can compute that sort of for free by knowing that it's the unit, but we can also see it by looking at the Machi functor and bounding out by the transverse. Yeah. Okay, I think I said this, but this RUQ, this is the complex representation ring, Machu functor. Where I guess I've tensored with Q. Okay, and then we want to do some calculation to figure out what we get in this idempoten splitting so that we know the homology of our image. Okay, and somehow this macu functor was How this Machu functor was quite a bit more complicated, but the transfers, I mean, of course, restrictions are restrictions of representations, and the transfers are just induction of representations. So we do really understand that mackerefunctor quite well. And what we did was compute what we get in this algebraic model. So we compute the homology by finding this eidempose. The homology by finding this eigenpose point. And what we end up with is Q adjoin zeta n and then through to unity adjoin beta n its inverse. And this only happens when our subgroup is Cn, so the cyclogroup of order n, and we get zero otherwise. Okay? And Um, and I should say, of course, the vile group should act on these things, and the vile group acts as the Galois group. So the usual permuting, the permittive end-s roots of unity. Okay, so this was a little bit complicated of a calculation, but let me give you some idea of why you might expect this to be true at least. So our proof uses Artin's theorem. Artin's theorem. And I mean, I guess really we discovered this and then realized there's a theorem that would say it for free, which is that rationally, when we look at the representation ring, this is rejected on by induced representations from cyclic subgroups. Okay, so once you Okay, so once you induce that from all the cyclic subcurves, you've hit everything and I've killed the transverse and so everything dies after that. So of course I only expect to get something at cyclic subgroups and then it's a computation that actually you get this field adjoin beta and its inverse. Sorry. I think I spaced out for a moment. The g is a general g. It doesn't matter what the g is, but then just if the h is cyclic, I get this. Just if the H is cyclic, I get this. And if the H is not cyclic, I'll plug this. Yeah, so G is just any finite group. So this is somehow, it's kind of a global field, but. Yeah. Cool. Yeah, and there might be a nice way to prove this globally, though that's not what we did. So I don't know. Is anything known about the non-rational geometric fixed points of G in general? I don't know anything about it. Is there some expression movement? Is there some expression movement? Okay, we don't have quick time. We could, yeah, let's talk about that later. Okay, so I. Alright, I think that maybe part of what's confusing is that I started the story talking about finding abelian groups, and here I am saying this thing for all groups. Okay, so what is the abelian issue? Well, when G is abelian, then this Mile group acts trivial. This vile group acts trivially on the homology of this thing. Okay, so that means that I don't have to account for the equivariance here. Okay, and now actually it's not so bad. So here, the usual Kazoole resolution plus this thing that we call the averaging trick. This thing that we call the averaging trick. This is going to give us formality. Okay, so I know the homology in general, but I don't necessarily know how to get formality when my group is not abelian. Okay, and we basically saw this Kazool resolution before, though we have to scoop it up a little bit. That we have to soup it up a little bit here. So the idea is that I want to take some zigzag between, I guess I'm working at the H spot, between Q adjoin zeta n, and then adjoin beta n its inverse. Okay, and what should I put here? Well, I should put some x that should witness zeta n, but then if I just put polynomial on x, I don't have that it satisfies the n sequence. Have that it satisfies the encyclotomic polynomial, so I'm going to put in something to make that relation. And then, of course, I still need to deal with the beta, so I'll have this gamma gamma bar that's just like what we saw before. So now I'm going to have exterior on y and z. And x here is in degree 0. It's trying to be zeta n. y is in degree 1. Now I can't remember if I called it y or z before, but I guess I mean that z is going to be the witness to gamma. I mean that z is going to be the witness to gamma, gamma bar should multiply to be 1. Okay, and so here d of y should be the n-cyclotomic polynomial on x, so that in homology, that really is a primitive nth root of unity. Okay, so that almost does it, but we need this averaging trick because I don't necessarily know that the action is trivial on my chain complex. I only know that it's trivial on homology. Well, what that means is I can just take any of these classes that I want to send over there. Classes that I want to send over there. I'm going to give this the fixed action, and I can sum over the orbit of the vile group and then divide by the order of the vile group, and I'll get something fixed that does the same job. Okay, and now I see that it was important I was working rationally, right? Because I can divide by the order of the vile group. So actually, I think Vimmer's result is really stronger than the rational thing. He says, away from the group order or something like that. Z hits one. Okay, Z hits 1 minus gamma gamma bar. Yeah. Great. Okay, so then of course I have to make sure these are quasi-isomorphisms, but that's roughly the idea. Okay, so that formality gives us that actually for G abelian, we don't just know the homology. We actually can just take the model to be its homology. Take the model to be ethnomology. So theta KUG rationally is just this thing that we've written down. So Q adjoin an n through of unity, adjoin beta and its inverse, when H is cyclic and zero ups. Okay, so I can just take it to be epomology. Okay, and then the main theorem that I started today with is actually corollary at this point, which says that for geobelions, which says that for geobelian, we found a unique thing in algebraic model. So we're going to lift it back through the Barnes-Greenleys Kajoric work to a naive commutative thing. And there's only one way to do that. So up to equivalents. So that means the naive commutative structure on rational equivariant Ku is Rational equivariant KU is indeed unique. Okay. Great. Trying to think what to say in my remaining time. So I guess maybe let me tell you, since I think a lot of us are interested in the genuine case, kind of what is going on there. But even before that, why do we need this abelian piece? Well, when the bio group action Is non-trivial on homology. It's not so clear how to take this free CDGA that I can map to it. So I really need a free equivariant thing. And so let's just say formality is more complicated. But we're working at it. Okay, so we know the homology, but Okay, so we know the homology, but then saying that that model actually is its homology takes some more work. So I think sometimes we go back and forth on this, but I'm going to state it as a conjecture for the moment, which is that this uniqueness, and we will be able to This uniqueness, and we will be able to prove this formality, and this uniqueness holds for all g. Finite G, of course. Okay, so now in the genuine case, what can we say? Well, now we need to look at equivariant KU and send it over to Vimmer's model. Now that's not a zigzag, even though I drew it as a sort of zigging and zagging arrow. Right now we're in this nice infinity category setting, and so we have maybe kind of a simpler thing. But we still want to compute what we get over here. So maybe let me just call that bar to say that I should have all of these C D GAs that I had before, but also algebra maps between them, seeing the shadow. Maps between them, seeing the shadows of the norms. And for simplicity, let me sort of write the situation for g equals cp to the n. So we do know what the homology looks like for the most part. So I want to look at these same, I know the homology in each spot, is what I'm trying to say. That's what I'm trying to say. Okay, so I have Q adjoin beta and its inverse at the identity or the trivial subgroup, and then I've got Q adjoin zeta p adjoin beta and its inverse at the Cp spot. And now I should have a P squared root of unity at the C P squared spot, and so on. Okay, so I know what the homology is at each place, but now I should have shadows of the norms between them. Of the norms between them. Okay, and that requires some more calculation. We do know these shadows of the norms are algebra maps. And we actually spent a really long time trying to calculate them and got stuck. So that was frustrating. Frustrating. And then we realized we don't have to calculate them because they're unique. So it doesn't matter what they are, they're going to be the same after isomorphism. And that's because in this case, these are all graded fields. So I guess I should have said they're graded algebra maps. So these are all graded fields. And much like in the ungraded field, In the ungraded setting, maps between fields are unique up to isomorphism. So actually, I know exactly what that does. It just includes Q and sends beta to beta up to, you know, some isomorphism. Okay, so we do know what this looks like in Vimer's model. And in fact, I believe that we can say what the homology looks like for any group because we already knew what it is at each spot. What it is at each spot. And if I don't take a cyclic group, I take something in general. Well, I'm only going to see the cyclic group parts, and then everything else is zero. So that's all good. By the way, I should say I mentioned little KU earlier, and somehow everything that we've said here worked for little KU. Just take away beta's inverse. You can still do the formality and all that kind of stuff. And now that would not be true. So if I take away beta's inverse, those are not graded fields. Not graded fields, and so there are choices of norms. But that's for the brutal truncation, little cadence. Sorry, that's for the what? The one with no holotopy and negative degrees. Yes, yes. Yeah, the connective cover. Would it be possible to compute these norms by just going into the representation ring and picking the thing that corresponds to Z to B and then taking some tensor power or something and following it to. Power something and following its image. Yeah, and that's what we were trying to do. And we would get to something and we'd be like, well, does this diagram commute? If it does, then we've done it. And then we'd get stuck. And so we'd be like, okay, well, let's take a completely different track. And then we'd get to some diagram. And if this commutes, we've done it. And we'd get stuck. And so sort of the magic was, we don't have to do all that. It doesn't matter what it is. It's definitely the math you think it is of to isomorphism. So great. Go to any of the roots of unity. But yeah, I agree. But those are all like basically the same, right? So rename them. Yeah, okay, so... Sorry, one question. For little KU, don't you also know that bots basically has to go to bots somehow? No, so then I don't necessarily know that the bot has to go to anything. It could go to zero. The point is this beta has to go to something invertible. And there's only so many invertible things here. There's only so many invertible things here because it was invertible. You know it in KUG, but if you had some other thing with the same homology that would have had norms in it. Yes. Yes, right. I don't have the formality kind of argument. Not that we have an integral model and you know that we want to have a problem. But that's for that choice of G E infinity extension of the naive E infinity. Right, so there are multiple extensions, and you should not choose the wrong one. Right? But now you have choices for. But now you have choices. For capital KU, you have no choices. Yeah. Well, okay, that's work in progress. So let me not overstate what we can prove at this point. Okay, so the work in progress, including generalizing from the abelian case. Generalizing from the abelian case to the general finite G in the naive situation is also this genuine situation. We want to show that there is a unique genuine commutative ring structure on capital KU. And what I'm saying is that I wouldn't expect that to hold for little KU. Wouldn't expect that to hold for little KU. There are choices. And I probably want to pick the choice that matches with this one, but I have some choices. Okay? So I want to tell you a little bit about how that goes. Trying to think if I have time. Maybe I can sort of show you part of what's complicated here. So I've got some C DGAs, and they have norm maps between them, really shadows of norm. Them, really shadows of norms. So this is really coming from norms on the geometric fixed points. And over here, I know what the homology should be. So here at the trivial subgroup, I should have Q adjoin beta and its inverse. I have Q adjoin zeta P, and then beta and its inverse, and so on. I feel like these are not lining up at all. Up at all. Let me try that again. Okay, and I have norm maps on homology, of course, and what we just said is we know what they do. So beta goes to beta goes to beta. In a sense, they're all the same betas, and in a sense, they maybe don't look like. They maybe don't look like the same beta, so okay, that's a nice thing about knowing that this is a map of graded fields. We can't mess it up. And I also know that zeta p goes to zeta p squared to the p up to maybe renaming who my p squared root of unity is. Okay, and I want to come up with something in the middle. And at the beginning, our old resolution will work if we're in the abelian case, right? And Cp to the end is abelian. To the end is abelian, so that's just fine. So I'll have some quasi-isomorphism here. I've got something that does my zigzag at the Cp level, and it's really not hard to extend the norm in the middle there. But then I put the model that I have at the Cp squared spot, and I find that it's really hard to extend the norm there. So what I need to do is somehow fatten this thing up in a way that I can extend the norm, and now I have. In a way that I can extend the norm. And now I have this commutative diagram in that orb CDGA category. And so that would give me the formality. And I think we know what to do here, but like I said, this is work in progress. So that all still needs to be written down. So you're saying you have it for G is Cp? Yep. Yeah. For Cp, there is a unique, genuine commutative ring structure on rational equivariant K. That part somehow is That part somehow is not so hard. I think we're even pretty sure about CP squared. I would say it's at 98% share of CP squared. I like to leave that 2% for like, who knows when you write it down. But we are really quite shared. And in fact, I think our proof works probably quite well for CP to the N. But of course, we'd like to be able to generalize to tall finite G. To be able to do that, we're also going to need to figure out what goes here in the Going to need to figure out what goes here in the non-abelian case. So, even to get it started. Oh, my time is up. I'm sorry. I will stop there. Questions? So, so Lurie has this description of a Clivarian K-theory naive assembly. Tempered cohomology. I wonder if that might allow you to go from a billion G to G what is tempered cohomology. Someone else suggested that maybe Spada's global work would also give us some way to lift from the abelian to the non-abelian in a nice way. So that's something I'd like to look into, but we'll look into that as well. Thank you. So can you describe the category of modules over KGQ using this formality result? Yes. So the homotopy is a graded field. And so all of those modules split. And that's sort of a nice, well-known fact about when the homotopy is a graded field. So yeah, modules all split as well. So what's the category then? Like CB. So, if you have a module over rational every k, then it's just going to split as a wedge of, oh, I'm going to mess this up. It's going to split as a wedge of copies of KU and then suspensions of KU, I believe. And this two-periodicity means you really only need one kind of suspension. But maybe let me check with my collaborators. It's as like. It's split as like, so the splitting, the graded field thing only happens after you do the item potential splitting. And so you take your, your module looks like a bunch of copies of a bunch of item potenti splitting pieces of cake that are not shifted or shifted on one, one of the two pages. So it's complic it's complicated to write it down correctly. And maybe to say it at the time is a geometric fixed. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yes, and this is written in our paper as I haven't thought about it recently. Anything else? Thank you.
