And other people. And so, this is going to be really not very extensive. It is going to be very biased and very partial kind of survey of things. So, and so I would like to thank, sorry, I would like to thank the organizers, especially Professor Sultan. Professor Sultan for giving me a chance to speak here. And since this is organized in honor of Professor Mr. Kabulovich on his 60th birthday, so I would like to say I wish him good luck and a long health life. Okay, so with that, I will start. So this thing starts in 2007 when I started working on my PhD. I started working on my PhD thesis with Mohan, and so I learned about this theorem of Biskina and Feynm in 1992. So they proved this what is called combination theorem for hyperbolic groups. So suppose Y is a finite connected Graph and then you have a graph of groups. This is a graph of hyperbolic groups of hyperbolic groups with QY embedding correlation. QI embedding condition and this satisfies flaring condition so they call it holidays flaring condition So then they show that the fundamental group of this graph of group is hyperbolic. So I will just illustrate with a simple example like so you can take your y to be simply some edge. So u v e. So for every what So, for every vertex, there is a group. So, there will be GU, G V, and for every edge, so the edge connecting them, so there is another group, GE. And then there is an injective homomorphism from this. And this QI embedding condition is just saying that these homomorphisms are QI embedding. And then, this flaring condition is slightly technical. So, I will not say anything about that. Say anything about that. So, in this case, the fundamental group is simply GU star G V amalgamated free product of this thing. So, they say that if I have all this GU, G V and G E, these are all hyperbolic groups, and then we have QI embeddings from GE to GU and G V and then there is a flaring condition, then this is hyperbolic. So, in particular, a special case will be so if G E. So if G E is is malnormal quasi convex so this is slightly easier to understand malnormal quasi convex in G U G V both u and g v then the their theorem says that this g is hyperbolic so this is a very special case of this theorem And for my THC thesis, Mohan suggested a problem of Professor Kapovich. So the problem is the following. So this appears in his problem list. So problems on boundaries of groups. So this is available now. So, this is available on his home page. So, the problem is asking that generalize this theorem, generalize this, I will call it BS Viner F theorem, just call it B F theorem to complexes of groups complexes of groups. Complexes of groups. So, this means that we have a complex of hyperbolic groups with QIM meeting condition and some other necessary condition. And then expectation is that if there is a flaring condition, then the fundamental group will be hyperbolic. So, of course, this is very hard. So, what I could achieve during my PhD is that this is a theorem with Mohan. Is that it's a very special case of this? So, suppose we have again, so y is a finite simplicity complex, let us say complex, and then you have a complex of so this is what is called a develop developable complex. complex of hyperbolic groups hyperbolic groups and with QIM meaning so yeah so I will assume stronger condition and assume that the development is hyperbolic development is hyperbolic development And finally, in place of QYM winning condition, I will assume something stronger. So I just change the page. The next condition is that this phase maps, let's call them phase maps. Like in the case of graph of groups, we had from age group to the vertex groups, we had maps. Similarly, so whenever you have some cell and from the very center of that, From the very center of that to the other things, we'll have homomorphisms, injective homomorphisms. So, these phase maps are isomorphisms, isomorphism onto finite index subgroups, finite index subgroups. So, for instance, in the previous example, so if I had simply this as So, if I had simply this as my complex, so I have Gu, G V and G E, so and I have injective homomorphisms. So, I assume that the image of G E and in Gu and G V, so they will be finite index in those groups. Okay, so then this group is hyperbolic. Y1 GY, this is hyperbolic, if an only this. This flaring condition is satisfied. So, this was my theorem during my thesis. So, a special case of this is slightly easier to understand. Special case is as follows: So, suppose we have an exact sequence of this. So, here So, here I assume that N is hyperbolic, Q is hyperbolic. Okay. And yeah, so then this G is hyperbolic if and only if flaring collision modes. Okay, so this was this thing. And the proof idea of this theorem was that so I missed one condition here, hyperbolic, and we also assume that these are non-elementary hyperbolic. So the proof idea of this was to guess quasi-georesics in this space. So in this case, if I want to So, in this case, if I want to do this special case, so I will try to guess the quasi-georephysics in G. So, I will construct some kind of candidate paths which are supposed to be quasi-georephysics. And then we prove triangle slim condition, slim triangle condition. And from there, then we some standard criteria for hyperbolicity we use to show that the whole space is hyperbolic. And then we show, therefore, we take that this. Therefore, we get that this kind of path that we construct there also quasi-geodes. So, in the theorem proved by Meskina and Fen, of course, their proof was different. They did not give any description of quasi-geodysis in the group. But here, in this case, we construct quasi-geodic candidate paths. So, after this, then in 2000, so this was. 2000, so this was in 2012. So then I got a chance to work with Professor Kakovich and I went to UC Davis as a postdoc field. So after I went there, so of course he asked which problem do you want to work on. So I said I am slightly experienced in this kind of thing. So maybe I'll just work on this general question of yours. So we started working on this and sometimes we thought, okay, we are making some progress and next time we Making some progress, and next time we saw that no, there is some issue, and so on. So, after struggling for like three years, we could not do anything about this problem. We had some small form results, like we had some idea about the proof of Bisvenoffen theorem by constructing quasi-geodasics. We had some idea, and we could generalize this theorem of my thesis and so on. And so on, but nothing significant was there. So we could not do anything at that time. So then, yeah, so then what happened is that after finishing the postdoc, I came back to India and then I thought I was kind of not very happy, I would say, depressed that nothing came of in this postdoc. So then I So then I told him that okay, so maybe we work on this proof of theorem of bespinoffin and see if it is working. So on. So then we started working on this problem. And so finally we could prove this. So the basic, so here I would like to mention that. So we prove this, we reprove this. We reprove this Bespinaken's theorem with the description of Wasi Geodesicodics. This thing was there. So, this paper, when we wrote, so it was like very long, already like 80 pages. Okay, but since this But since this didn't have anything new, so we were still worried. So, what would be about this? And then we came up with something else. So, there was a theorem due to Mohan. So, I'll mention this. At the time, he was Mohan Itra. So, 1998. So, suppose we are in the setting of we are in the situation of Bayes-Winaffin theorem. Situation of Bayes-Vinaffin theory. Okay, so we have a graph of hyperbolic groups with KOML condition with plaring and so on. And so now he proves here that for any vertex for any vertex of this graph. So, the inclusion map from the artist group to the fundamental group of this graph of group this admits Canon Thurston map Canon Thurston. So, for instance, that previous example, so I have this G G U G V and then this. G V and then this is G E. So then from G E, let us say to this group G, so that is among chemical free product, then this admits canal thirsty. So we thought that, okay, so maybe instead of taking the vertex group, we could do it more generally for sub-rap of group. So and then finally, we could prove the following theorem. So suppose again we are in the so we are in the setting of bisphenophene fuel we are in the situation of this finafin so we have some finite graph of hydrobolic groups with QIM meaning Of hyperbolic groups with Y embedding condition and flaring condition, and this thing is hyperbolic. So, in that case, and so let Y1 inside this be a connected subcomplex, sorry, graph, this thing. So, then we prove that the fundamental group of this thing to this. this admits admits canon testimony okay so I'll go to the next page so basically an example will be like this so you take a simplest example will be so u V W and you have E F these are the edges so then you look at the this is amalgamated At the this is amalgamated free product basically, so then you maybe this is y and y1 is simply this h uv. So then you so the fundamental group of this pi one g y1 will be simply g u star g v this to this fundamental group that is um Group that is so this admits Cam Thusten map. So of course and then there were some some other results related to this and interesting consequences and applications are there. And so this paper when you wrote so I we initially thought that we'll write it. We initially thought that we'll write it as a separate paper, and then we decided maybe we'll write it together. And then it became a huge thing. So then finally, we decided to write this whole thing as a book. So now this is a book in progress and we are still revising this thing. And so later on, after this thing, I is inspired by this, I was asking to obtain a similar kind of theorem. Obtain similar kind of theorem for complexes of groups. So, in my thesis, I proved this special case of this problem of Kapovich, or this combination theorem that I proved in my PhD thesis. So, then I was thinking, similarly, maybe we can take a sub complex and from the fundamental to the sub complex to the whole group, we have this map, whether that admits canonical question map. So, we prove that this thing with a student. thing with a student so this was a huge thesis of my student Swarati Krishna and so I'll not write down the whole statement because it is technical and so I'll just say a special case of this which is kind of interesting so again so we have this suppose we have exact sequence of hyperbolic groups but and everything is hyperbolic this is hyperbolic everything is hyperbolic This is hyperbolic, everything is hyperbolic, and suppose the q1 is inside q is qi embedded. So let us call this quotient map pi. So let g1 be equal to pi inverse of q1. So then this is hyperbolic, it follows from the previous theorem that I mentioned. And then we prove that the inclusion map. And then we prove that the inclusion map, so this is G1 to G, this admits kind of custom map. And as an interesting consequence of this, so we also obtained information about the canon thruster lamination of this map, and as an application of this We we prove a theorem uh with so I prove a small theorem with yeah so so this is one thing and then so there was another interesting uh observation which is that suppose that gamma is a geodesic line Geodesic line in G1. So you can give up of G1, you take that such that under this canon map, so the points are identified. So this gamma infinity, gamma infinity, and plus minus infinity, they are mapped to the same point. point the same point under the CT man okay so then so this is our situation so we have exact sequence groups and then we have this subgroup so then we then the so gamma is contained in a finite neighborhood is contained in a finite neighborhood of n finite neighborhood of n so this is something about the conversion lamination of this so if there is a leaf of the current personal lamination then it is actually coming from n so this something and then after this apply this theorem so then we put this theorem with Even with Mahan, which is that there are similar number of statements, but the most interesting of this is the following. So, again, suppose we have this thing, and there is a Q1 here. So, we will have this This thing, and so in this case, suppose n is either the fundamental group of some closed-orientable surface of genus bigger than equal to 2, or this is a free group on n generators, where n is bigger than or equal to 3, and assume that q is 1x cohort. So, in this case, if we So in this case if we have a subgroup in G1 such that the index is infinite and H is quasi-convex in G1 then it follows that this this H is quasi-convex in G Okay and uh so yeah so there are some some of the stuff but I'm almost out of time so I want I want to end with the following remark is that we are still working me and we are still working on this problem and recently we have And recently we have some small doubles about the very special case of this complex groups where we assume that the group is acting cylindrically on this development. And that also I would like to All the knowledge that he has very generously shared with me, and he knows so many things so very patient and kind and considerate. So, I wish him and Professor Sultan and family very good luck and healthy long life. With that, I will stop. Thank you, Pranab. That's applause. Thank you. Are there any questions? I have maybe a little bit of a question, I mean, because this is sort of looks very technical to me, especially when I think about the proof that turned into this whole book. Is there a sort of good intuitive way or a simple example of? Way or a simple example of a CT map, how to think about them? Maybe you already said this, but if you could repeat it. Yeah, so okay, so if H is so this is a hyperbolic group, and this is a hyperbolic group, and suppose this is quasi convex, so you have this whole space hyperbolic, and there is the And there is this H. So you take a coarse geodesic or geodesic gray here. Okay, this is gamma. Then there is a geodesic of G which is close to this. So I will draw in red close to this. So basically, wherever this, let us call this alpha. So wherever this the limit of gamma n. Gamma n as this thing, this limit is I am computing in this G union this. So this one is same thing as alpha infinity. So whenever I have some sequence of points going to the boundary of H, that sequence of points will go to some boundary of G. And this is very easy to see for quasi-communicables. And so therefore, we'll have a nice map. Therefore, we'll have a nice map from delta H to, I mean, partial H to partial G. And this happens to be a closed embedding. So this is for the quasi-convex thing. But then it was observed by Canon and Thurson for the first time in their paper group invariant piano curves that if we take this special example of a mapping torus of so suppose I have this genus G sarcascular. genus G surface, close orientable genus G surface, and I have some supianoso and then I take the mapping torus of that. So mapping torus of this thing, this will be simply symmetric product and this this phi is induced by some sigma so then of course it follows from Thurston's theorem that this manifold is a admits a hyperbolic metric and so this sigma g is sitting as a copy of Is sitting as a copy of this M and of course so there is a map NGT map from this to the fundamental group this thing and since this is a normal and finite infinite index subgroup of this thing so this is not quasi-convex I see but still they prove that whenever I take some sequence of points converging to the boundary of this group it will converge to a technique point or Will converge to a technique point or the boundary of this one, namely the three space, IWF three space. And then this map is also continuous. So this is the counter map. And then Mohan introduces this problem in geode group theory. I see. Okay, yeah, thank you. Okay, any other questions? All right, then. All right, then I can start to introduce our next speaker who just turned on our video. I'm delighted to see you. So, Moon Duchin was also a postdoc of Misha's some time ago. I can't remember exactly when. She is a geometric group theorist, but what deserves to be pointed out is that she is also applying some things she thinks about mathematical structures to things like data democracy and civil. Things like data democracy and civil rights.
