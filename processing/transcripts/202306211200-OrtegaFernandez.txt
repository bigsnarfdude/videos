We will see homological and cohomological interpretation of the non-orientable Shure multiplier. So remember that if we have a group, then one interpretation of sure multiplier is as the kernel of some map, some map which go from the free group. Which goes from the free group on pairs of elements of Yi to the commutator subgroup of Y, which sends a pair of elements of Yi to the commutator of these elements. And we take the coordinate with these four relations. And one thing Miller One thing Miller proved is that if we have a presentation of the group, then the sure multiplier is isomorphic to the commutator subgroup of F and intersection R and this coordinate the commutator of F and R. And for the non-orientable case, we also have non-orientable pairs and square elements. And we take the free group generated by these three types of elements. And we take the map which goes from GG to G square, which orientable pairs are. Orientable pairs are sended to the commutator of these elements, and non-orientable pairs are sended to the non-orientable commutator, and square elements are sent to the square of the element. And then we have these seven relations, and we take the normal. Take the sub-normal subgroup generated by these relations, and the non-orientable SURE multiplier is defined as the kernel of the map which go from G to G square and this coordinate the normal subgroup. So now we want to find the analogus of the hope. Of the hope formula for the non-orientable Sure multiplier. So we take E as the coordinate of F and the commutator of F and R in this R square. And we take M as R coordinate the commutator of F R. F R R square. Then we have that we can write E as E over M and we also have M squared equal one and M is a central subgroup of E. So we have this central exact sequence and then we consider the maps which go from the Which go from DE to E. Oriental pairs are sended to the commutator of bar X, bar Y. And here the bar denotes an element in the pre-mesh of the coordinate map which go from E to B. And we can prove that this map is well defined. For example, to prove that this is well defined on second coordinate, we suppose that we have bar y m equals bar y prime and then the And then the non-oriental commutator is var x bar y m var x minus 1 bar y m but m is a central subgroup, so we can take in m to here and we also have m squared equal one, so this is one and we just have the We just have the non-orientable commutator of var x and bar y. And now we have that this map which goes from GE to E sends KE and KE is the kernel of oh this map. Oh, this map and this KG are centered to P square intersection M and we also have that the normal subgroup generated by these seven relations are centered to one. So we have an onto map which goes from Onto map which goes from non-orientable term multiplier to e square intersection m and we also have that the coordinate map which go from E to G this induces a map on non-orientable short multipliers and the image of this map Of this map is equal to the kernel of this map, which go from the non-orientable shear multiplier of E to E squared intersection M. So we have this exact sequence and then we will prove that this map is also angelic. Is also injective. So this would imply that the non-orientable sure multiplier is E squared intersection M. So suppose we have an element on the non-oriental sure multiplier of E, and then we can write it as a word on. On orientable pairs, non-orientable pairs, and square elements such that this equation is satisfied. But we have taken E to be F coordinate the commutator of F and R squared. So each E, we can write it as F. write it as f in the modulo f r r square so x we can write it in this way and we have that this product is equal to no this product is in the commutator of f and r square and this is generated by a commutator By commutators of F and R and R square. So this word we can write it as a product of commutators and squares. But F is a free group, so it's non-orientable sure multiplier is equal to one. So we have that. So we have that these words are equal. And then we have that the image of x under the inducer of the quarter map is this, but we also have all these r equal one because each r is in r and we also have this. We also have this relation. So, all this is equal to one, and we have that x is mapped to one. So, this proved that the image of the induces of the coordinate map is zero. And this proved that we have an isomorphism of the non-orientable shoe multiplier of G with F square intersection. F square intersection R coordinate the commutator of F R and R square. Now we are going to see the commodical interpretation. So when G is a finite group, its orientable sure multiplier is the second. E is the second cohomology group of G with coefficients on the group of units of complex number. And here the action is tribal. So an element of the SURE multiplier is an isomorphism class of an extension with this form. And we want to find the analogus for. Find the analogus for the non-orientable case. So we have this exact sequence, it's a central exact sequence. And then by the shield sector sequence, we have the inflation restriction transgression map. But we just need this exact sequence. So we have that. So we have that the image of the transgression map is isomorphic to the group of homomorphism which go from M to F2 and this coordinate the image of the map, the restriction map which go from home EF2 to home M F2. So, the next is to prove that the image of the restriction map from home E to home M is equal to the kernel of the restriction map which go from home M to home intersection E squared. And so this would imply that the image of the The transgression map is isomorphic to M intersection E square, and we will also prove that this transgression is surjective. And this would imply that when M intersection square is finite, we have that this is square intersection M. So So first, suppose that we have a homomorphism in the image of the restriction map which go from E to OMM. So this is an homomorphism which go from M to F two, which can be extended to E, but the These maps go to F2, and F2 is an abelian group such that every element square is tribal. So this implies that each square intersection M is in the kernel of FIM. And this implies that the map is in the kernel of the rest. Is in the kernel of the restriction map, which goes from home MMF2 to home M intersection E square Ref2. So we have this contention. We will prove the other. So suppose we have an homomorphism which goes from M to F2 such that is square intersection. At square intersection M is in the kernel. So this induces a map which goes from M over E square intersection M to F two. But this is isomorphic to E square M over E square. And we have that F two is an injective F2 vector space. F2 vector space and the maps of Abelian groups coincide with the maps of F2 vector spaces. So we can extend P to E over E square and then we can compose with the quartering map which go from E to E over E squared. E over E square and this proved that the map can be extended to E. So now we will see that the transgression map is surjective. So suppose we have an element on the second cohomology group of G with coefficients on F2. So, we can take a representative of the isomorphism class of the element, and this is an extension of this form. And now write E equal F over R. So, as F is free, we have an homomorphism which goes from F Which goes from f to star g such that this diagram commutes. And we also have that r is in the kernel of f and the commutator of f r squared is in the kernel of f. So we have an induced homomorphism which goes which go from f over the commutator of f and r square to star again and we have this commutative diagram where this is the restriction of this map so the transgression map of this element is the original element we have taken of H two. Have taken of H2. So this proved that the transgression map is surjective. So this proved that non-orientable Shure multiplier of G is the same as the second homologic group of G with coefficients on F2. And here also the action is tribal. And we If we know this, we can use the universal coefficient theorem for calculating the homologic group of cyclic groups and dehydral groups, and we get the same result as Omar that's all.  That for that, you have to do it in by induction. Yeah, you separate it to groups of cohorts, and then you have to reduce everything to react. So it's not so easy. And also, it's not so easy that it's related with the talk of Mar to prove that it's of torsion two, so that every sequence is of torsion two. You have to. two uh you have to prove that yeah x1 x2 x3 xn and x n minus 1 x n minus 1 add to the minus 1 until until we arrive to x1 minus 1 is trivial that's really difficult yeah any other questions or comments for gustavo thanks for gustavo again Was that all here? I don't know if I can talk about that.
