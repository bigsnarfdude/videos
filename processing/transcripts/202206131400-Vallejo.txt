I'm going to switch gears a little bit, and that I'm going to totally change the pathogens that we've been mostly talking about this week. And although we've had mention of some vector borin from Mike and others. And then I'm also going to switch scale a little bit. So the topic of my talk is going to be more high level and thinking about how we can integrate a lot of these different approaches with each other to create systems that are useful. Systems that are useful for forecasting and prediction for pandemics. And so I'm going to dive less into the details and the weeds and think more about how we can try to put everything together from the data analysis and statistical perspective and also the mechanistic model perspective. And it's intended to also hopefully generate ideas from you all too on thinking about how to do this. So I'll show an example of a big project we're working on at La Sala. A big project we're working on at Los Alamos. And then we'll kind of see what you all are thinking. So I'm in the theoretical biology and biophysics group at Los Alamos and the deputy group here. And instead of putting these at the end, I'm going to put them at the beginning because we have a large team of people. And I even think there's several people who aren't in here yet who've joined in the past year that I haven't quite put into the who is helping us slides, but we have an Earth. Us slides, but we have at Earth Systems a mosquito modeling team. It's going to be a mosquito-borne disease talk today. We have an epi-human modeling team. Some of them are in multiple of the teams, but we have quite a lot of people helping out here. We have an integration team. That's a subset that's trying to put all these other teams that I'm showing you together and what they're doing together, which is a big challenge in and of itself. This is a big three-year. This is a big three-year multi-million dollar project. There's a data and statistics team. And again, I think there's actually probably at least five or six new people that aren't in here yet. And then there's an architecture and code team because when we try to do a big project that puts lots of things together, we need someone helping us make sure our code isn't a total disaster. It's at least acceptable in how it's set up so that others can use it and we can release it. It and we can release it. So, I wanted to acknowledge the team first because that's important to me. And then I'll do a little bit of motivation for this particular project, but it applies to a lot of things. So, one of the big motivations in proposing the project that we have right now is climate change and how it's going to be impacting pathogens in the future and trying to understand that. So, on the bottom left, for example, you can see one of our postdocs who also worked. You can see one of our postdocs who also worked on bally fever, which is a fungal pathogen, and projecting how its range is going to change over the next 100 years based on output from climate models. You can kind of see the little video. That's a whole separate scary thing that we could talk about, but I'm not going to talk about today. But you know all this, and I don't probably don't need to convince anyone in the room that we want to understand what the impacts are going to be here. Another thing, which maybe most of us in the room know too, is that. In the room, know too is that there's evidence that the number of outbreaks are increasing through time, and that includes vector-borne diseases and fungal diseases and things. So it's just, it's not just like the number of cases scaling with the number of people, but the actual number of outbreaks are increasing. And in the context of mosquito-borne diseases in the past 20 years, we've had at least three new viruses introduced to the Americas that spread. Was introduced to the Americas that spread within a matter of months to nearly everywhere. So, from our perspective, it's kind of like not if, but when we have another one. And the capacity is there for them to spread very quickly. Also, and obviously we know from COVID that the same is true for airborne and other diseases. And then I just wanted to show you some of the pathogens we'll be talking about today. So, Dengue, I'm sure you've all heard of it. I'm sure you've all heard of it. It is, they don't have it, it's in Africa. I don't know why this doesn't have that, other than that maybe there's not great data there. But certainly, we have a lot of data for the Americas and for Asia. Zika, we've heard of two. This is kind of an illustration of how quickly it spread through time and in intensity through the Americas. And then lastly, West Nile virus, which was introduced right around 19. Was introduced right around 1999-2000, but it also spread. You can see the progression from left to right and top to bottom, but it spread very quickly also across the continental United States and Canada. So just to give you a feel for kind of the scale of some of the mosquito-borne pathogens that have been introduced. I don't know if Sarah showed this slide or similar. She didn't. Okay. Sarah and I have a set of slides that we sometimes, you know, interchange. Set of slides that we sometimes, you know, interchange the topics that we use. But one of our grand visions, which is apropos for this workshop, is that data fusion and modeling and forecasting, we hope will not just be for weather anymore, but for things like diseases. And that stuff that Mike and the CDC and others are working on too, like, can we create a forecasting system that's operational and effective? So the simple equation here is that we have a lot of Simple equation here is that we have a lot of data of all sorts of varying everything. Some of it's really good, some of it's not good. There's a lot of it, some of it's really noisy, some of it's clear. And then we have a whole bunch of mathematical and statistical models that we can apply to that, which everyone here has talked about this week so far. There's a whole bunch of different really interesting methods. So there's a big piece of it that's figuring out which methods to use when and why. And then hopefully the output is that we have. And then hopefully the output is that we have some type of probabilistic either prediction or forecast. And I don't know if that's the terminology that we kind of decided on in our team that forecasting was more like the, what do we actually think is going to happen in two to four weeks kind of thing versus predictions, which we are saying is those kind of counterfactual, like, what if we did this? What if scenarios like going forward? Or at least the longer term things that maybe aren't supposed to be super. Term things that maybe aren't supposed to be super accurate, but to give us an idea about trends. I don't know, there's probably different words we could use to differentiate those two perspectives, but does that kind of make sense? Okay. So this is our big dream picture. I'm going to quickly go through the disease transmission dynamics of mosquito borne diseases, just for those of you who may not be as familiar, and then we'll dive into some of the analysis that we've done. So, mosquitoes. We've done so. Mosquitoes have an aquatic stage, which is eggs, larvae, pupae. There's a couple of pupae stages in there, and then they hatch into adult mosquitoes. The female mosquitoes bite and take blood meals. And so they're the ones that are spreading pathogens between people in that way. And then they lay eggs and start the whole mosquito cycle over again. Then there's the human part of it. So if an infected mosquito bites or if a Or, if a susceptible mosquito bites an infected human, then it can become infected, and then it in turn bites a healthy human. And it's kind of this obligatory cycle rate that keeps going in that way. So what do we need to predict or to understand these dynamics? Well, presumably, it's helpful to know mosquito abundance and locations, although Mike brought up that people haven't really used that with much success, at least in the forecasting. Success, at least in the forecasting world, yet. And then you need to know where are the humans and where is the human-mosquito interaction happening. So there's ways to predict maybe without understanding those things, but that's what's underlying the system. So some piece of that data has to capture that, even if it's not capturing it directly. Okay, so that's the system. And quickly to recap. To recap, maybe what's already been said here, the statistical models do tend to be more accurate in terms of forecasting, right? So, if you're just using case counts and something really pretty simple and phenomenological, often that is the best forecast. The exception to that might be when we have a newly emerging pathogen that we're not sure about yet and that people aren't necessarily capturing very well, in which case, mechanistic models might actually do better in some situations. Better in some situations there. We saw that, like in the Chikaguna forecasting challenge, a little bit in some places. And then the mechanistic models, which are the ones that have the underlying mechanisms that are driving the system, we think, are better for helping us understand the different drivers and how they impact like the sensitivity. And then exploring the counterfactual or newly emerging situations. So there's trade-offs between, and there's a lot of other trade-offs between those two things too. Those are just kind of. Trade-offs between those two things, too. Those are just kind of the top ones that come to mind. But ideally, from our perspective, from a kind of integration perspective, we want to think about how we can leverage both of those approaches to create systems that are really useful from multiple points of view in understanding an outbreak. And so I'm going to, I switched how I'm doing this talk, so we'll see how it goes. You can let me know. You can let me know. So, I'm starting this time with the really data-driven statistical side of what we've done, which is kind of how we started off. And so, the original slides I'm going to show you are slides from several years ago from a project that Sarah led that led us to start thinking about what we really wanted to put together in a mechanistic model. So, we're going to start off here with us trying to forecast or Trying to forecast or now cast dengue in Brazil. So we got case counts at the municipality scale, which is like a county scale, weekly over at first it was a seven-year period and now we have a 20-year period in Brazil. And we can scale up and down, right? So municipalities go all the way up to several levels to states and regions and then the whole country. And then we wanted to figure out which data streams could give. Which data streams could give us the most power in terms of statistical prediction for dengue? So we just threw together everything we could think of. The first one was satellite imagery. We have some really awesome remote sensing people on our team who can do their own stuff with this. We don't necessarily have to use canned things if we don't want to, which is fun because we can get different indices and things. So they used multispectral imagery. Used multispectral imagery. You can see some of the issues right away when you look at this data. The red line is the satellite data. The black line is the dengue instance in Brazil at the country level. So you can see, okay, there's probably some kind of relationship there in terms of seasonality. You can see the red line gets really noisy in the last few years, and that's because two new satellites came online. And so we had much higher resolution of data. And so it actually made it more like wiggly. The data Wiggly. The data from the satellites about every one to three weeks, depending on how it's going over and different things like that. We use indices like vegetation, water content, burn ratio, and we actually use often the cloudy pixels are just masked or gotten rid of, but we use the percent of cloudy pixels in this case because presumably clouds could impact mosquito bore diseases in the context of rain and whatever. Okay, climate data. So there's So there's some kind of packages that do a good job that we're using that kind of give you a pretty fine resolution scale of like temperature, humidity, etc. We started off by looking at all the actual weather station data in Brazil and you can see a picture of where they are and of course there's more weather stations where there's more people. So you can see that the coverage is maybe not perfect and especially in the Amazon. And then on the bottom right you can see the And then on the bottom right, you can see the dengue incidence versus temperature. Again, seasonality at least is getting captured, but maybe not the relative, like the difference in the peaks per year. Missing data and errors are common interpolation. So there's this whole side thing that I'm not spending a ton of time on about the really labor-intensive process of data fusion and cleaning, which probably those of you who work with data understand. Data understand. Okay. So temperature seems to be an indicator of some aspect of this, but not necessarily the ups and downs. The other piece that we know is probably important are the demographics. So there's, we use the 2010 census. And it's again at the municipality level. There's over 200 variables that are collected in Brazil. And so you can see some things like percent rural population versus dengue incidents. Population versus dengue incidents in these maps and some relations between dengue statistical relationships between dengue and things like poverty or other demographic drivers. The ones that seemed to have the most, and we had a postdoc who did a really, really cool dimension reduction stuff with this, which I won't go into either because I don't have time. Either because I don't have time. But percent rural population, household density, education of mothers, percent poverty, percent with garbage collection all seem to be like pretty consistently strong indicators of anguish incidents. And we found, of course, that a combination of demographic and environmental variables can give us a pretty good feel of like the yearly kind of burden of dengue in a location. So all of this is really exploratory in terms of like. Exploratory in terms of like what's driving this art? Can we find like strong correlations between statistical correlations between dengue and different types of variables through time and space? But also one of the things that we're really interested in and trying to do is create a system that's really robust against data streams moving in and out of it. Because there are times when we lose certain data streams for whatever reason, or we can't access them, or we don't have them. And so. Don't have them, and so one of the questions we're also trying to think about is: are there data streams that we can like plug in when we don't have the ones we want that will at least do a decent job, right? So, if we don't have weather, could we use satellite or vice versa? If we don't have case counts, could we use things like Google search queries instead? And so, we put some time into thinking about how different social internet data could help us. Help us kind of fill in some of the data that we need, especially case counts data. So we had Daniel Romero Alvarez, who's from Ecuador, did a really cool analysis that we have a paper on about Google search queries in Brazil. And we did find that several words were strongly correlated in many cases with dengue. So you can see this is for. Can see this is for all of Brazil. There's the black line, the actual blue line is the model built on Google search queries. So it's pretty good. Of course, of course, when you go down to smaller scales, like at the state level, that is highly variable. And that's something that hasn't been looked at as much, but that this paper did. So 12 out of the 27 states had really, really strong good correlation with Google search. Strong good correlation with Google search trends and their dengue incidents. Then there were states where it was like, okay, it's probably helpful. And then there were states where it's like, zero helpful does not help at all. And you can guess probably why. Places with smaller population, less access to internet, or don't have a good correlation there. So again, this is a big data fusion problem because we have a lot. Problem because we have a lot of different spatial scales and time scales that we're trying to put all of these data sets together on, so it's not exciting, but it takes a lot of time, and people put a lot of effort into that. And then we've been able to put together some predictions that are pretty good. So at a yearly scale, we can use those environmental and demographic variables that I talked about to predict the dengue incidence at small scales all the way up to the larger scales. Scales all the way up to the larger scale, so left is predicted and right is observed. This isn't ahead of time, though, it's just like purely correlational. Um, but part of this is so we can pull out what we think is important and then do the predictions forward in time. And the other piece that we did is we created a now casting model, which what that means is we're predicting like two to three weeks ahead, but we think that's actually telling us what's happening now, if that makes sense, because the because the case counts that we Because the case counts that we get from the data stream are always delayed by a week or two. So we can see several states here. It's a little hard to see this, sorry. The blue lines are the predicted using a bunch of different statistical and machine learning models, and the red is the observed. And then we have uncertainty around them. So actually, the now testing model does quite well in many cases. Again, there's a few states and locations. Again, there's a few states and locations that are challenging, but it does a really good job giving all these variables. But something that we found is that was really important is that different models and data streams performed much better in different locations. So we couldn't create just one model and use just one set of data streams for the whole of Brazil. We had to actually build it around the different states. The different states and let like a larger kind of ensemble model choose the best methods for the different locations. Does that make sense? So, some of them did much better with a really, really simple statistical model. And some of them did much better actually when they included all of the different data streams. So, there was this interesting trade-off across space and time in terms of what data was useful or not. Useful or not, and what statistical models are useful or not. And I could give a whole talk about that, but I just wanted to say that out loud for you all to understand. And I think that's an interesting thing to think about with what Mike is doing in the CDC, which is that depending on the scale, we might see some different outcomes in terms of what gives us the best accuracy. At least that's what we observed for the case of Dengue in Brazil. Okay, so after this, we could. Okay, so after this, we kind of had this realization that we really wanted to understand the why underneath this, right? Like we have these good statistical machine learning methods that are doing a good job predicting, but we really want to understand the mechanisms so we can predict into the future, predict under climate change, do the what-if scenarios, do the interventions. So, hold that thought. I'm going to continue some of the statistical stuff really quick that's going to go into our modeling. So, one of the other things that we realized we needed to kind of answer these questions about what's going on under the hood is where are mosquitoes? So, I'm now going to switch continents and go to West Nile virus in North America. The best mosquito distribution maps we have for Kulex mosquitoes, which spread West Nile virus, was this that a guy drew in 1980. So we were like, oh, that probably needs to be updated. Probably needs to be updated. So we need to know where they are because we don't really know what the risk is if we don't even know where the vector species are. So we put together a big data set of variables that we think would be important for the mosquito populations. And then on the left, you can see we digitized that map that the guy drew. And then we took from all over the place and everywhere we could find data sources of presence. Data sources of presence and absence of certain mosquito species. You can see where all those dots are, is where we got our data from. And then we had to go to a lot of different locations and some like personal connections and stuff to get data for this. And so then we created using MaxEnt model and we've experimented with a lot of different types of models, the updated distribution map for the species, right? So on the left is the gray map that the guy drew and on the right is the updated map that we have based on machine learnings, methods to correlate the Methods to correlate the different variables with the presence of Culix tarsalis in this case. And so, you know, he's not totally wrong, but it's certainly not at high enough resolution if we want to actually go deep into understanding the why underneath the landscape level, what's happening. And then we went through this process for, I think, eight different Culux mosquito species relevant to disease spread. So the Culux. The agricultural quote-unquote mosquito on the left, and then Collux Pipians, for example, the urban mosquito on the right. We created maps for them, and you can see there's like a really strong difference between where those different species are and why and how they're associated with humans when you look at it. So, the other thing that we wanted, so here's the like, where are the mosquitoes? Then we're like, when are the mosquitoes? And so for this, we started off with statistical models core. Started off with statistical models correlating, again, satellite and spectral imagery data with mosquito population data for the Toronto area. And we used a lot of different models and we found ones that seemed to fit best. And it seemed like the satellite data gave us a good indicator of the relative mosquito ups and downs over the years. So that was interesting. And then, of course, there's things like we have to use lag, like distributed lag models and things because mosquitoes don't just instantly. Because mosquitoes don't just instantly hatch as soon as it rains. There's like a lagged response, right, to what's going on in the environment. So, all of this to say that we're like, okay, we have some confidence that we can predict using the underlying mechanisms and things that are known that are driving it, what the mosquito species dynamics are going to be and where they are. And so maybe we can actually get a mechanistic model that does a decently good job that's driven by things like That's driven by things like climate. Okay, so I'm going into now the mechanistic approach. Yes? Okay, so the idea is to be able with the mechanisms is to be able to do the what-if scenarios for predictions. And we really wanted it to be continental scale instead of what we usually see and what a lot of us do, which is like, I have the data for this city. Here's my city model, or I have the data for this one state or whatever, right? One state, or whatever, right? Like, can we somehow integrate again and put it together? And so, we're calling it CIMID, which is the climate integrated model of mosquito-borne infectious diseases, which is very similar to an acronym someone else had earlier this week. Anyways, I noticed that. I can't remember who it was now. Maybe, yes, thank you. That's correct. But the idea is to incorporate the environmental factors and the mosquito population dynamics with the human factors and human demographics and dynamics. Human demographics and dynamics. So, we have a truly like integrated human-natural system that creates predictions. And I already talked about all the data fusion that has to happen there to make this model work. So, I'm going to show you some results from the sub-pieces of this model because it goes from, I'm going to talk about hydropup units in a minute, these little scaling units that we use to the Earth system model. The Department of Energy has one of those big giant climate models that we use to predict climate. Giant climate models that we use to predict climate change that goes into the climate report every year and all that stuff, up to mosquitoes, and then to the human transmission. So, we know that temperature, water, daylight, among other things, are impacting human mosquito population dynamics. And we wanted to be able to incorporate these into a mechanistic model. They vary between species, too, that makes it tricky. So, we came up with something. Tricky. So we came up with something that we called a process-based model. It is not quite a mosquito agent-based model. It's not quite a differential equation model. It's in between. So it's inspired by a partial differential equation approach where the, so the mosquitoes go through their developmental stages from egg all the way through to adult based on time, but also temperature. So temperature can speed up their rate of development, right? Up their rate of development, right? So we're thinking it's not a PDE in space, but a PDE across time and temperature that's changing their development rates. And so the output is how the mosquitoes are moving through that system. So if it's warmer, generally they move more quickly through until it gets to a certain level of heat where they die. So it's not a just, it's not just a linear relationship. It looks more like a this, which I'll show you. So it's a rule-based model, but it's inspired by a PDE. But it's inspired by a PDE type structure, and we have some grad students working on the actual PDE and doing it because it's tricky. So it's kind of this in-between thing, and it's driven by the aquatic habitat temperature and daylight hours, daylight hours because we want to understand diapause. Mosquitoes, especially in temperate regions, disappear during the winter, right? And they get signaled to do that. And we want to capture that too, because we want something that can run year after year after year instead of having to be restarted. After year after year, instead of having to be restarted every spring with new initial conditions. Okay. So, this is the schematic of what we did. Basically, what we did is we said the eggs are little, like we split the time and the eggs into all these little compartments and they move through at different rates depending on temperature and time. And then they graduate to be larvae and pupae, and then they graduate to be adults, and they move through based on temperature and aquatic availability. I'm not going to. Aquatic availability. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this. We use different kinds of equations that are based on, oh, what's the word? I'll lose my words. It's like a physics-based kind of thing for ectotherms, but I'm forgetting the terminology for it. But basically, their development rates depend on their external environment, and we have data from the laboratory that we fit to try to create a reasonable A reasonable equation for that kind of temperature-based movement through the stages. So, of the 15 parameters in this model, nine are fit to laboratory data and six are fit to the mosquito time series. And I will show you that fit here in a second. Okay, it's moved on my screen, but not on your screen. Oh, there we go. Okay, quickly, I just wanted to. Quickly, I just wanted to show you where the data is coming from. This is the Toronto area, which is, they just happen to have a beautiful, amazing mosquito data set. We have several other ones now from all over the United States, but this is what I'll show you. The black dots are where they had the mosquito traps. And this is a 20-year time series. And it's also for the greater for all of Ontario, but we focused a lot of our stuff on the Toronto area. Okay, and so one of the things that we wanted to think about when we did this is temperature-driven for sure. How do we capture the aquatic habitat? One way that's really common is precipitation that's on the left. The blue dots that are like at the bottom is precipitation data from the Toronto area. The black, big dots are the mosquito abundance data across these years. And the yellow really this periodic thing is the temperature. Periodic thing is the temperature. Okay. On the right, we used instead of precipitation, we used water levels from stream gauges and like stream and pond and whatever gauges. So you can see maybe that maybe those are capturing a little more of that variability than the precipitation. So in addition to trying to see if this process-based model worked at all, we wanted to see how it worked for different aquatic availability data streams too. So now I'm hitting you. So now I'm hitting you the bunch of information at once. On the right is a statistical model fitting the mosquito data to temperature, daylight hours, and either water level or precipitation. The stuff to the left of the red line is what we used to fit the model, and the stuff to the right was the test data that was withheld. So you can see the statistical model does decently well. It's really hard to capture, to do a year-on-year capture of mosquito dynamics. Capture of mosquito dynamics, it's quite challenging. On the left is the output of our process-based model, and it's actually rarely and oddly enough, more accurate than the statistical model in terms of prediction and forecasting. So there's probably some, we could probably do something fancier. This is kind of a pretty basic like GLM with some lag statistical model, but it was interesting to us that the process-based model did better by quite a bit. By quite a bit. And then, also, interestingly to us, at least for the Toronto area, is that those orange color, if you can see it, is using those stream gauges, and that did a better job of capturing the year-to-year mosquito peaks than the precipitation did, which was kind of interesting. But the overall take-home message was that the process-based model did actually quite well at predicting mosquito time series, better even than the statistical model, which was. Statistical model, which was surprised us, honestly. Okay, I know I'm starting to run out of time a little bit, but I will go for a couple more minutes for questions. So that's this. We're proud of this. It's really, we're continuing to work on it and extend it now to lots of other locations in the United States where we've been able to get mosquito data to ensure that it translates across location, which is another big issue for the type of model we're trying to do. That's a continental. And we have a lot of students working really hard to put this together. Of students working really hard to put this together. Okay, so that's the mosquito modeling. There's the epi modeling. I will not go into a ton of detail here other than to say, right now, we're using just pretty classical vector-borne disease transmission models. So we're not getting super fancy here because we just want to get one big thing that we can put together and then we can play with, you know, adding compartments and doing different things. So for the dengue team, you know, the top is the humans, the bottom is the vectors. Is the vectors, and then those cross lines are saying the vectors get infected from biting infected humans, the humans get infected from an infected vector biting them. Mosquitoes don't recover, they just die after some point, but the humans can recover. And then there's the pieces that go into it in terms of the mosquito population dynamics are this birth rate that gives you the susceptible adult female vectors, and then a death rate. And so, what we've done is that we Death rate. And so, what we've done is we've used a kind of in-between model to connect the output of our process-based mosquito model to this. And we do that through those birth and death terms to make the mosquitoes in this model follow the right density and path in terms of numbers of mosquitoes. So, this is an area where we're really interested in thinking about different ways to connect these models without creating a total spaghetti. Creating a total spaghetti disaster of America. Do you know what I mean? So, thoughts on that would be appreciated. Do you have a question? Yeah. So, getting into the spaghetti disaster thing. Yes. Have you put four strains of thinking into this? No, sir. Yeah. Yes. That is a double spaghetti disaster. Sorry. Oh, yes. He asked about putting in. Oh, yes, he asked about putting in the different serotype, not serotonin, the different dengue. Yeah, that's right. I'm losing my words. Anyway, so no, the answer is no. How we're accounting for that fudging right now is allowing some people to go back into susceptible at certain rates. But at some point, that's another thing that we would be really interested in exploring. Another issue there is it's really, and this is why Mike said they had some in Puerto Rico at least, it's really hard. In Puerto Rico, at least, it's really hard to find good stereotype data from places. And so we're kind of flying blind there in terms of trying to put them in. It's a good question. Okay. And then we, this is another paper that Julie's on that's in review, but the point is that we kind of included some of these mosquito dynamics based on temperature and stuff with our disease model. And then we can see different scenarios depending on temperatures. Depending on temperatures. And also, there's some, of course, uncertainty around how the temperature impacts different mosquitoes, like their death rates or their incubation period for the virus and all these things. So depending on how exactly that works, you could get a really worst case kind of scenario or maybe a not so bad case scenario. So if you make it so their lifespan's longer, but the incubation period is shorter, then you're in like a worst case scenario. And those are possible based on the data. On the data. But if you also shorten their lifespan, then you get in a space where, okay, maybe the shortened incubation period isn't such a big deal because they're also not living as long. So they don't have as long to transmit, if that makes sense. So I don't, this would take longer to explain for you to fully understand what this plot is saying, but I just wanted to show it to you because something's coming out of the model. And then the Westnow virus model is really similar, except that to further complicate things. To further complicate things, birds are the main host of West Nile virus, and humans are incidental. So now the birds are the kind of host species in this, and then the humans are kind of just that spillover thing happening when an infected mosquito bites them. That's an interesting challenge too of how to do the inference on that, because we have trap data where they trap the pools of mosquitoes and test them for Westnile virus. So we have some mosquito Westnile virus data through time in this Toronto data set, for example. And then we have human. Data set, for example, and then we have human cases, but they're rare and they're not as well documented. And so, those of you who are interested in thinking about how to fit a model to like multiple types of data at different time scales and accuracy levels, that's another thing that we're thinking about that's kind of interesting, I think. And again, all of these have, these are all temperature-related things going on with different mosquito species and their lifespans and stuff for West Nile virus. Also, same thing as what happens for dengue. Thing as what happens for dengue. And we're working on a review that hopefully will come out soon for that. Okay, so the very last thing I really wanted to quickly show you for the Earth System model, and this is another challenge that I think is really interesting, is how do we handle landscape heterogeneity and how do we scale? Because there's a whole bunch of different habitat types spread throughout that mosquitoes could potentially use. And we came up with this scaling. And we came up with this scaling method called hydropup units. It uses a bunch of different kinds of flat type informative things like wetness and elevation and human population and distance from nearest water body and land use type and stuff, stationary layers that go into creating this kind of space where we have people and mosquitoes overlapping with each other at certain rates. I'm going to skip that, but. Skip that. But anyway, we've created this method, and you can choose different hydropupines. But the idea is the ones that are the same color have very similar habitat. So you can translate. So if I have really good data for a place over here that's orange and none for a place over here that's orange, the idea is I can translate that across because they're similar because we don't have great data everywhere. So the big thing that we're thinking about is how can we translate across space? And one of the ways to do that is to say, And one of the ways to do that is to say, let's basically categorize different types of landscape in ways that we know are relevant for mosquito habitat, and then categorize them in kind of clusters together so that we can at least defend using data across different locations for similar places. So, anyway, that's it. I'm done. I know this is kind of a lot and it's everything, but I wanted to. And it's everything, but I wanted to kind of inspire people to think about the different problems at different scales and how we can try to put everything together at some point. And at first, it's going to be like, you know, it's hard at first, but I think if we keep thinking about this, we can have a nice spread of really detailed like deep dive models and also models that can really capture what's going on when we have like a pandemic that's spreading on a continent. Can we understand where that would go and how that would look? Okay, that's it. Thank you. Thanks, Carrie. Do we have some questions? You said something about Toronto being the gold standard area for developing things. I was just kind of curious why that is. Isn't that interesting? So I don't really know why Toronto has such good mosquito data, other than that I think they just have some really Other than that, I think they just have some really good people in their like vector-borne disease and entomology team that put this together. So we had to, it's not publicly available, but you can request to work with them on it to get their data and meet with this guy who's been working there forever, Curtis Russell. And so, yeah, I don't know why, but they have really good mosquito data. They have trap data from like every single year, every week during the whole summer season for. Every week during the whole summer season for 20 plus years, and they're still doing it. I wish everywhere did that, but they don't. Yeah, it's interesting though, right? The places where you're like, Terhunto, okay, cool. We'll go with it. Yeah. And they have also the data for like, like they actually test the pools of mosquitoes and stuff like that for West Nile. So we have disease data from them too, in addition to human. Yeah. Okay. This is Joel following on. This is Joel following on from Evan's question. So, Toronto, has anybody tried out Toronto mosquitoes in Florida environmental conditions? Are they, you know, it's one species, but have they adapted locally? Yeah, so that is a really good question. So it's like this cross thing of like, there are, there's different species too in Florida versus Toronto. And so we have to think about how we need, we're thinking about how we need to tune the model. How we need to attune the model for different species of Kulux mosquitoes. So they're similar, right? They're not like crazy different from each other for the most part. But yes, mosquitoes do locally adapt. And that's something I'm also really interested. So what so what our plan is, is we do, we're getting mosquito trap data from at least representative ecoregions across the United States, right? So we can fit it to, let's say, the Toronto one and say, how do we need to tune it to make it fit those? Need to tune it to make it fit the same species of mosquito that's living in, yeah, Florida or wherever, because it probably will be a little different and their and their relationships are. So that's a really good question. And I think like, in the kind of time scales we're talking about, they can actually evolve to be better adapted to their particular, yeah. There's really interesting questions there. This is Mui. I have a question about the Google search. I have a question about the Google search queries that you used. I was wondering, well, I can imagine that these are highly sort of influenced by media coverage or events that take place. So I was wondering if that could sort of skew some things. Yeah. And there's like classical stories about like when people were predicting flu and then there's like Bieber fever or something. And then like, because they were using fever as a search term. And then there was like this, I don't know, Dustin Bieber fever. So this is like many. Justin Bieber fever. So this is like many years ago that created this big, like, we have the flu. And it's like, no, we just have. So yes, the answer to that is yes. So when you're using the internet data, you have to be aware of that. So we found, for example, that like for dengue, it's kind of old news. So it didn't seem to have a big that we could tell, it didn't seem to have a big impact on the seasonal dengue outbreaks. When we looked at Zika, we had to account. When we looked at Zika, we had to account for the fact that especially at the very beginning of the Zika outbreak, there was a lot of news about it. And so people were searching more than was warranted by the amount of Zika in their area. And then again, once it kind of became old news, then it kind of stabilized and we could use it, if that makes sense. So you do really have to be aware of that when you're using the internet data and have to think about ways to kind of account for media and that kind of thing. Yes. That kind of thing. Yeah, so there's some danger there. Do we have any last questions? Yep. Hi, this is Amat Washer. So you talked a lot about sort of the differences in synergy between mechanistic and statistical models. But inside statistical models, you also have sort of things like GLMs that are interpretable and sort of more black boxy machine learning models. How do you think about those things? And how do you think about those things working together? Yeah, that's a really good question. So, yeah, for some of the things we did use some kind of black boxy stuff because they just worked better. And so, when we needed to get like really accurate, like maps of the mosquito species, for example, you know, there's one side where you really want the interpretability, another where you want the accuracy, and they're not always opposed to each other. I think it depends on what you're trying to do with it. I'd be interested to what you think too, because if we're using it, which for a lot of this we did to try to inform what we should put in our mechanistic model, then we really do need to understand which data streams are actually driving it and like kind of why. If we're trying to create something that's just like we need an answer for this, like now we need it to be the most accurate possible, then maybe it doesn't matter so much. But I think it's Think it's also interesting to compare how much of a difference it makes because sometimes we can use the models that are more interpretable and less intense, and they actually do nearly as well as the ones that are not. So I don't know if I answered your question, but it is something that we're thinking about. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. I just wanted to mention. Sorry, this isn't really a question, but I just wanted to mention that the integration team is working on a Integration team is working on a separate project to quantify error propagation across the whole integrated model. Yes. Thank you, Julie. That's happening. Thanks very much. If there are no more questions, I don't know if there are any online. Let's thank Carrie for a great talk.
