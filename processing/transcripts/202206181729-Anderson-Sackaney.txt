Yes, a fantastic message. Can you kind of give a very hard thing? Because I think I prefer the optional way to pull it yourself. Okay. So, um So, welcome to our last talk of the day. It will be presented by Ben Anderson-Sakini from the University of Waterloo. And the title of his talk is Ideals of Quantum Group Outputs. First, I'd like to thank the organizers for having me, Brian, Keith, and Volker. Okay, let's get started. So, first, to sort of establish the motivation for the talk, and then I'll The motivation for the talk and the notation that I'll be using. So, gamma will always be a discrete group, and we have the group ring, and we have a, on the group ring, we have a reduced C star norm and the universal C star norm. The reduced C star norm is coming from the left regular representation. Using that, we can build these canonical operator algebras. So we have the reduced C star algebra and the universal C star algebra, and the Gripp von Neumann algebra that is built out of the Algebra that is built out of the reduced C-star algebra. And I'm using this path notation and all of these operator algebras that will sort of explain a bit later when I start talking about quantum groups. So this is my notation for this. And we can define the Fourier and Fourier-Stiltshees algebras. So the Fourier-Siltshi's algebra is the dual of the universal Cister algebra, and the Fourier algebra is the pre-dual of the group von Legion algebra. So another way you can see So, another way you can sort of formulate their definitions is the Fourier algebra is the quantum group algebra of gamma hat, and the Fourier-Siljose algebra is the quantum measure algebra of gamma-hat. So I'll talk a bit more about that later. Okay, so with a discrete group, we can define the coproduct on the group ring, which is the unit of star homomorphism here that just sends group elements to their square tensor product, and it extends to the group funnel. It extends to the group von Neumann algebra and the reduced and universal C-star algebras. Effective morphisms in their categories. And with the coproduct, we can define convolution on the Fourier and Fourier-Silters algebras that make them Bonnach algebras. And with this, the Fourier algebra is a closed two-sided ideal, so I have the Fourier-Silters algebra. And the Fourier algebra sits as a sub-algebra, the continuous function is vanishing at infinity. Continuous functions vanishing at infinity, and with that we see that convolution is just function multiplication. Lobonic algebra structures that you might be used to on Fourier and Fourier Stilt's algebras can be defined with the coproduct. Okay, so then let this be the finitely supported functions on gamma, and some basic facts is that the Fourier algebra has a bounded approximate identity, if and only if gamma is an. Energy, if and only if gamma is an amino. This is Laptune's theorem. It's a commutative Bonic algebra, so and its spectrum turns out to be the order of gamma. And using just sort of basic technology from community Bonic algebras, we see that for every ideal in the Fourier algebra, that we have this maximal ideal and this minimal ideal, where E is the whole of our... E is the Hull of our ideal. So, and since the spectrum is gamma, the hull is a subset of gamma. And IE is the maximal ideal that we can put onto this hull. And JE is the minimal ideal that we can put onto this hull. And it's just all the finitely supported stuff inside of IEA. To have this sort of structure to the ideals inside of the Fourier algebra. And then we say that a subset of gamma, so every subset is a hall of some ideal, we say that as a set of sensitivities if the closure of the smaller, of the smallest ideal, JD, is the biggest one. So in particular, there's exactly one closed ideal that we can associate with this subset. Okay? And it's a theorem of Kenneth and Lao, or at least. Kenneth and Lau, or at least this is the statement for the discrete case. We prove something more general for locally compact groups. And it turns out that every subset of gamma is a set of synthesis if every function in the Fourier algebra can be approximated by the principal closed ideal generated by itself. So in this case, when every set is a set of synthesis, then we have a complete characterization of all closed ideals in the Fourier. Of all closed ideals in the Fourier algebra. And so we can, this is this property here, this approximation property for all the functions in the Fourier algebra. That's known as Dickens property at infinity, or property d infinity. And I'll just mention that this is a fairly mysterious property. There are no known examples of groups that don't have this property. And also, you might notice that any group subsidies. That any group such that its Fourier algebra has an approximate identity will have such that this property holds. So, for example, groups with the approximation property have dictioned property at infinity. Another thing that I'll mention is that there are no known examples of groups that have property d infinity, but not the approximation property. So there's just really not that much that we know about it. Okay, and then, yeah, basically the And then, yeah, basically, the goal of my talk will be to prove a generalization of this statement and the generalization of the structure theorem that I showed on the previous slide: quantum groups. Okay, so the group ring of a discrete group is a special, this is an example of a hot star algebra. And a compact quantum group is basically something that's defined in terms of certain hot star algebra. Hot star algebra. So, yeah, a compact quantum group is something where we have this integrable unital hot star algebra, a pole of G. So that means that there's a co-associative co-product, which is a unital star homomorphism, satisfying this algebraic identity. We have a co-unit and an antipodent. I'm not going to define those, but those are somehow generalizations of the identity of a group and the inverse. And we have a hard state. So it's a state that. State. So it's a state that's invariant with respect to the co-product. Okay, and then just like with discrete groups, we can define canonical operator algebras. We can define a reduced and a universal C-star algebras right here. And then we can define L infinity of G to be a von Neumann algebra generated by the reduced C-star algebra. And I'll just mention that the norm on this thing is coming from the GNS representation. Is coming from the GNS representation of the HAR statement, and the universal one is just a universal one. And then the coproduct extends to all of these operator algebras, just like with discrete group. Okay, and then with the co-product, we can also define convolution algebras for compact body groups, just like with discrete groups. So we denote N of G to be the dual of the universal C star algebra and L. universal C star algebra and L1 of G to be the pre-dual of L infinity of G. And then these are Bonach algebras by a convolution to find exactly those mutated three groups. And then it turns out that L1 of G is a close to side ideal inside of M of G and we call L1 of G the quantum group algebra and M of G the quantum measure algebra of G. Universal quantum entrance. Okay, and then compact quantum groups, they're things that model the duals of discrete groups, so like gamma x, and compact groups. So say a bit more about compact groups later, but that's the whole idea of compact quantum groups. Okay, so I just want to talk about representation theory. So if we let G be a compact group, If we let G be a compact group, we can let G be a locally compact group here, but we have a one-to-one correspondence between unitary representations of G and non-degenerate star representations on L1 of G. And going a bit further, so using this operator space identification, so the completely bounded maps from L1 of G to B of H pi with this tensor product, we can associate some representation with some. Associates some representation with some operator, uπ. So we have this correspondence between unitary representations and what I'll call these unitary co-representation operators on this tensor product. So this is an idea that we can take with us to compact quantum groups. So we'll say a representation on a compact quantum group G is a non-generic, completely bounded representation such that Such that this uπ defined as in the previous slide is a unitary. And then we let this thing, u or g, denote the irreducibles, so the irreducible representations on g. I know one of g. And then we have a Peter-Wow theory for compact quantum groups. Every irreducible is finite-dimensional, and every Is finite-dimensional, and every representation on G decomposes into irreducibles. Establish a bit more notation. So these will be the matrix coefficients on u pi, so you slice away with the vector functionals here. And then pole of g is the span of all the matrix, of all the matrix coefficients of the irreducibles. Okay? So if we let G be a compact group, then these matrix coefficients from the previous slide, those are just continuous functions on G, so they're just matrix coefficient functions. Okay, so then in the classical cases, pole of G is commutative if and only if G is a compact group, and then the reduced and universal C-star algebras are just the continuous functions on G, and H is. Continuous functions on G, and H is the hard probability measure. And the quantum group algebra is commutative if and only if G is the dual of a discrete group in here. Full of gamma hat is the group group. The har state is the indicator on a trivial subgroup. So now, going towards the original goal that I stated at the beginning of my talk, we'll take some inspiration from compact words that. Inspiration from compact groups. So you can find this in Ewing and Ross. I'm not really sure who to attribute this to originally. But we have this following description of closed ideals in the group algebra of a compact group. So for every closed left ideal, we can find this sequence of subspaces of H pi's, where all the pi's are irreducibles on G. And then we have this following description of the closed. Of the closed left ideal. Complete characterization of the closed left ideals of the group algebras of compact groups. What we're going to do is we're going to combine this idea with the ideas that we saw for discrete groups together. And I'll just note here that this sort of version of property d infinity for compact groups always holds because we always have a bounded property. Always holds because we always have a bounded approximate identity. And so, yeah, the main idea is if you think of E, this sequence of subspaces, as being a non-commutative hull of our closed-left ideal. For that, so in the classical case, the group ring as a vector space looks like As a vector space, it looks like the finitely supported functions, which is just an algebraic direct sum of scalars, and it sits as a sub-algebra outside of the Fourier algebra. This same sort of picture holds for compact quantum groups as well. So polo G as a vector space looks like this algebraic direct sum of matrix algebras. So each of these are finite dimensional, so these all look like matrix algebras, and that sits as a sum. Like matrix algebras, and that sits as a sub-algebra inside of L1 of G. Since this looks like finitely supported functions with matrix-valued entries, so to speak, we think of that as being finitely supported quantum functions. And so this object t-hat, that's known as a discrete quantum group. We don't really need to worry about discrete quantum groups, but that's just for information. Information. Alright, so then a non-commutative Hall will be a sequence of subspaces, just like for compact groups, which means pi's or subspaces of the H pi's. And we denote the following left ideal. So we have this IE, left ideal, it's a closed left ideal. And then JE is sort of the finitely supported stuff inside of IE. Stuff inside of I. And we'll say E is a set of synthesis. If the closure of the smaller ideal, JE is bigger one. And then we have a generalization of what we had, of Kenneth and Naos theorem for Fourier algebra. So for every left ideal in the quantum group algebra, of a compact quantum group, there is a non-commutative hull such that Such that it sits between this JB and the IE antiquates. IE left ideal is the largest one you can put onto this non-commutative column, E, and JB is the smallest one. Every left ideal has a non-commutative column. And also, every E is a set of synthesis, if and only if we have this property, this D infinity property, just like with. Property, just like with where you have the discrete group. So we may as well call this property for discrete quantum groups property d infinity, just like I would call property d infinity for discrete groups, which are dual tools of discrete groups. Okay, so we have this. Now I'm going to talk about a couple applications that I can get from this structural result. Get from this structural result for left ideals of quantum group algebras. So I'll just remind you that gamma is immutable if and only if the Fourier algebra has a banded approximate identity. And if you think about it, this is really a property of gamma hat, which is a compact quantum group. And so we call this property co-ammenability. So we say G is co-amenable if its quantum group algebra has a bounded approximate identity. Equivalently, the quantum Equivalently, the quantum group algebra is weak star dense inside of the quantum measure algebra. And this is work due to a long string of authors from 20 years ago. Co-amenability. Okay, so it's a fact that every irreducible extends to the quantum measure algebra. And with that, with the structural result for the left ideals of quantum group algebras, we can say something about the weak star close. Say something about the weak star closed left ideals of the quantum measure algebra. So, this is a result of myself and White. So, White did this for compact groups. Then, I essentially noticed that the techniques could be extended to the quantum case. And so, what it is, is that every weak star closed left ideal of a quantum measure algebra has this form, which is just the weak star closure of IE. So, every weak star closed left ideal has a non-commutative Hall. Left ideal has a non-creative hall, and you can write it like so. So you're just directly using the structural result for closed-left ideals of quantum group algebras and a set of synthesis characterization. And then also using this, in a sense, there is some work to do, but essentially what it boils down to. That more thing I would like to talk about. So say a subspace of L infinity of G is G invariant. If it has this sort of ideal property, so it's right invariant with respect to this action of L1 of G on L infinity of G. So this is how we can write down the action explicitly. And this is just the natural pre-dual action of L1 of G on L infinity of G. action of L1 of G on L infinity of G. Multiply on the inside the argument of the functionals L infinity of G or functionals on L1 of G. So write out that action explicitly like this. So then it turns out that we have a correspondence between closed ideals of L1 of G and weak star closed G invariant subspaces of L infinity of G. Of L infinity of 2, or rather left ideals. And it's realized from doing the following. So if we start with the left ideal of L1 of G and take its annihilator thing, so all the stuff on L infinity of G that annihilated, then that will be a weak star closed G invariant subspace. And if you start with a G invariant subspace of L infinity of G and take the pre-annihilator, then that thing is a closed left ideal. And this is a one-to-one correspondence to Bose and weak. Closed and weak star closed. Okay, and then here's some basic facts about idempotence. So at Cohen and Host, they characterized idempotence of Fourier-Stiltshaw's algebras, and then Alex Bronck, they found out that the idempotent states correspond to subgroups of gamma. I mean, this all works for locally compact groups. I'm giving you the discrete version. So we have this corresponding. So we have this correspondence between subgroups and eigenpotent states in the Fourier-Tilts algebra. Turns out that we also have a correspondence between subgroups and G-invariant von Neumann subalgebras of L infinity of gamma hat. A related fact is due to coordinate I know, which says that the close subgroups of a compact group G are in correspondence with eidempotent probability. With eidempotent probability measures. So we have this correspondence between subgroups and eidempotent states. So one thing that I'll sort of just mention is that given an eidempotent state in the Fourier-Silters algebra, you can project down onto the L2 space of lambda, as a subgroup of gamma. And that's sort of the underlying idea for the thing that I'm about to show you for a comment. idea for the thing that I'm about to show you for compact group quantum groups. So if we take a non-commutative hull, define via the following, so omega is an ident state, and there's a typo there. So e pi should be projecting h pi onto e pi. So pi of omega is an orthogonal projection, and then we define Projection, and then we define this nω to be the annihilator of this closed left ideal with respect to this non-community of Hall. And it turns out to be a G-invariant binary in subalgebra. So there's like a long list of authors that have studied these objects, finding different characterizations of them in terms of item potent states and so-called group-like. So called group-like projections. But a compact quasi-subgroup is just one of these things. It's one of these G-invariant subalterns of element therapy of G. So if you have a subgroup of gamma, then L infinity of lambda hat, it'll look like this N This G-invariant von Neumann subalgebra coming from this eidempole state right there. So I'll just point out that it's a theorem of Forrest for the discrete case and then Forrest, Knuth, Mao, and Sproncky did this for locally compact groups. Turns out that gamma is immunable if and only if this ideal, one lambda, has a bounded approximate identity. Alright, so that. So I'll denote the sort of reduced version of the quantum measure algebra. It's the dual of the reduced C-star algebra. And it turns out to be a closed two-sided ideal side of the quantum measure algebra. And it turns out that a subgroup of gamma is amenable if and only if its idempotent state is. If and only if its item potent state is reduced. And this sort of notion of a generalization of this fact was attained recently. So Kalantar, Kaschek, Skowski, Vernu, they defined a notion of a co-ammenable quotient, which is some subclass of the compact quasi-subgroups. And I generalized it to compact quasi-subgroups. And I showed it as equivalent to. And I showed it that it was equivalent to this. So a compact quasi subgroup is co-ammenable if its idopotent state is in the reduced measure algebra, quantum measure algebra. And so it was with this whole immunability condition that I'm able to obtain a generalization of Forrest's result that I showed on the previous slide. So if this compact quasi-subgroup coming from omega, if that Root coming from omega. If you assume that's coammenable, then we get that G is co-amenable if no this closed left ideal has a bounded right across ideal. I'm out of time, so I'll just stop here. I think you have two or three more minutes, if you like. And in fact, you haven't yeah the next talk isn't for more than 15 hours, so If you want a few more minutes, you're good. Let's see. Get up to you. Sure, yeah. Alright, I'll do it. Yeah. So here's what... I'll spend the rest of my talk just talking about how can we reformulate, you know, we have a non-commutative hull and we have these two sort of canonical left ideals we can associate it with it. How can we sort of reformulate that picture in terms of G-invariant subspaces on L-thane and achieve it? On Latinas and achievement. So, if we start with the non-creative Hall, we can define this space. So, it looks like politi, except that these chi's are coming from the E pi's. And we just use L infinity of E hat to denote the weak star closure of this thing. So it's a weak star closed. It turns out to be a weak star closed G invariant subspace of L infinity of G. So in the classical case, this is what this looks like. So for So for gamma and a subset of gamma, then pole of E hat just looks like the span of the stuff inside of E. And then the IE close ideal, the annihilator of that is just L infinity V hat. That's something that's easy to prove. Something that's a bit harder to prove is a description of the annihilator of the smaller ideal, which A even. So I'm not going to bother giving that. So, I'm not going to bother giving that. I'll just about to give a more generalized version of that. So, this is what's going on in the classical case. So, it turns out that we have this picture for G-invariant subspaces of L infinity of G minu. So, if you let E be a non-commutative Hall, then the annihilator of IE is this L infinity of E hat, and then the annihilator of GE, JE, is this intersection. Section. And then we can also restate property D infinity on L infinity of G with this condition here. So every E is a set of synthesis if and only if for every weak star closed G invariant subset X we have that this sort of thing holds where you know okay so if you take X and X this always holds but it's the converse that's interesting for me. But it's the converse that's interesting to get you this set of synthesis condition. So, as a consequence, you know, for every G, we start closed G invariant subspace X of L infinity of G, we have this picture that looks a lot like an analog of the J E I E picture for the quantum group algebra for those left IE loss. Thank you very much. Are there questions, comments? What you were referring to in this talk was, well, the case of compact groups at the beginning of this group. And so now you describe for general open copy groups. This for general local compact could be a double work done, say for which SG this is for a compact one every time. Yeah, I know, I know what do you have any examples of ideals and one of this those just like any examples of closed left ideals? Yeah, yeah. Um well you could take Well, you could take, let's see, you can take any closed quantum subgroup of G and then conform its quotient space. And then its pre-annihilator will be a closed left ideal. So that's the most relevant, those are the easiest examples I can come up with things that look like this. So this property D infinity. So this property D infinity, I don't know if you can go back to that, I forget which slide that was on for quantum works. Okay. Right, so you have every E is a set of synthesis. Yeah, so this the synthesis condition, I mean, this is all based on the representation theory of G, right? So do you think that this property D infinity is This property D infinity is preserved under monomer equivalents? If you have two compact one numbers which are monomerally equivalent, I think that's the same as their L1 algebra is being Moreta equivalent as one. So yeah, I think like D infinity. I don't know. That's that's a good question. Uh that was actually something I was wondering on while Matic but I haven't I haven't gone into it yet. Got into it yet. So, just to buffer Folker's question, so this SUQ2, like does no one have D infinity for any reason? What's that? SUQ2. Does it have this Ditkin type? Yeah. So SUQ2 is co-amenable. So this means you can tell what all of the ideals look like, not just one of them. Yeah, they all look like ideals. Yeah, they all look like I okay. So like S C Q two, um the three unitary quantum groups, orthogonal groupings, and I think the quantum permutations. So these are all weakly amenable, I believe. So this would also apply to these things. Applies to a lot of examples. More questions? Can I ask something? Yes. So, in the quantum setting, do you actually have examples without D infinity? Because I mean compact classical groups, L1 of GAI, it's not probable for algorithms of discrete groups. So, are there actually an example that could it be the case that everything has given infinity? It's seems like it could be possible. I don't know. Like all the examples that I would try to work with just happen to happen. So yeah. I have no idea. More questions? Okay, well, if not, let's thank Ben again. Let's thank Ben again. Our next talk is at 9 a.m. Another time tomorrow morning. And let me add one rebot. We have to check.
