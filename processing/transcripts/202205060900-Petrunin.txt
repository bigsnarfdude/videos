It might be a curvature bounded below or curvature bounded above. I will consider two cases. In principle, many things I will talk about will hold for general curvature bound, not necessarily zero, but I will not. Necessarily zero, but I will not divide what works, what doesn't work. So it's like zero curvature is sufficiently interesting already. So in addition to Alexander spaces, I will talk about some other, some related, some questions, some related type of spaces, right? So first of all, the question, I mean, I heard it. question i mean i heard it i heard this question from uh valery biristovsky a long time ago and after that i saw it in um somewhere in gromov right so in uh and at first it seems like a simple question right so like but uh i i don't know for how many years uh i thought it's simple question but after that all right Question, but after that, I realize that it's not simple at all. So, first, before I start, I will need to introduce a way to write inequalities, a useful way to write inequalities in metric space. So it's I start with a graph. Yeah, maybe the graph. And I don't know, let me draw some graph. I don't know, let me draw some graph. It doesn't matter, it has edges. It's orange in this case, and it has non-edges, which I'll mark with gray, right? And I label some points in metric space by vertices in the graph. And can see the picture. So, like, imagine that this is the picture in my metric space X. And now I can see the, I want to find a comparison picture in the Hilbert space. So the same vertices with Twiddles, B, Twiddle, C, Twiddle. B twiddle, C twiddle, D twiddle. So I want to find a comparison configuration such that edges are not getting longer and non-edges are not getting shorter. Right? So for four points here, I have to write six inequalities, which I don't want to do, but let me start. Do, but let me start at least. So, what it means is that A B, so I denote by A minus B by absolute value distance in the metric space X, must be smaller equal than A twiddle B twiddle in the Hilbert space A C must be big or equal than A twiddle. Then A twiddle or C twiddle in the Hilbert space, and so on, right? So there are six inequalities. So, this is a key moment in the talk. So, if you didn't understand the graph comparison completely, please ask questions. No questions? So, I think you should say: so, what does it mean? So, does it mean that. Yeah, I could say, for example, I could draw some graph. Could say, for example, I could draw some graph, right? I could draw some graph, say, say this one, a tripod, and say that this is my gamma, right? And I could say that metric space satisfy gamma comparison, meaning that for any four points in my metric space, I can find a configuration in Hilbert space such that these inequalities hold. Hold right, no questions. So, let me still say a little bit more about this comparison. So, some basic examples. First of all, triangle inequality. It's a graph comparison, a graph comparison. For this graph, so it doesn't really make sense to consider, to encode triangle inequality in a metric space because it's by definition there, right? But you can just assume you have not a metric space, but just a set with a function. Set with a function that takes pair of points and returns a real number, then this will be this will encode triangle inequality. Does everybody see this? Right, I just want you to feel comfortable with the graph comparison because otherwise everything else will be a waste of time. Anybody has a question about this? Anybody has a question about this? Like, do you everybody see that triangle inequality is this graph comparison or not? So, why is it that one and not for the actual triangle? What could you explain? Well, for actual triangle, you have nothing, right? So, what for actual triangle, what it does, does it mean that you have three points ABC and there is a comparison picture. Let me make it green in Hilbert space. So, why not to take A twiddle? So, why not to take A twiddle, B twiddle, C twiddle at one point? So you just shrink all points to one point, right? So it's always exists. It always exists. It's just it doesn't like this, no condition at all, right? This graph, complete graph is not no condition at all, as well as empty graph, no condition at all, because you can put points sufficiently far from each other. From each other, right? So, yeah. So, in some sense, you may think that triangle inequality is a certain type of comparison with Hilbert space. Like you have, you may define Hilbert spaces the axiomatic way, right? And there is certain property there which you want to now consider spaces with this triangle inequality. Maybe more questions. Maybe you. Maybe you have a favorite graph and ask want to ask me what's the comparison there. Okay, so now next step is curvature bounded below and above, right? Curvature bounded above in the sense of stop, stop, stop, stop. So there's a question. And by graph, yes. So maybe Joseph, can you maybe ask it? Just yeah. Maybe Joseph, can you maybe ask it just to an on? Yeah, so if I understand, you're saying that to be a metric space means that for all positive D, with this blue sort of capital Lambda shaped graph, you have a graph comparison where the vertices that are joined by edges are distance d, and then the two vertices that aren't connected are 2d. And just if any points in your metric space satisfy, that's the triangle inequality. That's the triangle inequality and makes it a metric space, yeah. Right, I you i only didn't understand you said d you mean the metric or d is just some it can be any positive real number for the distance. I mean, I don't see d in the picture at all, right? So you have you have three points in your space, right? Right. You think that they are labeled, I mean, these points are labeled by virtue of graph. So you may think that there is actually a graph kind of in the metric space. And you try to find a comparison picture in Hilbert space. So that's your space X, that's Hilbert space, such that these two sides are not longer and this one is not shorter. Not shorter. Right. You're comparing to a graph with a metric on the vertices of the graph. And so the metric on the blue lambda shaped graph is... I mean, the graph is just a combinatorical object, right? Okay. So it just encodes what type of inequalities. And after that, you write this whatever. It tells you what sign on each edge, right? It doesn't increase or doesn't decrease. It doesn't increase or doesn't decrease, right? And that's it, right? So I'm not sure. Maybe, maybe if I will go further, it will be more clear. Sure. Right. So, so. There's just one more question. So about if the dimension of age can be arbitrary. Yeah. So if I think about it. Yeah. In principle, you don't need infinite dimension. I just want one container which contains all possible finite metric space. Finite matrix space. So you may always think that it's Euclidean space of sufficiently large dimension. It doesn't matter. I just don't want to specify dimension each time. For triangle inequality, Euclidean plane is good enough. Actually, a real line would be good enough, but it doesn't matter. So now good thing that Alexandra comparison could be encoded in the graph comparison, the graph. In the graph comparison, the graph is this right, and Alexander comparison with for curvature, curvature less or equal zero in the sense of Alexander, also can be included into graph. And this is this graph. Okay, so it's like first good thing that two comparisons and triangle inequalities. And triangle inequalities, all of them can be encoded into graph comparison nicely. And now the next problem which we consider will be to answer the question. Assume I have a metric space and I'm interested in what condition it has to satisfy to. Has to satisfy to be embedded into some Alexander space, curvature bounded below or curvature bounded above. And for the answers exist for case for five point point case and it's a predictable answer. Predictable answer, right? So roughly it's negative results. So nothing new appears on the steps. And there are conjectures for six point of point case. So there are conjectures and all of them formulated using a graph comparison. Comparison. Okay, so let me say what answers are, right? For five-point case, the curvature, sorry, curvature bounded below by zero is equivalent. Is equivalent to this graph. Okay, sorry. It's supposed to be main thing and it takes little place, right? So just for point condition and for curvature. So it's still something new, right? For the For the Alexandrov condition is a tripod. And it easily follows that this comparison plus intrinsic metric implies, I don't know, quadrapod, right? This graph, this graph comparison. And it turns out that this is a sufficient condition if the metric space. condition if the metric space with five points satisfy all these uh all uh the all the this graph comparison for all relabelings of vertices then it there is a alexander space that uh have it as a subspace and uh the case curvature uh curvature bounded below in the sense of it doesn't matter yeah in the sense of alexander frame put me here Sense of Alexander Freik put me here. That was actually Riemannian, which was slightly stronger. Is there nothing at all happening new, right? Just if for all relabelings you have original definition of Alexander, right? You go for this four-cycle, then it can be embedded. This is a result of Toyoda. Result of Toyoda and we have some kind of different proof of it, maybe shorter and maybe more conceptual, right, which I probably will talk about. And by the way, I forget to say, but let me say it now, that everything what I'm saying today is joint. Saying today is joint with Nina Lebedeva. Okay. So, joint work with Nina Lebedeva. Okay, so at the level of definition, so that's the statement of there are two results here. Maybe some questions about formulations. So So a five point metric space admits an embedding into Riemannian manifold with non-negative QG if and only if it satisfy satisfy this comparison. And five-point metric space admits in the cat zero, admits its isometric embedding into cat zero space if and only if it satisfies this standard comparison, right, for every four point. Right for every four point okay for six point uh for six point case uh uh uh six point uh so there are no there are no results right so we we don't know the actual answer but uh we have kind of questions or conjectures right Questions or conjectures, right? So, curvature curvature greater or equal zero. So, in the sense of Alexander, we know that it must satisfy the following graph comparisons. All right, so these are graphs. So these are graphs with six vertices. Okay, and one more. Okay. And at the moment, we don't see like every example of six-point metric space that satisfy all these comparisons. All these comparisons, we don't see examples that do not admit embedding into Alexander space. So, these conditions are necessary only if, real, only if, but if is the big question, right? So, for curvature. Curvature less or equals zero, we have another graph which is beautiful and symmetric and interesting, right? It's octahedron, so it's six points also. And again, and here we don't know almost anything, right? So we just have this graph, which is suspicious, right? Suspicious, right? Of course, the graph comparison for octahedron from the octahedron graph comparison, the Alexander comparison follows, right? Because simply the four cycle is an induced subgraph of factor hidden, right? But and But and okay, so what do we know about octahedron comparison? We know that it holds for product of trees, for trees, trees and products. And I should say that, like, I mean, the trees, I mean, no matter what you think about non-positive curvature, trees must be there. Curvature trees must be there and their products also, right? So it's kind of best examples of non-positive curvature. So, and it seems like I'm not 100% sure, but it seems like it's true for matrix on the plane plane. So, this actor-hidden comparison holds, but uh But don't kill me if I'm wrong here, right? I didn't check it 100%. And that's it, right? So, and I think like at this moment, it's a funny question, right? So even if the Arctic Hedon comparison holds for all cat zero spaces, then it's interesting, right? It's a new comparison, a new inequality. Right, it's a new comparison, new inequality. Or if it doesn't hold, then it's we have some metric conditions that distinguish trees and their product and Kadziro spaces. Yeah, by the way, I just realized that I'm talking to a larger audience and I'm talking about comparison without any introduction. Should I say something about Alexander Giormiti? Alexander Germiti, I'm not sure if you completely lost. Tell me other questions. Yeah, other questions, right? Maybe. So I have a question. So you told us that positive curvature and negative curvature are related to some graphs with four points. Graphs with four points. There are some more graphs with four points. Do they also correspond to some interesting class of metric species? So for four points, I don't know, like how many graphs. Like, I don't think so, right? So there are two graphs for four points, right? This one and this one, which are interesting. And if you do something else, then usually you get just triangle inequality or like it will. Inequality, or like it will follow from triangle inequality, or it will be just trivial. Like one example, we can see that before, like triangle, which has no condition at all, right? Maybe if you're interested, I could tell what's happening for a larger number of points, right? What's what like assume you just draw a random graph for say 10 with 10 vertices? What will happen? Are you interested? Happen. Are you interested? Yes? Yes. Yes. So let me draw a random graph, right? I don't know. Okay, so you see that there is a sub like induced subgraph which is a tripod, right? Right. And that means immediately that its curvature greater or equals zero in the sense of Alexander. Okay, so there is another induced subgraph which is four cycle and doesn't matter like n cycle, any cycle, if you have induced subgraph. If you have induced a subgraph which is cycle, it implies. So, excuse me, so now you are talking about geodesic spaces, yeah, so about intrinsic spaces. Right, right, right. I always talking about spaces with length metrics. Sorry, I should say it in advance. Right, but uh, so far, it doesn't matter, right? Uh, I Right I have a I have a some graph and if I have extract from it tripod by passing to a induced subgraph and a cycle by passing to induced subgraph then it means that curvature curvature is zero in the sense of Alexander so and if this is a now if it's length-metric Now, if it's length-metric, right, then it's simply not quite easy, but you can prove that the space is isometric to a convex subset of Hilbert space. So it's nothing interesting. So you have to be inventive to find a graph that doesn't have both, right? And octahedron is one of these subgraphs, one of these. One of these subgraphs, one of these interesting graphs, right? It has an induced subgraph, which is a four-cycle, but it doesn't have induced tripods. Whenever you choose a point, like, okay, I mean, you can check it. There are no induced tripods, right? Whenever you have three edges from one vertex of one of pairs of extra Vertices are connected by edge, right? So, more questions, maybe? So, are there maybe graphs which do not contain both? Right. Yeah. I mean, I don't. Well, actually, good question. At least. At least, I mean, for example, complete graph, right? It doesn't contain both, and it, but it doesn't have, like, it doesn't give you anything interesting. Actually, it's a good question, right? So, what, like, since we worked with graph comparison for quite a while, why not to look at carefully what you actually can describe by this language, right? But I didn't thought about this. But I didn't thought about this much. Right. So at least, I mean, I spent already 20 something minutes to describe graph comparison, but plus I described the main results, which I'm going to talk about. And am I finished with graph comparison? Everybody okay with this? Yes? Okay, so let me just say a few words about proofs. All right, so there are two trivial observations about... So I assume I have two Alexander spaces, A1 and A2. So they have a curvature bounded above or below, right, by zero. Right by zero. Then their product is also Alexander space. So if the curvature bounded below or curvature bounded above curvature, then this one has curvature. There's the same curvature bound. Okay, so it's an evident observation, and in addition, if you multiply metric of your Alexander space by a constant, then it still has the same Kaurichi bound. So once these two observations can be used to state that in some sense, Straight that, in some sense, the space of all metrics on a finite metric space that admits an embedding into Alexander space forms a convex subset. So the metric on finite metric space can be encoded by a metrics, right? You just fill a table with distances between pairs of points. Of points, so you have to have zero on diagonal, okay, and some dij. So, this way it's not like uh forms a convex, like the set of all these matrices do not form a convex subset, but if you put squares over distances, then these two observations imply that the space of metric space. Metric spaces that admits an embedding into Alexander space with non-positive, non-negative curvature bound forms a convex cone forms a convex cone cone in space of matrix of matrix. Let me put matrix square, so meaning that I take all the distances squared. So any question. Distances squared. So, any questions about this? Right? So, that's you may simply think that your answer, so the good start that the answer you are looking for, right, all the spaces that admits an embedding into some type of Alexander spaces forms a convex cone into space of all matrix. I put square to remind that I take distances squared. Remind that I take distances squared. Okay, so that's one observation. And another observation: if I take any graph comparison, the same thing hold. So that if I have one comparison picture, another comparison picture, I can take product of them into the product of Hilbert space, which is also Hilbert space, and that will produce the needed comparison picture for the sum. recent picture for the sum of matrix square sum of squared matrix okay so it seems like we have a simple question we have assume we have an answer right we we already know the answer and we want to prove that two convex sets coincide right so which is kind of question in convex geometry actually convex cones in some Convex cones in some for five points, it will be R10, right? So the 10 distances between five points, right? So you have explicitly like one of the sets, say green, red, is explicitly defined using inequalities. The other described by existence of embeddings. Existence of embeddings and the question if they coincide, right? So, there are, of course, this, I mean, if it would be convex compact sets, you should write. So, what you see, the green one, they say let it be, red one will be A and green one will be B. So you see that B contains A. A meaning that any space that satisfies, admits an embedding into Alexander space, satisfies the comparison. That's already proved. The question remains that actually yb is equal to A. Right? And in this case, if they would be compact sets, you should check the extremal points of convex. The extremal points of convex sets and check for every extremal point whether it admits an embedded control Alexander space and then take the products of the spaces. So it's a kind of observation that probably after which you might think that it's just a technical question, right? Question, right? No questions. Okay. So now right, so what we did what we did for the curvature bounded below, right? We started to check what's started to check what's the like we we started with this set b that a set that satisfy this graph comparison and we know that it's a convex cone and we wanted to find in this convex And we wanted to find in this convex cone extreme arrays, right? In other words, I may take unit sphere in the space R10, take the intersection of this unit sphere, say B prime. It's a convex set in the sphere, and I wanted to find extremal points of this convex set. All right. Right. And the externality can be like you have to translate extremality of such metric space in the into metric category. So you have to describe metric space that that uh uh uh that is extreme right so to to do this right so what like what does it mean that it's extreme that some of the comparisons uh for subgraphs of this graph become exact right so there might be two cases either it's a subgraph of that type graph of that type, right, which we already see for triangle inequality, that means simply that triangle inequality becomes equality, right? One point in your from this, like one point lies between other two points in the metric space. We might have exact condition for this three guys, so that means that there is a That there is a these four points admits an isometric embedding into in the plane, right, with one point inside of triangle. And we have we might have the comparison picture for the for the whole graph, right? Which means that simply you have tetrahedron with one Tetrahedron with one vertex inside living in Euclidean space. So the last case is already solved because your space simply admits an embedding into Euclidean space, which is an example of a Riemannian manifold with non-negative curvature. So this case is more complicated. More complicated, but it's there is a rather simple construction when you have one equality like this. What can be done, right? And what remains is that you have degeneracy, but only of that type. And this condition actually like complicated, right? And so we had to invent a certain way to. A certain way to describe such degeneracy. Right, so we the such degeneracy could be described by a diagram. So let me give one example of such diagram. Excuse me. So do I understand it correctly? So that this picture, so this degeneracy just means that in your five-point metric space, one point is in between two other points. Yes, yes. Yes, yes. So the triangle inequality is exactly like becomes equality for self-points. Yeah, yeah, but it does not, but it does not. So this finite space can still be non-extremal, yeah? Right, right, right, right. You have more conditions for extremality, right? So like you can count the dimensions. So each Each such degeneracy takes dimension two. So you subtract minus two in dimension. The total dimension of your space of rays is like 10 minus one. It's nine. So that means that you have five degenerate subsets. At least, maybe more. Right. Right, so you have a metric space, like you have five-point metric space. Uh, I think this one, two, three, maybe this one, right? One, two, three, four, five, right. That's one of the picture, right? And I want to describe a diagram, right? So, how to describe such degeneracy so it will be clear what's happening, right? So, consider, let me redo this. Let me redo this diagram because it might be okay. You can see this diagram. That's a few smooth lines with vertices on it. If I see a picture like this in this diagram, then I think that these three points is degenerate and one which is in the middle. Is in the middle, right? So, for this particular diagram, I see many the January trips, right? So, that's one of them. That is another, right, that's yet another, and yet this is yet another. Yet another and one more. So, this means that for all these triples, the triangle inequality is an equality, right? Right, right. So, uh, yeah, and you have to you have to classify all possible diagrams of that type with five points. So, and uh, at first we did it on computer, and after that, we uh made it Made the proof by hand, so I don't want really to say much about the, so I want to just scare you a bit to show like, oops. So I want to show the so it's pretty much brute force, brute force. Force, um, brute force uh, argument, right? Brute force search, right? Where we want at least five degeneracies, so it must be at least five of the five degenerate subsets, right? And uh, so those start with this column number five, right? I start with one degenerate set and continued. Set and continued. Now, there is one condition which is pretty much trivial: that every pair of points have to appear in one of the triples. So, in this diagram, what I do, I take pair which is not taken and trying to find how it might be extended by another triple. Right, so in that complete search, what we get is the There are three possibilities, like 13, 15, and 16. Right? So, that's only three spaces which we need to embed eventually. So, let me, since I started to scare you, let me scare you a little bit more. I will show complete search of it, right? So, like for each diagram, I have to check six cases or so, or sometimes nine. Or so, or maybe sometimes nine, right? And that's complete list of steps which we did, right? So that's enough to scare you, right? And but as a result of this search, we get these two diagrams. So that's one. And that's the other. So this one means simply that so you have five points in cyclic order. Each of them is the midpoint of neighbors. So this case is obviously embedded into circle, right? Right. And this one you can construct like with some work, you construct a metric on a disk with for such a metric. So once more, that means that, like if you have points A, say, and B, then points X, Y, and Z lie between A and B. Y lies Y lies between X and Z, B lies between X and Z, and right, that's pretty much it, right? So it's five conditions. So I said everything I wanted to say about these five point conditions for non-negative curvature. So if you have some questions, please ask. Otherwise, I will. Questions, please ask, otherwise, I will move to non-positive curvature. No? So, and for non-positive curvature, the situation we are a little bit more lucky. There is a kind of conceptual problem here is let. The problem here is to get a source of examples that can be used to embed the space. And for non-positive curvature, the situation is a little bit better. So what we can do is to consider associated form for the, so just another way to represent the metric on the, say, five. On the say five-point matrix space. So, first, let me remind what I'm proving. So, it's a result of Toyoda, Toyoda, but we give another proof. Suppose we have C4 comparison, comparison for cycle, comparison, then there is a cat zero space. Is a cat0 space space that with isometric copy of the space okay so uh so we we start with a metric on uh five point which is Five point, which is again 10 distances, it doesn't matter. So we want to encode this distance into quadratic form. What we do, we take a simplex in R4 and you can think that it's standard simplex, say origin and the basis of your R4. Basis of your R4, it doesn't matter, right? And you can construct a quadratic form such that vertices vi minus vj, this quadratic form is the same as a distance between correspondent points in your metric space squared. Right, so that's just linear condition. Just linear condition, right? It's just like a way to encode all 10 distances in one object, quadratic form. Right, now if quadratic form is non-negative, that means that this five-point metric space admits an embedding into Euclidean space, so there is nothing to do. Is nothing to do. Right? And so there is a interesting case when this quadratic form is negative at some vector. Then let us look at this vector. So we have this vector v. We know that w of v is negative. Of v is negative, and we may take a transversal plane and project this picture on this transversal plane. So that's the so there So what you will see in the picture is that if you have any four points, so if any four points on the after projection get into one plane, then they must form a convex quadriliter. So this picture is I'm sorry, this picture is not possible, right? This picture is not possible. And what you might get Possible and what you might get is the triangle with one point inside right sorry just right, right, yeah. Okay, and um Sorry, other way around. That is possible. That is not possible. I'm old and stupid. Right. Okay. So, and so what's like, okay, let me just describe the source. So, first of all, from this, it follows that your quadratic form might be negative. Might be negative, like might have only one negative eigenvalue. Your time is running out, so you have just a few words. So, so, but is it already end? Or sorry? Yes, how long? So, it's yeah, so more or less now. But, but okay, then let me just write. So, just find. So, yeah, so sorry for this. So, let me just say the source of examples comes from the fact that if you take convex hypersurface in the R31 in space-time, then this convex surface with intrinsic metric has K0 metric. And sorry again for taking too much time. So, let me finish here. Time, so let me finish here. But how, like, is it 10 minutes, five minutes? How long? Like, I thought, I thought I have one hour. No, 50 minutes, 50 minutes. Okay, 50 minutes and so you just, you, you, you, you, you just came. Okay, yeah. So I'm at right time, right? Yes. Yeah. So questions? So let us thank the speaker very much. So are there questions? So are there questions, comments? So yeah, so there's one question by Jan, please. Yeah, so hello. Sorry. So I have a question. So you said at the beginning that these results also generalize to like other curvature bounds than just zero, just positive or negative. But I just wonder how. But I just I just wonder how then they may look like because somehow the curve in terms of these graphs is somehow discrete. You can of course take these graphs into like take this graph comparison with the sphere instead of Hilbert space. Right. But as I said, and most of things which I'm most of parts of of most of parts of argument work for in this case right so there is a standard way right if you want to compare if you want curvature bounded below by one you just take not hilbert space but sphere unit sphere and hilbert space right or if you want to have curvature minus one you take hyperbolic space so that's the short answer right but uh as i said before right not everything works perfectly right Not everything works perfectly, right? For example, this the fact that space of metric is a convex cone, it's not true anymore, right? It's more complicated and right. And actually, if you ask exactly what works, what doesn't work, I'm not ready to answer, right? That's somewhere I could find it, but it's not in a second. But most of things work. Thank you very much. There's a question by Tima. There's a question by Tima. Yeah. Anton, near the end of your lecture, you said that you're old and stupid. I am elder. You want to say that you are. So that excuses my question. You spoke more about, and I know theory about geodesic spaces here, which is very well developed. But with the four-point comparison, there are plenty of examples of non-geodesic spacements which satisfy this condition. Do you know? This condition. Do you know much about that? So if you take a surface, convex surface, any surface in Rn with its ambient metric, it's zero curvature bound, right? So in between, there are plenty of objects. Right. But well, at least I don't know anything interesting, right? Among these objects. Most like things which are interesting are always with intrinsic metric. Okay. sigmatic. Okay, so there is a funny result of Toyoda that about these spaces that four cycle condition implies n-cycle condition without assumption that the metric is length. That's kind of surprising and interesting, right? But I cannot comment. I cannot give more comments on this. Thank you. There are other questions or comments. Doesn't seem to be the case. So then let us think Anton again. And yeah, we have a break for five minutes.
