All right, thanks a lot, and thanks to the organizers for giving me the opportunity to share these ideas, which are in joint work with Jeff Bergfolk and Martino Lupini. And maybe I should say in spirit, not in content, there is something similar a little bit to the first talk on Monday of Lubotsky's talk, because this is what Ulam Stability somehow tries to This is what Ulam Stability somehow tries to capture. Generally, an Ulam stability framework is a framework. Usually, what you are trying to do is you have a context where you have some notion of a map, a nice map. Let's call it a map that it's trivial, let's say, like it preserves whatever it needs to be preserved. And you have some notion of an approximate map. And often what you're trying to show is that every approximate map is Every approximate map is close in a certain sense to a trivial map. In the same way that in that talk, we had the points of a permutation group, elements of a permutation group that approximately commute, and you won't find things close to them that actually entirely commute. So there is a little bit of that here, but in a very different setup. But Woland stability is usually what it refers to. All right. So let me start basically with a concrete example and go from there. And go from there. So let's say you have the additive group of the reals, and then you have the rationals, which is a dense countable subgroup of it, and you look at the quotient. And let's say the first question is how many homomorphisms from the quotient, group homomorphisms, from the quotient to the quotient you have. And if you think a little bit about it, you think first the reals as a Q vector space. So if you think about how many homomorphisms from the reals to the reals are, you can take a continuum sized basis. A continuum-sized basis of the reals as a Q-vector space, and wherever you map them, this extends. So you have two to the continuum many homomorphisms. Of course, when you look R mod Q, what you have done, you have removed one dimension. You're looking at a codimension one space of a continuum-sized Q-vector space. So still the same argument applies. So there are two to the continuum, so two to the two to the L F naught, two to the continuum many abstract. Many abstract group homomorphisms from the group additive group R mod Q. It's often called the Vitale set, so it's a group. Right, now the question that I'm interested in, the next question, is how many of these homomorphisms are actually definable? And for us here, definability comes from the sigma algebra of Worel Z. algebra of borel sets so you're you're you're thinking of okay so so you're thinking of of the reals you're thinking of the reals as a topological space and then the borel sets is the sigma algebra generated by by the open sets so think of it as any set that can be calculated using a countable logic gates you apply you apply countable logic gates over over the open sets whatever you get is borel these are the sets that are definable so but but we're we won't talk about But we won't talk about the maps in the quotient that are definable. How do we do that? Well, so the question is: how many of such homomorphisms are definable? What do I mean by definable? And maybe this is an important picture because it will come up again and again in this talk. So let's say you have a homomorphism, an abstract homomorphism. You call this homomorphism definable if you can find a Borel lift. So what's a Borel lift? A Borel lift is just a Borel function from Lift is just a Borel function from the real to the reals. It's just a function. It's not a homomorphism on the level of reals, just a function. It's a Borel recipe for explaining what you do in the quotient, but you do it in the pre-quotient. It's a Borel function that commutes with projections. This is what. So we call an abstract homomorphism in the quotient, we call it definable if we can find the Borel lift. If we can find the bored lift of this map. So maybe some immediate examples are the following. So if you give me any rational number, see, you can think of the map that maps every real to the multiple, c times x. And it's very easy to see that, okay, this induces of course a definable homomorphism on the quotient. homomorphism on the quotient. Now, in a certain sense, we would like to call this a trivial, a trivial definable homomorphism, because it is not just a Borel lift, but so it's not just a Borel function, it's not just a Borel function, but in fact it is continuous homomorphism. So on this level, generally we demand only it to be a Borel function, but here it turns out to be a continuous homomorphism. So it's a very strong. So it's a very strong, it has a very strong properties, right? But it turns out, and this is what is the interesting rigidity phenomenon, the Ulam stability phenomena, it turns out that every definable homomorphism is trivial. So anytime you have a homomorphism of the quotient that lifts the Borel map, in fact, you can lift it to a homomorphism on the level of R. And this is basically the phenomenon. And this is basically the phenomenon that we want to study in other setups as well. Right. So now observe that because here definable homomorphisms are parametrized by the rationales, which is a countable set, the answer to this question is just L F naught. It's just countably many. So there's a huge gap. You have only countably many definable homomorphisms, and you have 2 to the 2 to the L F naught general homomorphism. Aleph node general homomorphism. There's a huge gap. Okay, so this here is a theorem and has a name. So let me write. It works in a little bit more generality. So generally, whenever you have two countable dense subgroups of the reals, any homomorphism between them that lifts the Borel map on the level of the reals, actually, it's trivial in that it lifts the homomorphism on the level of the reals. On the level of the real. Now, problems like this have been studied even earlier than the kind of a Erikin result. Maybe the oldest one I can think of is a theorem due to Velitskovic, which Velitskovic extracted this theorem from a paper of Shella, and I will say a little bit of you some historical remarks in a second about it. In a second, about it. But here it's a rigid result for Boolean algebras. So, here you look at the Boolean algebra of all countable subsets of the natural numbers. And of course, inside there, you have a sub-algebra, a countable dense sub-algebra of all finite sets. And when I'm talking about density, I imply there is a topology. Of course, the topology you put here, you can identify this with a counter set. Set and identify this with a counter set. So you have a Boolean algebra, which is a Polish Boolean algebra, a topological Boolean algebra, and you have this dense sub-algebra. And then what you want to do is you want to understand the, you look at the quotient algebra, P omega mod fin, we call it, and you look at the automorphisms of it. You have many, many automorphisms, but the question is, which are definable, which lives to a Borel map on the level of P omega. And the theorem of Felix Kovich says again that. Felix Kovic says again that, of course, there is a notion of triviality.
