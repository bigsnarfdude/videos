But before starting my talk, I would like to thank all the organizers, including Professor Irish Matano and Peter Polak, Leo Girardin, and Girokazinomiy and Luka Rossi, who's given opportunity for me to give a presentation of my research in the DIRS workshop today. So, my topic is to introduce My topic to introduce is the short interface motion of the Allen equation with force-medium diffusivity. So for today's talk, I will like to give in the following order. So I first briefly introduce my equation and try to explain the short single limit of this equation. First, quite Equation first by performing some kind of some form of standard extension, and then we I give a sketch on how I can show that the limiting interface motion actually as how the how it is related to the actual solution of the Elyka equation. So for the Einkan equation was actually proposed in 1979 by In 1979, by Ali and Kanye Moderu to describe the describe the phase separation phenomena of the metal alloy. So, what where they consider some kind of energy function like 18 here, where we're having the kinetic energy term and the potential term, potential energy which has the property of equal equipotential condition for the For the state u equal to plus and minus one. And then by thinking that u will tend to the state which will minimize the energy functional, they derive the well-known Allen equation. So the figure below is the expected result for their equation where some kind of interface. Transitional codes of the order of the width of Bitcoin, which will separate the solution having the state plus and minus one. And for today's talk, what I want to think is the following to a little different Allencan equation, where instead of the linear diffusion, I want to think about the force-medium diffusion light. About the force medium division of u to the field here, the field u is equal to the u to the power m, where m is strictly larger than one. The reason for studying for such equation is because the first medium diffusion occurs in several situations, such as cell movement, where in some of the models, The pressure of the cell is depends on the current density. So in that sense, the desired diffusion is naturally obtained. So in today's talk, what I want to think is the phi is equal to the u to the power m and equal to the u to the power m and f the reaction term is the bistable reaction term with the zero and one as the stable steady states and in order to give some some potential condition as uh as in the in the concerting i give the third condition uh which is the equivalent to the the equipotential condition of the land concerting so even with such even with in this Even with in this equation, what I expect for my solution to behave is as in the following figure. So as described in the earlier figure, what I expect is that some kind of an interface called gamma t will occur such that from this comma, the steep transition. The steep transition layer, of course, of the order of people with the width of all the people, which makes such that the solution u will become either zero or one away from this compact T. So this is the expected result for my first median equation. And then in order to describe this one, let's try to first try the formula synthetic expansion. Hormonal authentic expansion where we expect all the orders will be related to the order of out to the ipsum. So in the spatial direction, at least near the interface, since the solution, the stiff condition layer occurs with the distance of the vision scale, it is natural to think of the at least near the interface. At least near the interface, the solution has can be written as in as follows: where we have the leading term, which describes the stiff transition layer. And the Z variable is actually the variable that describes such a stiff transition changes. Here, the D is the sine design function with respect to the function. With respect to the comma t, where inside the comma t, I expect the sine to be, the value d to be strictly positive, and outside, I let d to be negative distance with respect to the interface on my t. And then after the literature, it should connect up because the The state zero and one. And for the next time, the next time it should describe the order of each one and each and each of them. And this is the extension of what I expect for the near, at least near the interface. And away from the expected interface as described in the figure before, I want the solution user to be close to zero or one. Close to zero or one so that at least out inside the epsilon should be close to one and outside the epsilon it should be close to zero with the with some kind of perturbation for the epsilon or epsilon square and uh i and and and naturally we have some kind of a matching condition uh for the user uh for the leading uh for the for for the outer expansion and the inner expansion. Outer expansion and the inner expansion. Even so, if we, if I want my solution, if my expansion like this wants to become the actual solution by computing the L of H naught, I want them to be at least close to zero, equal to zero, independent of the choice of epsilon. So, which means I need to, which means I want to, what I want to do. want to the what what i want to do is to make a direct computation of elevation and all the time from starting from the one original square and one of the and the rest of the terms and let's try to find appropriate function user and new one which makes the which make these terms to become zero independent of this one but since the one is square scale is the largest one uh scale is the largest one uh let's try to find some solution which satisfies this uh this uh this one equal to zero which means that uh which we want to find the following ordinary different solution the following ordinary differential equation and for such an equation it it is we can see it as some kind of a station it is a stationary solution and for such a stationary solution it is known that from the work of the the post pro The process of Posan in 1986. The station, such a solution exists in a unique sense. For this, I will talk about a little bit more in the later pages. So, noting that the solution user is indeed a stationary solution, what we need to tackle next is the next scale. Next scale, one of the one of the scale. So, for this equation, for this term, I expect U1 to satisfy the following ordinary differential equation. And even though we do not know under the assumption that U1 actually exists, or we can derive from the fact that U0 is the stationary solution, we can do some switch. We can do some sort of rigorous computation and obtain that the light anti-should satisfy some kind of an integral equation like this, which means if the u1 actually do if you want actually if you want actually just then the right hand inside should satisfy the same equation, which means we can obtain some kind of a k equation. Of a key equation for the sine design function, at least on the interface. And where the lambda is the actual ratio of the integral of these two components. And in fact, even though this integral was done with the help of UCERO, by using By using the equation of the station away solution, we can actually obtain the reverse equation for the lambda zero with the help of the non-linear function phi and the ration term f. And this is why and from this very pd equation, what we expect is that the interface would move according to the motion by meter. According to the motion by meta vector, it's but unlike the linear diffusion, what we can observe is that some kind of the ratio of the motion by mechanism may change due to the coarse medium diffusion. So, this is the expectation that we can obtain from the formula standard expansion. And what I want to do from now is to connect the how to connect the motion by means of artificial interface motion and the actual solution. For that, what I want to, in order to describe it, I plan to construct some kind of a pair of seven super solutions which will make some connection. Which will make some connection to the interface for motion by mean curvature, motion by mean curvature movement, and the solution of the force-medium equation. And the structure is in the in the form of such substance solution, it can be can be naturally obtained by following, can be naturally, can be constructed by following the idea of the formula. The idea of the formula synthetic expression, which means that we use the stationary solution u0 and the solution u1, which I expected the existence in before. And for the p1 and 22 here, I put it in and for user and new ones, they will help us to control the big older terms, such as whatever is square, whatever is not. And the remainder terms, if every time there are people one epsilon, one scale, I expect I want, I will control, I will control the term by the help of K turn and the Q turn. And in order to actually show that U plus and minus is actually the certain supersupolation that I want, what I need is some kind of estimate for the user and U1 for instance. For the user and you want person, and then we need some, we need to use, we need to use the comparison principle to prove that u plus and minus will have will bound above and below for the solution u is and since we're doing since we're dealing with the coarse medium diffusion, we need to think of the solution in a weak sense. To think of the solution in a weak sense, and for that, which means that the comparison principle should be thought of as can be considered as a comparison principle in a weak sense. And in order to use such a comparison principle, I will use the method used in the paper of Alpau and Tilhox in 2010, which means that if we if my construction If my constructive super solution or subsolution satisfies these three conditions, then it will and naturally, then it will actually give an upper bound for the user. And naturally, if three conditions are satisfied with the opposite inequality, then it will naturally become the subsolution and will give us the lower bound for the. Give us the lower bound for the solution UH. So, with this compared, with this lemma, in order to use this lemma, what I need to first check is some regular, regular, we need to check some estimates for the user when we want. And for the, at least for the keys, at least for the two state. is to say to for this let's try to fix the case for the approach median dependence for the case of power equal to two and for this case and uh the result of possible in 1986 we can observe that the user behaves and has the solution you have actually have some kind of has some has the free boundary. As the free boundary points where I denoted the zero. And user, a stationary solution will have this kind of regularity, meaning at least near the free boundary, user will behave as a people g to the power true, g to the square, and user, it is natural to user of g. The uterus, the derivative uterus will be behaved of the order of people g. But and with this information, we can actually also write rivers if we can obtain some net regularity for UMOR, at least also near the free memory, because the huge error can be, will be by during the striple computation, we can. Scriptable computation, we can write you one in the form of the following, we can write it directly in the following in the following form. But if we with this explicit form, if we compute the behavior of u1 near the free boundary, u1 will behave, u1 will behave on the scale of people if people see NNC, which means that it is natural to also we can compute. to also we can compute mu1g it will behave of the order uh near the uh will behave like uh equal of ng near the free boundary but this this regularity actually gives some of the difficulty may occur some difficulty uh in in constructing a solid super solution suppose uh we consider uh we try to draw uh the shape of u0 plus u1 Of u0 plus u1, which means that we consider when epsilon is equal to 1 and try to draw how the u0 plus u1 behave, then because u1 has some bad behavior near the free boundary, u0 plus u1 will have this kind of a graph, which means that if I add some constant, any con plot. Constant, any con plot constant, it will the graph will naturally become like in the right-hand side. But because of this, if we check the lemma that I introduced here, this will fail the first condition that I for this lemma, which means it might be hard to use the construction of the solvent. The substance, at least for the super solution, to use this form to construct the super solution. At least for the negative, at least for the subsolution, since we take the negatives, take away some, we subtract something, so it might be okay to construct a sub-solution, but it will but in view of the constructing the super solution, it will be a little bit difficult to construct one. difficult to construct one. Such a difficulty is naturally can be explained naturally can be explained in which we think of a simple case, if we think of a simple example. Let's say if we consider the spherical symmetry case where the initial interface starts from the circle and if and because due to the due to the mean coverage. Due to the mean coverage of flow, this interface will shrink to a point. Let's think of the behavior under such a movement of the interface. Let's say we think let's try to think of the behavior of the solution you, if not, for on uh if uh uh with the uh on the this red line. On this red line. Then, even though the interface would try to shrink as time goes by, because of the force median diffusion, because the diffusion becomes zero when u is equal to zero, the free boundary of the solution mutual will not move, which will cause some kind of a bad behavior near the value close to zero. Close to zero. Even so, even so, the what I want to say here is that because the free boundary does not have a have a match, does not shape in the same way as the interface, it will make us to construct, it will have some difficulty in constructing the super solution, at least for the sub solution. At least for the sub-solution, it is okay because the aim of the constructing the sub-solution is to describe the mode of the interface. So we can neglect how, neglect the information of the free boundary. So we can actually construct the in the as in the same way that I introduced before. But for the super solution case, we need a little. Case, we need a little bit of different idea to construct one. In order to obtain a new method, let's try to formalize this extension and in this time, let's say you want, in this time, you want does not depend on Z variable and state and state, let it become under the under the assumption. under that under the assumption let's try to get to again the formal extend the formal assumption expansion and what we can expect is that the the that that except for the human terms every terms in the in the in the computation before will come in hand and come here but what i want to do here is to give some formal authentic expansion without the u on because you on actually was a bad function in order to during function in order in during the construction of the sub of the super solution. So instead of in order not to use the u1, we need some way to control the gradient applied d3 in some way. And the idea or in order to control this one, I suggest to think of this term not as a vulnerability. Think of this time not as a one-dimensional scale, but as a one-to-one square scale, which means I want to take everything as a historian square scale and try to think of a solution u, which will control both the one-vision square scale and one-vision scale. Which means that since I'm adding this one to the one-devicent square scale, one-to-reason square scale, which means, it means that some kind of a the some kind of uh it will it will become the additional terms here will be can be thought of with some additional advanced terms which will naturally which will end up thinking use you as some kind of a travel way solution so for such a travel way so for such a travel way solution we can we we we want to find the following the solution you satisfy the following Satisfying the following ordinary differential equation. And such a existential uniqueness of such a problem solution can be derived by using the method of the process also in 1986. And moreover, because such a solution, moreover, such a solution, such as the behavior of such terminology solution. Of such fermentable resolution depends on the sign of the delta. For example, if the sign of delta, which means in here the Laplacian is actually positive, what we expect is the travel wave solution will have some kind of a pre-boundary condition. In this case, u0 will not become zero at this three-boundary, but it has some positive value here. And for the negative value, if the delta is a negative value, it means that the solution you will behave will converge to zero within an exponential rate, which will have this kind of condition. Moreover, since such a solution exists uniquely, Uniquely, at least within the free boundary, we can expect that the solution u and the speed traveling with speed C will be smooth at least with respect to delta, at least delta near the near zero. And from the smoothness of such a smoothness of C with respect to delta, we can actually approximate the distance. approximate the distance which was which appeared in the form of extension this term. We can approximate this term as the C prime of the C prime of zero times the log five entity with some error term, which means that as fst tends to zero, we expect that the interface of the motion actually behaves some sort of behaves as the behaves the mean coverage flow. Which is the very equal, which is the very same result as in the previous slides. So, with this idea in hand, what I want to do is to again construct, we construct user only by using the travel family of the travel solution. So, in order to construct a good such in this way, what we need is In this way, what we need is some kind of regular key estimates for the u, especially for the derivative with respect to use. And we need to choose z d this function close to the avoidance function, which makes you stay away, certainly stay away from zero. The reason for this is actually because you behave a little bit for plus in the equal to positive case. Equal to this positive case because in this case, the as I say is shown here, the derivative of the U reduce the G variable is not equal to zero, which we may have the very same problem that I explained in this slide. We have the very so in order to avoid such a difficulty, I will change a little bit. So I will come back. Could you wrap up in the next minute or so? So it is almost done. So for the U delta, we can actually write explicitly, which means that U delta can be written as a function of U and some kind of a function can be considered as some kind of a function with the help of U. So we can with such explicit form explicit form, we can obtain the Obtain the estimates at least near the three boundary for the u zero, which have this kind of result, which will help us in control controling every terms. For the ug terms, what I suggest is to construct the GD in the following form, with the H and Y, with the appropriate H epsilon and G equals. For H epsilon, I expect some kind of different strips. The stiff changes of four for the eight six months within the width of the very epsilon changes. So this will if I use such a equation for H epsilon, it will natural it is natural. H say the H behave, the regular case will behave really, really bad. However, since we since such a change in the core in this S in this In this small area, choosing keys are really, really well. We can actually control H2 in another way. We can actually control such because it will appear with the U terms. So for that, I will try to explain and for the Gibson term, I define Gibson to be a very limited. To be a very unique point satisfying this kind of relation. Since the U was smooth inverters like the delta, we can actually compute rigorously for the derivative of V simul, which ends up having that every derivative with respect to the space for this time will also can be bounded, which means that which ends up making Making which will help us to construct the making new but the actual super solution that I want. And that is the end of my talk. So thank you for your attention. Any questions? No, yeah. Okay, in the interest of time, let's switch on to the next speaker, but we're all welcome to send the questions. But we're all welcome to send questions offline here. So, thank you again, Dr. Park.
