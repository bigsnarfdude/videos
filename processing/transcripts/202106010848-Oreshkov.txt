Do you hear me now? Sorry. Yeah, yeah, we can hear you. All right. Okay. Go ahead, Dr. Sorry. Okay, great. Well, thank you. Okay, great. Well, thank you. Thank you, the organizers, Plaminia, Lucien, and Rob for the workshop and for the kind invitation. So I will be talking about time delocalized systems. And today I will present some new results in comparison to what you might have heard before. So, I think that this is a relatively diverse audience. Do you see all Audience, do you see all of that stuff that pops up on my screen? I'm sorry about that. Do you see the control and everything? So no, we don't see any extra stuff. It looks fine. And do you see my pointer? Yes. Yeah. Yep. It looks great. Okay. So some of you might have heard me talk about the subject and might be familiar, but as it is a diverse audience, I will take a little bit of time. Diverse audience, I will take a little bit of time to briefly at least try to have introduced the concepts that I will talk about. So, I'm just going to say a few words about processes with indefinite causal order because this is the motivation for this work. So, the motivation for this work is to really understand these types of processes in which sense they might exist in our quantum mechanics, in quantum gravity, and how to understand their descriptions. And so, I will discuss the quantum switch and how we can. Discuss the quantum switch and how we can understand it in terms of time delocalized systems. One thing I will present that you might not have heard about is how to re-describe practically any circuit with respect to an arbitrary choice of subsystems, which actually encapsulates these different transformations between, let's say, the standard description of an experiment, the process matrix description, and other things that have been proposed in the literature. Then I will also discuss which kinds of I will also discuss which kinds of processes we know to be realizable within the standard quantum mechanics in the sense of realizable on time delocalized systems. In particular, there are processes violating causal inequalities that surprisingly do have realizations in this sense. And at the end, I will discuss the link between this notion of transformations of circuits, then jumping between different tensor products, the compositions of the circuits. Tensor product decompositions of the systems we have, and quantum reference frame transformations. So, the concept of indefinite causal order, or it was called indefinite causal structure, from an operational perspective was introduced by Lucian in his papers here, where he argued that, of course, in the theory of quantum gravity, we don't expect the usual causal structure of space-time to be classical and predefined, and combining the probabilistic. And combining the probabilistic nature of quantum theory with, or whatever remains of it in this unification with the notion of dynamical causal structure should lead to something like indefinite causal structures. And actually, he proposed this causaloid framework, which is an abstract framework in which we might think about such indefinite causal structures in operational language. And then there was the paper by Kiribella, Dariano, and Terinotti and Vadiron, who introduced the And Vaderon, who introduced the famous quantum switch, which is actually the first concrete example of a quantum process with indefinite causal structure or causal order. And then there was this paper by myself and Fabio Costa and Charles Love Bruckner, where we formulated a framework to study the possibility for indefinite causal relations, which is based on correlations. And in this framework, basically, the assumption was that we have this local experiment. Was that we have these local experiments which obey the usual rules of quantum theory, but we don't assume a global causal order between them. And so, based on some very natural assumptions, namely that the equivalence classes of events in these laboratories are still described by the same equivalence classes as in standard quantum mechanics, one can argue that the probabilities for different types of outcomes of these different local experiments should be given by a formula like that, where this is called a probability. Formula like that, where this is called a process matrix, a positive semi-definite operator. And these are basically the choice operators representing the completely positive maps of the local outcomes. And this process matrix is normalized on channels, basically, because we want the sum of probabilities to be equal to one whenever the parties perform deterministic quantum operations. This process framework can be understood as a higher-order transformation in the language. As a higher-order transformation in the language introduced by Kiribel and co-workers, basically, you can picture it like this. I mean, Alex Kissinger yesterday spoke about similar perspective from a categorical language. So basically, you can think that the process matrix is essentially this transformation takes as input local operations here depicted for Alice and Bob in particular, which could be extended to act on an. Could be extended to act on ancillas and it produces another operation, specifically when these are channels, this is another channel, and it is capable of describing all kinds of situations that we are familiar with in space-time, such as, for instance, the case in which Bob is before Alice. This is an example of a process that can be described in this language. This is, in fact, described by the theory of quantum comps, again, by the Pavier group. These types of situations, there are process matrices that have this kind of form. You have the identity matrix on the system that gets traced out at the end. And one can also describe situations where you have classical ignorance about a specific causal realization of the process. And these are the types of processes that we called causally separable processes in our first paper with Fabio and Chaslov. For the bipartite case, these are just mixture. Bipartite case, these are just mixtures of processes corresponding to these situations in which Alice is before Bob or Bob is before Alice, or space-like separated can be included in any of these. One can similarly define, but it's slightly more complicated, notion of causal separability for multipart-type processes. One has to take care of the fact that actually it is completely in agreement with our intuition of causality that the order of events in the future could depend. Events in the future could depend dynamically on what happens in the past, in particular, depending on what happens in Alice's laboratory, the order of Bob and Charlie could change. And this leads to a slightly more complicated notion of causal separability, which I will not spell out here. But what's interesting is that there are these processes that are not causally separable. So, currently, our understanding of the landscape, and this is just a crude kind of Venn diagram, is the following. The following both in the bipartite in the multi-partite case, we have this kind of separation. Well, for the bipartite case, there are some open problems, but essentially we have the causally separable sets. Those are the types of processes for which we can imagine a specific type of quantum story with a definite causal order, possibly with classical ignorance about what exactly happens. And then there is the rest, is the causal non-separable ones. And now in our Us and now in our original paper we demonstrated this the existence of such non-separable processes with a striking example of a process that can actually produce correlations that we say violate causal inequalities. So this is violating causal inequalities is like a device independent test of the fact that these correlations are incompatible with an underlying causal explanation. They are incompatible in principle even by explanation by some general Explanation by some general probabilistic theory, which obeys certain reasonable notions of causality. But it turns out that there are also causally non-separable processes that don't allow such device-independent tests. Nevertheless, we can say in a device-dependent fashion that they are causally non-separable. One example is the quantum switch that I will discuss very soon. So, the existence of this kind of non-causal processes or causal Processes or causally non-separable processes. It's very interesting from a theoretical point of view. And the natural question is whether they exist in physics in a certain sense. Sorry. In particular, one of the motivations, as we said, is the hypothetical unification of quantum mechanics and gravity. So one question is how they could possibly exist at this intersection of quantum theory and gravity. But could they also exist within standard quantum mechanics? Within standard quantum mechanics, maybe in a novel sense. Just like you know, the position of a particle could be indefinite, maybe the time or order of events could also be indefinite by just exploiting standard superposition. And actually, the quantum switch is one example where it is by some part of the community, it is widely accepted that this is a realizable process. Another part of the community might object, other people out of the community might. Other people out of the community might strongly object. And what I want to discuss is the sense in which we can say it does have a realization within the standard quantum mechanics. So here is again a brief review of what the quantum switch is. Originally introduced as a higher order transformation, it's something like that. It takes two transformations here without loss of generality and for simplicity. I take them to be unitaries, extended to act on ancillas. Ancillas and it does and it produces. You just imagine plugging them in in this abstract mathematical transformation, and it produces a new transformation. So it acts like this. There is this control qubit here, and there is the target system. So if the control qubit in the past is prepared in the zero states, what we have is effectively as if the target system is being sent first to the operation of BOP. Operation of Bob and then goes to Alice and then goes out. And if it is one, we get the opposite situation with the control qubit coming out in its logical state here. And because the transformation is linear, essentially, if you imagine preparing all kinds of superpositions, what you get here at the end is a superposition of the previous outcomes. And the transformation itself, we may interpret as something like realizing superposition of different circuits. One can see it as a problem. One can see it as a process matrix. You know, process matrices normally don't have three wires sticking out, apart from possibly on the ancillas. So we put somebody in the past and in the future here, David and Charlie, and we can say using the theory of causal non-separability, this is a non-causally separable process in a precise sense. And however, it actually cannot violate causal inequality. So this was first pointed out in these papers. Out in these papers. Nevertheless, it's been shown to offer all kinds of interesting advantages for information processing tasks. So it is still a rather interesting process. And it's been claimed and implemented in the lab, actually. It's been claimed that this process has a natural realization, just as suggested by the previous picture I showed you. Where if we go back here in these lines, you can imagine basically realizing. Lines, you can imagine basically realizing this idea by sending particles following different paths, and this has been done in the laboratory by different groups with different variations. And one natural question is, in which precise sense is this a realization of the process? And so, here I'm going to give like a working definition, which I think is rather minimalistic, of what we might mean by a realization of the process. mean by a realization of the process and you're free to demand more if you like. What I will speak about is exactly for a notion. I mean I'm gonna spell out precisely the sense in which at least this type of definition is met. So I say that there is a we say that a certain process of this kind has a physical realization if there is an experiment in which every element of the mathematical description of the process, here are Hilbert spaces, operations Here, Hilbert spaces, operations on these Hilbert spaces, etc., has a physical counterpart that itself can be considered a realization of that element. And it is this last part that, of course, could be subject to debate. And I'll argue that there is a natural sense in which we could see those types of experiments as realizations. And this is given by the notion of timely localized systems. So if you look at what an experiment of this kind looks like, described in the This kind of looks like described in the language of circuits. Here is roughly what it is. I mean, you can choose different systems with respect to which to describe it, and you have the preparation in the past, and then you have this essentially controlled operations of Alice and Bob. So, really, if you describe how the thing evolves in time, this is the kind of circuit that you would see. And the question is: where are exactly these operations of Alice and Bob, which are claimed as part of the definition of this, the traditional definition of the program? The traditional definition of the process. So let's analyze the concept of system a little bit. So we step back here and think about what quantum systems are. Traditionally, when we talk about circuits, let's say, we write that here is an example of some kind of circuit which is ordered in time. Sometimes there is no explicit time arrow, but in a way, the composition, if it's a Composition, if it's a causal circuit, is implicitly presumed to be related to a temporal composition, and the systems are usually systems at definite times. Now, this is a framework in which one can formulate a large class of theories using this so-called operational probabilistic theories framework by again Kiribala and Hardy. And in the case of quantum theory, the system. Quantum theory, the systems are associated with Huber spaces and the operations they are associated with what we call quantum instruments. These are sets of completely positive maps that take you from the input system to the output system, and the sum is a CPTP map. Okay, so that's as far as standard circuits are concerned. We have this Hilbert space associated with each of these wires. However, I mean, it's been a kind of very well-known fact. Of very well-known facts, a very kind of common understanding that usually when we speak about physical systems in practice, you know, every such system in a given experiment is usually a subsystem of some larger Huber space. This has been pointed out by Zanardi. And when I say a subsystem, I will mean most generally a tensor factor of a subspace of a larger Hue space because the system might be defined. The system might be defined only in a certain subspace. In fact, from the theory of error correction, it is well known that the so-called subsystem principle, that this type of encoding is the most general faithful encoding of quantum information. So if you imagine that somehow you put the information contained, let's say in a qubit in a given Huber space, in a way that it can be retrieved with some operations, it will most generally be contained in a factor. Really, it be contained in a factor of a subspace. So, and in practice, you know, in reality, the types of things we refer to as subsystems, usually they are spatially local to a large extent, but not necessarily, like a photon, for instance. They, you know, they are subsystems of some larger Hilbert space. A subsystem is defined by the algebra of operators acting on that system. System. So I may switch between talking about algebras and systems. So here is an example of a different decomposition of a Hilbert space. So imagine you have a given Hilbert space that can decompose in, I mean, if the dimension factorizes appropriately, there are infinitely many decompositions into tensor factors. So let's take as an example here that you have a Hubert space that decomposes into two systems A and B or to some other. Into two systems A and B or to some other system C and D, which need not at all be compatible, so say in this in the sense that they might be overlapping with A and B. The algebras need not commute with the original ones. So then, well, in one decomposition, you might, and choosing a basis, you may describe the state that lives on two systems as, say, the density matrix rho. In the other decomposition, you might describe it as this. You might describe it as this transformed state, where this V is the isomorphism relating the basis chosen for the original decomposition and the basis in the other decomposition. Or here is another simple example, just that we gain intuition. Let's say that you have a unitary from AB to C D, and let's imagine another decomposition of the C D Hilbert space. Now, one particular decomposition we might imagine is the one defined by the Defined by the way by the actual unit area itself, because this unit area isomorphically maps the observables on A and B onto some observables at the output. Let's call them, let's call these images of the original systems A prime and B prime. If I go to this description, this unitary would look like two, let's say, identity transformations, assuming here that I've chosen the basis according to the isomorphism. Now, another thing I want to point out is that, yes, we spoke about systems being defined at well-defined times in the standard approach, but we may also think about composite systems that consist of systems at different times. Imagine that such a circuit is divided into blocks, different parts like this. These are so-called quantum comps. You know, each of these quantum comps, yes, it may have. Quantum comps, yes, it may have an internal structure, but just like any other transformation here, it might have an internal structure. And actually, these quantum comps, they're transformating proper transformations from all the input wires that enter here to all the output wires described by the theory of quantum comps. So you can think of them as transformations, although, of course, there is some constraint on what these transformations could be. They are a subset of the usual types of transformations you might consider from AF. Consider from AF to DHI because usually we imagine that A and F are both in the past, are in the past of all the output systems. But here, you know, you can still see this as a transformation. Not only that, you can actually make operational sensitivity as a transformation in the usual way we understand transformations. We can prepare states on the input, we can make measurements on the joint output, and thereby make a tomography and verify this operation and the way you would. Verify this operation. And the way you will do this is by effectively pulling down this wire, pulling this wire up, by inserting an identity channel in practice. And you can just reduce this to a standard type of preparation in the past and another measurement in the future. So you can test your operation. So we have here two ideas. We have, on the one hand, we spoke about subsystems, which could be arbitrary tensor factors of Huber spaces. And we also spoke about these composite systems composed of systems at different times. So it's a natural idea to actually combine these ideas. Onion, you have this is the 20-minute notification? Speed up right now. So basically, a time to localized systems is a combination of these ideas. It's just a subsystem of a Huber space that is itself tensor product of systems at different times. And so here is an example. Take a quantum comp, just as I did. Just as I did before for the unitary, I can turn it into this picture with respect to another decomposition. But here, in general, this A prime would be a subsystem which is delocalized between the original outputs, which is D and C. And that we're going to call a time delocalized system. And it is in terms of this object that we can actually interpret interpretations. So we can interpret implementations of the switch that have been discussed. Switch that have been discussed. Here, for simplicity, I describe it with this type of setup where Bob is applied at a fixed time and only Alice is delocalized around. And essentially, if you focus on this part here, the others are all local operations, you can see that one can rewrite, by the main trick I discussed before, one can rewrite this as just a single separate operation acting on certain types of subsystems, which we will identify with the input of Alice and the output of Alice. Input of Alice and the output of Alice, and then there is something else. So, in detail, I've discussed in this paper what these subsystems are, what these algebras are, how they relate to the original algebra. So it's just by a control-swap transformation. So, I'm not going to go into detail. The point is that once you define this, you can understand, reinterpret the exact same experiment with respect to the newly chosen systems. And it looks just like this: the usual process matrix framework. Not only that, but there is a means to actually go and probe this. means to actually go and probe these individual boxes by intervening at these wires but these are delocalized in time wires but there is a way of doing that now the natural question here is the new thing uh is there a general way of transforming circuits into other circuits uh by based on different choices of systems the answer is yes um and here i'm going to describe this how it works uh so basically consider with an example consider this circuit this circuit i can This circuit, I can conveniently kind of deform it in this form that put elongate a little bit the wires, and here I'm suppressing the boxes which will be going from the output of one wire to another. Then it is also convenient to consider thinking just if you like mathematically as there being an identity channel from the beginning of the wire to the end of the wire. That's because we might be interested in thinking about different choices of subsystems. About different choices of subsistence of these outputs of the boxes that were present in the circuit, and possibly different subsistence of the inputs of the boxes that were present in the original circuit. And the way one can describe that is by introducing the appropriate isometries. For instance, let's imagine that there is another, there is a choice of systems E and F, which is another decomposition of these joint outputs from all the boxes. Well, that can be related. Well, that can be related. There is an isomorphism that's gonna map you from here to here. And then there is, since I don't want to change the picture, I'm going to introduce the inverse isomorphism here. And similarly, I can consider another factorization. So there are these two other isomorphisms. The isomorphism is inverse. I have not changed anything by doing so, but now I have explicitly introduced my new systems and I want to ask what do they connect? How does the experiment look with respect to this choice of systems? Look with respect to this choice of systems. And so you can see what they connect, and you can calculate using the regional circuit what this is. In general, you may find out that whatever is in this box has a certain tensor product structure. So you might further decompose it into boxes. And here is one example of what you may get. Generally, you are going to get a circuit with a cycle, just like the process matrix picture looks like a circuit with a cycle. One curiosity here, just to mention, is that if the Curiosity here just to mention is that if the original circuit was composed of trace-preserving instruments, of trace-preserving operations, you're going to get a circuit composed of trace-preserving operations, but possibly with cycles. Now, the quantum switch itself can also interpret it. Like you can actually understand what's going on with this procedure. And you can now understand how you can go from, let's call it, Bob's causal perspective. Imagine this is what's happening, let's say, in the lab. You can go to the process matrix. Now, here, these are concrete systems. Now, here these are concrete subsystems of the original systems that I assumed are given to me and they are physical. Now, this is another, this is Alice is local, Bob is local, and here around is the process matrix. I kept the control qubit on the left. And then from there, by the analogous procedure, you can move to another description with respect to another choice of systems, again defined with respect to the original systems, where ARIS is local and Bobbit is delocalized. So this we may call Aris. So, this we may call Alice's causal perspective. And this is an idea similar to Philippe Alarger and Charles Buchner's notion of transforming, let's say, that they proposed an abstract terms that there should be a way in which we change reference frames such that in a process matrix, every operation could be seen as local, and the rest could be somehow understood as evolving according to a standard circuit. And similar ideas. Circuits and similar ideas based on reference frames in the context of the gravitational switching with Page Wooders formalism. I would like to mention here we see that it is possible in terms of just transforming subsystems to understand this transformation between different perspectives. Very briefly, let me tell you, I don't have the time, I believe, but which types of processes we know could be realized in this sense. Well, there is these things that we can do with quantum control of quantum operations in this. In this, there are also the so-called unitary extendable bipartite processes that we can do. As well as some, I will not have time to describe, unfortunately, but essentially there's an important insight in my proof of this fact, which has to do with the fact that because this process is unitary, it actually defines you naturally the isomorphism and suggests to you how to define and search for the new system. How to define and search for the new systems on which you can see the process realized. In a subsequent paper, actually, we proved that all these processes are, in fact, variations of the quantum switch. So in a sense, it's a bit disappointing, you may say, because it's nothing new. It's again the switch. However, I will skip how we prove that in this paper on cyclic causal models, but I'm going to go straight to the question. Go straight to the question: Is this really bad news? If we were hoping to find processes that could actually violate causal inequalities, and the answer is no, because, in fact, precisely because of this fact that these are quantum switches of a kind, we can actually prove the existence of certain larger class of processes on time-de-localized systems, which include processes violating causal inequalities. So, the idea of the proof is basically: I mean, if you have a unitary I mean, if you have a unitary extendable process, and here is a tripartite unitary extendable process, whenever we choose what to plug in here, and it can always be imagined purified or extended to a unitary to act on ancillas, you always get the unitary. And because this unitary bipartite process that remains for every choice of Charlie's operation is itself a quantum switch, there exists a way of realizing this Alice and Bob's operation on fixed delocalized systems. And all the variations. Localized systems. And all the variations we have by the different choices of Charlie, they end up being amounting to different types of transformations that you will see here in between. And by an argument analogous to the one I furnished for the bipartite case, one can actually prove that these have realizations. And a striking example is actually a classical process that can violate causal inequalities. So this classical process is this deterministic process where the input Where the input, this is a, you can think of it as a diagonal process matrix in a given basis, where the input bit, if you like, coming into the laboratory of Alice is a function of the output bits sent out by Bob and Charlie. Here are the logical functions. And it's a non-causal process. And this work actually is together with Julian Vex and Cyril Branciard. And Julian found this circuit, which is actually very Found this circuit, which is actually very closely related to something else. It's been discussed by Philippa Chaslov. And here is what it looks like from the usual temporal perspective. You can see how Charlie gets delocalized in a weird kind of way, different from the switch. Nevertheless, surprisingly, we can see this as a proper. I mean, if you choose the right subsistence, you can rewrite it in the usual process-matrix figure. And so, yes, surprisingly, this kind of thing exists. And you can address, albeit more complicatedly, you can address each of the individual delocalized systems and kind of verify that this is a proper process on this time delocalized systems. Finally, here is something. Well, it can violate causal inequalities, and essentially we can discuss what that means. Basically, it means that one can understand this in terms of cyclic causal models. Cyclic causal models for these variables that we might introduce in a given experiment. And well, it means that there exists this type of models, cyclic, but even the classical switch is a cyclic model, so that's not the new part. The new part is that unlike the classical switch, here this classical process doesn't admit this type of story unraveling where you have this causal story of that we call dynamical causal unraveling for these variables. These variables, and this is only under the assumptions that no other errors will be present in each history and the unraveling, apart from those you see in the pictures. And these are verifiable in practice by addressing, as I said, intervening on these variables, and that the input of each party will be in the past of another. So I guess here the most interesting part of this discussion, but I don't, I suppose, Lucian, am I out? Am I over time already? Yeah, you're over time by now, yes. Okay, so I guess I will just say. So, I guess I will just say that this is very, very closely related to quantum reference frames, understanding of gravitational switch, in particular temporal frames, like in the Peigrouter's formalism. But I should also note, as you've seen in Nesteban's talk, that actually non-temporal quantum reference frame transformations also can be seen as choosing different decompositions of the invariant system or the invariant algebra into different factors. So, all of that somehow seems to be. Seems to be with some exceptions, but I'm not sure exactly how this relates to Lucien's notion of quantum reference frame transformations. But essentially, it seems that this is another language in which we can think about transformations and between different perspectives, so ways of describing a circuit, which is also applicable in the context of the gravitational switch. And so, there are some natural questions here, such as whether we might this could be understood itself as a reference frame transformation in some generalized way. Transformation in some generalized way, combining temporal, spatial, and possibly other degrees of freedom. And maybe we shouldn't be actually looking for covariance with respect to this more general type of notion. So thank you for your attention. I'll stop here. Okay, so thank you very much. It's a very interesting talk. We have time for one question. There are any questions? Okay. So then maybe since we are over time we can push questions to the discussion session. So if we take I'd say we're running about 10 minutes over time. So if we take let's just give ourselves a 10 minute break and we'll start at 30 minutes past the hour. Minutes past the hour for the discussion session, and all four speakers will be present there to take questions. Okay.
