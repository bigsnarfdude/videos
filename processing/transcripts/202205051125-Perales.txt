About the motivation, though I don't think this is very motivating for this crowd, but let me just say it. So, the motivation is that there are very famous theorems by Shenjao and Gramov Lawson that says that if you have a torus and this is the scalar curvature, it's not negative, then actually, this torus has to be a flat torus. And another theorem is this. And another theorem is this one by Shane, Yao, and Whitten. And it says that if you have a manifold, so here, that is complete and asymptotically flat with a non-negative scalar curvature and ADMS equal to zero, then you again have to have a Euclidean space. Well, yeah, you should be an Euclidean space. Be an Euclidean space, a flat Euclidean space. And those the questions are: what about if we relax this condition? So, say we have sequences of manifolds, and now we want this scalar curvature to be small and to be negative. So, let's say minus epsilon i, epsilon i greater than zero and converging to zero. Okay, uh, so. Okay, so can we find in the limit, and one limit that you could take is chroma-hauser limit, can we find in the limit a flat torus? And usually this doesn't happen if you want to use this chroma hauser distance, but we can find results using intrinsic flat distance. And the same thing happens if you relax this condition and you ask this ADMS. This ADM has to be small and positive and going to zero, let's say, greater or equal than this. Okay. So there's a question. Wait, wait, wait, please. So there's a question by Joseph. Please ask. Would we like the scalar curvature point wise bounded below or the integral? No, it's a point wise. But actually, one of the results that I have, we bound the integral. Bound the integral scalar curvature, yes. But in general, people are thinking point-wise bounds. Okay, so then how do we study the stability of these two theorems? Well, we prove some convergence theorems, and as I told you, we use intrinsic flat distance. And these theorems read as follows. So, we basically want or know what the One or not what the limit should be. So I'm fixing this M0, which is going to be the limit. And then what I'm doing is, so here I have a fixed manifold and a fixed Riemannian metric. And what I'm going to do is in this manifold, change the Riemannian tensor or change the distance in this manifold, if you wish. And with this new distance, the conditions that we require are the conditions that we require are the following. So distance with respect to g0 should be smaller than distance with respect to gj. The diameter should be bounded for all j. This is for all j. And the volumes should converge in this way. So volume of the mj should converge to the volume of what you want the geminate to be. And in this, with this hypothesis, then you do have convergence to m 0. To MC. And notice that, well, here I have a sequence. These are spheres, and this is M1. So you see, one has splines. And with Gramo-Hausdorn distance, because of these splines, we won't have GH convergence. But do we have? We do have intrinsic flat convergence. And someone is raising a hand. Maybe I should check the chat. Got it. Thanks. I think the hand was. The previous one. Okay, good. Okay, so then with this theorem, well, I didn't say, but the manifold that we fixed is close, so it does not have boundary. So then with this theorem, we could prove the stability result of the storus that I told you about. So, I mean, we didn't solve it in full. So, I mean, we didn't solve it in full generality. We came up with a class. So, this was work with Cabrera Pacheco and Keter and myself. And we came up with a class of tori. And as I told you, we relax the scalar curvature condition. And then in the limit, we do get a flat torus. And there are more works that I won't mention because I don't think this is interesting for this talk. And now, what happens? And now, what happens when one has manifolds with boundary? So, when one has manifolds with boundary, we have a theorem that looks very similar to the other one because, again, we fix a manifold M and we fix a Riemannian structure, so a Riemannian metric, and we want to converge to this M0, so which is our Miami. Which is our manifold M with this Riemannian metric. So we are again fixing this and then we are changing the distances in our manifold M. And again, we have these three conditions that you saw before, but now we have to impose conditions on the boundary. And in this case, because we will ask that M0 has totally convex. Has totally convex interior, then we just need a lower bound. Sorry, a bound on the volume of our boundaries. Okay, so if we add boundary, totally convex interior, and this condition gives us intrinsic flat convergence to this manifold that we want. Okay, and then And then with this theorem, we again can come up with a class of manifolds that are going to be complete and that are going to be asymptotically flat. And within this class, we can prove a convergence to balls. So these are balls in Euclidean space. Okay. Here, these ones, these are not really the manifolds, but one has... The manifolds, what one has to do is you have the manifold and then intersect this manifold with a cylinder. Okay, so we are getting this type of regions. And these are the ones that are converging to this Euclidean manifold. And notice here that in this type of theorems, we have two boundaries. This boundary that is the one from the manifold boundary of M, but we are creating But we are creating another boundary here. This is the extra boundary. So, this extra boundary is actually going to be very nice, or actually, I mean, if you think about how one applies this theorem. So, basically, what we are going to choose as M0 is the ball of radius R and G 0 is going to be, well, the Euclidean. Going to be well, the Euclidean metric. But then, in order to apply the previous theorem, what we had to do is cap this off. So we cap it. And now this new manifold is actually diffeomorphic to a ball. And then we will have a different metric. Okay, so here it was important the capping, and I wanted to mention this because. Mention this because I think we have open questions, and the open questions about improving these results are about this: how can one build better in a better way with these things, like capping? Maybe capping is not necessary, or maybe we can do the capping in an easier way. Anyway, let's continue. Oh, well, as part of this application, And as part of this application, here I said these cylindrical regions converge, and then one can study the balls. And actually, the intrinsic balls of the manifold are going to converge to an Euclidean ball. Okay, so that's it. And now, well, let's talk about this intrinsic flood convergence that Christina already talked about, and also Benger talk a little bit about integral currents. About integral currents, but let me just give again a summary of what these things are or how this is used. So we basically want to study convergence to a fixed element, and this is going to be M0. And if you are used to a Hausdorff convergence, what one does to calculate the Hausdorff distance between two spaces. Between two spaces, or one way to do it is to embed it in a bigger space. So isometrically embed in a bigger space, and there you calculate the house of distance if you want to calculate Grammar Hauser distance. But we want to calculate intrinsic flat distance. So then here we write this F. So we calculate flat distance. And this is my picture. So here we have two sets. Here we have two manifolds, and I'm embedding here, and I'm embedding here. And this is a new set. Okay. And since we have a sequence of manifolds and we want them to converge to this thing, well, what we hope to is to embed everything, there calculate the flat distance, and then wish that this limit converges to zero. So that's what one has to do. But give me, let me. But let me give you more details about what this flat distance is. And for that, let's just talk about currents. So these are currents defined in metric spaces. They were first defined by Ambrosio and Kirhan, and then there were several generalizations, for example, by Lang and then by Lang and Benke. So these currents are going to be multilingual. To be multilinear functions, so this t, and they are going to act on this space. So they take values, they take, well, they act here, and this dm set stands by m plus one tuples of Lipschitz functions. And the first one is bounded, and we don't care that much about the other enters. Okay, so we have these Lipschitz functions. Have these Lipschitz functions, and then we have this current. And this current is multilinear and satisfies other conditions that I'm going to skip because I think it's better if we see our first example. And actually, these two examples are the building blocks of all the currents that we really want to study. So the first building block is this one. Is this one? What one does is one takes a function theta that is defined on Rm or a set of Rm, and we want it to be L1. And then this current, which is double brackets, is defined in the following way. So you take your Lipschitz functions, and then this theta is actually a weight, you multiply by F. By f and then you take the derivative of this pi. And remember that this pi is actually m functions. So you take the derivative, this is a square matrix. You can take the derivative because it's a Lipschitz function. So it exists almost everywhere. And then you take the determinant. So this is our first current. And the second one is when we want to study, I mean, this was a current in Euclidean. I mean, this was a current in Euclidean space, and these currents are more general, areometric spaces. So, what one has to do is if one has a Lipschitz function, then one takes the push forward of the current that was defined here. And this push forward is just, well, you keep the weight and then compose your function f with the phi, and here you also. And here you also take the composition of pi with phi. Okay, and these are going to be the building blocks. The other conditions that I skipped are about continuity. Well, this is about continuity. This is another one that I'm going to skip. And then there is this one. So number one, which is important to say it. And this one says that there is actually a measure mu. Is actually a measure, or there should be a measure mu such that this inequality is satisfied for each fπ in the n set. Okay? And I mean, it really makes sense if you see this formula because what we want is to bound this or bound this. So here you have the Lipschitz functions appearing here, and then you have f, which is the function that you are integrating. Which is the function that you are integrating here. And then your measure is going to be like this theta and this Lebesgue measure. So this is actually going to be mu or something like that. Okay. So these are the currents. And as I told you, we have a push forward, which is just composed with the function that you are pushing forward. We have a bound. forward we have a boundary operator which is just put a one in in the first entry we have at this if you take the smallest measure mu that satisfies this condition then we denote it in this way and then the mass of our current is basically you use this measure and evaluate that set and then the we care about this We care about this subset of your space set, which are the points that have positive lower density with respect to this nice measure or with respect to the measure associated to the current. Okay. And as I told you, the currents that we are really interested are the ones that can be written in this way. That's what this slide is saying. We care about these currents. We care about these currents. And here I just wrote the whole formula. That's how they look. And because we want to make our lives easier, what we usually do is choose our lip sheets, maps to be by lip sheets. So these are contained in RM. And we require the images and The images and the images now live in the met in the metric space set to be pairwise disjoint. Okay, so we make our life easier and have charts that are actually disjoint. Okay, and because these are called integer, we want our weights to be integers, integer value. Okay, and the following integrals that we Following integrals that we really care about are the ones that are integral, and that just means that also the boundary of T is also a current. Perfect. And the main examples, well, the manifolds. And the manifolds come with charts. So basically, it's just use the charts that the manifold have. And we are going to put weight equal to one. And then we have these very nice equalities. Nice equalities. The mass given by the current is going to be just the volume or the Riemannian volume. The mass of this current is the volume of our manifold. And the boundary of this current is actually the current that comes from the boundary of M. And here I put a different example. I mean, you can choose multiplicities and you can have. And you can have boundaries. Anyway, let's continue. And now let me define flat distance because that's the one that we want to calculate. So the flat distance is the following. You have these two currents. So these functions that are multilinear and that are defined in this fixed space. And let's look at the picture. So you have this current in red. So you have this current in red, and then you have this current in blue. And what you want to do is take the infimum over the mass of a current in green and the mass of a current in yellow. And these currents in green and in yellow are chosen in such a way that this equality should hold. Okay, so basically, the boundary of this yellow one is giving you the Is giving you the two currents that you have, and then maybe you get extra boundary, and so this is the U. And okay, so that's how you calculate flat distance for these currents. And this flat distance was used by Benger. And then Solmani and Wenger well defined the intrinsic flat distance. And as I told you, it looks very similar to Gromofausdor distance. So you have your integral. So, you have your integral current spaces here, and what you do is you isometrically embed them or embed the currents, and there you take the flat distance and take an infimum. Okay, good. And now, some general facts about this distance. Well, this distance is actually going to be zero if these spaces are isometric. Isometric, but also if the also one has to have is that the push forward of the one current of T1 should be equal to T2. And these four oriented manifolds means that the orientation is being preserved by this isometry. There is a compactness theorem. This was proven by Wenger. And there, you only need to bound the diagram. You only need to bound the diameter and the mass of your current and the mass of the boundary of the current in case you have boundary. And as I told you, the main example, at least for me, because I do more Riemannian geometry, is when you have a manifold and then you can see it as an integral current space. And these are the things that you use, the distance given by the Riemannian metric and the current that I described in the previous. That I described in the previous slide. And this one, I'm going to skip it, but if you are interested in reaching lower bounds, maybe you can ask me later. Okay, so let's go back about how one estimates intrinsic flat distance. And as I told you, one constructs a space set where one can isometrically embed. One can isometrically embed M0 and M1. And once that we do that, because of the definition, this inequality is going to happen. The intrinsic flat distance is going to be less or equal than calculating the flat distance in this space. Okay, and the flat distance in this space is given by this. And let me give you a trivial example. And the trivial example. Trivial example, and the trivial example is when your M0 and your M1 are the same space. So this is just M. And then I can take as a metric space set, well, just the cylinder M times this interval. And so I'm going to embed M0 to level set 0 and then M1 to level set H. Okay, so I do this and then I need to come up with. Then I need to come up with a yellow current and a green current. And the yellow current is basically this, the whole space. And then the green current is going to be like the sides of this cylinder. So it's going to be, or the side of this cylinder. This boundary of M cross 0H. I calculate the volumes and this is what I get. Okay, good. And now what about if I have I have something that is very similar to M0. It's actually the same M, but it's smaller. Okay? So then I can do the same picture. I can construct this type of cylinder, but now it's going to be a cone. And in order to estimate this distance between this space or this manifold and this manifold, what I'm going to do is actually What I'm going to do is actually going to remember that I can construct this cylinder and I can construct a one-lip sheet map. Okay, so basically instead of calculating distances in this cylinder or in this truncated count, I pass to this cylinder and here I get the same estimate. So h times the volume of m and then h times the volume of boundary of m, which is the green part. Which is the green part and the yellow part. Okay, good. So now we know how to prove theorem one and theorem two. Questions? Okay, so these are my question, maybe it's a silly question, but why is a name and why is it called flow? Is the name and why is it called flat distance? It doesn't have to do with a flat, flat, yeah, why flat flat curvature. It's about the musical. They were using the musical. Yes, she talked about this. Okay, yes, I remember. Thank you. Okay. Okay, so here in this slide, I'm writing the two theorems that I started with. So either, so you have this fixed man. So, you have this fixed manifold, and then you have a fixed distance, this zero, the one that you want to converge, and then you are changing the distances using another Riemannian tensors. Okay, and under these conditions, the diameter bound and the volume bound and these distances being smaller using G0. Zero, and either when one doesn't have boundary or when one has boundary, but then one adds these conditions, we want to prove convergence to m G0. Okay, so that was the theorem. I just wanted to remind you what we're going to do. Okay, and in my last five minutes, what we are going to do is very similar to what I explained to you in the previous slides. Previous slides. So we have M0, which is here, and it has a smaller distance. And then here we have Mj, and Mj has a bigger distance. And what we are going to do to calculate the distance between M0 and Mj is construct a metric space set. And this metric space set is basically this cylinder that I told you about. But we need to define an appropriate. Need to define an appropriate metric in this space. So, what we do is the following. At level zero, we add M0 and in M0, we have smaller distances. Then in this part, I mean, this part, we have like distances that look like this. If I put the distance, the product distance. And then in this other part, so at In this other part, so at level HJ, I'm going to just glue a part of MJ, but I'm just going to identify in a particular set. And that's why I have these things coming here, because I am identifying some things and I'm not identifying another things. And so the metric is going to be just take: if you have a point here and you have a point here, then me. Here and you have a point here, then minimize here. I mean, and you want to go to here, then maybe you go along m0 and use the distance in m0, and then use the product distance to come this way and take the infimum of such distances or lengths of curves. And that's going to give you the distance in this space set. Okay, and with this space set, one has a One has that the flat distance is bounded by this quantity that looks very similar to the previous slide, which is the height of your cylinder, the volume of your manifold, height again, volume of the boundaries, and two times a small number. And now let me just explain you why we have this small number. Well, I'm not identifying all of mj here, and I'm not identifying. And I'm not identifying in a certain space or certain subset of my manifold. And the space in which I'm not identifying has very small volume. And what is going to happen is that in this W, the distance, so remember that this distance was bigger than this dj0. Well, actually, if I restrict Restrict my distance to this set, it's actually bounded in this way. So they are almost the same. Okay, so this is the construction. And let me just tell you how one can construct this space because one needs to satisfy this condition in this theorem. And in order to satisfy this condition of this theorem, what This theorem, what one has to do is the following. So one has to prove that these dj distances are converging to this d0 distance. And then one can come up with these w sets that are in here. And one has to use a lot of parameters here, but then everything works. Here, but then everything works fine. Okay, and now let me just tell you about this and how does this oh, okay, I didn't mention this and this was important. This part, which is here, that was proven by Brian, Alan, and Cristina Solmani. And this is the part where I think we need help. I think we need help. Like, if you know about these types of things, I would be happy to hear about you. I mean, it's also the same problem that I told you that we have in case we have here some boundary that we have to do the capping. And that's why our theorem with boundary is not more general. We do have more theorems with boundary and we have different hypotheses, but they are not. Different hypotheses, but they are not the ideal. I think there is room for improvement. Anyway, how does one prove this theorem? Well, Brian and Alan prove this, and then we use the previous step to construct these X W lambda k. And then one uses these W lambda k's to construct these spaces in which one can isometrically embed. And then we take some limits and converge to zero. And that's it. Converge to zero. And that's it. Thank you very much. Let us thank the speaker. Are there questions, comments? So I have one question. So in your second theorem, so what is the example? So, what is the example one should have in mind where the volumes of the boundaries are not bounded? So, why do we need this assumption? Why do we need this assumption? So, I mean, not technically, so I believe you need it in the proof, probably, but is there a counterexample? But is there a counterexample? No, no, we don't have counterexamples. So that's the thing. Yeah. And I mean, the way to prove this theorem in which one has boundary is we wanted like to double the manifold, but then it's not that easy if your boundary is not behaving very well. And at some point we thought, okay, what about if you have your manifold and like you put an Like you put a color there, but then the distances may change also, like a lot. And yes, I mean, putting this condition then was a little bit because we needed in order to do the doubling and get the same conditions that we have here to use the theorem with no boundary. Thanks. So there's time for, I think, one more question. So please, Pablo. Thanks. Yeah, you said you mentioned about Ricci limit spaces possibly being integral current spaces. Could you comment a little bit about that? Yeah, I mean, that is true. You put, as I told you, like this type of current, and then you take the Riemannian distance. So then they are integral current. So then they are integral Korimo spaces. But what I meant to say is that here one has a Grammo Hausov convergence and also intrinsic flat convergence, and the limits are the same. Yeah, Gromo-Hauser and intrinsic flat limits coincide. Okay, thanks. Yeah, it's very nice talk. Really enjoyed it. Very fast. I might have to watch it again in slow-mo. Thank you. Watch it again in slow move. Thank you. Yeah, you can also ask questions later. Yeah, I can. Unfortunately, we have to postpone other talks because the next speaker is going to start in two minutes. So let us thank Rake again. Thank you.
