Here's a list of content I will discuss. First, I will give some brief instruction on vortex and turbulence. Then we discuss details about our vortex reconnection recognition, what has reconnection and its relationship with turbulence cascade. And we also discuss some our work on finite time singularity. Finally, I'll give a summary. We know that turbulence is ubiquitous in nature and span of quite a large range of scales, and it's also one of the most Scales and is also one of the most challenging problems in classical physics. And it also limits the development of many subjects such as aerospace, transportation, and also energy. For vortex, so sorry, yeah, for vortex, since every people have experts of vortex, I will not discuss the details. But the reason we study vortex is because we think that vortex is a key to understanding turbulence. So this is why we want to, because we are seeing that in turbulence flows, there are many, many vortex. Standard vortex. And for the vortex dynamics, it tries to understand the formation, evolution, and interaction vortex. Here, I listed some examples of the formation vortex or interaction vortex. But for our topics, we are mainly interesting. Oh, sorry, yeah, we are mainly interested in the study of vortex reconnections. Is that when you have two vortex with optic signs, they'll come together and reconnect to form a new vortex with one sign of red, one sign of blue, then move apart in different directions. Here, I show an example of how the two vortex rings. Example of how the two vortex rings come together and reconnect to form two new rings. Vortex reconnection is not only important in viscous flows, but also in quantum flows, as Randolph discussed, and also in magnetic reconnection, and also in DML recommendation. And we believe that since we look at water recognition is the only fundamental topological transformation event in visual flows, and we believe that it's essential to understand the interaction and breakup of cognitive structures. Interaction and breakup of coherent structures, and also the main mechanism behind any cascade mixing and LNS knowledge generation. Finally, that it may also help to explain some of the mathematical problems in full mechanics, such as formation of finite time similarity of OLR and online equations. So side recognition was triggered by the compiling work of Klaus dated back to the 1970s when he found that when you have two vortex columns of design, they become perturbed and formally kind of isolated what hex rings. The isolated vortex rings. And since then, many people have studied what ex reconnections. And people find that no matter what initial configuration it is, when they come together and reconnect, it always forms these kind of anti-parallel configurations. So that reconnection physically is similar. It's not dependent too much on the initial configuration. So most of the people study reconnection are based on this kind of anti-parallel cases that you have this kind of two perturbed anti-parallel vortex because this configuration has a high symmetry because you have a symmetry. Have a high symmetry because you have a symmetry with respect to this collision plane with the plane that come together and also have symmetry with respect to the symmetric plane. Initially, all the circulation is along this horizontal direction, but during the connection, the circulation will transfer to this kind of collision plane. So, this kind of transfer of circulation is some copy used to quantify the reconnection level. Here, this is a reconnection picture at Lena Samwar 2000. You can see that when the two waters come together, they'll form a new structure, what we call bridge. And then Call bridge and then you move away and also leave some part of this only connect part with what it calls red. Here I will show some snapshots that typically that for reconnection we have three stage one is what we call adaption that when the water has come together then have what we call bridging from new structures what the final stage is what we call separating one key feature of the classical early connection is that it's never complete you always have this kind of something left left only connected. Something left, left, only connected. This water thread, then this kind of thread have many other way rich dynamics we are showing at high learning stables. Yeah, so this is some result at high at high learning number, learn some 2000, learn some 75,000, 7,500. As you can see that at the learner increases that you have very, very fine scale structures. But another interesting feature is that initially the configuration is symmetric, but right now you can see that you have an asymmetric structure generated. This is what you call symmetric breaking because when you This is what you call symmetric breaking because when you have the two vortex pairs, when they come together, they'll perform this kind of very thin vortex sheets. These vortex sheets are very unstable. They'll lower up due to this kind of K1 home instability. This kind of asymmetric is always available in practical situations, but this will somehow complicate our problem for star reconnection. So we try to find some way to suppress that one. There are many ways to suppress that one. One way is to use high-order method, but we already use a most people use spectrum method in the simulation. Spectrum method in the simulation so that you cannot use even high-order method, but you can use high resolution. But if you high resolution, you will require much higher cost. So, what we do here, we are trying to do for symmetric imposed simulation. What idea is that because we know the initial condition is symmetric, so we can only we can simulate only the we only need to simulate one quarter of the domain by imposing symmetry along this kind of collision plane and the symmetric plane. By doing this one, we can also not only suppress asymmetric structures, but also. Suppress asymmetric structures, but also can save some memory, somehow save some computation cost. With that, we have performed a series of new simulations, learn some from 5,000 to learn about 40,000, the rotation from 500 to 44,096 cubic. Somehow because this is with one code of the mass, so that this is why it's 249. Yeah, so here we show some results at length number 40,000. This is like this is the two mini. Where this is the two mini two mini view initially that all was similar at the Lawrence number, but as you can see at Harlan's number, that immediately that you have initially are just initially just two. If you go back that let me go let me go back. Yeah, yeah. Initially, just two what has columns, but you wait start reconnect, it will immediately form very small scale structures. You know, there are numerous small scale structures, and these structures will be at least a zooming view of. These structures will be at least the zooming view of the kind of small-scale structures. You can see here, these are the small scale. Yeah, what we call structure, these structures are what we call turbulence cloud avalanche or fans or vortices. And if you continue the simulation, these structures will further intact with the bridge and straight. And you will see later that they are generally even smaller scale structures. You can see there, here and here. As you can see, all these structures are come from two waters, they come together. Structure come from two waters, they come together. Yeah, yeah. In a very, very short time. Then this is the last frame of our simulation. You can see that there are, this is what you call, this is a bridge. There are many, yeah. Sorry. It takes some time to for them to show up here. Let's show the Let's show the other two small scales we cannot show, but you can see that they are really very fine-scale structures around the bridge, they also have structures around the thread. And after we do the anti-parallel cases, we also design oscillator cases. This is the initial configuration for oscillator cases, yeah. So we also design simulation for 300 rensembl, but Renault 5,000 to up to Renault 20,000. This is the remember resolution. We all use the spectral method. Macro resolution. We all use the spectral method area. So here we show some what is the other contours. The top row is less number 5000, color-coded by the helicopter density. And you can see that they become locally anti-parallel and also some small scale structures are similar as what we see in anti-parallel cases. This is at the lesson of 20,000. The big, the large-scale structures are quite similar. The only difference is on the small scale structures. These are the two simulations we have done for reconnection. We know that for. Action yet. We know that for turbulence cash scale, we have this kind of minus five cell spectrum means that energy injected at large scales were transferred to small scales by finally dissipated by viscosity. And this is the spectrum picture, but there are no clear physical mechanism. People typically use this kind of sketch that you have this kind of big swirls to break out into small eddies, and small eddies will break up into even smaller eddies. But the actual physical mechanism in the turbine flow is unknown. In the turbine flow, is unknown. There are many people have proposed different physical mechanisms. But before we look at that, we can first look at the spectrum for reconnection. This is a spectrum for anti-parallel cases at random 9000 for different time. This green color is at random at the initial time. You can see most of the energy is localized in this kind of small web numbers. And at the reconnection starts, this kind of energy at a large web numbers increases. At this black line, which is the time of the peak entropy, which you have the maximum dissipation. Which you have the maximum dissipation, you can see this clear minus five-thirds spectrum. And if you only show the structure corresponding to this one by doing some bench filtering, this is the structure corresponding to that. So you can see these are the newly formed structures of bridges and threads that contribute to this minus five cell spectrum. Then we show the at least spectrum at different lens numbers, but it's anti-parallel cases only at the time of the peak entropy. You can see that clearly the minus five cell spectrum for different lens number, particularly at least a length. For different learned number, particularly at least at length 40,000, this manifesto spectrum, quite consistent with the turbine flows. But if you look at the autonomous cases, there are some difference because you can see at learn some of this black line, which is 20,000, is more corresponding to this kind of minus 7 so low. So they have some difference on the initial configuration. Our speculation is that due to the helicity, because for the antipado cases, the helicity is exactly zero, but for all sorts of cases, there are no non-zero. For all sorts of cases, there is no non-zero helicity. So helicity may have an effect on the energy cascade. So it's from the spectrum point of view. We also, based on our simulation, proposed some physical mechanisms of energy cascade that when you have reconnections that you have formed liscon bridge and thread. And then this thread can further go annually reconnection to form a new bridge and new thread can continue to happen. This is what we observe at low 9000. You can see that we have liscon peak spread, big bridge and a small bridge and a small straight here. But as we can see in Adelaide 4000, But as we can show you, at learning 40,000, we didn't see this scenario. For 40,000, we almost see like that one. You have a big vortex. You have some filament along around this big vortex. You have even smaller federal vortex. This is what the picture here is that you have this kind of one big bridge. You have small thread. You have even this kind of thread. You have some filament around that one. Yeah, yeah. So this is another scenario we propose for like for turbans cascade based on reconnection. On reconnection. We can also do some scale by scale to energy transfer. Like if you define the energy in a band, like IP, this is the IP defines the wave number in that band. So we can define energy equation for each band. Here, that this kind of pi defines the energy transfer rate between different mode and epsilon dissipation in that mode. So with that, we can study the energy transfer from different mode to different from different mode. Here's this kind of square box that denotes. Square box that denoted that the energy from one mode to another mode. Here, it's almost like of this sign with respect to this kind of diagonal line. So, here the red means forward energy cascade. So, in this initial range, we can always see this kind of forward cascade. But we also observe that at large scales, we have this kind of dark blue. It means that energy is transferred back to the large scales. It means that during the connection, it only not only. During reconnection, it only not only has the forward cascade, but it also has inverse cascade at particularly at large scales. So, we show this for the orthogonal cases, but we also observe in the anti-parallel cases. So, this is why we believe this is quite also for reconnection. Once you have reconnection, you have this kind of dual cascade and small scale energy forward cascade, and large scale energy is the inverse cascade. So, after that, we present some of our work on finite time singularity. Since there are several talks yesterday about finite time singularity, I will not discuss the deaf definition. Singularity: I will not discuss the deaf definition, but I just want to emphasize that there are many previous works on workflow tried to find a finite time similarity, some based on Piazzawa law, some based on the discount den simulation, particularly that is yesterday they have shown that based on anti-parallel configuration to find out some final time security. Since we have done some anti-parallel simulation, we want to show how the vorticity evolves. This is the evolution of the entropy as a function of time for different Reynolds number. As a function of time for different Reynolds number, this is the erosion of the peak voltage at the function of time for different Reynolds number. So we see that as a simulation start, it will rapidly increase during the connection and somehow become saturated and oscillated with the decay. If we plot the peak value as a function of Reynolds standard, we can show here. This is the entropy. This is the maximum vorticity. This is the entropy production. So somehow it increases, but somehow become linear in this kind of log sense. It means that this kind of vorticity peak increases. That this kind of vorticity peak increases are not faster than the super exponential. Somehow suggests that for this configuration, at least finite time scaling may not happen, at least for viscous cases, unless that runs from the infinity. Expected the reason because you can see at least at least runs from that this kind of growth will somehow become slower. Expected it's because due to formation of this kind of turbulence average, you somehow suppress the growth of the vorticity amplification. Then we know that. Then, we know that in 2019, Moffat cumula that you have developed a theoretical model to governing the equation of this kind of fighting vortex rings. The idea is that when the radius of the ring is much larger than the second distance of these two rings and also much larger than the core size of rings, so the ring can almost remain circular and the co-fraction is not important. Then, the behavior at this tipping, these two points are mainly governed by the curvature at that point and the sucking distance between. At that point, and the sucking distance between these two points, and also the core radius. Then the developer is kind of four ODEs. So, S is the sucking distance, and K, kappa is the culture, and the delta is the core size of the ring, and the gamma is the remaining circulation. For unit case, gamma is always one, but for viscous, gamma will become less than one when the during connection. Then, since you have the four since four OTEs, you can still give some initial configuration, then you can. You can give some initial configuration, then you can use mathematics to integrate this equation to obtain the evolution of like the core size. And this is a gamma. They found that surprisingly 200 that this kind of core size will first increases, then rapidly decreases and almost becomes zero at this point, almost like this can be defined as single time. Then, correspondingly, the voltage will become rapidly increases at this point. They find that this only allows 200. If you go to like only I learned from 200 if you go to like learn some of 4,000 or one like 1000 to 2000 then it's almost become unbounded they cannot even calculate it so based on this uh based on this result they claim that there might be some at least the physical singularity at this at this point because that the cosine becomes too small or then the unsequest may not be valid so since we have developed the code we see we can even simulate this configuration so we just perform a simulation for this configuration A simulation for this calculation. In certain cities, we know that the core size is very thin in these cases, so we cannot do very high learners' number, but we can do learn some up to 4,000 using this resolution. So, this is the picture of movie how see how this kind of went to Lewin Client. Similar as the anti-parallel case, it will form this bridge and some straight. Yeah, yeah. So, the configuration, the result is quite simple. The only difference between the quantum cases and the classic case. And the classic cases that our point has to show, but we learned the required that you have some list kind of spread there. If you for quantum cases, everything is clean and there are no structure remaining for left here. Here we show some two minutes view only by only focusing on the least point and show the vortistic isocondal in that at that point. So you can see that this when the time involves, initially the vortex core is circular, but slowly becomes elliptical and then to form this kind of head tail structures. Structures. Then I also have some, this can see these headless structures. This is the structure at the collision plane. You lower up into this kind of vortex or whatever, circular vortex. So this is at learner summer 2000. If we show the vortex contour at the in a symmetric plane, at learner 4000, it looks like that. Initially, it's circular, become elliptical, and this head tail. And at this time, that you have one part here, one part left here. So the circulation of this part is less than the initial circulation. So, most importantly, we found that one conclusion found that there has multiple cost battling and stripping in the wisdom reconnection, which is somehow contradictory to the assumption by Morphan and Kimola. Most importantly, we can look at the voltistic evolution. This is the maximum voltistic as a function of time for different lens number. For land number 1000, you can see it decreases less than it decays, and the maximum peak is even less than the initial value. Even for the lens number 400, the cases, the ghost, the maximum. Cases, the goals, the maximum of the peak is open about 1.6, much slower than that predicted by the analytical model. So that at least we plot a function, a maximum peak at the function of Renaissance, but you can see it's almost like linear glow. So it seems that suggest that the actual DNS simulation are quite different from the MCAM model predicted because that MKA mode that predicts that the TCP can be like 10 to the power 25, 26 at the least learner. 25, 26 at the least value. So they have some inconsistency. Recently, in this year, I think Mofala Kimuna published a new paper, try to address this issue, to want to discuss the maximum vortex amplification on the effect of the initial condition on the maximum vortex application. Oh, I will not discuss the details, but they find that in all our cases when the epsilon equals zero, some maximum voltage amplification is defined as omega maximum derivative omega zero. It's derived is equal to one. zero is divided by is equal to one by lambda m two square square lambda is the uh the core size divided the initial core size yeah so that this will depend on the uh initial uh the initial ratio between the core size and the second distance so this estimate that this analytic equation they also find that as z increases means that the uh the core size decreases uh the amplification of uh vorticity increases also the time for singularity increases yeah but Cases. But this is for the unique cases. But for the UIS case, they just find that as long as they have a critical release number defined by least value, that if epsilon is less than least critical value or learners number above some critical relevance number, they have notable, there's no difference between, very small difference between unity case and weakness case. Here it shows that one line is the weak case, one line is the unit case, it almost collapses. And this is for different when the increase relevance, increases the epsilon, decrease the relevance number. Epsilon DPS Reynolds number. So that's said in our paper that based on our initial configuration, we choose S0 equals 0.1, delta 0 equal to 0.01, which is z equal to 0.1. Based on this parameter, they can estimate the maximum amplification of this value. So it's about 1.45. We did we reported 1.6 in our simulation. So that they also estimate that the critical learner number for this configuration should be like 17,000. 17,000. It means that if about 17,000, you will have similar result between risk cases. Definitely for DNS, we cannot go that high because this will require much resources to go to that large number. But to address this kind of issue, we did another simulation, is what we call OLA simulations. We listed our new OLA simulations by making it with caustic zero, but this time we are slowly, slowly increasing the resolution. That slowly, slowly increase the resolution. Here are the results for the different resolution. This resolution is like unequal to 248. This is unequal to 496. As you can see, that the initial circular becomes slowly become elliptical. The difference between these two are very, very small, only at that tor equal to 0.3 seconds. This is when we compare with our whisker simulation. I learned some of 4000 because things are quite different because in whisker scales, due to whisker diffusion, In viscous case, due to viscous diffusion, this core size becomes initially become initial close. But for the US case, it almost remains circular. So that this core size is almost like circular, the core size almost remains as an initial value. So most importantly, we see this kind of evolution of second distance as function time and also the maximum as function time. This is the evolution that at initial time, almost like zero time from zero to 0.2. So no difference between different evolution. There are no difference between different resolution, and also there are no way small difference between the this line is a whisker case, difference is very small. Also, okay, we are predicted by this kind of dashed line with the MK model. But if you look at the distribution amplification, then it's quite quite different. This is the M case model prediction. This is for different resolution. Even for n equal to 1500, it matches with other results. It matches with other results quite well at this time, yeah. But for other cases, it always collapses. It somehow can indicate that the uh, you know, at least at this time, our simulation is well resolved for this kind of for this resolution. So let's see that if you choose S equal to divide sigma is equal to phi, which is what MK Morphine cumula choose, means that when subtracting distance is five times the core size, if we go back, if we find the time here, time is almost. Back, if you find the time here, time is almost like tor equal to 0.2. If you go back here, that the amplification of autisticity is only by 1.1 times, which is much smaller than predicted by MK's model, which is 1.45. Even we slower, we reduce the setting distance, like we reduce delta equal to 4. It's almost like 1.2. So it means that there's still a difference between the numerical simulation and the MMCS model. So we are trying to see what made it really different. Trying to see what may be the difference between the prediction and the numerical simulation. So, this is our result for the Spanish singularity. But we don't want to make a claim that whether at that time it will develop a singularity or not, because for DNS, we are never attached to that point. So, at least for the results showing here, it seems that it's rapidly growing. It may have a singularity and maybe around t equal to 0.3, but we don't know yet. Post three, so but we don't know, yeah. Here, I will give us some summary. Yeah, we did some simulation at Harlan's number. What has what has simulation at Harlan's number? We should review smash phenomena such as smash breaking, offset and recognition, recognition cascade, and turbulence average. And also find that co-flattering and the subsequent hair pair formation and the turbulent average are very important for viscous recognitions. And it somehow suppresses the formation of time singularity, and also that. Singularity and also that with intense forward energy cascade, we also observed a news cascade during new connection. Finally, that we find the growth of the maximum vorticity for the colliding vortex ring case is much slower than predicted by the MK theory. As we say that we should still try to find the reason for that. Ongoing works, you may want to do even harder simulations, but maybe with AMR techniques, but you should be very cautious with MR because if you went into AMR, you will do some interpretation. AMR, you will do some interpretation. This interpretation may somehow contaminate your result at later time so that we are still testing, try to use some high-order scheme AMI techniques, such as a spectrum element method. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So these are my talks. Yeah.
