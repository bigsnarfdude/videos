You hear me? Is it fine? Okay, thanks. So, I want to discuss, I mean, just one result which we proved with Romain Dujardin. And it's part of an ongoing work, which the goal of which is to try to describe the distribution of orbits of large groups of automorphisms of projective surfaces. Of projective surfaces. But today I will focus on periodic orbits. And the upshot is that I will give examples of large groups of automorphisms for which I can prove with Roman that there are only finitely many finite orbits. Okay, so we want to control the number of finite orbits. Okay, let's start with a basic definition and examples of automorphisms. Okay, so the setting. Okay, so the setting is the following. I will denote by x a smooth, complex projective surface. Okay, so it's a manifold of real dimension 4. And the group of automorphisms of X, you can have two viewpoints on it. The first viewpoint is that this is a group of holomorphic diffeomorphisms, if you do complex analysis. The second viewpoint is that it is a group of regular algebra. Of regular algebraic automorphisms given by algebraic geometry. And as a topological group for the uniform convergence, it's a complex Lie group. The Lie algebra is an algebra of holomorphic vector fields on X, and it's a finite dimensional Lie algebra. But the most interesting part of the group is the discrete part. Okay, so you can, except for the first example I will give, you can imagine. First example I will give, you can imagine that the group is in fact discrete. It's a countable discrete group. Okay, so let me start with examples. The first example, you take an elliptic curve, so a quotient of the complex line C by a lattice lambda, and you look at the surface, the abelian surface, which is the product of E with itself. Okay, so E times E for the elliptic. times E for the elliptic curve E. As a torus, it's the complex plane divided by the lattice lambda times lambda. So there are two obvious groups acting on it. First, X is an abelian surface, so it acts on itself by translations, by the group law. In fact, this group of translation is exactly the connected component of this complex free group in the case of a billion surfaces. And there is another And there is another group here acting, which is a group GL2Z. So the group of two by two matrices with integer coefficients. If you look at its natural linear action on C2, it preserves lambda times lambda because it's the same lattice, I mean lambda times lambda, the same one. Okay, so this lattice is invariant. So GL2Z induces an action, a linear action on the quotient C2 mod lambda time zone. C2 mod lambda times lambda. So a linear action on the torus. And you see in this case, torsion points are exactly the periodic points of this group. So you have a correspondence between finite orbits of this group GL to Z with torsion points. Torsion points in the torus X. A finite orbit is a torsion point, and a torsion point gives a finite orbit. So torsion points or finite orbits are dense for the Zariski topology or for the Euclidean topology on your torus. And this is the type of situation that we would like to characterize. In fact, the goal is to give. In fact, the goal is to give results saying that if you have a group of automorphisms which is big and which has a Zariski dense set of periodic points, then in fact it should come from a torus with such a linear action. Okay, so that's the goal of the talk. The second example is a variation of the first one. So you take the quotient of the torus by the involution minus x minus y. Minus x minus y. So the inverse or the opposite for the group law. Or if you prefer, it's the action of the element of the center of G L to Z, which is given by the matrix minus identity. So the quotient is a surface X mod eta, it's a singular surface, and the group G L to Z, since it commutes with its center, acts on this surface. So it acts here on GL. Surface. So it acts here on G on the quotient. And you can take a minimal resolution of this surface, and you still have a group action, an action by regular automorphisms of PGL, of GL to Z modulo eta, so PGL to Z. Okay, so this type of example is known as a Kumar surface. Geometrically, you go from an abelian surface to a K3 surface. So you change the geometry of the surface. And for the periodic points or finite orbits of this group action on this new surface Y, they come exactly from torsion points on the torus. So they are still Zariski dense and dense for the Euclidean topology. The third example I want to describe is an example that Simeon Philippe already described in his talk. It's a so-called Wheeler surface. So, this is an example that has been studied a lot by Weller. I mean, not a lot, but in a nice paper. Okay, so here is the situation. You start with a smooth surface in P1 times P1 times P1. I will fix a coordinate x, affine coordinates x, y, z. It's x, y, z on each of the p1. And the assumption is that the degree of x with respect to each variable is equal to 2. So if you look at the polynomial equation, you can take products like x square, y square, z square, but if you just focus on one of the variables, for example, the variable y, the maximal degree you see must be two. Okay, so that's a two to two surface. Okay, so that's a 2 to 2 surface, and since I assume it is smooth, in fact, it's a K3 surface. And geometrically, this degree assumption means that if you forget one of the variables, for example, the variable y, you project x on p1 with the x coordinate times p1 with the z-coordinate, then you get a 2-to-1 cover. It's a 2-to-1 ramified cover. So you have an involution which is An involution which is a deck transformation group, which generates the deck transformation group of this 2 to 1 cover. And since you can do that with the three variables, you have in fact three involutions. I think the notation used by Simeon was something like sigma x, sigma y, and sigma z. And all together, they generate a very nice group. It's, let's call it gamma. It's a free product of the three. It's a free product of the three involutions if the equation is general. There are no relations between these involutions. And if you take the composition of the three involutions, then the dynamics of this transformation is very nice. And to illustrate it, I took pictures from my PhD. Took pictures from my PhD thesis, so 21 years old pictures, in which the picture is the following. So you take this surface, you plot the real part, so the real part is topologically it's a sphere, and you take a large number of points on this surface, and for each of them, you draw the orbit of the point under the iterates of this map. And this is the type of picture that you get. Okay, so this is the view on the surface, and this is the view. Is the view on the surface, and this is the view from the top when you put your eyes above the surface here and you zoom. Okay, and so the type of question we are asking with Romain is, for this specific example, can we prove that the group gamma has only finitely many finite orbits? And the answer is yes. Okay, so the last thing I want to say on this example is if I come back, If I come back, the fact that this example, this Wheeler surface, which I described on an example, is a deformation of this Kumer surface, in fact, of X mod eta. You can embed X modulo eta in P1 times P1 times P1, and it's a singular surface of degree 2 to 2. And this example is a deformation of the This example is a deformation of the previous one. And of course, the three involutions up to finite index that correspond to a deformation of this action of PGL2Z. Okay, so it's just the same example as the Kumir example, but after deformation. Excuse me, what are we actually seeing in this picture? Is this a single orbit? No, it's a bunch of orbits. Okay, so there are something like 200 orbits. Something like 200 orbits in this picture. For instance, if you start with a point near the top here, when you do the three involutions, the orbit will go, will stay near the top and near the bottom. It will oscillate between the top and the bottom. And when you look at just the point that you draw on the top, so I'm not looking at the bottom, you see something like that. So you see an orbit which does Like that, so you see an orbit which does something like that. I mean it okay, it this orbit is confined in a region of the top. But if you start with an orbit here, basically the feeling that you have when you draw the picture, but it's not a theorem, is that the orbit feels an open set in this part. Okay, but there are several orbits in this picture, like 200. Is that clear? So they're not there. So they're not dense, these orbits? No, these orbits are not dense. But these are the orbits of F, of a single map. If you look at the orbits of the group gamma, which is much larger, then the orbits typically are dense. And the question is to control the orbits which are finite. Thank you. Okay, great. Okay, so now I want to describe a Okay, so now I want to describe a tool to study automorphisms, which is the action of the automorphism on the cohomology, or if you prefer on the Nevon Segregoup. It depends if you prefer more topological tools or algebraic ones. Okay, so first let me start with the intersection form. So you know that if you have two curves, C and D, in your surface X, then you can X, then you can count the number of intersection points between C and D with multiplicities, and you get a number which I denote C bracket D, like a scalar product. Typically, it's a positive number, but for instance, if C is the blow-up of a point and you intersect C with itself, you get minus one. And the important thing is that I describe it as a function of two curves. It is a function of two curves, you can take it as a function of two divisors, and it's linear with respect to C and linear with respect to D, so it's a bilinear form on divisors. And I will look at the Neuron several group. So the Neuron Seville group, I'm cheating a little bit. In fact, usually it's called the set of numerical classes num1 of X. So what I'm doing is I'm So, what I'm doing is, I'm looking at the Neuron Seville group modulo torsion. So, this is, I mean, two curves are equivalent in the Neuron Seville group if they intersect other curves with the same number. Okay, so C is equal to C prime in the Nevron several group if C intersected D is equal to C prime intersected D for every C. But topologically, it's the same as looking at the intersect. The same as looking at the intersection of the second cohomology group with integral coefficients with the part of the double decomposition which is H11. One way to see that is to say if you have a curve, then there is an invertible shift or a line bundle associated to this curve of c and you take the first churn class of that and this gives Of that, and this gives you a point here. Or, if you prefer, homologically, if you have a curve C in X, it's a Riemann surface in X. So you look at its homology class, it's something in the H2 of X, and the Poincaré Redual is this class in the neuroscient group. Okay, so there are three distinct review points on the same group, and the important thing is that it's Is that it's a Nabigan group of finite rank, which I denote by rho of x and without torsion. So rho of x is the picker number of the surface. So we have a lattice, z to the rho, with an intersection form, a quadratic form, or bilinear form on this lattice. And the Hodge index theorem tells you that Tells you that the form, the intersection form, is non-degenerate, and the signature is 1 and rho of x minus 1. So there is one positive sign, and there are rho of x minus 1 negative signs. Okay? Now I will look at the action of automorphisms on this space. So they act on Nevon several groups, they permute the curves. Groups that permute the curves and they preserve the intersection forms. Okay, so using this geometry, every automorphism f in out of x determines a linear transformation of this Neuron segregal group. So it's a matrix with integer coefficients in a space of dimension. coefficients in a space of dimension O of x. But also it's an isometry of this scalar product, this, I mean this scalar product of signature one rho minus one. And there are three cases which corresponds to the possible fixed points of this isometry in the positive cone. So let me explain the picture on the left. So the black cone So the black cone is the isotropic cone. It's where the self-intersection is zero. The gray cone here is where the form is positive. So here the self-intersection is positive and here the self-intersection is negative. The first case is when the map, the endomorphism F star, has a fixed point in the interior. Point in the interior of the positive cone. In that case, it's easy to prove that this isometry F star, so the action of F on the cohomology has finite order, just because it preserves this lattice, this integral structure. The second case is when you have a fixed point on the boundary of the positive code, so a fixed point in T. Fixed point in the isotropic code. So, in fact, you have, of course, a line of fixed points here. And the brown plane in my picture is just the orthogonal complement of this line for the intersection 4. Okay, this was the same here. This brown plane is the orthogonal of that one. In that case, so I'm assuming. So I'm assuming that f star has infinite order and that it has a fixed point on the boundary of the of the positive cone. In that case, in fact, F star is virtually unipotent. So some iterate of this matrix F star has all its eigenvalues equal to one and can write it as a Jordan block with one on the diagonal and some upper right coefficients. Coefficients. And it's of infinite order. And the last case, which is called the laxodromic case, is when there is an eigenvalue larger than one. So some number lambda of f, which is an eigenvalue of f larger than one. And it can be proved that this eigenvalue is unique. The corresponding eigenspace is an isotropic line, so which is multiplied by lambda. Multiplied by lambda. And there is also an isotropic eigenspace of dimension one, which is multiplied by one over lambda. And on the orthogonal complement of the two lines here on this set, it acts as a rotation. Okay, so my picture is in dimension three, but the geometry, of course, the dimension is rho of x here for these pictures. So we have three behaviors. Have three behaviors of automorphisms corresponding to three possible actions on the cohomology or the Nevon segregation. And so the name are elliptic, parabolic, and loxodonic. And the nice thing is that there is a correspondence between this description, which is just a linear description on the cohomology or neuron cycle group, and the geometry of F acting on the surface. On the surface. So here is the statement. When f is elliptic, so when f has finite order on the nie-reference every group, then some positive iterate of f is in the connected component of the automorphism group. So this is an algebraic group acting algebraically on x, and you can study these actions by looking at groups. At groups, I mean, algebraic groups acting algebraically on surfaces, or if you do differential geometry, holomorphic vector fields on projective surfaces. The second interesting example is the case of parabolic transformation. And in that case, F preserves a generous one vibration. So, a vibration like that, I would like to thank Laura de Marcot for this nice picture. So, you take a fibration of genus 1, and you have a transformation which maps fibers to fibers. And typically, it preserves each of the fibers, acting as a translation on the fiber. Okay, so in fact, if it really permutes the fibers in a way, I mean, such that the action on the basis has infinite order, you can prove that the surface is abelian. So, it's not so interesting. Is a billion, so it's not so interesting for us. And usually, this transformation, these parabolic transformations, in most examples, they preserve each of the fibers. So the typical example is the same as the example in Laura Stock. You have two sections of your fibration. So the zero section by convention and a second section. The section The section intersects each fiber in one point, and the automorphism does the following. It translates the first, I mean, it translates the surface fiber-wise and moves the zero section to the second section. Okay, so this is a typical example of parabolic transformation. Okay, so I explained to you that there is a dictionary between the action on cohomology and the geometry of the map. And the geometry of the map on the surface, at least in the first two cases. And now I will move to the third one and explain the dynamical properties of the third examples. But I think it may be a good time to stop. And since I am the last speaker, to thank the organizers of the conference. Okay, so maybe we have a few seconds to thank them. Thanks the Bierce presentation. Okay, I don't have the comments here on my computer because I'm focusing on my presentation. Did you get questions from the audience or no? If there's one I'll read it, okay, so I continue. Yeah, yeah, go ahead. Yeah, yeah, go ahead. Okay, so now I move to the case of lookromic transformations. So, transformations, automorphisms with an eigenvalue larger than one on the Neuron Céligo. So, there is an isotropic line corresponding to an eigenvalue larger than one, and an eigenline which is contracted by one of a lump. Okay, so here I So, here I will do some complex analysis. So, I fix representatives, I mean, vectors in these lines, theta plus and theta minus. So, theta plus is multiplied by lambda, and theta minus is multiplied by 1 over lambda. So, maybe I change the color to and I normalized. And I normalize in such a way that the intersection between these two vectors for the intersection form is equal to one. The first property, you start with an ample class in this cones. So here you take an ample class and you apply F star. It will converge if you renormalize to this line. So you prove that theta plus and theta minus, in fact, are in the closure of the ample code. So they are represented. Represented by closed positive currents. And in fact, these currents are unique. So if you fix the class here, theta plus, there is a unique closed positive current such that the class of T plus is equal to theta plus. And moreover, this current has Hulder continuous potentials. So these currents, if you come back to the talk of Simeon, are Part of the sections that Simeon constructed from the boundary of this cone to the space of currents. And since they have holder continuous potentials, you can take the product. And with my normalization here, the fact that the intersection is one in cohomology, then you get that the product is a probability measure. Its total mass is one. So it's a measure and it's a probability measure. So it's a measure which is. So, it's a measure which is given just by complex analysis. And this measure is invariant by the dynamics of f because t plus is multiplied by lambda and t minus is multiplied by one over lambda. Okay, so you have a nice natural probability measure, which is f invariant. And this probability measure has a dynamical meaning. It satisfies. It satisfies the following property. The periodic points of F, of your initial automorphism F, which is fluxodromic, its periodic points, when the period goes to infinity, equidistribute with respect to this measure. This means that if you look at the periodic points of period n, you put a Dirac mass at each of them, and you average, then when the period goes to infinity, Then, when the period goes to infinity, it converges to μf. Okay, so you have equidistribution with respect to a measure which was given just by complex analysis and Hodge theory. Moreover, the number of periodic points is roughly lambda of f to the n. Okay, that's the first result I want to stress on, I mean to state. And the second one is a rigidity result. A rigidity result. If this measure is smooth, or if it is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure of dimension four on this real manifold of dimension four, then the pair given by x and f is a Kumar example. So it comes from a torus. Okay, so I already gave an example of a Kumar surface in the first slide. In the first slide or second one. Here, the definition of Kumar example is a little bit more involved, it's a little bit more general. I want to take all possible quotient of tori with such a group or such a Luxodropic automorphism acting on the quotient. So, let me give the definition because it's important for the last part of the talk. Okay, so what is a Kumar group? Okay, so what is a Kumir group? So don't read what I wrote. Okay, let me explain on a picture. So you want to look at the following phenomenon. So you start with an abelian surface A and with a group gamma A acting on A. Okay, so A is an abelian surface and gamma A is a group acting on A. And this group contains a finite Contains a finite group G in such a way that G is normalized by gamma. Then you can take the quotient R mod G and the action of gamma A on A induces an action of the quotient, let's say gamma A bar mod G on A mod G. mod G on a mod. And now, so this surface typically is singular. Now you resolve the singularities. You get a new surface. Maybe it's not the minimal resolution, call it X. Maybe you blow up more points than just what is enough to desingularize. And then you lift gamma A to a group gamma here. Okay. So if you have this picture, So if you have this picture, so with a projection Qx, a projection QA, and everything commutes as I explained, then you say that this surface with this group of photomorphisms is a Kumer example. Okay, so if I come back to the previous slide, I'm saying that if the periodic points of a loxodomic automorphism equidistribute to A quidistribute toward a smooth measure, then in fact the automorphism F of X comes from a linear transformation of a torus. That's what I'm saying. Okay, so it's an example in which some information on the periodic points, the fact that they equidistribute toward a smooth measure, tells you that, in fact, the transformation. In fact, the transformation you are looking at comes from a transformation, a linear transformation of a torus. Maybe I should say that here. I say linear because A is covered, it's a torus, so it's covered by C2 modulo lattice. I mean, it is C2 modulo lattice, and all automorphisms F of such a torus lift. Taurus lift to a fine transformation from C2 to C2. Okay, so when you have a smooth distribution of periodic points, then the transformation comes from an affine or linear map in C2. That's the statement. Okay, but here the definition I gave works for all I gave works for all, I mean, for groups, not only for transformations and the cyclic groups that generate. Okay, so now I'm in a position where I can state the result we proved with Roman. So here is a statement. So it's a statement which will say that the group is a Kumer group, and the hypothesis will be that the set of periodic points is Zariski dense. But let me go slowly. Go slowly. So you start with a number field, any number field, and you take a smooth projective surface defined over this number field. And then you consider a group, gamma, which is a group of automorphisms of X, also defined over the same number field. So all transformations are defined by formulas in some number field, the number field K. And the big assumption. And the big assumption is that gamma contains two parabolic elements with distinct invariant vibrations. Okay, so here is a picture. So you have your surface X. Suppose you have a first elliptic vibration. So you may have some singular fibers. Have some singular fibers. I will construct an example of such a gamma. That's what I'm doing. And you have two sections, like that. And you define an automorphism which acts by translation along the fibers, translating from the first section to the second section. So this gives you a first automorphism G1. Automorphism G1. And assume that G1 has infinite order on the Nevon-Seville group, which is almost always the case. So that's your first transformation. And now you assume that you have a second elliptic vibration, which is not the same, so a second one. And you have also two sections so that you can translate in this second direction. So you have two parables. So you have two parabolic automorphisms with respect to two distinct vibrations. And the group you look at is the group generated by these two parabolic elements, for instance. Then the conclusion is as follows. If gamma has Zariski dense set of periodic points, then the surface, I mean the complete geometry here, the surface and the group come from an abelian surface. So it's a Kumar example. Okay. Okay, is that clear? So, this Zariski dense set of finite orbits is extremely rigid because the only example are given by abelian surfaces and their quotients. And then you can designularize or blow up a finite number of finite orbits. Okay, so the statement is over a number field, but you, because the proof uses some Because the proof uses some arithmetic equidistribution. But we can also prove results about the field of complex numbers if we add some hypothesis. For instance, if we had that gamma has no periodic curve, we can prove the same type of statement over the field of complex numbers. Serge, can I interrupt to ask a question? Yes, of course. So, just to appreciate the hypotheses here. So, if you have a surface where you assume bullet points one, two, three. Points one, two, three, but don't assume that gamma has a Zariski dense set of periodic points. So, so which surfaces have such gamma? Okay, okay, sorry, I should have said that. Take the Wheeler example at the beginning. Thank you, Loa. The Whaler example, this 2 to 2 example. We had three involutions. Okay, if I compose sigma x with sigma y, I get such an example g1. If I compose sigma y with sigma x, y x x x x If I compose sigma y with sigma z, I get another example g2 of parabolic transformation. Okay, so the Weller surface are examples satisfying all this hypothesis, at least if the equation is over a number field. So the statement says that for most Whaler surfaces, and in fact, exactly for Wheeler surfaces which are not Kumar surfaces, and this can be described, the set of The set of periodic orbits is finite. Okay, thanks. Okay, but there are many other examples of surfaces with a large group of automorphisms like that with a lot of parabolic automorphism because they have a lot of elliptic vibrations with sections. So, for instance, cobalt surfaces. So, you have many examples like that. Examples consist. Examples constructed by Jérémy Blanc. So there are a lot of examples. But of course, this assumption that there are two parabolic elements in the group is certainly not the right one. What I expect, and I think Roma expects the same also, is if the group is big in the sense that its action on the Nevon-Séré group can be. On the Nevon several group contains a free group, a non-abelian free group, then the same statement should be correct, okay, without assuming parabolic elements, but for instance, just assuming that you have two loxodromic elements which have no common power, for instance. I mean, they have fixed points, theta plus and theta minus, which are not equal. Okay, and this is related to the To the, if you try to generalize this result, this is related to the following equation. We would like to classify pairs of fluxodromic elements, F and G, in such a group gamma, such that the measure mu F is equal to the measure mu G. So does this imply that F and G generate a cyclic group or that the surface is a Kumar surface? A commerce surface. That's the type of question we would like to answer. Unfortunately, we don't know yet. And this type of question has been analyzed by Roman and Charles Favre for Reno automorphisms of the affine plane 8. Okay, so I want to give, if you have questions, do not hesitate. But what I want to do now, I want to give one application. One application and then look at the strategy of the proof. Okay, so no questions? Okay, I go on. Okay, so let me give one application. It's also over number fields. So you start with a number field. It fits an algebraic closure, K-bar, which is just Q-bar up to isomorphism. Them and the surface and the group are defined over the number field. Now we consider the Picard group of X and forget about torsion. So to do that, I tensorize by R. So if peak zero is trivial, this is just a Nevant-Savory group. So if you don't know exactly what the peak R group is, you can just think about the Nevron-Savory group. About the Nevance every group. Except that if peak zero is not trivial, this is not a finite-dimensional group, it's infinite-dimensional vector space. But otherwise, it's fine. It's almost the same as a Nebraska segregary group in some sense. Okay, so here is a definition which is due to Arthur Baraga. It's so you have a surface and a group, and you are looking for And you are looking for a family of wild height. So, for every divisor class D in the Picard group, you want to cook some height function which depends on D. So now it's a function of x, where x is the point of the surface over k bar, such that the first assumption is that each of the h That each of the hd of x, when d is fixed and x is in the surface, is a k-bar point, is a veil height with respect to the divisor d. The second assumption, which is quite strong, is that it's linear with respect to the divisor or to the divisor class. And the third assumption says that the height is canonical in the sense that it behaves well. That it behaves well under the action of the group of transformations gamma. So you want that h of f star d x is h of d at f of x. The natural equivariance property you may think about, think of. Okay, so this is not an empty definition. There are examples. The main example is a Nevontate height, but not for all automorphisms. So for automorphisms, So, for automorphisms, fixing the nut hole element of your abelian variety. Okay, so if you have an abelian surface, or more generally, an abelian variety, the Nerentate height for automorphisms of the abelian variety fixing the origin, or if you prefer, preserving the group law, satisfy this property. Okay, so the neuron type height is an example. The second example was given by Barragar. By Barragar and motivated the definition. And if you look at the construction of canonical heights by Silverman and you apply it when X is a surface of Picard number 2 and gamma is a cyclic group generated by a Luxodromic automorphism, then you get an example of canonical vector height. Just putting together the heights H plus and H minus construct. Constructed by Silverman. H plus H and H minus are heights which behave like the current T plus F and T minus F that I described a few minutes ago. And then the third example is not an example, it's a counter example. Kiawagushi, following ideas by Baragar, proved that for certain examples of For certain examples of wheel or surfaces, there is no such height function, such as canonical vector height. So, he gave examples for which he could prove the non-existence of such heights. What we put with Ronan is in fact the statement is that all examples are coming from the neurotende height. So, if you have a surface X with a group of photomorphisms gap, Group of photomorphisms gamma that satisfy the hypothesis of the first theorem. So the existence of these two parabolic transformations with respect to distinct vibrations. Then if there is a canonical height, X is a Nobelian surface, gamma is a periodic point, and the height H, the canonical vector height, is derived from the Nevontae height. This means that after translation, After translation by such a fixed point, the height is the Nevante height, plus some small perturbation. So, what I mean by small, you can do the following. You take a class E in the Nevron segregation group, which is fixed by gamma. So, this may happen, and you take a function phi on x of k bar. On X of K bar, which is bounded, and gamma invariant. So, if you compute this height, this new height, you can see that it satisfies all properties of the canonical vector height. It's trivial. And the statement says that, in fact, all examples are given by such perturbations of Nevonted height. Okay, so I won't. Okay, so I won't prove the second theorem, but I would like to sketch the main steps of the proof of the first theorem. Okay, so let's go. Let's do that. The right-hand side in your formula doesn't seem to depend on y. Yes, yes. So let me say it differently. You start with a You start with an so x is the first part of the statement is x is an abelian surface. So x is c2 mod lambda. It comes with a group law and the origin is the projection say of zero in c2. Maybe the origin is not fixed by gamma. But the second part of the statement is gamma has a periodic point y. And then you can phrase it like And then you can phrase it like that: conjugate gamma by the translation which maps 0 to y. Then now gamma fixes 0. And translate, do the same for the height. So you translate by translation by y. So now, after this translation, so to simplify, let us forget about this translation, then Then H dx is the Nevontae height plus some perturbation. So it just means this y just means that if I replace gamma by a finite index subgroup, it has a fixed point. If I put this the fixed point at the origin, then the height is an Eurante height plus some perturbation. So the Y is not so important. Is that clear? Y is a fixed point here. It's not. A fixed point here. It's not. Am I clear? Up to Gronjigesi biotranslation, this is the Neurontite height, modulosum perturbation. And E is somehow determined by H? I would say E is determined by gamma up to if gamma has a fixed point in the Nevron several. Has a fixed point in the Nevon segreg group, then this fixed point is unique up to multiplication by a scalar factor under my assumption that gamma has two parabolic elements. This is because the Picard number of Nobelian surface is very small, so you don't have much space to find fixed points. Okay. Let let's let's go to the to the proof strategy. You to the proof strategy, and maybe we can come back to this issue after the talk. Okay, so the first idea is basically due to Kawagushi, it's to use Yuan's equidistribution theorem for periodic orbits. So, my standing assumption is that gamma has a sequence. A sequence of points in X cabar, so an infinite sequence of periodic points. And more than that, so I have infinitely many periodic points, but moreover, these periodic points form a Zariski dense set in my surface. Okay, so I want I want to use an equity distribution theorem, and for that, first I will construct some kind of canonical height for the group gamma acting on X. But it's a kind of canonical height, but in a stationary way. So instead of looking at an MPL class, which is preserved by the group gamma and say multiplied by something larger than one, Say multiplied by something larger than one, I'm looking for a class D which, in average, is multiplied by some number alpha. So, here what I do is the following trick. I take gamma, I take a probability measure on gamma, say with finite support, and I look at all the images of D by elements in gamma, but I average with average with and I want d to be an eigenvector with an eigenvalue alpha of nu larger than one with respect to this transformation. Okay, and I want d to be ample too. So when I do that, if I can do that, then I can cook a canonical height, so a veil height, which behaves exactly as the dbizor class was doing. Was doing. Moreover, this canonical height, I mean, this canonical stationary height decomposes into local heights with continuous contribution, local contributions. That's the first thing to prove. And the second is that finite orbits exactly correspond to points of height zero, so the minimum of the height for this canonical height. And then you are. For this canonical height. And then you are in a position to apply Yuan's equidistribution theorem to this sequence of points. So they are periodic, so they have height zero. So they equidistribute. And they equidistribute with respect to some measure, mu, some probability measure on x. And since this equidistribution is an equidistribution of periodic orbits of gamma, the limit is invariant. Okay, so I invariant okay so i i want to move to the second uh i want to quickly move to the second step because this one is some somewhat classical okay so the trick now the the the idea is that in the previous slide i can change the weight the weight that i put on the the automorphism so i can change my probability measure and for each of them i apply the equation Them, I apply the equidistribution, and I always get the same probability measure at the limit because it depends only on the periodic points and their Galois orbit. So this measure mu, which in mu1 theorem is related to d, in fact is not related to d, because it's only related to the fixed point. So this measure mu, which is related to d, which depends on mu, in fact does not depend on nu. Depend on you. And when you do that, you change the parameters and you take a sequence of probability measures which converges just toward a Dirac mass at a loxodromic element and its inverse. And what you get doing that is that the measure mu, so this measure mu n gives you a measure mu, which does not depend on n. So this measure here should give you also the measure mu. Measure μ. And what you get from that is that, in fact, μ is μf, the measure which controls the distribution of periodic points of every loxodromic element in gamma. Okay, so in fact, this measure is gamma invariant, but is also the measure μf associated to the laxodromic transformation f. For every loxohnomic. For every loxodromic element in gamma. And you have a lot of them because you compose parabolic elements and you get a lot of them. Okay, so I'm lacking time. So let me say how we conclude from that. So the first step is to show that the measure mu has full support. Okay, so it's a probability measure on the It's a probability measure on a complex manifold of real dimension four, a compact manifold, and you want to prove that it is not supported on some weird counter set. You prove that it has full support. And for that, we use parabolic elements and we cook up explicit loxodromic elements in gamma. And the last step is you have a measure which is invariant by a large group and which has full support. And which has full support, and we prove that it is smooth. And if it is smooth, since it is a measure μf, we can conclude that it is a Kumar example from the theorem I obtained with Christophe Dupont, which I described in the middle of my talk. Okay. I think the best is I stop now, and if there are questions, I can describe the last steps of the proof. Less than Sir. It's a last time, sir, for the talk. Is there any question? I had a question, if I could. Fantastic talk, by the way, and a great result. Does it actually, do you think, yield estimates which would let you for a particular example where there's only five? Example where there's only finitely many finite orbits actually determine them, okay? So, um, yes and no, okay, so first no. The proof I the general result I gave here, so this theorem A, it's not quantitative, not in the way we wrote it. Uh, and I don't think. And I don't think we have the tools to get quantitative estimates, or at least tools that I don't know, maybe there are, but the tools I know, there are no quantitative estimates. But the main example I had today are these Wheeler surfaces. And for instance, what we proved is that, but by other means, is a simpler statement, but if you take a very general But if you take a very general weather surface, so it's more related to the second statement of a C, then there are no finite orbits. But you see, it's by degeneration. It's by degeneration. You assume that there is a finite orbit on a very general surface and you you spe specialize at some specific weather surfaces to exclude this possibility. To exclude this possibility. So it's not the same type, it's easier. It's much easier. Right. I mean, there will be lots of specific examples where there are moderately large orbits. I'm sorry. The other thing I wanted to say, it's almost more of a comment, is if you reformulate those just as a surface that has two elliptic vibrations, it's sort of a, I think you can more or less set it up. More or less set it up, phrase it as an unlikely intersection problem. Yes, you're right. Yes, and so it's also really a beautiful result from that viewpoint, too. I don't know if it is better if I phrase it like that. I mean, it's maybe better for you, but yeah, no, no, just a different way to think about it. Thank you. Is there any other question? I wanted to ask. I wanted to ask a question about maybe I missed something in the proof, but so if you start with a periodic point that's periodic for both parabolics G1 and G2, and then you kind of throw it around, so you have the sequence of measures. That sequence of measures will be invariant both by the parabolic, G1 and G2, before you even take a law conjugates. So then in the limit, it should still be invariant. The weak limit. Be invariant, the weak limit should still be invariant by both parabolics. So then you get this measure that's going to be invariant by both parabolics and you can classify those using the... Yes, so you can classify these measures. This is something I did a long time ago. But you end up with the following problem. So what could happen? Let me go to the happen let me go to the let me go here for instance what could happen is that the surface so x of c that's your surface complex surface and it contains periodic points xi maybe there are in x of q and then then the equity distribution maybe tells you Maybe tells you, you have to exclude this fact that mu is supported on the real part of x. I mean, say the support of mu. No, so I agree with this, but what I meant was whether the first steps, like the Yvonne equidistribution theorem, was needed where you could avoid it with your assumptions. Say it again. So I understand that you have this difficulty that everything. I understand that you have this difficulty that everything could be supported under real locus. But what I mean is whether you need this equity distribution statement in order to get, because this equidistribution statement does not exclude the difficulty you just stated, right? You have to deal with this at a later stage. Yes, you're right. But at least you get equal distribution. But all you need is that there's a measure mu, which is a. But all you need is that there's a measure μ which is invariant by both carbon. Yes, you're right, you're right. But you need a quick distribution, and also you know how to compute this measure. Somehow, this measure is related to the class D. Basically, you decompose your local height at an Archimedean place, it gives you the potential for a current. Potential for a current, and so let's say for a current Td and Td watch Td is this measure mu. So now this is where the second step enters the picture. When you change the probability measure mu, you change the class D. So D depends on nu. And so you can arrange the choice of your probability measure such that Probability measure such that this class and the product T D U H T D, so this class, I don't care, but this converges towards the probability measure associated to a loxodromic automorphism. Is that clear? So, in fact, your measure is this one for all F in the group, which is laxodonic. So, you get a lot. So, you get a lot of information on this measure. And this is how we get some information which
