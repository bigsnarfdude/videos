It's a real pleasure to be in a in-person conference. It's been a while. I mean, this talk is going to be some kind of an invitation to some emerging collection of notions, ideas, results, which I like to call higher classification theory or M-classification. Or n classification theory, you know, like by an algebra with a category theory or something. Because you don't need a good name. So what is this about? So in the usual classification theory, let's say we talk about stability, NIP, distality. So all these things say in one form or another that if that That if that all definable relate binary relations let's say R of X one X two can be approximated let me put this in quotation marks so approximated in one sense or another In one sense or another, by the Juner relations of the form, let's say s of x1 and let's say t of x2. So each of these only talks about one variable at a time, up to some small error. So the meaning of approximated and the meaning of small error vary depending on which of these notions I'm considering, but they all kind of say things of this kind, which is not, I think, how we always think about them, but uh once you try to put higher RTS, somehow you realize this is what's really happening in this type of classification results. Let me give you a couple of examples. Let me give you a couple of examples. By the way, you can see in this corner. Yeah, I guess. So let's say one: the T is a stable. If and only if, for any invariant types, let's say M invariant types, global types, let's say Q of X, Q of Y. Types over the monster model, we have that the product of these two types, well, we have that if I take p of x union, q of y, union, the collection of all formulas, well, let's say a small partial type involving both variables at the same time, implies the product of this. The product of these two types already: Q of x, tensor q of y, Morley product, non-forking product here. We have this for where this set of formulas involving two variables are the forking parts. So somehow the smaller dimensional formulas. So for R of xy, forking over m. So here I'm just Over m. So here I'm just restating uh stationarity of um stationarity of uh forking and stable theories, which is one of the characterizations of stability. And forking formulas somehow we think of sorry? Oh no, not R? Oh sorry, I need not R, right? So I need to I won't rule out on the forking formulas, yeah. So outside of forking formulas, which of which we think like a small, small dimensional, so outside of some set of outside of Outside of some set of uh outside of some small set, like modula small set, I already get that uh knowing the types of each of the variables separately. Partial type. It's not uh it's not, you know, it's informal notation, it's a very informal conference. You take negations of everything. Yes, the partial type consisting of the negations of working formulas. I don't know, maybe in positive logic it's so okay. Let's say this is. Okay, let's say this is stability, right? Now, let's say for similarly, we can characterize let's say distality. So, the point is that once you have this for types, for complete types, this is correspond to saying something about binary definable relations. So, somehow we say that binary definable relations are actually determined by knowing tuner relations, only talking about each variable at a time, plus some small amount uh of information. So, this small amount is there, or what So, this small amount is there, or what? Sorry? This is your air, or what you have? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. In this case, yeah. So, like I said, outside, we think of forking somehow, smaller dimensional intersections. So, generically, this already determines a complete type of two variables. Okay, now similarly, we can say, let's say t is distal. One of the equivalent ways to define it is to say that if I have two global invariant types, again, invariant over some small. Again, invariant for some small model. And assume that they commute. So assume that p tensor q is equal to q tensor p. So the pair of any pair. So I have a pair of commuting global and environment types. Then they already weakly orthogonal. So then I have already, I don't even need to add anything at this point. So p of x union p of y implies the full type on two variables. The full type and two variables. So, this is one of the current criterizations of distality. You can write something similar for an IP in terms of measures, but I'll say more about this in a second. So, all of this results are somehow saying either for some class of binary relations or for all binary relations, but up to small error, binary things are already determined by knowing binary data. So, now what's the So now, what's the project of higher classification, the became, is to understand what happens when, instead of trying to reduce from binary to ternary, we try to reduce, for example, from ternary to binary. So, this, so higher classification and classification. So, we want some, to obtain, to isolate some conditions, some notions, some theorems, which tell us that. That relations of RTN plus 1 are approximated by energy relations. So, the usual classification theory then corresponds to n equal 1. So, very important, we don't want to say anything about small. And we don't want to say anything about smaller RET sets. So, for example, an MI theory should definitely be entertained for any possible mean containers for any notion of theimers, yeah. So, this is a small artifact which happens for n equal to 1, which happens because we don't have unary theories, really. We always have the equality symbol. We also have some binary relation. So, unary theory doesn't have to be distal. It can be very stable, typically. But that's just because we work in theory with equality, where there's an equality relation. We don't really have truly unary theories. But for n higher than For n higher than 2 and more, this is not an issue anymore. I mean, this funny artifact of how the final loader disappears. Okay, so I want to give an overview of some of the notions of n thinness, for higher n, and some results, what kind of results one can expect about n. This okay? There's a motivation. Okay, so first let me say a few things about end dependence. This is by now the best idea. By now, the best studied, I think, notion. The best studied, somehow, also there's no question about what it should be. I think we all agree that there's a clear definition of what n-dependence should be, which is not necessarily the case for some other functions. Okay, so n-dependence definition. We say that the formula phi of x1 through xn comma, let's say y Say y has I to n if there exists some sequences, let's say Ai T for i enormical, let's say some infinite sets for t between 1 and n such that for any subset of the product of the integers, so for any s, a subset of A subset of omega to the n, there exists some element b, let's say b subscript s, such that the formula holds on the corresponding indices. So we have phi a1, let's say i1 through a t ds, if and only if the tuple i1 through I1 through IT belongs to our set. So this is a straightforward generation of what the usual independent property says. So there it says you can pick out subsets. You can cut out all subsets of a given infinite set, for instance of a single formula. For IPM, we are saying that you can cut out all subsets of the product of n infinite sets. Right. Okay, so again for n equals one, this is the usual uh independence property. And then uh a series n dependent if uh you cannot do this. Sure. So uh so this is one, let's say this is two. T is N dependent equivalently M N A D for Alice especially. I don't know, the shock never gets sold for people apparently. Oh, there are two ways to call one thing. So it wait quite fascinating. So endependent if no formula has IPM. If no formula has IPM. No formula has IPM. So there are some natural examples of such things. NIP sub n. I don't understand. No formula has IP on it. What the way? I did one. We're still going with the joke. I should see somebody said we have a very natural characterization. About a natural characterization. So, I think I started seeing some examples. So, some natural examples of this are, for example, not to generate n linear alternating forms over NIT fields. That would be a very typical example. I mean, an easier example would be just a generic random n-hypergraph. And this is a strict hierarchy. So, as n grows, we get more and more theories. A fascinating open question. Yeah. A fascinating open question is whether there are independent fields which are not already in ID and the pure ring language. I think it's a quite interesting question. Somehow it seems field structure is killed. Somehow, independent, all the examples that we know, they seem to suggest that independent theories are linear or one-based with respect to the MIT part. I don't know if that's something that should be true in general, but all the examples seem to indicate this. To indicate this. All the examples we know. So let me give you now a characterization of this in terms of measures, which generalizes the NIP case. This is some recent work with Henry Sausner. Assume I have a bunch of measures, Eastern measures, so there were talks about it, right? Kyle defined all of this very conveniently for me. So let's say we have a bunch of measures. Let's say we have a bunch of measures. Let's say mu1 to mu n. Let this be global, definable if there matters. And assume that they are pair-wise commuting. Okay, so by this I mean that's the only thing that's the same Okay, so by this I mean that this is five there's a form of Fubini theorem going on between these measures. So you have mu i tensor product with mu of j the same as mu j tensor product with mu i for all i j Right so tensor product remember is defined by uh by uh by by an integral with this of uh of the values of this measure on the form with respect to this measure. So what this really says is that you have to be So what this really says is that you have to be double integrals uh don't don't depend on the order. Okay, it's not necessarily associated with order. Yeah, for definable measures it always is. It's not full generality. I mean the result is actually more general. It's about abstract measures and some, but let me state it like this just for simplicity of the statement. Okay, so you have a bunch of commuting measures. Okay, then for any Uh okay, then for any epsilon uh let's say well let's say for any relation r definable, so for any formula r of x1 through xn and any epsilon greater than zero, there exists, oh, maybe I should state the assumption, right? So assume that the theory t is anti-pendant. So assume the theory t is Theory T is n-dependent. And it's actually, I apologize, let me take new n plus one many measures. Okay, so then, given the relation of RT n plus one, so I'm just trying to realize an instance of this wish, right? So I'm given an n plus one area definable relation. I'm also approximated by relations of smaller area. So now small error will be in terms of the measure of the symmetric definition. Of the measure of the symmetric difference. So, for any relation R definable, so definable formula, and epsilon arbitrary small real number, n plus one, yes, n plus one, full n, yes, antenna epsilon, there exists some, so, okay, so we can, we then have that if I look at the, well, sorry, there exists some, let's say, r prime. R prime, still a relation of R e t plus 1, definable, such that the measure of the symmetric difference of these two is smaller than epsilon. So the measure in the sense of the product of all these errors divided from 1 to n plus 1, y also r symmetric difference with r prime. This is smaller than epsilon. Okay? And this R prime is of special form, given by a Boolean combination of relations, each of which only depends on n many variables out of n plus 1. And r plus 1 is of the form for, let's say, s, a subset of uh n plus 1. Size of s is n. Size of S is M R S of X I I and S. So it's a finite Boolean combination of definable relations, each of which only involves n many variables out of n plus 1. So up to epsilon, we never have to use all variables simultaneously. In particular, in the case of an IT, which is a known result, Which is a known result. So, for an IP that we mentioned. Well, there are a couple of remarks. So, first, for an IP. Yes. Sorry? It's false, right? Sorry? It's false on the IP. No, it's definitely not false. I mean, it's doing and dependent in particular. You can take an equal one. It's true. What is false? What do you have false? This is false in an IP? I mean, it's in our paper. I mean, it's an hour paper. So it's going to be true. Okay, so, right, so in particular, if you're in an IT theory, what this tells you that if you have a binary relation, phi of x1, let's say it's two, well, let me still call it r, right? So what we get is that up to symmetric difference of measured most epsilon is going to be given by union of This is going to be given by a union of boxes. So, this is given by some disjoint union of sets of the form, let's say, SI of x1 and let's say SI prime of x2 for some finite set of indices. Yeah. So, up to measure epsilon, every binary relation is already given by universal. So, this was known before for the data. Right, so for right, so this existed in several, so there were several variants. There were several variants of this result. So, this was by Alan Newman for finite measures. Also, this exists in this result by similarity and by lower sorry, what am I saying? Not similarity, lower C GD. Okay, somehow the testing for Nepig was rediscovered a number of times. There is also some variant of this by Krushovsky Pilai-Simon and for the situation when you have higher And for the situation when you have higher RET and an IT, this is in my paper, the aforementioned paper with Sergei. All of these are slightly different contexts, slightly different versions, etc. Right, so maybe what bothered you said is that wherewise commuting complies generic stability in an IP. Like, I don't say that the indexes have to be distinct. So, in particular, mu i come. Distinct. So, in particular, μi commutes with itself. Oh, I see. Yeah, so in the NIP case, actually, we get this measure is equal to be generically stable. In general, not necessarily. And in fact, I could also put here, let's say, where you define both defined ball that's of interest or somehow. Okay. Okay, ah, and this is the first remark. And the second point is that this is a characterization of n-dependence. So, one thing, and two, so T is n-dependent, if and only if this holds uniformly over all measures. So, what do I mean by this? I mean that if I fix my relation and epsilon, then I can find a bounded size of the A bounded size of a Boolean combination, so I can find the same formula so that wherein its parameters it will work for all measures simultaneously. So I need this in order to conclude N dependence. From a result like this, I need to know it uniformly over all measures of this form. So, independently proven, this holds uniformly. Well, let's say independently of the choice of a measure. But you assume also m dependent, so it follows here in this that you should. Right, so this result, oh, sorry, I didn't state it in the best possible form for simplicity. So the precise result actually would be that we can do this uniformly over all measures, by which I mean that if I fix the formula R, then I can choose some formula. And I can choose some formulas, some formula R' of this form, but possibly with some additional parameters. And now, for any choice of measures, I can pick those parameters so that they will give me a choice of measures like that. That's funny, maybe three or two. But there's always a choice of measures like that. That's a good question. Yeah, there is, because I can always take a measure of commuter to. I can always take another product. Well, I can also take finite product. I cannot take another product. Well, I cannot take finite measures. That's the point. It's enough to have it uniformly for all finite measures, actually. Even by the same relations. Sorry? Do you read the parameters? Yes. So that's what I was just explaining. There are hidden parameters here. So uniformity will mean that I am only varying these parameters, depending on the choice of my measures in colour. But I'm not varying some colour, I'm not changing the complexity of the formula prime. Some colours has to be fixed throughout all measures. Depending just on R and on epsilon. Just on R and on epsilon. Right, so, right. No, it's an excellent question. So we can always find commuting measures by taking finitely supported measures, and that's enough. So as long as we allow to take larger and larger finite sets on which we can do this, this will recover N dependence. Okay, but how does it relate to N dependence? Aha, okay, this is a state. Okay, okay, good. So it relates by being equivalent. No, no, no, it's just a remark that this usually characterizes independence. Okay, so this is independence. I mean, there's more to say, but I also gave a talk in the Berworld fact recently with the same title. So if you want to know more about this type of things, you can. Can I ask a question about definition? Yes. It's sufficient to check only four simple ones, yes? So it's sufficient to check for all forms. Well, I guess the strongest way to state I guess the strongest way to state it is that you can have a formula with parameters and all formulas, all variables single. This is sufficient to check formulas of this formula. So the theory is ind-dependent if and only if every formula of the form, well there are two ways to say that, which are pretty close. Either to say that all but one formula, all but one variables are singletons, or if you will allow to use parameters, you can also assume this one. Parameters, you can also assume this one is in the classroom. So, in practice, this is very convenient. Wait, this is like Kelsey's job, right? Yeah, I mean, it's very close to the proof. So, we had the proof with Nadia that you can make this, keep this a tuple and make all the singletons. And yeah, like if you it's a slight modification, yeah. The Harry remarks, I mean, he didn't write it. Okay. Okay, so right, okay, so this is N-dependence, yeah? Okay, so now inside NIP we have two important classes, distal theories and stable theories. So let me say a few words about N-distality. By the way, when do I have to finish? 45. 45? Okay. So, end distality, okay? This is definition due to Due to Roland Walker, a student of Dave Marker. He calls it a digital rank, I think. I like to call it n-distality. So a theory T is n-distal if for any indissembled sequence. Consisting of enough segments, so let me count the segments now. So let's say in the second sequence I of the form I1 plus, etc., plus I n n plus plus one, I believe. So by this I simply So by this I simply mean that the well I mean this consists of n plus one segments. So my sequence looks like this, right? This is I. It looks like this for just concatenation of sequence, yes. Right, so let's say this is my I, let's do with two for simplicity, let's keep two in my picture, okay? So let's say this is my I, it consists of I1, I two, I three. Actually it's easier to say it in the picture, maybe then I will write it. But okay? Maybe I will write it. Okay, so now assume I'm also given some tuples let's say A1 and A2. So, okay, for any like this, and A1 through An. If I have that, removing one of these elements gives me an indiscernible sequence together with all the other AIs included. Included. So if for each i also equal to n, the sequence I1 plus a1 plus etcetera plus i n minus sorry i n what did I say i yeah i i minus no let's say let's say like this No, let's say let's say like this, Ii, Ii plus one plus Ai plus one, etc., plus Im plus one. So if this sequence is indiscernible, then the whole sequence with all of the A's together is also indiscernible. I think we need to I0, because for N equals one, there's nothing. No, A1, AN. No, A1, AN. So A1AN. I know A1AN, so A1AN is for n equals 1, it's not equals A1. So if I remove the first one, the whole sequence 1 plus P1 through etc. For what this time you have to discern. Sequences go to n plus one, so if n is one, there's two sequences and a one. Yes, and if you drop it, it has no information. No, it's not. Because if you drop it, it's not. Say what happens once you've dropped it, you have zero information about n1. Oh. No, the condition is if you have two guys, you drop one. No, for n plus one, it's only one is circle. I can't A C L or A L. It has to be. Yes, okay, sounds good. I mean, I'm not going to rewrite it. I think exercise, feel the correct definition. So the usual distality is like this, right? So I have two segments. I have one point in the middle. Sorry, parameters. All the parameters. Sorry, parameters. Ah, sorry, the usual distality is this, right? So I have. Yeah. It's too early for me. Right, if I have two points and each of them by itself fills out the corresponding cut, so this is indiscernible and this is indiscernible, then the whole thing is indiscernible. So it's like two distal. So this is one distal. This is one discernible. So maybe I'm both this is one distal. Just to n minus one distal. Just to n minus one this is n minus one. So I'm probably off by some indices, right? So up to up to plus one maybe or something. Well, I think we all understood the opinion. That's why this definition is so natural because everyone has an opinion. Not anyone. Okay, so the usual distal means given two cuts, if you can fill them separately, this fills them together. So two distal would correspond to a picture like this. So you have three points, any two at a time, fill out stain discernible, then all three simultaneously are indiscernible. Okay? Okay, and then there is, so remember. Okay, and then there is so remember I mentioned the characterization of distality in terms of comedian types, being orthogonal. So there is some generalization of this, but not necessarily characterization, curiously. So here you say that for any global M invariant types. Pi of xi. So given a bunch of invariant types, which are pairwise commuting. Pairwise commuting. We have that again the full product. So we have that the full tensor product of this, y from 1 through n. Through n. Let's say from 0 through n. Sorry, I keep forgetting the same assumption here. So t is n distance. Assume t is n distant. Then, given all these things, this is already implied, again, by knowing all subtypes of n variables at the time. Okay? So this is a type n plus one variables. So this is the type in n plus one variables. So this is implied by the union of the subproducts. So the union overall zero, t between zero and n and now I take subproducts of pi of xi for where i is not equal to g. Question? Yes. Does any distality imply any? Yes. Does n distality imply n IP? Yes, of course. So, uh right, so this is a fact. Let me make some remarks. So, of course, n distal implies end dependent. What by that? No, no, it's it. No, same end, same end. Your end is by one. Sorry? Your end is shifted by one. No, no, it's not. I mean, maybe you I wrote it incorrectly, so it's the same line. Has to be the same line, so that has to be the same. Has to be the same n, so that helps you to get the correct n for yeah. Okay, so n distal implies and dependent. The same statement for measures is, by the way, open. So is this true for measures? Yes. Sorry. Is it obvious? Sorry? Is it obvious? Is that this is true? Remark. This is true. Yeah, this is obvious. You can take you need a sufficiently indiscernible witness to the failure of N dependence. Witness to the failure of n-dependence. So you take some n random n-party graph independent thing, and then there you can, by describability, you can conclude that even though all these things are fixed, somehow here you can either put an edge or not put an edge. So this is going to give the implication. It's an easy argument, but we need a Ramsey theorem. But it exists. Okay, so it's a subclass of an A and dependence. Proper subclass Proper subclass, you'll see in a second. Right, okay. So, for me, is this true for measures? So, there are some ideas how to do it, but the problem is that if we are not assuming that the series is an IT, so you can be two digital and not an IT. Very important. Any binary relation, or in fact, so any binary. Relation, oh, in fact, so any by any binary series of any animal series of personal distal, right? So, for example, the random graph, generic random graph, is too distal. And we don't really have a theory of Kisser measures outside of an IT. They're mostly negative results. But I conjecture that there is actually a theory of Kisser measures in n-dependent theories. And there are some small indications toward this. Like in my work with Henry, we proved, I guess. My work with him, we proved, I guess, like the you know, the zero-step lemma that is used in the beginning of the development of the theory of T-shirts in an IT, somehow like a Platinum lemma for families of finite C dimension. So we have a generalization of that, but that's somehow the easy zero step of starting to do Keith Remeris and II. But maybe that's a place to start, so it would be great to understand. Are you assuming the final? Is the question swimming the final? In the question, yes. Let's say for now, Yes, let's say for now definable. Let's say for definable measures. Yeah, commuting is part of the right, and commuting. Then do you mean to some album or do you actually mean from the measurements? Well, I didn't tell you, right, I didn't tell you precisely what implication of measures means. So, what we could say by this is that if I have a collection of partial measures like this, yeah, then there's a unique way to extend it to measure in n plus one variables. If already you In n plus one variables. If already all of these restrictions to some variables are determined. Yeah? For types, is it known that that's not a characterization of distality? No, it's not known. So it is a characterization in an IT. Yeah. So this is equivalent to distal under an IT, to n distal under an IT. But without the NIT assumption, this is not clear currently. You don't know. Yeah, I don't know. Right? Right? Okay, so we have this notion. And I want to mention that it actually gives a fine, illustrates a surprising connection to the notion of triviality of forking, or k-triviality of forking. People studying stability, like Poison, Baldwin, many people looked at variants of triviality, of working and stable theories. So I want to remark a curious connection. So now it's perfectly possible to be stable and to distort for. Sorry, okay. Yes. By the way, you also need pi and di computer. No, here I don't need it actually. Just for any i not equal to j. What is here? Okay, so let me recall the definition of triviality of forking. So let's go to stable theories for a second. So let T be stable. And this definition I've And this definition I just give to POSA. Let T be stable. Assume K is greater or equal than 1. Then T is K trivial if whenever I'm given any K plus 2 tuples and some And some set of parameters A. If every k plus 1, so here I have for 1, sorry for EF for 1, starts from 1. So if any k plus 1 of the tuples form an independent set A independent set. A independent set. Then all of them form an independent set. So the k plus one member of the then all k plus two of them are independent. It should come from zero. Am I one again? Wait, let's see. So one trivial one trivial should be the same as the usual notion of. Should be the same as the usual notion of trivial forking. So this means what? So this means I have three things, right? A one, A2, A3. And if any two are independent, then all three are independent. So are the indices correct this time? Well, the good thing about this, you never have to remember the indices because you kind of see what makes sense eventually. So, okay, so this is trivial, K-trivial, sorry. Now, well, there are some related questions of triviality which also enter the picture, but I'm not going to mention today. Right, so now there's a funny characterization of indistality restriction to stable series. It's again due to Walker. So fair. In fact, uh assume that t is stable, then t is k trivial if and only if t is k plus 1 d stop. And of course, this well-known question of positive This well-known question of Poza asking if in stable theories k-triviality is equivalent to triviality for arbitrary k. So the answer is known to be positive in super stable theories. So in particular, they show that for super stable theories, you can have you can it they can be sorry, all k-distality hierarchy collapses down to two-distality. It's super stable. It is open if this happens in stable. It is open if this conference is stable. Sorry? I thought it was not equal for K bigger than one. Yeah, right. If K is equal to one, you cannot be stable and distal at the same time. Stable and K distal at the same time is not possible. Stable and one distal. But two distal is perfectly possible. It's not hard to think of an example of this. Two distal and stable. What's the question you got? So question. So question in T stable, do we have that k distal for k greater than 2 implies 2 distal. This is equivalent to the classical question of quasi. You said it's true in super stable. True in super stable, yeah. So, no. stable yeah so known for g super stable yes yeah I think it's actually quite funny it's connected to this n gons that I guess we're relevant in in sports talk and anyways I Anyways, I don't think I have time to discuss any of this. So, right. And in fact, there's something more general which holds in an idea, which somehow tells you that in fact, k-distality corresponds to triviality, k-triviality of forking between generically stable types. So somehow it's a very funny thing. We know the distal means in particular there are no generically stable types. But this really means that forking on generical types is really trivial because there are none at all. And higher distality somehow characterizes, well, implies at least, it implies that working between generically stable types is sufficiently trivial up to the corresponding k. So it's a funny new way to think about what the study means again once you put it on the perspective of this all this hierarchical business. So how does it relate to complete an amalgamation or does it relate to the what what I was going to talk next, but I don't think I have time. Talk next, but I don't think I have time because a lot of interest in the talk. So I should stop, right? Okay, yeah, so I'll stop here. Questions? I have two. I asked a question. You can continue. Well, let me just state one fact. Let me just state one fact. I mean, this is connected to stationary TS in the sense that once you know all the subtypes, because everything commutes, right? So if you know all the, let's say, k subtypes, it determines the k plus 1 subtype by the thing I erase. Okay. But let me just mention one more connection of all of this business to indeed to hire. To indeed to st higher stationarity, which is part of this whole picture. This is a little theorem. Assume T is simple, so let me just state it, with simple with less or equal than four amalgamation, with four amalgamation, independent amalgamation, like in the usual sense, yeah, when you can amalgamate uh boundedly closed uh uh tuples. Tuples. So assume you have this, then the following equivalent T satisfies two uniqueness. T is two dependent. Three T is three levels. Is three less, let's say four is two stable for any definition of two stability. And if I think there is no actually we don't it seems unavoidable there will be multiple two stabilities. But that that that could be a longer discussion. That could be a long discussion. But any of them that you might have considered, they will all collapse. So, this result is a generalization of the very easy standard fact that stable and an IT coincide in simple theories. Once you have a non-stationary type, in a simple theory, you can produce the random graph. You can build an IT. Withness of IT. And this is a more complicated version of this. Yeah. I don't know if I actually. Yeah, I don't know if I actually mean this. I don't know if this is necessary, but I suspect it is. Anyway, I just want to mention this, yeah? So, these higher things they really connect to all these higher amalgamation and stationarity questions, at least in simple theories, and also should be the case in general, but not with respect to forking, but with respect to some higher notions of independence, higherity notions of independence, which don't exist yet. Not really. Yeah, so okay, so I just wanted to mention this. It's not exactly. I just wanted to mention this. It's not exactly what you were asking, but it mentions stationarity. And I wanted to say it. All right, thank you very much. I think you answered my first question. And stability. Instability is tricky. It's tricky, yeah. So, I mean, there are some variants in the literature defined by Takeuchi, by Terry and Wolf, Henry and me have a bunch. It seems there's like a whole lattice of notions. We actually know for a fact. Whole lattice of notions, we actually know for a fact that you cannot easily define them in a combinatorial manner, like by excluding some easy combinatorial configuration like a letter or something. But the theory is starting to emerge here somehow. So there's a whole, it's funny actually, that an idea was easy to generalize. Distality also seems like a very initial generalization. But for stability, it's actually not clear what the correct generalization is. I mean, as of now, so all of this needs to shake down a few of them. Any examples that? Well, any examples, special examples of distality? Of theories, which are in this tall. So the easiest example would be just take again any n-ary theory. Like take random n-hypergraph is going to be n plus 1 distal. But not n distal. If you mean like algebraic examples, actually in the case of multilinear forms, we haven't considered what happens here, for example. Here, for example. But those are essentially the only other examples of n-dependent theories that we have currently. And conjecturally, they might be the only ones. Look at the n-forms, they're n-dependent. Yeah. N plus one-dependent. So like bilinear form is two-dependent. Sorry, no, n, sorry. Like generic bilinear forms are two dependent, and the same holds for all the higher n. Do you say you don't know if they're n-distal? Well, assuming like the field is n-distal or something. mean like the field is in this or something yeah we haven't i i i mean i we haven't i haven't considered that i have actually a version of that for stability for higher stability like there is a composition lemma if you know what i'm talking about there's a composition lemma for higher for some versions of higher stability but not yeah for the study i don't consider this at all and for distal in fact we expect even stronger collapses than for n-dependent like any n-distal field should be already distal and we expect that even like for sufficiently rich groups already there should be a collapse Which groups already there should be a collapse. There should be concontamination, I think. But anyway, sorry. Here we jump in. I'm sorry.
