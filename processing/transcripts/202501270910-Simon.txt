If you just click that channel, it looks better. Thank you for your patience. We're very pleased to have Christopher Lloyd Seiben who will tell us about simple genetics and arithmetic services. Okay, well, thank you very much to the organizers for giving me this opportunity here to. This opportunity here to introduce you to the geometry of Markov numbers. So, as you saw while I was doing the manipulations, you can access these slides on my website if you've got a computer right now and you can't see them or if you want to switch back sometimes. But I should be going at a reasonable pace. And if there are any questions about something unclear, about internotations I'm using or whatever perfect features. A few features. Especially, I mean, I don't know, maybe there are some people who are blind, colorblind, and I'll be relying on slides, and so my speech may not match precisely the slides. So, feel free to okay. So, the title does not contain Markov in it, because I'm going to take the point of view of hyperbolic geometry, simple curves in arithmetic surfaces, and especially volume one, especially arithmetic surface. Problem one, special charithematic surface. And I'll actually especially take the point of view, a topological point of view, so from the point of view of Martin Glasswood dynamics and 21 approximation. Okay, so let's begin. So let's remind you the action of the modular group PSL2Z on the hyperpolic plane. So the modular group is generated by this element S of order 2, which is acting as a... That doesn't look red. Acting element of order 2 and element of order 3. So this is the Kayleigh-Klein projective model of the hyperbolic plane. You can see in brown the tribunal tree. The tribunal tree, which is due to the triangulation in forestry. So, a fundamental domain is this triangle here. I like this one, not the usual one. So, it's connecting infinity, zero, and this point J in the upper half plane is the sixth root of unity. And so, when you make the identifications of these two edges, you get the modular OV. These two edges, you get the modular OV4. Okay, and so you also find that PSL2Z is the free amalgam Z2 and Z3 generated by these cyclic circles. Okay, so the loops in the modular, the homotopy classes of loops in the modular orbifold, they correspond to the conjugacy classes in the modular group. And so you've got the elliptic classes. You've got the elliptic classes which surround the conical singularities, you've got the parabolic classes which surround the cusp, and then all the other ones they admit a unique hyperbolic geodesic in this homotopy class. Alright, and so I showed you a few pictures. And so the geodesic representative has got a certain length which is related to the trace or the discriminant of the matrix or lift of the matrix in effort. And so here you see some pictures of geodesics. You see, they can pass by the clinical singularity or not. So now let's go on to parametrizing conjugation classes of hyperbolic elements combinatorially. So the Euclidean, what I call the Euclidean monoid is PSL2N. So this is So, this is the projection of matrices in SL2 with non-negative entries. The projection is a bijection because you ask them to be positive. And so this is a free monoid on these two matrices, L and L. And this is given by the continuum fraction expansion. So that's how they act on the tree. And so what's nice is that every conjugate class of infinite order. Every conjugate class of infinite order, so either parabolic or hyperbolic, intersects PSL2N in the cyclic permutations of a unique word in L and R. So you should think hyperbolic conjugacy classes are cyclic words in L and R. And actually I said hyperbolic, it's hyperbolic if I only need there's at least and enough. Otherwise it's a power of R or a power of L. It's a power. Now let's remind you a bit of continuum fraction. So every real number greater or equal to one has a unique Euclidean continuum fraction expansion of this form, C0T1, with all of the CJ greater inputs form. Okay, you may be wondering about this unicity in the case of so how I wrote it here. So, how I wrote it here, I'm implicitly taking for rationals, I'm always taking the continuum fraction of even length. Okay, so it's important when we write continuum fractions with these matrices, R and L, that we take them of even length. So, starting with an R, ending with an L, so there's an even number of continues. Okay, so the sequence is finite if and only if the number is rational, it's periodic if and only if it's quadratic. It if and only if it's quadratic, and in that case, it's going to be fixed by this matrix here, this product which is in PSL to N. And the entries are bounded if and only if conjecturally gamma is either quadratic or transcendental. That's a conjecture which goes back to, well, I mean, it's a subtle finding out where it goes back to. So I gave you a reference here from Sharit on a survey on numbers. Survey on uh numbers with bounded um attributes. So um now the axis of so now let's take a matrix in PSL2N which starts with an R and ends with an L. So this means that its axis is going to have a fixed point which is greater than one, the attractive fixed point, and the repulsive fixed point is going to be between minus one and zero. One and zero. Or another way of saying it is that the repulsive fixed point, if you take the minus one over the repulsive fixed point, is strictly greater than R. Yes? Dumb questions. So in the first definition of that continuum fraction, we have R to the C0, L to the C1, dot dot dot, x down infinity. What's the meaning of that? Oh, you mean, what does it mean that I'm applying this matrix to infinity? So infinity is. matrix to infinity. So infinity is the point. So we are in, so actually go back here. So infinity is this point here. Right. Okay, and so the modular group is acting on the boundary of the hyperbolic plane. So which action act first? What do you mean which action? Do you act from left to right or from right to left? Oh, I'm acting from. So the first one, I'm acting from. I don't know what it means to left UI, but I'm starting with. Because there's an infinite many matrices. Yes, I'm taking the limit, exactly. So I'm taking, so I'm taking, so I've got an infinite quota of matrix. Any finite chunk gives you a well-defined image of infinity. It's like when you're taking the limit of continued fraction expansions. What does it mean that gamma is equal to C0 plus 1 over C1 plus 1 over plus dotted dots? What does the dotted dots mean? It means that you're taking. Dota dots means? It means that you're taking the limit of the finite chunk. And then what do you put? What does the dot dot dot? You replace the dotted dots by infinity. One over infinity is zero. So then it's a finite chunk. I think he's saying, like, is the limit, are the finite chunks, like, they always start at the far left? They start at zero, C0 plus one over C1 plus one over C2. So it's composition. It's like composition of functions. Right. So my question was: like, if you don't have So my question was like if you don't consider the limit of the product of matrices, yes, does it act like R to C0 first for? So no, I first act by L to C1, then by R. It's like functional function. It's a left action. Left action depends on the conventional set. It is bounded, it's equivalent to quadratic or transcendental. This means if it's quadratic and bounded, then it's quadratic, and if it's And bounded, then it's quadratic, and if it's not periodic and bounded, then it's transcendental. Yes, exactly. That's what it means, yeah. So if it's bounded, either it's periodic, in that case it's quadratic, or it's non-so another way to formulate it, if you're non-periodic, yet bounded, then you're transcendental, that's the conjecture. And you can be transcendental and not in that case. So actually I shouldn't put an equivalence. I should have put an implication. So this is one thing. Thanks for the polymer. Thanks for that. So, the conjecture is that if you've got bounded continuance, yet you're not periodic, then you should be transcendent. And that's going to be a very important theme in what's saying that low complexity should imply either strong rigidity, quadratic, degree two, or transcendence. Okay, so now if Okay, so now if we take an element in PSL to N, starting with an R, ending with an L, so you've got this axis, and these are the continued fashion expansions of the fixed points. So when I put a bar like this, it means it's periodic. Is there an example of a transcendental number with bounded? So that took some time to find, but yes, they are. I mean, no, an example of a transcendental. Uh no, an example of a transcendental refounded? Yes, that's uh yes, they are. And I refer you to Shari, this is a beautiful survey, and there are various, there are several sources, not that much, but there are. Some coming from communicates, paper folding, there are even generating functions which can give you so there's an infinite, there are infinite families, but they are not so I mean it's not very well not much, but there are some. Um right so and so the geodesic uh from the repulsive to the attractive fixed point intersects the triangulation according to the sequence area, which means that if you do if you cut the triangulation uh five times from the left and four times to the right, that these four and these five are giving you the continued fraction expansion. Okay, and so the first thing the first thing I want to mention is that the size of the of these continuants size of these continuants measure the depth of the first of the tenth excursion into the custom. So we're going to project these, so we take any geophysic in the hyperbolic plane and up to PSL2Z conjugacy we can assume that the attractive fixed point is bigger than one, the repulsive fixed point is between minus one and two. And then we're going to project it into the modular orbit full. It might be closed or non-closed, but then Non-closed, but then what are the CNs telling you? They're telling you how far you're going up into the cask. Okay, at the end excursion. Roughly speaking. Yes, I see some people shaking hands, but so let's be precise. If we consider the whole ball, so this is now in the upper half-plane model, everything which is of imaginary part bigger than h and some height, so this projects to a horrible neighborhood in the modulus. To a horrible neighborhood in the modular orbital of the cusp, and which has area 1 over h. So the geodesic from 0 to gamma, so I take this geodesic from 0 to gamma in the hyperbolic way. So this, when you project it in M, it penetrates this hollow ball each time n satisfies this inequality here. So basically you take the continued fraction starting at n. The continued fraction starting at n to infinity, so that's going to be the main part because it's cn plus something smaller than one. Here, this is smaller than one, but still it's kind of important. It's very important when you're looking at several properties of the how far you're going up. And so it penetrates to the ball at height h each time you've got this inequality here. This quantity appears all the time. So actually, let's define it. So actually let's define it. And so the the proof, if you like, is well if you start at n equals zero. And that height is the Euclidean height, yes? So this height, well here it's yes in the Euclidean height. This is in the upper half pair. So in this picture here, so you see you've got the gel zip from 0 to gamma. So gamma is between C0 and C0 plus 1. And so the height here is C0 over 2. And so it's between these two. It's between these two bytes here, and so it's going to penetrate any H here. Well, it's going to penetrate for H equals C0. And of course, C0 plus dot dot dots is greater than this 2 times C0, which and it's not going to penetrate C0 plus 1, but it's going to penetrate something in the middle, which is actually given by. Are actually given by. Okay. I mean, if you, the only quantity which is invariant under the action of PSL2C, you have to add the tail. Each time you shifting, you have to add the tail in the other direction. That's why this quantity here is appearing on the left. So you can make this as a good resource. It's the only quantity which is invariant by the action of the SLTC on R P one plus R P one on the diagonal. Diagonal. Right. But so this quantity is important. So this is actually the Lagrange constant of gamma. So it's the asymptotic, well actually the asymptotic height of the geodesic 0 gamma. So this is one way to define, precise way to define the Lagrange constant. So it's the Linth Sup of this quantity here. Okay, so this means the Lagrange constant of gamma is going to be greater than h. Gamma is going to be greater than h if and only if you're going to penetrate this power ball at height h infinitely many times. Not once, infinitely many times. So it's important to make the difference because that's the difference between Lagrange spectrum and Markov spectrum, or what I'll be calling Markov-Cohen spectrum. And this is equivalently the supremum of the number of L's such that alpha is close to a rational number. Close to a rational number at alpha is close to p over q, one over l times q squared for infinitely many pq. Okay, so these are two, it's quite easy to trade with. Okay, so what values can it take? I mean, many people in this room are specialists and are studying this kind of question. What are the values of the Lagrange spectrum? So, well. spectrum. So well and I would like I mean the theme here is going to be bounding size and pattern complexity of this sequence and relating them to geophysics, complexity of geophysics in the modular Obivol. So it's rational if and only if L dam is 0 and for alpha irrational well it has to be at least this thing which is just once which is root 5. Okay and then if L is great a small If L is greater is smaller than 3, then the CJs, asymptotically, you can show that they have to be smaller than 2. And the sequence CJ has to have very low complexity. This is kind of motivation for what's coming now. Actually, not quite now. I just want to say one thing because this is going to come up in some of the talks and I like this topic. So we're looking Magnus topic. So we're looking at PSL2Z inside of PSL2R. When we've got a lattice in the Library to understand its geometry, it's good to take deformation, to deform a little bit the lattice and see how things vary. So deformation space of PSL2Z, so the space of faithful and discrete representations of PSL2Z into PSL2R up to PSL2R contributes here at the target. So this is primarily. So, this is parameters by one number, which is the distance between the fixed point of S and the fixed point of T. This fixed point there. If you like, and you're allowed only to pull them apart, because you want it to be discrete. Another way to parameterize it, which I like very much, and which is essentially equivalent to the Buhal square representation, is to send your two matrices to deform your matrices L and R by putting Q and Q inverse. R by putting q and q inverse on the diagram. And now q can be any real number. Geometrically, what's happening when you take the quotient by this, if you take the subgroup generated by these two elements, then you get either PSL2Z if 2 is 1 or something which is a free group on, well not free group, sorry, it's going to be, I mean it's always isomorphic to PSL2Z. But when you take the quotient, you can get either a cusp or a funnel, and the length And the length of the unique geology here is related to Q by this expression. Okay, and so once you've done that, I mean, you can now consider your favorite matrix in PSL to Z. Take the Q deformation, so you take you write it as a product of L and R's. Replace all the R L by L Q, all the R by R Q, so you get a U matrix. It's got polynomial entries in Q and Q inverse. Entries in Q and Q inverse, and then you can compute the fixed point as repulsive and attractive, and that's how you get numbers which are the Q-deformed numbers. Those were introduced in papers by Maurier Jenou and Valentin Oshenko and some of their collaborators. And that's how I like to view them. You deform the representation and then you take the Representation and then you take the fixed points, those are the future forms. And these appear probably in some of your thoughts. Corresponds to opening up the cusp to the length of the unique geologic here is given by this parameter. So there's one parameter information. Yes. Okay, so now let's go to the modular tools. Okay, so now let's go to the modular tools. Let's see how much time. I've got a clock here. Okay, good. So the modular tool, so now let's consider the abelianization of PSL2Z. So PSL2Z is Z2 amalgam Z3, so the abelianized abelianization goes to Z2 times Z3. And this corresponds to the colour cover of the modular orbit. The Gala cover of the modular orbifold by a surface with Galois group T mod 6, and this surface turns out to be a punctured torus. So if you identify opposite sides here, what you get is a torus with a puncture. It's your favorite modular torus, if you've already seen it. And so its fundamental group is the derived subgroup of PSA2Z, so PSA2Z'. And it's a free on two generators, which I will call X and Y. Called X and Y. This X is the commutator of two generators in PSL2Z, which turns out to be LR. And Y is the other commutator, which is RL. And so those are the two matrices, 1112, 2111. If you're familiar with literature, that's Kuhn started looking at this precisely in relation with Markov numbers, these two matrices here. But that's how I like to see it. You take the derived diabetes. The derived the ability analyzation, and that's your colour, the modular torus. And so if you take now, I want to mention, if you take the ability analyzation again, so you've got a punctured torus. How do you understand, so we want to understand geodesics in the punctured torus. Okay, so let me, let me, I should mention the game. What's the game? The game is we've got geodesics here. The orbifold has, I mean, it's got orbifold points. It's hard to understand geodesics here. Side geologists here. So, what we're going to play, either closed or non-closed geodesics, we're going to lift them in the modular torus. And if you want to understand geodesics in a punctured torus, it's good to go to, well, if you had filled the puncture, you could take the universal cover and get a plane. A universal cover of a torus is the plane. And here, just if you fill in the puncture, so if you don't fill in the puncture, you get a puncture. It's not the universal puncture. Punctured colour. It's not the universal colour, it's the universal obedient colour. So we're going to lift now the geodesics from the torus to the universal obedient colour. So group theoretically speaking, you're just taking the abelianization map of the fundamental group of the functions. So let me mention that m prime, since m is the modular orbifold, and m prime is obtained by one aberrionization, so that's the modular tolls. So that's the modular torture. So this is m prime. I'm going to take the organization again. So m track five. So this is going to be a plane punctured along a lattice. This lattice has Z6 mod6 symmetry, so it's a hexagonal or equi-anarmonic lattice. It's the these triangles, so these are the these points 0, 1, infinity, these are projecting to the cusp and they are These are projecting to the cusp and they are equilateral triangles. Okay, so if you want to say, I mean, there are various ways of describing this cover here. So M prime prime, which is this one, covers M prime. And the Galois group is the abelianization of the fundamental group of the torus, which is C2. And what's the cover from the hyperbolic plane to this one? So this is given by, well, it's given by. Well, it's given by a second-derived subgroup of the modular group, and this is a free group on an infinite number of generators. You can view them as all loops based, say, at this point here and going around all the cusps. And that's the cover here. And you can also go from here to the plane here by taking the Jacobi integration map, based at the test. Okay, and this identifies. And this identifies this m time frame here with the homology with real coefficients of the torus, except that you have to take out all the cusps. And the cusps you can identify with the elements in homology which have integral coefficients. Okay, so I have a closed cycle. So real cycles that you take out all these gas and these. Which you take out all these cusps, and these cusps are the integral circles. So I realize that this is maybe a bit technical and maybe not in everyone's background. So if there are any questions, why should you ask? Okay, so the game, we've got now, we had geodesics and the modular surface, now they're in the toys, and it's good to think of them in the universal avenue and competition. It's helpful. So let me mention just one fun proposition that I found in my thesis. Found in my thesis, I'm surprised that it had never been, I mean, not to my knowledge mentioned anyway, is that if you take the modular group gamma and you derive by the second derived subgroup, so this is the automorphism group of this surface here. And so this projects to Z mod 6, this gamma mode, gamma prime, and the kernel is Z squared. And this is a split exact sequence, which means that the obvious thing we Which means that the obvious thing, which is what is the symmetry group of this thing, it's the hexagonal group of isometries. The isometries, the Euclidean isometries, affine isometries of a Euclidean matrix, which is the semi-direct product of Z2 and Z6. Okay, so you've got this Z plus Z, okay, which are I would like to write the coordinates in indices, Z plus Z, semi-direct product, Z two times Z3. Z2 times Z3. And what does this DS and this DT here mean? It means that the acting, it's the action of S by conjugation and the action of T. And the D10 stands for the interest, the entire day interest, but I mean it's consistent with what's coming late. Okay, so it's just usual style graphic group of the hexagonal lattice. Right. I'll come back to this if I've got time. At the end, you mention some new results. Okay, so now I want to describe this correspondence between Markov numbers and simple geodesics in the module topics. So in the function toss, you can take any geodesic and you can ask the question what are the geodesics of which geodesics are simple? Simple means they they do not have any uh self-intersections. Self-intersections. And closed? Closed and simple. Closed or maybe not. Either closed or not closed. So closed will correspond. So, and what do I mean by what are the geodesics? I mean, take your geodesic in the modular torus, lift it into the hyperbolic plane, look at the fixed points. What are these numbers? So that's the game. We've got a geodesic in the modular surface. We want it to lift in the modular towards a simple geodesic, closed or not closed. Simple geodesic, close or not closed, and when it's simple, we want to look what are the endpoints and what are the continued fractions of these endpoints. These are going to be our Markov numbers when they're closed. That's the touch mark, but I'm going to repeat this. So actually, this is a proof. So the loops in M' they correspond to conjugacy classes in this frequencie. So the cyclic words on extra one. On x and y. Okay, so we've got this free group on T-genuators, which is the fundamental group of the ducture tools. The simple loops, they correspond to primitive vectors in this lattice, in the H1. Okay, so they correspond to, so for each slope, you've got, for each primitive vector in that lattice, you've got a slope, and you've got a simple geology. And the basis of that free group, or if you like, the basis of that lattice, there are in correspondence. Of that lattice, they are in correspondence, they correspond to pairs of simple loops in the function toys which have one intersection point. Okay, so basis of the free group or the homology, it's two simple geodesics in the toys which have one intersection. Okay, so you can think of the usual basis. And you've got the action of the mapping glass group by Dane twists, or if you like the auto-automorphism group of this free group, or if you like GL2C, acting on Acting on these bases. And so it sends SL to Z and it's generated by these two Dane twists. Now this is all the heart of the matter here, is that these two, if I do a Dane twist along the curve X or a Dane twist along the curve Y, how is it changing the geodesic encoded in terms of a product of X and Y? It's changing Y into Yx. Changing y into yx or x into xy. Okay. Okay, so we've got relations between these data, which are given by the rate relations. And now, so you've got this substitution monolith here. So I think, so dx and dy, they freely generate SL of SL2 of this of SL. XLNG. Okay, but now it's the free monoid. It's now that we're now thinking in the mapping class group. We're not thinking at the fundamental group level. This kind of SL2Z is appearing twice. It's appearing when we're doing PSL2Z, but now let's forget about this one. Now we've got a free group on two generators, X and Y, but now we're thinking of SL2Z as the mapping class of folks. Okay? And so it's acting on these geographics by substitution. Okay, so now the question is: which cyclic words on x and y correspond to simple loops in a prime? How do we find that? So we take a primitive vector in z squared, which is the slope, and we want to find what's the cyclic word with that slope in x and y. So what do we do? So what do we do? We decompose. So technically what I'm asking is for is the cyclic word on xy, which is a simple geodesic, which is homological to xp, x2 to p, y2 to the p. Okay, so how do I do? So I expand p over q into a containing fraction expansion. And up to the z6 and symmetries of the tolls, I can assume that p is greater than q is greater than 0. P is greater than Q is greater than 0. So I expand it into a continuous fraction. Now I act, so now I know that the matrix R0 dot dot dot L to the C2N plus 1, it sends the basis of our hours to the basis that we're looking for. That this basis contains the loop we're looking for. And so we act by the Dane twist and we replace R by Y We replace R by Y, L by X, and we act by the same product of the interests by substitution on the basis we had at the beginning, which is YX. And then what do we get? We're going to get two words. And the first word we're looking for is p of Q. Okay, so you start with Y, and you start applying these substitutions here. So you first apply dx CK times. So you're going to replace Y by xy. To replace y by xy or x by xy, and you continue. By the way, question: I don't know if it's an open, I mean, I think it's an exercise, but I don't know if there's a closed formula for finding what's the length in X and Y of this word. I give you PQ, and I ask you what's the XY length, the combinatorial length of that word. I don't know, maybe it's in Martin Egner's book. Either it's an exercise or it's a conjecture that maybe. It's an exercise, or it's a conjecture that maybe you've got simple combinatorial length spectrum. I don't know. But I was thinking about that just while I was doing the slides, and I thought, oh, combinatorially, I don't, I mean, you can write the recursion. It's not, it's not, I didn't find a nice formula in five minutes. So it seems like, I don't know. Can you repeat the question, please? So, what's the question? So, I give you PQ, I give you a slope in the torus, and I'm looking for the unique word in X and Y, so in the fundamental group, which is giving you. The fundamental group, which is giving you this simple geodesic. So I'm applying these substitutions here into x and y. What is the length of that word? So you can write a recursive formula. So each time, so first you look at, you've got, each time you're adding how many intersections you've got with the x direction, and each time you're adding the intersection number. The intersection number. Yes. And so, but it's recursive. It's kind of, you've got this co-cycle kind of. And when you make the whole thing, I mean, you have to remember all the numbers before. I don't see a nice formula. Maybe it's given by some the evaluation of a continuant polynomial. Yeah. It should be just P plus Q. I was thinking, oh, it's P plus Q. No, it's not that. I mean, do it as an EC exercise on a very short thing, you'll see it blows up way faster. And P plus Q is a big. People are squeezed because there's this confusion between the two SL2Zs appearing. It's not. Should be nothing related to the Markov number in position. It should be. It should be. I mean, if the. So I'm wondering if there's not already a combinatorial simple spectrum. Maybe there's not a combinatorial simple spectrum, but it's already narrowing. Maybe there are questions. Maybe the question. So I find this is a fun question. Maybe I'm not enough aware of the literature, and this has already been considered, but I think it's a fun thing to look at. Okay, so now we've got our simple geodesics in terms of x and y. Now let us remember who is x and who is y. X is L R and Y is R L. So you just replace X by R L and by L R and then you find the continued fraction expansions of the fixed points. Continued fractional expansions of the fixed points. And so these kind of sequences that we get from this process, applying substitutions of that kind to that, those are, if you like, it's your definition of Stammian sequence. That's going to be my definition for the talk. These are Stamin sequences. They've got many other definitions, but I encourage you to quantity all there. But these are Stomming sequences. And so the simple closed loops, those are the periodic Stomen sequences. The periodic Stomachian sequences. So A0 and A1, the fixed points. If you take a simple geodesic in the torus, you lift it in the hyperbolic plane, you look at the fixed points, you look at the continued fraction expansions, you've got the Schurman sequences on Q and mods. And it's periodic, if and only if it's quadratic. Otherwise, it's not quadratic. But it's still a simple geodetic. But it's still a simple geodesic. Okay, so now let me define the Markov chrome constant of a geodesic in the hyperpolar plane up to the action of the SLTZ. So it's actually a geodesic in the modular orbital. So it's going to be the infimum height such that your geodesic intersects the ball. So before we were taking the Lim Suk, we wanted to penetrate the ball infinitely many times. Penenrate the ball infinitely many times. Now, as soon as we're penetrating this ball, we're taking the largest neighborhood of the cusp, which avoids your geodesic. Okay, that's going to be the Markov-Common constant. And so now it's the soup, a turning soup of this quantity here. So it's a straight list to a geologist. And so, theorem, which follows from Theorem, which follows from the works of Haas building on Kohn. So simple loops in M' or simple geodesics. So you take two geodesic, two numbers in RP1, not both rational, and the following are equivalent. So the geodesic is simple, respectively simple and closed. The sequence is Stomian on 1 and 2, respectively Sturmian and periodic, and the cusp height, or And the cusp height, or the Markov constant, is between root 5 and 3. Respectively, strictly smaller than 3, if you want it to be closed. So the closed one are strictly beneath 3. So this is saying that the ones which are non-closed have exactly three. So the ones if you take a Schurman sequence which is not periodic, what's the height? It's getting precisely at three. Getting precisely at 3. And furthermore, so if it's strictly smaller than 3, so there are conjugate projected groups of Markov forms. And let me give you a new result, or it's not really new, but it's just putting everything together. If it's equal to 3, then there are chances are metal. This actually follows from work of Halouch. Adushaboni Keferek It'll come back. So this work here is showing that when you've got a very low, I mean when you've got a Stomian sequence on ones and two, which is not periodic, it has to be transcendental. And the idea, what's the idea here, is that these numbers are two. These numbers are too well approximated by Markov numbers, which are quadratic numbers. And the spirit is when you've got a number which is very well approximated by rational numbers or quadratic numbers, numbers with bounded degree, then if you're too well approximated by something of bounded degree, you cannot be alibi. You have to be transparent. This is the spirit of the Schmitzer-space theorem. Much broader generalization of this thing. And I want to mention, I mean, I'm using this a lot in what I'm going to, question I'm going to ask at the end. So since my job is to kind of introduce you to the geometry of Markov numbers and not just Markov quadratics, I feel obliged to give you this slide, which I'm actually very pleased to do. So let's mention geometric interpolation of the geometric geometric interpretation of the unicity conjecture for the Markov spectrum or of Markov numbers. So if you take, so let's pause for a moment, let's take any two matrices in SL2. SL2 or any commutative ring as you like. I know that some people in the audience are going to give talks on FP, on maybe FP brackets in a field of functions, like any commutative ring. Commutative group. And so you denote C plus or minus equals A times B plus or minus. Okay? And so we've got this trace relation, the product of the two traces is equal to the sum of the two traces. Trace of AB plus trace of AB defense. So this is by the K the Hamilton relation. So if you're used to using this trace of AB, so trace of AB Of AB, so trace of A, trace of B, trace of AB here, and trace of AB. If that actually makes sense to you, good. If it doesn't, I'll be reappearing. And then you've got the trace of the commutator, which is sum of the so that's true whether you have a plus or a minus, so uh choose your pick, let's take plus. The sum of the three choices minus the product minus two. Minus the product minus two. Okay, so that's the commutator relation. And so now let's take two elements in PSL2R. And so you take the so and you suppose that they generate a free group which is fake which is discrete and when do you get a quotient which is a torus with a whole? So Toys with a hole, so either a cusp or an open hole, this is if and only if the commutator is smaller or equal to minus two. And when you get a cusp, this is if and only if you've got equality. Okay, so pairs of matrices which satisfy trace of the combinator equals minus two, these are the tori with a tuncture. Okay, so a whole but which is a custom. Okay, so now let's relate the basis of the hyperbolic function toi to Markov numbers. So now let's think of m prime, m prime is our function torus, but now just let's think of it topologically. You can deform the representation if you. But if you don't like But if you don't like the form of representation, take that one. That's good enough. And you take any basis, two loops with one intersection or basis of the homology, and you take the third loop to be the product of the two. Well, if you prefer the dainted twists of one around the other, same thing. So this gives you two other bases. So if you take a basis, and then you've got two other bases, this pair here and this pair. This pair here and this pair here. We've got two other bases. And so the commutator of any two elements in the bases is always giving you a loop around the curst. And so if you take the traces of these three elements, it's called the super base by Conway in his little quadratic form book. So these satisfying. Book. So these satisfy some of the squares equals the product. So what's the moral? Take a basis, a super basis, so a basis with either the product or the product with the n plus, this gives you a solution to the Markov qubit. For any representation of a 5 group on 2 generators, such that the quotient is a punctured torus. Now, for our favorite punctured torus, which is Favorite functor toys, which is the equivalentharmonic one, which is the one given by the divide subgroup of PSF2Z, we get all the integral solutions of the Markov cubic. So, and how do you get them? We start with the trace of three elements, x, y, and x, y inverse, which are 3 through 3, and you act by the And you act by the mapping class group. The mapping class group action, which is SL2, I mean SLZX plus Zy, it changes these three traces to, if you take the element, the action of S or the action of T, so this is the Vieta involution. So S is acting by the Vieta involution, so it's changing the C plus and the C minus, and T is doing this cyclic permutation here. Okay? So these yield all the integral solutions to the Markov conjecture. Okay, and so Markov conjecture now can be formulated with what we said before, is that since we know that the trace of an element is giving you the length of the geobasic, so Markov's unicity conjecture is can be reformulated in terms of the simplicity of the spectrum. The spectrum, either the length spectrum or the height spectrum, by what we have seen in the previous experiments. So, how high you go, and that's an interpretation which I had not known before in these things, is that the height spectrum is also related to the length. And I know that there's another part which is the twist, but I'm not talking about that, of simple loops. Okay, so this means that if Okay, so this means that if you've got two simple geodesics in a modular surface, if they've got the same length, then they're in the same orbit under the mod 6 action and reflection action. That's the conjecture. Or if they've got the same height. I just wanted to mention that the Q variable spectrum is known. So if you take the trace, if you take the Q deformations and you take the trace, And you take the trace as a polynomial in Q, this has been proven quite recently, a company member in Mix Paper, that you've got simplicity of that spectrum. So the polynomial which is encoding more than just the length, it's encoding the length of all simple geodesics in the punctured torus, and you're doing this, you're opening the cusp of the punctured torus. If you allow yourself to open the cusp of the punctured torus and you keep track of the length. And you keep track of the lengths of the expansion, I mean the polynomial which is encoding the lengths of all nearby toy, then you can pinpoint the geodesic. You know this polynomial which is giving you the x of nearby toy. For the precise one, it's open. Does that make sense? Well when q is what you don't want simplicity, right? What like simplicity up to isometries or something? Isometries or simplicity up to the Z6. So when you deform it, you still have a Z6 atom. Yes, because you're deforming only the cusp. You're still keeping the equi-anharmonic symmetry, but you're only opening the cusp. In other terms, the deformation factors through the... So we've got the torus which colours the modular orbifold. This is the deformation that I had before. I'm lifting this deformation of the modular orbifold to the modular torus. To the modular torques. So now this open function toy, I mean hold toy, that's what I mean by hold toy, is covering the modular orbifold with the open custom. So it's still got this zeemot fixed signature. But you could also do more deformations and deform uh either keep the whole and deform in the moduli space of whole vector toi. Now you've still got solutions to the genuine Markov cubic. Genuine Markov cubic, this one. So when you open the cusp, I should mention that these are not points of the Markov cubic like this. Now you've got a plus a constant. And this constant depends on the cube, on how much you've opened. This constant is the length, I mean it's the trace of the commutator plus two. Trace of the commutator is giving you the length of how much you're opening. So there are two ways to reform it. If you're allowed to open the cusp, we know the simplicity of the curse. The cusp, we know the simplicity of the spectrum. So I'd say we, I mean, sorry, I can't remember the reference exactly, but I can dig it out. But it's quite recent. Sorry, and you require that the polynomial and q, right? Yeah. Yeah, if you've got the same trace polynomials, fricker polynomials, or whatever you want to call them, then you have to be the same up to using all things. Okay, so generally. So generalizing to other arithmetic surfaces. So I thought it a bit late, so I guess I'll generalize this Markov picture of simple geodesics, either your quadratic or your transcendental. And I want to generalize to you other arithmetic surfaces. So this is ongoing work, and I'm Work and I'm working hard on it, but I want to give you the spirit. So I want to generalize this conjecture, which is so have this quadratic transcendence dichotomy in arithmetic surface. So take your favorite arithmetic surface. It might be an harmonic bunch of colours. It might be, you take a modular, the modular, a congruent sub, a congruent subgroup of the modular group, and you take the congruence cost. Group, and you take the congruence cover of the modular orbital, and then you're looking at geodesics in there, and you take a geodesic which is simple and which does not escape into a surface and which is not asymptotic to a close geodesic. So, not like this. This one, this arithmetic surface here, that has no crust. There are such arithmetic surfaces. I'm not going to describe them now. But the conjecture is that if you're not asymptomatic, But the conjecture is that if you're not asymptotic to a cusp, because if you're asymptotic to a cusp, then you're gonna let me save the conjecture. If you're not asymptotic to a cusp or to a close geodesic, then you take the lift of your geodesic in the upper half plane and you look at its ends in RP1. So you take one of these uh B's here of this uh uh yeah, you take one of them and they have to be transcendental. Transcendental. Okay? So, where's the dichotomy? Sorry, I should say transcendental. Yeah, so if you take something which is a close geodesic, you're going to be quadratic over the field of definition, over the invariant trace field of your arithmetic group. Basically, because you so you've got your matrices, so your your it's a subgroup of ESL2R. It's a subgroup of ESL2R. It's got entries in real, totally real field, number field, and you need to take quadratic extensions to write the fixed points, just because you've got the square root where you can write the fixed points. If you're skipping into a cusp, you're actually going to be in the field itself. So either you're rational over that field, or you're quadratic over that number field, or you have to be trusted. What's the idea? What's the idea? Is that you too well approximated by numbers in that number field, by algebraic numbers? So the idea is to use this mapping class group symmetry. The symmetry of the mapping class group and its dynamics are saying that if you've got a simple geodesic, you kind of almost invariant by elements in the mapping class group. Another way of thinking about that. So if you almost invariant, Thinking about that. So, if you're almost environed by things in the mapping class group, you're going to have very low complexity. You've got this substitution monoid, the mapping class group, which is acting by substitution, and you're going to have very low combinatorial complexity. And then, with this very low combinatorial complexity, you'll be able to, as in the paper of Alush Kefferek, show that you actually too well approximated, actually, not in the paper of Arush Keferek. Using this low combinatorial complexity, then you're Low combinatorial complexity, then you apply the Schmidt subspace theorem to show that you're too well approximated by elements in your number field, and then you deduce transcendence. So that's the idea. So I want to, so that's what I would say here: strategy and philosophy of the proof. So topological symmetry leads by the action of multi-classical symmetries or dynamics, if you prefer. Classical symmetries or dynamics, if you prefer to. Low symbolic complexity, if you encode your geodesics in the fundamental loop, and this leads, yeah, this just mids of the space theorem to some hyperformatic rigidity. Either you have to be quadratic or you have to be short-sement over your immigration. So that's a conjecture that I'm made and that I'm working on. And one last thing I wanted to mention is Is similar to it, but it's now take your favorite examples. Take the congruence subgroups. These are giving you these congruence covers. And I want to ask you the question, what are the simple real quadratic numbers of level N? What does that mean? Which geodesics in the modular Obifold lift to a simple geodesic in the congruence cover of level N? Congruence cover of level n. So these are certain quadratic numbers. So now we're taking congruence covers. So these are certain quadratic numbers. And you could express them quite easily in terms, or quite easily I'm exaggerating, but you can find certain, you know what are the discriminants in terms of the level, but some are going to be simple and some are going to be not simple. The simple ones should have very low complexity, they're the analog of the Markov numbers, but the Markov numbers. But the Markov numbers in the congruence colour of red. And so the question is: what are these numbers? And so I want to specialize even because, I mean, it's good to have examples. I want to even take my favorite, favorite convent colours, which are the ones which have gena zero. These are the platonic solids. So if you take n equals three, four, or five, so for n equals three, you've got So for n equals three, you've got a cover of uh by the tetrahedron. So these are uh drawings of the tetrahedron, the octahedron, the acutahedron. So for three, four, five, you get CP1 minus the regular tetrahedron. So what do I mean by you get these? It means that the cusps are the vertices of these of these platonic soils. So you've got a simple geologic here, and now what is the math? And now, what is the mapping class group? It's a break group. It's the braid group on, it's a spherical grade group. It's a break group on, spherical grade group on four strands group on three, on four, six, and eleven, but it's uh if you want to fix one functure, if you get the pure grade group, you get on three, five, eleven. You get on three, five, yeah, which is the dimension of the colour homology of this colour. Okay? Yeah. You you could ask your question also just about the integers, right? What are the traces of the curves that list? Exactly. And so I'm asking what are these quadratic, but then you can ask the Markov numbers, the analog of the Markov numbers, what are the traces? Do you also have, can you also have a picture, everything that's going to be said about in this conference, about cluster algebras, about these. In this conference, about cluster algebras, about these relations, this Markov, I mean, the relations about these numbers, what do they become for these covers? I mean, I expect that you've got some nice things which hold for all alphabetic surfaces, but I expect that it should be especially nice for convents covers and really nice for these ones. Everyone expects, I guess. I mean, it's our constant. And especially, actually, for this one, I started thinking about it, so I thought about this question while I'm writing these slides. For this one, actually. Slides. For this one, actually, there's a combinatorial parametrization which is, I think, isomorphic to Sturmian sequences. But now, when you do the translation in the alphabet, it's not x goes to LR and Y goes to RL. You have to look at the presentation of gamma 3 and you can parametrize them by Strangeman sequences, but the contain fractions themselves, it's going to be maybe like you replace your generators by a certain block, which is a A certain block which is uh RRL and LRR. And then you get once you've done this translation, you don't get strong sequences in L and R, but they're parametric. So they've still got low complexity, and it's kind of the first next step to look at. Okay, so my time is over, so I finished that. Any other questions? There were many questions, many things to discuss. We've had a coffee break, and we will start again at 10.30 in 20 minutes. So you can access my slides on my website. And if you're curious, there's an additional bonus which I can talk about in the course.
