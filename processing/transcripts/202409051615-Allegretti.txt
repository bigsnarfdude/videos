So, my title is Skane Algebras and Quantized Coulomb branches and This talk will be based on joint projects with Hung Shang and more recently Kyung Kyu Kim And the idea is based on, well, it's based on some physics idea, so I'd like to begin by telling you a bit about that. So we'll begin with the physical motivation. So the idea is this. One can start with Uh Riemann surface, which I'll call S. And there is a construction in physics which takes the Riemann surface and produces some kind of physical theory, which I'll denote like this. I'll call it T. And in fact, it depends on more than just the surface. It also will depend on a choice of Lie algebra, which I will take to be SL2. And this is a 4D n equals 2 quantum field theory. It's what we call a theory of class S. This kind of theory was first constructed by Gaiato around 2012, or at least that's when the paper was published. And it was studied. And it was studied in great detail by Gayato, Moore, and Nitsky shortly after that. So we'd like to study this theory, but unfortunately, this is not a mathematically defined thing. This is a physical idea. And so instead, what we'll do is. Instead, what we'll do is look at various associated objects that can be defined mathematically. And one of these things is a space, which I'll denote MC. And this is called the Coulomb branch of the theory T of S L two S on On R3 times S1. So there is some kind of physical construction that produces this space from a Riemann surface and this Lie algebra, which we take to be SL2. And what is this space? So there is a proposal which I can, which I will credit to Gayato Moronitzky. That this Coulomb branch, MC, is something more or less like the SL2 character variety of the surface S. And I will define this precisely later. And in fact, one could take that to be the definition of. In fact, one could take that to be the definition of the Coulomb branch in this case, but there is a possibly better way to approach this. So more recently, Roberman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima have proposed a general definition. A general definition of the Coulomb branch of a gauge theory under a certain assumption. So they give a mathematical definition of the Coulomb branch under some assumption. Uh under some assumption. And so you could ask, well, is it possible to relate that to this answer given by Gayato Mornitsky? And that will be the goal of this talk. So we would like to relate. The character variety of the surface to this Braverman-Finkelberg Nakajima Coulomb branch. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Okay, so so in fact, what they mainly discuss in the paper is a What they mostly talk about is the Coulomb branch of a 3DN equals 4 theory. And we're really going to be talking about a variant of that definition, which is also mentioned in their paper, called the K-theoretic Coulomb branch. Thank you. So let me begin now by just So let me begin now by just reviewing what we need to know about the SL2 character variety. So I said that S, the data that you start with to get this physical theory is a Riemann surface. In fact, we A Riemann surface. In fact, we don't need any complex structure, so we'll just take S to be some compact-oriented surface with boundary. And then we can define the SL2 character variety as follows. Variety as follows. So the SL2 character variety of S is the following scheme. It will be denoted like this, so I'll call it M flat because this could be considered as a moduli space of SL2 flat connections on the surface. But I'll use the following description. I take the set of group homomorphisms from the fundamental group of S into SL2. Into SL2. Now that has the natural structure of an affine scheme, and so we can take the GIT quotient by the conjugation action of SL2 on homomorphisms. So that's the definition. And we'll be interested in the, yes. Yeah, but we'll be able to do that. Uh yeah, but we view SL2 as a group scheme, so uh you mean SL2 C. Okay. Yeah, and usually we take complex points, so yeah, yeah. Um so we'll mainly be interested now in the the ring of functions on this space. So let me tell you what that looks like. So the algebra of Of regular functions is generated by the following set. This set consists of functions that I'll call tr gamma. And here gamma means the homotopy class. Class means a homotopy class of loops on S. And so, what is what is TR gamma? It means the following. It means the following. So it's a function on the character variety, meaning you take a representation of the fundamental group, and what it does is it gives you the trace of rho of gamma. So here again, rho is a point in the character variety, or a representation of the fundamental group, and we're just evaluating it on gamma and taking the trace of that. On gamma and taking the trace of that matrix. So I claim that that set generates all regular functions on the character variety. Now, we're usually interested in surfaces with boundary, and in that case, it's natural to do the following. So rather than consider the character variety defined in this way, we will We will consider some variant of that, namely, let's let gamma one through gamma n be loops on the surface, elements of the fundamental group. And let's suppose these are freely homotopic to the boundary components of the To the boundary components of the surface. Okay, and then we will also specify a vector, which I denote lambda. And its components will be lambda 1 through lambda n. So this is a vector. Lambda n. So this is a vector of non-zero complex numbers. And once we specify that, we can define the so-called relative character variety. As follows. So it will be denoted like this: m flat, and then let me put lambda here. This will be a subscheme of the character variety that I've already defined. Namely, Uh, namely this is the closed subscheme defined by setting these trace functions equal to some fixed complex numbers. So you have one of these trace functions. You have one of these trace functions corresponding to each of the boundary curves, and we will require that this function is identically lambda i plus lambda i inverse, where i goes from 1 to n. Okay, so that's usually what we'll be interested in when we have a surface with boundary. Boundary. So, the goal is to relate that somehow to one of these k-theoretic Coulomb branches. And in fact, we're going to get not only a relationship between those spaces, but also between their quantized algebras of functions. So, I'll tell you now what that is in the case of this character variety. It will be something called the skein algebra. The skein algebra. And this is defined as follows. So first of all, let me write L A of S to mean the free C adjoin A plus minus one. Join a plus minus one module generated by isotopy classes of framed links. In S times 0, 1. So from the surface, you construct this three-manifold. And then within that three-manifold, you look at knots and links. And framing means that at each point of a link, you're choosing a tangent vector that is not tangent to the link. It lives in the tangent space of the ambient 3. In the tangent space of the ambient three-manifold, but not the tangent space of the link. And then we consider such things up to ambient isotopy in the three-manifold. Now, this thing is actually, it actually has the structure of an algebra. So to see that, let's suppose that L1 and L2 And L2 are some framed links in S times 0, 1. So if those are framed links, then I will write L1 prime to mean the link obtained from L1 by applying an isotope. By applying an isotopy, so it's L1 isotoped to lie in S times the interval from 0 to 1 half. So you can just move the link so that it lies in the one half of this three manifold. And similarly, I'll define L. And similarly, I'll define L2 prime to mean the link L2 isotope to lie in S times the interval from 1 half to 1. So we can always do that. I'll explain in a moment. I mean, it's a formal variable. So this is just a ring of Laurent polynomials. So we're considering. Polynomials. And we, so we're considering linear combinations over that ring. And then the way we get a product on this module is as follows. We get a product on On this module, by the following rule. So you take the class, the isotopy class of L1 and the isotopy class of L2, and their product is defined to be the isotopy class of the union of L1 prime and L2 prime. So you've moved these links so that they're living in different parts of the three-manifold. In different parts of the three-manifold, and then take their union. And this will be well defined on isotopy classes. And by extending bilinearly, we get a product on this module. In fact, this is not quite the algebra we want to consider, though. So the real definition is the following. We define the Kaufman bracket Skein algebra, or usually we just call this the Skein algebra to be this thing, so it's denoted SK. So it's denoted SK of S with a subscript to remind us the name of the parameter A. And this is defined to be the quotient of this algebra L A of S, and this is the same. Of S by the following relations. So the first one can be, I can tell you what it is like this. So what I have drawn here, this circle, which I'll shade, is some small neighborhood on the surface. Small neighborhood on the surface. And we'll suppose that we have a link whose projection in this neighborhood looks like this. Right? So you have two parts of the link that are projecting into this neighborhood, and they have a crossing. And if that is what your framed link looks like, and here we Framed link looks like, and here we, maybe I should, well, I'll say this in a moment. So, so if this is what the projection looks like, then we're gonna have a relation of this form. So, here's another picture of the same region on the surface, and we resolve in this way. And here's another picture of this region. Picture of this region, and we resolve in the other possible way. So, what I mean here is that I'm talking about some framed link in S times 0, 1. They are assumed to be identical in these three pictures outside of the region that I've drawn. And they differ in that region as I've shown it here. Then there's a second relation that we impose, which says if you have an embedded unknot, so if you have a region on the surface where the projection of the link looks like that, then you can remove this component and you have to multiply the resulting thing by minus a squared. by minus a squared plus a to the minus two. So that's defining relations. I said though these uh generators are framed lengths. They have to have some smooth choice of tangent vectors at every point. And so what is that supposed to be in these pictures? I'm assuming here. Pictures, I'm assuming here that all the links I've drawn have the so-called blackboard framing, meaning the framing vector at any point points out of the blackboard. So, those are the relations. So, those are the relations in this algebra. And what is the significance of this algebra? So, the point is the following. And this proposition has kind of a confusing history. So, let me just name a couple of the people who are involved. I'm sorry that there are other people I'm not naming here. So the proposition is that there is an isomorphism. Of the classical limit of the Skane algebra, so what I mean is the following: take this algebra. Take this algebra and set this parameter a equal to minus one. So it's an algebra over this ring, and we quotient that ring by the ideal generated by a plus one. So that specialization at a equals minus one is in fact a commutative algorithm. One is in fact a commutative algebra, and in fact, this is precisely the algebra of regular functions on the character variety of S, the SL2 character variety. So that's the point of this construction. It gives you a quantization, a non-commutative deformation of the character variety of the surface. Yes? Yes. Since you are considering frame means without facial issues. That's right, yeah. And see, and basically the leaf or possible structure on this space of black actually some problem that deep rated right? Uh yes, that's right. That they could be the same thing. So, I think you have to be careful because the Goldman bracket is defined differently for different groups. This is the SL2 character variety, and maybe for other groups it's defined a bit differently. The Lie bracket has a different formula for different groups. Okay. So now we're going to have a little bit of a little bit of a message. So I mentioned that what we're really interested in here is this relative character variety. So we should do an analogous thing for that space. So let's now suppose that gamma one through gamma n are loops in s, but let's actually lift them to loops in s times 0, 1. And suppose they're homotopic to Uh boundary components. So I mean I can I can move them into the boundary of this three manifold by a by an isotopy Okay, then let's define the relative The relative skin algebra as follows. So this one will have two subscripts. I'll denote them A and lambda. And that's because this is defined by taking. This is defined by taking the usual skein algebra, which has just one subscript, A. That would be an algebra, as I said, over Laurent polynomials in A. But let's extend scalars so that we have these additional parameters, lambda one through lambda n and their inverses. And then let's take a quotient of that. By another one of these geometrically defined skein relations. So now I'm going to look at a neighborhood of the boundary of the surface. So this is meant the shaded region is meant to be the boundary of the surface. And suppose we have. And suppose we have a loop that surrounds this boundary component. So this is maybe the loop gamma i. Then we quotient by the relation that says that loop equals this scalar minus lambda i plus lambda i inverse. All right, so that's what I'll call the relative scan. That's what I'll call the relative scan algebra. Yeah, sorry, I meant to. Right. Well, I mean, you can just say it this way, because the scalar embeds into this algebra as this thing times the empty link, right? Okay. So let me give you an example now where we can say explicitly, whoa where we can say explicitly what this algebra is. So I'd like to consider the case now where The case now where S, the surface, is a once-punctured torus. So, I mean, this that's S. So, in this case, We could say the following. Let's take this relative skein algebra of S. And for this statement to be true, I guess I have to extend scalars a little bit. Let me tensor this with rational functions in a and lambda to the one-half. One half. So remember, these lambdas are some formal variables, and there's one for each boundary component. So here I just have one of them. So if I do this, then this would be identified with the spherical double affine Hecke algebra of type A1. A1. And in particular, what that means is we get some nice representation of the Skein algebra or relative Skein algebra. Namely, we get the polynomial representation. Representation. So that would be an embedding, would be an injective algebra homomorphism from this Skein algebra into endomorphisms of some polynomial ring. So I'll write it like this. This where CQT means this field of scalars. Okay, and then we adjoin an additional variable and take Z2 invariance where the generator of Z2 is The generator of Z2 is interchanging X and X inverse. So then the CQT linear endomorphisms of that provide a representation of this spherical Daha and therefore the Skin algebra. Okay, so that's what I wanted to say about these. About these Keynes algebras, and now let me review what we need about the K-theoretic Coulomb branch. So So let me start with a group. So we'll let G be a complex connected reductive algebraic group. And I will use the following standard notation. So let's write K to mean the field of The field of formal Lorentz series in a variable Z. And write O for formal power series in Z. And then let's recall that the affine Grossmannian of G Is this object? So Ger G is GK mod G O where GK means k-valued points. Of G and G O is O value points. So that definition is pretty well known. We're going to consider some kind of extension of this, which Which was mentioned a little bit in this morning's talk. So this is a definition. Oh, oh, sorry. Before I state the definition, we're going to need an additional datum, which is a representation. So let's let n now be some complex representation of g. Representation of G. And then we have the following definition, which is due to Roberman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima. So let's write NK to mean To mean n tensor with K and write NO to mean n tensor with O. And then there are a couple of spaces that we can associate to the data of G and N. Firstly, we define A space denoted like this. So this will be called T of G N. And it's the following thing. So you take, you form this kind of product. So this means like taking the product of GK. Product of GK and NO and then quotienting by an action of GO, where GO is acting on pairs in the following way. If you have G and S, then B acts there by this formula. And here S is an element of this NO. Okay, so that is so it's like uh it's like an associated vector bundle and uh And actually, what we need for defining a Coulomb branch is some kind of subspace of that. So, this could be viewed as some kind of infinite-dimensional variety. And then the thing we really care about is the variety of triples, which is also an infinite-dimensional space. So this one. So, this one is denoted Rgn and it consists of those classes G, S in this T space such that Such that G acting on S gives you something in NO. So in general, this thing would be expected to lie in NK, but we require here that it lies in NO. Okay, so that's the space that will be the basis for the construction of this Coulomb branch. And you should note at this point. And you should note at this point that there is an action of GO on this variety of triples, Rgn, which is just given by multiplication on this first factor. First factor. And if we have an additional group, so if F is another group acting on this representation N, which commutes with the G action. Then we will get an action of this group which I'll call G O tilde on Rgm. So what is G O tilde? That means O valued points of G tilde, where G tilde is just the product. Where G tilde is just the product of G and F. And I should mention here that in the physics terminology, this group F is what we would call a flavor symmetry group. So, we will actually, in our examples, will need that extra flavor symmetry action on the representation. All right. So, now there are a couple of statements. Statements that we need to know here. So, this is a proposition, and you can find this also explained in the paper of Robert-Finkelberg Nakajima. The first statement is that the following: it's that there's a certain commutative product. It's a convolution product on the geo-tilde equivariant k-theory of this variety of triples. So I said here that there's an action. Here, that there's an action of this group on variety of triples. And it's not a variety, it's some infinite-dimensional space, but one can nonetheless define equivariant k-theory of this object, and by some kind of standard ideas from geometric representation theory, one gets a convolution product. But the real Surprising thing, I guess, is that this is a commutative product. But we can also deform this product. So there is a C star action on this variety of triples, Rgn. This is the action by loop rotation. By loop rotation, rescaling the variable z. And one similarly has a convolution product on the geo-tilde semi-directed. Semi-direct product C star equivariant K-theory of the variety of triples. So when you enlarge the group in this way, there is still a product on the resulting K-theory. But this product is no longer commutative, so this product Makes this thing into a non-commutative algebraic over the C-star equivariant K-theory. Equivariant k-theory of a point, which is isomorphic to the algebra of Laurent polynomials in a variable q. So again, you have a one-parameter non-commutative deformation of some commutative algebra. And again, this is a quantization of the algebra. And this leads us now to the following definitions. So this is the definition that you can find in the paper of BFN. So the K-theoretic Coulomb branch associated to these data, the group and its representation. This k-theoretic Coulomb branch is defined as the spectrum. Is defined as the spectrum denoted Mc of G tilde N. This is spectrum of G O tilde equivariant K theory of R G N, right? Because this was shown to be a commutative algebra. Shown to be a commutative algebra, so you can take its spectrum. And that gives you some affine scheme, which we call the Coulomb branch, or K-theoretic Coulomb branch. But then we also had this non-commutative algebra deforming that K-theory. And we define the quantized Coulomb branch. To be that algebra. Okay, so now we have these two interesting non-commutative algebras. They're both quantizations of some commutative algebras. Quantizations of some commutative algebras. And we've already seen that the, at least in the case of the one-hole torus, the skein algebra, relative skein algebra, has some nice polynomial representation. So in fact, one also has that for the quantized k-theoretic Coulomb branch. So a fact. So a fact is that if you have a torus, T in your group, you get what you might call a polynomial representation. So it's a representation of this non-commutative algebra, this quantized Of algebra, this quantized Coulomb branch, or in other words, an embedding of that algebra into a simpler Coulomb branch. So this is again defined as some kind of equivariant k-theory of this variety of triples, but now the group action is t times x. Is T times F and O points of that. Remember that F is our flavor symmetry group, and we extend by this C star action here. And what we're acting on is the variety of triples associated to this torus T and the zero representation of that. Okay, so this is this is not quite true yet. In fact, uh, In fact, uh what one needs to do is is uh localize this algebra at some multiplicative set that I won't uh that I won't describe in detail. Okay? But the point is there's some algebra embedding here, and one should think of this as analogous to the polynomial representation of Da Ha that I mentioned before. Okay. Okay, so clearly these algebras have some similarities. And now I'd like to get to the main results, which is about a relationship. So the main result is about a relationship between the Skein algebra and Coulomb branch. So, to formulate this, let me write SGN for a compact oriented surface of genus G With n boundary components. And let's assume furthermore that the Euler characteristic of the surface, which is 2 minus 2g minus n, let's assume that's negative. This will guarantee the existence of a The existence of a pair of pants decomposition of the surface, which is important for what we do. Okay, now there is a fact that is shown in the paper. In the paper with Peng, that if the genus of your surface is less than or equal to one, then that surface determines a group G tilde, which again has G tilde, which again has this factorization as G times F, where F is a torus which we regard as a flavor symmetry group. So S, the surface determines a group and a representation of that group, which we denote N. Okay, so from that data we can of course construct this k-theoretic Coulomb branch, which is some kind of abstract thing, but a result that we proved in the paper is the following. So we considered various examples of surfaces and we tried to compute. Surfaces, and we try to compute the Coulomb branches of this group and representation. So we considered, first of all, surfaces in genus zero. So you could take S equal to the three-punctured sphere or the four-punctured sphere. And in these examples, we show that there exists a C algebra. A C algebra isomorphism of the Skane algebra, or more precisely, the relative Skane algebra and the quantized k-theoretic Coulomb branch. Associated to these data, the group and its representation. So that's kind of generally what you expect, I think, in genus zero. Yes? A uniqueness of what? The isomorphism? You mean, is it possible that there is another group in representation who's That there is another group and representation whose Coulomb branch is the same? I think so. I don't know why there would be unique. Do you think it's unique? I think it's a better question for somebody else. Say that again? Was that the point of the question? That you know another construction of the theory? Yeah, I don't know. I haven't thought about that. I don't know. Well, in any case, we have an isomorphism. It's not at all a unique isomorphism, because, of course, you can act on this thing. You can act on this thing by the mapping class group of the surface. But one has isomorphisms like this. And then for the, in genus one, it becomes a little bit more interesting. So we looked at the So we looked at the case of once punctured torus, S11. And in that case, you have to introduce a Z2 action on this relative skein algebra. And then you find again there is a C algebra isomorphism. Relating not the Skane algebra, but now the Z2 invariant subalgebra with a quantized k-theoretic Coulomb branch, namely the one associated to these data. Okay, and then in addition, we And then, in addition, we formulated a general conjecture, which is maybe not too hard to guess. It's just similar isomorphisms in genus 0 and 1, and gave some evidence for that. So, more recently, I've continued working on this general case, and that will hopefully appear in not too long. This is something I've This is something I've been discussing with Hyung Kyu Kim. And I'd like to say that in all of these cases, the essential fact, the essential thing that one uses is the existence of these polynomial representations. So in these examples, in this theorem, Examples in this theorem, these can be gotten from the polynomial representation of Daha of various types. And then in the general case, one uses some kind of new representation of the Skein algebra into a localized quantum torus. So, thank you for your attention. That's all I have to say.
