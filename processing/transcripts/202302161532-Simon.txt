Just have to clean up. Can you see this? Okay. Yes. Okay, excellent. So let me know when you want me to start. Okay. So our next speaker is Christophe Silon joining us virtually. Whenever you're ready, Christoph, we can take it away. Okay, thank you very much. Yeah, I was hoping to drive out there. So I am in, as you see here, I'm at the University of Calgary, so I'm pretty near you right now. So, I'm pretty near you right now. I was hoping to come in person, but that was not meant to be for various reasons. So, I appreciate the opportunity to tell you a little bit about what I'm doing like this. I hope it will be interesting. It's not really about non-Markovian things, really, but I saw that you had some quantum biology talks this afternoon. So it's at least a little bit related to that. So, I hope it was there. Little bit related to that, so I hope it will still be of interest somehow. So, yes, so I'm a quantum optics theory researcher. I've done a lot of work on quantum technology of various kinds, quantum networks, things like that. But then recently, I have become very interested in biology, in particular, quantum biology, to the point where I'm now a member of the brain. Member of the Brain Institute that we have here at the University of Calgary, in addition to our quantum institute. And that's what I decided I wanted to tell you folks about today. So a lot of what I'm doing is driven sort of by this big question, you know, whether quantum effects and in particular quantum entanglement might play a role in our brains. So let me try to motivate that. Let me try to motivate that a little bit. Okay, this is my usual introduction slide about entanglement. I assume that you all know, you know, that it's a very special quantum property. And the key thing I want you to sort of think about right now is that in some sense, an entangled quantum system is a coherent whole, right? It has this holistic aspect. Yeah, that's my main point here. So, what So, what would entanglement in the brain potentially accomplish? So, there's really two main reasons why I think that's potentially a promising question to study. One has to do simply with quantum information processing. So, we, many of us, I think, believe that quantum information processing, quantum computing is potentially useful. There are quantum advantages for There are quantum advantages for various computing and communication complexity tasks that we are aware of. So it doesn't seem crazy to think that maybe nature figured that out too at some point, right, during the course of evolution. Maybe it has found a way to use quantum advantage for its own purposes. But then, so that's the engineering motivation. But then there is more like a philosophy/slash neuroscience. Philosophy/slash neuroscience motivation two, which is what's called the binding problem of consciousness. So, so consciousness is a mystery still. Most neuroscientists will agree that we really don't know how conscious experience arises in our brains. One of the things that it has, one of the attributes that make it mysterious, not the only one, but one of them is definitely the fact that it is in some sense unified. Some sense unified, right? Our experience, we have one experience at a given time that has like parts to it, but still we experience all of it somehow at once. And it's very difficult to see how that arises from the dynamics of all these neurons and even all these molecules in our brains. And some people are hoping, me included, that maybe entanglement has something to do with this, you know, like maybe somehow some Somehow, some of these molecular degrees of freedom are bound together in a holistic way, and then you know, being entangled, maybe that's the part that gives rise to our consciousness. You know, that's sort of the working hypothesis. I have a paper about this too in a philosophy journal, but I'm not the only one who has had this idea. It has been around for a little bit. So, okay, so two motivations now. Now, how could it possibly work? And this is where I'm sort of drawing on my experience in developing quantum technology. So if I was nature and I had to build a quantum computer of some kind in our brains, how would I do it? It seems to me that photons and spins are natural ingredients that you would want to use. That you would want to use based on our experience. Photons, we know, are great for sending quantum information over any non-macroscopic distance in the brain. We would be talking millimeters and centimeters, but that's still microscopic in some sense. And then spins, we know that they, both electron spins and even more so, nuclear spins, we know that they are capable of serving as quantum. Of serving as quantum processes and quantum memories, even in certain condensed matter systems, and even at high temperatures, even at room temperature or body temperature. So there are examples for that. So that motivates a lot of what I will tell you going forward. So this talk is sort of structured along these two main areas: on the one hand, photons and then spins. Spins and I'll start with the photons. So there are photons in the brain. They're actually our living cells emit photons at some level. It is a low level, but they are there. One can see them. This is an example of a CCD image of a brain slice, you know, that's emitting light. The sources are relatively Relatively clear. It's like not, you know, totally like in the hell down, you know, what all the sources are, but it's clear that reactive oxygen species are important and probably the mitochondria in the cells, that's a cell organelle, you know, are particularly important. The question really is whether these photons are somehow used by our cells and in particular by our brain for some level of communication. That is not really clear. However, I Really clear. However, I'll tell you some pieces of evidence in the next few minutes. So, certainly, we know that potential detectors exist. I'll come back to that a little bit later, but there are light-sensitive proteins, for example, called opsins in our cells and in particular in our brains. I should say that my storyline here is about quantum communication, but even if it was firmly established, You know, firmly established that our brain uses classical communication by light, that would also be an important discovery in biology. Like, that is that is also not clear at this point. Now, here is how this story somehow started for me. That was our first real contribution to this field was this idea that maybe axons in the brain could serve as photonic. Photonic waveguides. So, axons are, you know, these like long cable-like things that connect a lot of our neurons right in our brains. They are often surrounded by this myelin sheath that's drawn in red here. And, you know, they look like cabers, right? It's well established that they are conducting electricity, electrical signals. Conducting electricity, electrical signals. And at first sight, you know, they look like they could also conduct light, maybe. They have roughly the right dimensions. And it turns out they also have other properties that are good. In particular, the refractive index is promising. So even an unmyelinated axon has a higher refractive index than the surrounding medium, which is more or less water. But then if it's myelinated, that's even better. The myelin has even higher. Even better. The myelin has even higher refractive index. That's sort of understood. Then, of course, they don't look like the kind of optical fibers we are used to. So that's really the big question. How good could it be, this side guidance? And that's where we did a lot of relatively detailed modeling. For example, one of the main concerns was that the myelin sheath is interrupted periodically by these so-called nodes of Ramvier. Of Ramvier. So that was a concern, you know, like how much loss would you expect in these Ramvier nodes, things like that. So that's what we did. So we made a model of the Rami nodes and we studied how a light transmission would work. And the conclusion basically was that, yeah, I mean, there would be some loss, but it seems like with realistic dimensions, it wouldn't be too, too bad. And then similarly, we looked at other. And similarly, we looked at other imperfections from a photonic engineering perspective that we were aware of. So the male inch is not always homogeneous, not always uniform. And there's also, it's not necessarily perfectly circular. There's bends in the actons. We look then whether there might be crosstalk. Absorption is actually really. Absorption is actually really quite low. There's not too much absorption in the visceral and near-infrared range in the brain. That is very low. So, on the whole, I mean, we did a lot of modeling and we came away with a moderately optimistic conclusion that a high transmission of a few percent to maybe almost 100% for distances in the millimeter to centimeter range seem possible at least for the right kinds of axons. Kinds of axons. And then if one thinks about, you know, so that's encouraging. Then, of course, the other question is: how many photons are there? So we can also estimate that based on the data. There is probably billions that are emitted per second throughout the brain. That's not a lot per cell, but it's still a lot in total if you think about it. So it could certainly transmit a lot of information in principle. One can think about what base. One can think about, you know, what bandwidth would you actually need for our conscious experience? And people have thought about that and come up with numbers that are not that high in our conscious experience. It's very impressive to us, but its bandwidth is not necessarily very large. So it could, you know, this could all work out in principle. But of course, at this stage, it's an idea, right? So then the question is: is there experimental evidence of any kind for this? And there are some. There are some. So there was actually there are results on light guidance by saddles that are much older and not about axons. For example, in our retina, we have saddles that it was understood about 15 years ago that they really serve as light guides. They are called Müller saddles. And there one can really do experiments where you see that they can guide light. And they are actually quite similar. Right, and they are actually quite similar in character to the gear sails that make the myelin sheaths. So that's that's nice, that was encouraging. They were aware of this. But now there's more direct evidence too, and maybe the nicest is in this recent paper. There's other papers too, but this is one where it's sort of very clear. This is again a brain slice, and so they called it anisotropic light scattering from axons. From axons. Basically, what you see here is you can see the axons, and you can see the rings, which are the myelinated axons, and you can see that there's light being guided towards you. So that's certainly, I think the physics of it is valid, is correct. This still is only qualitative data. It would be nice to be able to do To be able to do more quantitative tests, you know, like how good is the light guidance really, like how much loss, you know, in a given axon and so on. And we are having discussions now with people who might be able to help us do these tests. But I think it's not at least not completely wrong that this is happening. Then I mentioned before that there are these opsins, right? So there are light-sensitive. So there are light-sensitive proteins, not only, there are, of course, rhodopsins in our eyes, and they are what makes our eyes see, but there is similar proteins called optins in other cells, in our bodies. And here, this group showed that these opsin V proteins in hypothyamic, so that's part of the brain, the hypothyroids, in these hypothyamic neurons. These hypothermic neurons they do something meaningful. Like, if you in response to light, so they this is external light. Okay, this is not these biophotons that I was talking about. This is an experiment where they applied violet light to these neurons in the hypothermus, and they showed that the neurons reacted by changing the sort of the balance between, in some sense, Balance between, in some sense, work and heat. So, thermogenesis is when the cells heat, because they have to be at a certain temperature, to be healthy cells, they have to maintain a certain temperature. So they use some of the energy that they have for heating. That's called thermogenesis. And here, what happened is when light was shown in, then they suppressed that, so they heated less. So they did something similar. Less. So they did something seemingly biologically meaningful in response to light, which suggests that maybe they could be doing other things in response to light too. So this could be a sign that really light is an important communication channel, potentially. So building on that idea, so we had a more recent paper where we did a bit of speculation, you know, how, suppose, you know, suppose, so they suppose. Suppose the axons are light guides, and there are detectors that can receive this photonic information. What could it be good for? And so we talked about that with various neuroscientists, and one of them was Wilton Nicola, who has a colleague here in Calgary. And we came up with this, for example. So back propagation is a super successful learning. For learning algorithm that underlies a lot of AI right now. And it puzzles. So it's a very good algorithm. Neural networks per se are in principle were inspired by the brain, right? But it's not obvious to see how back propagation could be implemented in the brain, in fact, because it relies on information. So you have a Information. So you have a network, you know, that has like layers, and this information is propagating through that network. And in the back propagation algorithm, you have to propagate error information backwards through this network. And our brains are not very, the connections in our brains are not very reversible. So the electrochemical signals that people usually talk about, they propagate in one direction. They propagate in one direction along axons mostly, like 99% of the time. So they are not very well constructed for this back propagation. So of course people think about alternatives and the kind of feedback loops and so on, but it's more complicated. It doesn't quite work. There's a lot of literature about how to avoid that problem. And here we suggested that if you have photons that can go backwards easily, because the Photons that can go backwards easily because the photons don't care, you know, from the you can go each direction along an axon if you are a photon, then that could be an elegant backward channel. That was the idea here. So this would still be, and we did some simulations to show that that was not a crazy notion, because the photons would be stochastic, but that's okay. Stochastic backpropagation can also work. That's sort of the technical part of what we did here. So, anyway, so that's one. So, anyway, so that's one idea that's not yet quantum, you know, but then if you add quantum to it, you know, then presumably you could do even more and more exciting things. All right. So that was the photon part. So let me come to the spin part for a little bit. So there is a lot of papers, a lot, a lot of papers on the effects of magnetic fields. The effects of magnetic fields, weak magnetic fields, let's say in the range of the Earth's magnetic field, or maybe 10 times more, you know, so we're talking micro Tesla to milli Tesla, not Tesla, right? Like much bigger than that. So the effects of such weak magnetic fields on biology, there really is a lot of them. So there is effects of static magnetic fields, of just shielding the Earth's magnetic field, effects, all kinds of biological. Field affects all kinds of biological functions. And this is all kind of mysterious. Okay, so we have a review about this in the Journal of Royal Society interface that came out last year. So there's more or less hundreds of these studies. Low frequency, extremely low frequency magnetic fields, again, lots and lots of studies. And not really a compelling, a clear sort of convention or explanation for how this works. Explanation for how this works. So, what we are proposing is that it could be because of the radical pair mechanism. So, the radical pair mechanism is something sort of is a spin chemistry, a phenomenon, where you have a pair, sort of you have electron transfer happening, for example. Electron transfer happening from, for example, from one molecule to another, or you're breaking a chemical bond is broken. And then you create two unpaired electrons that are correlated in spin. They can be integrated in spin, you know, if it's a singlet state, or they can be just correlated in spin if it's a triplet state. But in any case, there's a correlation between these spins. And that correlation then affects what happens going forward because the chemical. Going forward, because the chemical reactions that are possible are not, you know, that is a spin-dependent thing. And therefore, if there is now a magnetic field of some kind that influences the spin states of these two unpaired electrons, it can really strongly influence like what chemistry, you know, what's going to happen in that system. And that can be an external magnetic field, or it can be nuclear spins that are nearby, you know, that are little magnets, right? Or it can be. Know that there are little magnets, right? Or it can be in principle other electron spins too. So, so there, this is a quantum mechanism that will allow weak magnetic fields to influence chemistry, even though, you know, because the paradox from a classical perspective is that these magnetic field, the energies associated with these magnetic fields is much smaller than the thermal energies in your chemical system. Chemical system. But here it doesn't matter, you know, because it's about the conservation law, it's about spin. And so, therefore, this like little thing, you know, this little magnetic field, because it influences something as powerful, you know, as like a spin conservation law, it can be strong enough to influence things even on the, you know, even when thermal energies are high. So this has been studied quite a lot in one specific In one specific system, which is the cryptochrome proteins in the context of magnetoreception, so magnetic field sensing by birds. So this is where this was first proposed by Carl Schulten about, you know, initially about 40 years ago. And then he made this concrete suggestion that maybe cryptochrome was the protein to look at about 20 years ago. And since that it has 20 years ago, and since that it has been sort of a very active field to figure out if this is what happens in the cryptochrome proteins when the birds are sensing magnetic fields. And there is a fair amount of understanding now. And it's not established. It's not 100% guaranteed that that's what it is, but it's sort of the leading theory of how they sense magnetic fields. The cryptochrome proteins are also implicated in some other biological. In some other biological contexts, for example, in nerve generation in response to magnetic fields, because the medical community is actually using magnetic fields to promote healing, in particular in the brain. Again, without a clear understanding of why that would work, but it's sort of, you know, there's evidence that the cryptochrome proteins are involved. So that's a hint that, you know, maybe it's actually a quantum bar. maybe maybe it's actually a quantum biology phenomenon. But we think that it's more general, you know, because not all of the papers, of the many papers I showed before, not all of them involve cryptochrome. So we think that this is a more widespread thing, that there's also other proteins or other systems where these radical pairs are formed. And for example, there's an enzyme, a very important enzyme that's called NADPH. Enzyme that's called NADPH oxidase, NOX, that has some similarities, and that could also maybe form radical pairs. But this is still somewhat speculative at this point. In any case, we have over the last couple of years, we published a number of papers on different... So we basically went down the list of biological phenomena that are related that show magnetic field depends. That show magnetic field dependence, and we studied some of them in some detail and showed that we can reproduce some of the important features based on radical pair models, basically on quantum biology models. And I don't have like a ton of time, so I'll go relatively fast through those. And you can maybe ask me questions if you are interested afterwards. So, but I'll just sort of show you. Sort of show you. So, so the first one we did had to do with anesthesia by xenon, noble gas, right? Where people had shown that the effectiveness of xenon as an anesthetic depends on the nuclear spin of the xenon atom. So xenon has different isotopes, and they showed like pretty convincingly that it's the nuclear spin that matters. And that's again something that's like such a weak thing, the magnetic field of the nuclear. The magnetic field of the nuclear spin, but a radic pair model accounts for that very naturally. You know, you would expect that from a radicair model, and we showed that we can reproduce this isotope effect. And then we made the prediction that you should, now if you anesthetize your mice or rats or people, you know, under a magnetic field, that should change the potency. And we are hoping that somebody will try that out sooner or later. Then we had a bit on lithium. On lithium, which is something that has also, where again, there's an isotope effect. This inspired Matthew Fisher, in particular, who has his own ideas about how quantum biology operates in the brain. He doesn't talk about radical pairs. Here, what we showed in our paper here is that radical pairs could also account for the isotope effect that people see. The paper C. So that'll be so. Are you mixing this on the RAD study from several decades ago? Yes, so there's two experiments now. Sorry, I'm going the wrong way. Yeah, so there was an experiment in the 80s, and then Matthew Fisher and his colleagues in Santa Barbara, they actually did that recently. And again, they saw an isotope. So the isotope of lithium matters in It completely changes what the drug does. It's a while since I read Matthew's paper, but I got the impression that the results were different from the results of the 1980s, although again, I still hoped to have some effect. If I'm recalling correctly, did your results provide a possible mechanism for both sets of observations, the old ones and new ones? Everyone, um, I'm not quite sure. I mean, it's also the precision of these things is like not, you know, like right now what we are correlating is, so I think we were targeting, even trying to remember which one we were targeting here. The, you know, in this paper at least, we don't really know the chemical mechanism that's underlying, right? So we are just basically showing that for a pro. That for appropriate parameter values for the radical pairs, you can definitely see a significant isotope effect. You know, a significant difference between the two isotopes for the chemical reaction yields. So I think we could probably model either of those if there is an important difference. I haven't looked at it in detail in a little while. It's a fair question. It's a fair question. So, here, another bit of a more sophisticated example that we did, because here we actually had, so this is about the circadian clock, where people have seen magnetic field effects on the period of the clock in flies, in particular. And what's nice about the circadian clock is that people have developed chemical kinetics. Have developed chemical kinetics models so they know relatively well how it works, you know, like what are the underlying reactions, and then those are, of course, complicated, but then you can boil it down to you know a simple model of maybe just two coupled differential equations, you know, and then and it works like a chemical oscillator. And so here we were able to sort of pinpoint like where the quantum effect would come in. You know, it would that the cryptochrome plays a role in this chemical oscillator. In this chemical oscillator, and the magnetic field, we think, you know, modifies a key rate in these oscillator equations, and then it changes the clock period. So here we had a bit more information. So we could do, in some sense, a more thorough job, not just correlating quantum delivery effects with biological effects, but sort of giving more of a story of how that might actually happen. So that's, of course, the goal to do that for all of these phenomena. This phenomenon. Then we also have a paper on microtubors. That's another system that is popular in quantum biology for various reasons. And that's also tied to consciousness, anesthesia and so on. And there's also magnetic field effects. It turns out there is magnetic field effects that people have seen on microtuber assembly. Assembly in vitro in this case. And we could show, again, we can, the radical pair mechanism is well placed to account for those types of effects too. Then that's more. I think one could do that for many things. Here, I think this is the last one I have here. There's neurogenesis. So the creation of new neurons in the brain, of rats, I think in this case. And here they very nice paper where they show. Here, they very nice paper where they showed that just shielding the geomagnetic field had a significant impact on this creation of new neurons and had significant cognitive impacts on the animals. And they showed that it's related to reactive oxygen species. So, it's somehow mediated by the levers of superoxide, in particular, in the brain. And so, in this case, we made a more. So, in this case, we made a model that involves flavin, which is famous in the radical pair context, and superoxide, which is also very prominent. That could account for what they saw. This was a group in China. So, yeah, so this seems to be somehow a promising direction, this radical pair. So, we have various experimental collaborations now, both on the photon side with colleagues in Canada, both on the side. With colleagues in Canada, both in Calgary and in Ottawa, and also now in actually Wilfrid Laurier in Waterloo. And then we have also collaborations on magnetic field effects, in particular with the most advanced ones are with Wendy Bean in Michigan and again with Sarah McFarland's group here in Calgary, who see biologically magnetic field effects in their systems. We are also starting something with Travis Cradock and Something with Travis Cradock in Florida. So this is exciting somehow. So here are the conclusions for now. So the one idea is that photons guided by axons could be a communication channel and maybe a quantum communication channel in the brain. And then on the other hand, there is or this evidence that radical pairs, so which is entangled or covered. Which is entangled or correlated electron spins might play a role in many, many really biological phenomena from anesthesia to circadian coke to neurogenesis. And this has been a very fruitful area for us over the last two or three years. And so none of this, of course, proves what I started out with, right? Like these are just sort of ingredients for what I was suggesting. So there are some ingredients we have. There are some ingredients we have. We have entangled spins, you know, we have photons. One can think about potential interfaces between those spins and those photons. That's not completely crazy. So maybe, you know, maybe that could mean that entanglement is somehow related or is what underlies consciousness in our brains. But this is, of course, still speculation. And with that, I would thank you, and I would like to thank my group members who work in this area and my. Who work in this area and I have worked in this area and my collaborators. Thank you very much. Thank you, Christoph. Do we have any questions from original? Hi, Thomas Fay here. In your simulations of the superoxide containing radical tears, did you include spin relaxation of the superoxide? Because I'm really surprised by the slide. Because I'm really surprised by the size of the low magnetic field effects you're seeing. Yes, so that is a big topic that we are pursuing. So, yes, I mean, we do always include relaxation. We typically need slightly longer relaxation times than you would naively expect for superoxide. This is a big topic of debate also in the magnetoreception field. But there are potential. But there are potential answers. So we typically need, you know, like microsecond, maybe 100 nanoseconds, and paper. If for free superoxide, you would expect something like maybe nanoseconds. So there's maybe a couple of order of magnitudes that we need improved. But people have, also in the magneto-reception community, they have come up with various ideas. The most obvious one would be for the superoxide to be somehow confined. You know, like if it can't rotate. If it can't rotate freely, then the relaxation would be expected to be slower. And there are various hints that that might actually happen for some of the relevant proteins. So we have some active discussions about that with colleagues in France in particular, who are doing simulations about how superoxide might get trapped. Or if it gets bound, then it's a different story again, but then maybe it's not superoxide anymore. Again, but then maybe it's not super oxide anymore. So, that is an important topic, relaxation, right? Thanks. Do we have any questions from online from anyone on Zoom? Any more from the room? Well, thanks with that. Well, thank you to stop again and thank all of our speakers from this afternoon. Thank you.
