Hello, everyone. Tajia Hong. So let's begin the first session of today's program. It's my great pleasure to introduce Professor Yu Guang Si from Peking University. He will talk about today about a positive mass theorem for Sierra for ALF and ALG Metaphor. Please, Yugu. Okay, it's my great pleasure to be here, and I would like to thank the organizer for the invitation. Today, I will talk about... Yes, everyone hear me? Yes, yes. Okay, fine. I will talk about the party mass theorem for ALF and ALG manifold. Here, ALF means asymptotically locally. Asymptotically locally flat manifold. And the ALG manifold is a complete and non-compact manifold with a very special asymptotic structure at infinities. Actually, this talk is based on my recent joint work with my student, PhD students, Liu Ken and Zhu Jing. We have post our paper on the archive. If you're interested in it, just download and take a look. Okay, now let's get start from some basic facts of. From some basic effects of scalar curvature. By definition, scalar curvature is a trace of Lichet tensor. So it is a scalar functions on Manifold. And actually, it is a weak curvature invariance on the Manifold. A nice way to understand what a scalar curvature is, is to look at the volume of small geodesic ball with reduced R extend P. Now, here is specific. is specific formulas and capital RP is a scalar curvature at the P. So from this formula we understand we see that the largest scalar curvature is and the smaller the volume will be okay now it is a classical result actually due to Nishnowich I think he proved this result in 1964 and his results And his belt says that not all manifolds admit positive scalar curvature. Here, PSC refers to positive scalar curvature. So with this fact in mind, we want to ask what kind of manifolds admits or cannot admit positive scalar curvatures. Actually, this is one of the central problems in Riemannian geometry. To me, it is interesting to see the scalar curvature can exist. The scalar curvature can be explained as energy density in general relativity. Because of this, many scalar curvature problems have deeply related with energy problem in general relativity. I think one of typical example is so-called positive mass theorems. According to Robert Girac, physical meaning of positive mass theorem for isolated system is the following. That means that is an isolated gravitating system have no Gravitating systems have non-negative local mass densities, must have non-negative total mass, which is measured gravitational at spatial infinity. So this is the physical laws. Now, let me translate this into a mathematical series. As we mentioned before, mass density correspondence to scalar curvature R, and isolated systems can be described by a syntax effect manifold. Now, here is a precise. Now, here is a precise definition for asynchronous flat manifold. Namely, a complete non-compact manifold Mg is said to be asymptotic flat if it satisfies the following two assumptions. The first one is topological one, that is, outside a compact set K, it can be written as a union of certain components, and each component is diffimorphic to exterior part of a board in n dimensional. Of a board in n-dimensional Euclidean space. So each component we call an end. For simplicity, we only assume one end here. Now, for each end, we have Cartesian coordinates. And under those Cartesian coordinates, we have metric components, which is denoted by Gij. And we assume Gij satisfies such a decay conditions. Here, P. Here, P is called asymptotical order. We always assume P is bigger than n minus 2 over 2. And furthermore, we require that scalar curvature is always L1 integrable. So with those assumptions, we can define a conserved quantity, which called ADM mass. You may regard it as a total mass in these ways. And I think in 1986, Lord Barney could. Lord Barney could conclude that such a definitive for ADMS is independent on the choice of collision coordinates on the end. So this is also a geometric propaganda. Now let me show you example. Here is a Shuwash manifold, which is a symmetrical, S2 symmetrical solution to Einstein Fields equation. Now, the underlying differentiable Now, the underlying differentiable manifold is R3 original point O. And this is a Schwarz metric. Now, this is a standard Euclid metric on Euclid R3s. And this is conformal factors. Here, M is a positive constant, and R is a Euclidean distance to original point O. Now, when R tends to infinity, this conformal factor tends to one. So this Will go tends to one. So, this is asymptotically Euclid. Now, it's corresponding to this part. And when R tends to zero, then this conformal effect will blow up. So this point O corresponding to this part. And R equal to N over 2 is a geodesic, totally geodesic hype surface, which said horizon in general relativity. I think here is the horizon. Okay, this is a first non-trivial example of asymptotical flat manifold. And the scalar curvature of this metric is equal to zero. Okay. Now, part of the mass theory, as I told you later, said a part of the mass theorem is kind of a result of a synthetic flat manifold with an active scale curvature. However, it has different. Curvature. However, it has deep relation with certain property of some compact manifold admits no positive scalar curvature. A typical example is a follow-up that is n-dimensional torus admits no positive scalar curvature metric. And this was approved by Shen Yao when n is less or equal than seven, and the general case by Gromov Lawsons. About four years ago, Shen Li Yao. Go. Should y'all prove the following result that pick up any orientable n-dimensional manifold and then do the connected sum with n-dimensional colors. The resulting manifold admits no positive scalar curvature metric. And this theorems implies positive mass theorems. And we can regard this resulting manifold as a As a surgery on T, on n-dimensional tolerance around a point, around a single point. Now we can state what the party mass theorem is. La Mg be an asymptotic flat manifold, which represents isolated systems and scalar curvature is non-active, that is, and its density is non-negative. Then ADMS is non-negative. That means total mass is non-negative. And equality holds. The matrix and equality holds. That means, in this case, if total mean total energy equals zero, then if and only if the manifold is isometric to a Euclidean space. So this is a part of mass theorems. And this Polytember theorem was proved by Sheng Yao by minimum surface theorem and by Wheaton by Spino arguments. So in Wheaton arguments, he had to assume Arguments, he had to assume M is Bin. To me, the philosopher behind the Plato mass theorem is the following one. This is flat Minkowski space, and it is a trivial solution for Einstein fields equation. Actually, it is the solution with the least energy among all those with non-negative energy density. That means flat. Is that means flat? The philosopher behind the polymer theorem is that the flat, the standard Minkowski space is ground state for energy in the solution of any Einstein fields equation. Now, we know that we have many non-trivial static solutions for Einstein Fields equation. So, it is natural to ask: are there any other part of mass theorem or manifolds with non-macular scalar curvatures? Scalar curvatures. So, nice candidate is ALF, the asymptotic locally flat manifold and ALG manifolds. Now, let me show you what the ALF manifold is. In this talk, I will focus on ALF manifolds. Okay? Now, here are specific definitions. Specific definitions. Lot NG be complete and non-compact remaining manifold. It is ALF with asymptotic odd mu if it satisfies the following assumptions. The first one is that just like asymptotic fact manifold, there is a compact set K and outside the compact set K, there are several ends, but for simplicity, we only assume one end, which is diffimorphic to this one. To this ones. And here, B and R is bored in n minus one Euclid space. Note that this is a flat. This is a flat space. And actually, this is the model space for our, for A of manifold. Now, if n equals to 3, we assume the metric can be written in these ways. Now, this one is actually a metric. Actually, a metric defined on R2 with under the polar coordinates. And beta is a constant. So, this is actually conical matrix. And L is a constant. And d theta square is defined on S once. And here, sigma is electrons. When M is at least 4, then we assume metric G satisfies this assumption. These assumptions. And here is a Schwarz part manifold. M1 and M2 are constant. And L is also a constant. And then sigma, again, sigma is error terms. And we assume sigma satisfies this decay condition. Here, mu is always bigger than n minus 3. Okay, this is the definitions. Now we defined the total. Defined the total mass in this way. And when n is at least 4, Vincent Minerby has similar definitions. Now, he has two definitions for mass. And this one is actually the same with ours up to a constant. Okay. Now, this is the definition for LG manifold. The only difference is that we use T2 fact to replace of S1 fact, but I will not talk about this because they are similar. So, this is for ARF manifold. And another motivation to study part-mass. the motivation to study polymer serum for ALF and ALG manifold is due to the following fielding problems. Now let me tell you what is the fielding what is the fielding problem is. About three years ago, Gromov raised the following problems, which is so-called the fielding problems. Let this triple be the barnecker date. That is, sigma gamma is a Riemannian metric. Sigma gamma is a Riemannian manifold. Gamma is a Riemannian metric. H is smooth function defined on sigma. function defined on sigma which will will be served as mean curvature data and then he asked under what kind of condition for this triple can we can we can find a kind of n-dimensional ambient manifold so that the boundary data that said so that the boundary this remaining manifold is induced from this remaining manifold is boundary of this ambient remaining A ambient remaining manifold. So that is gamma is induced metric from G and H is a mean curvature of this boundary in omega n. Here we always, the mean curvature is with respect to unit outward normal vectors. And the scalar curvature is at least sigma. Okay, this is the fielding problems. Now, that is given this triple, we try to find an try to find an n-dimensional empty space so that the boundary is from this omega and g and the mean h is the mean curvature scalar curvature satisfies these conditions so this is a few problems one year later in raised more difficult problem congestion that is let x be a compact nominal manifold with scalar curvature at least the same With scalar curvature at least sigma. Then he conjectured that the total mean curvature is as bounded above by a constant depends only on intrinsic remainder metric of y. Okay, so this those two conjectures means uh means a few new problems. Yes, in order to study this problem, we need some notations. This problem, we need some notations. The first one is so-called lambda plus. Now, lambda plus is actually for any fixed remaining manifold, sigma gamma, we can define the equality, which called lambda plus. It is a supremum of total mean curvature among all those non-negative scalar curvature fusion of these triples. And also, H is positive. Okay. Okay, here NSC means non-negative scalar curvatures. And we can define a similar quantity which denotes by lambda. In definition of lambda, there's no assumption of positivity of mean curvatures. When n equals 3, then in surface space, this quantity was introduced by Mental Leaders and Hong Ji Miao in 2017 to study general. 17th to study general blind yoga sorry blond yoke mass uh okay uh actually we can generalize this point a little bit in this way that means kappa is a lower bounded of scalar curvatures now with this notation we can reformulate bromoff conjecture in the following way so that is given in remanu manifold and uh he And he conjectures that lambda kappa is less than this. To my knowledge, there are no results in this, if the mean cultures may change the sign. We only have some result in this case. Now, the first, to my knowledge, the first result in this is from positivity of Brown York mass. Now, this was blew the K and I about 19 years ago. About 90 years ago. So that means this is triples for this is a surface with positivity or with a positive Gaussian curvature and H is also a positive. Then we may then by the classical result due to Newmanberg. The sigma gamma, sigma gamma is a topological sphere with positive Gaussian curvature. Can be isometrically embedded into R3. embedding into R3 and H naught denotes the mean curvature of embedded image in R3. Then we prove that this quantity always non-negative. And from this, we see that the total mean curvature, that means integral of H, is bounded by integral of H naught. And H naught is completely determined by this sigma gamma. So we give the upper bound of this when n equals 3. Equal to threes. Later, Jarabuis, Pengji-Meal, Tems, and Mantalidis has interesting serious work in this problem, but they only consider two-dimensional case, means a surface case. For high dimensions, we have the following result. Actually, this is a journal work with my former students, Wanong Long, and my postdoc, Wei Guodong. And my postdoc, Wei Guo Dong, and my PhD student, current PhD student, Zhu Jing Ken. Now, here is our series. We consider n dimensional, n minus one dimensional spheres and this set denote CK smooth remaining metric with positive scalar curvatures. So the standard unit sphere metric is in this set. This set and let gamma be a smooth metric with positive scalar curvature. And we assume gamma is isotopic to the standard unit sphere in this set. That means there is a smooth path in this set connected this gamma to standard unit sphere metric. Under this condition, we can ensure that the total mean curvature supermount. The total mean curvature, supreme total mean curvature, is bounded above by a constant H naught, which depends only on gammas. And when n equal to 4 and 3, that is S2 or S3, and gamma is a positive scalar curvature, then it is automatically isotopic to stand-unit sphere in this set. So this is always true for N. So this is always true for n equal to 4 and 3. Okay. Now, all the above results are considered topological sphere. So we want to ask what happens if sigma n has non-trivial topology. For example, this sigma is a torus or sphere closed torus. If we use criteria If we use quadospherical metric to investigate these problems, then we have to study, we will reach quite a mass theorem of a sympathetic AOF and AOG manifold. Now, let me show you how to do that. Let me show you why this. Suppose we want to consider the fusion problem on S2 plus S1, and we construct a quasar-spherical metric on the S2 factor. On the S2 factor, and then we get a three-dimensional asymptotic asymptotic flat manifold and cross S1s. So the total manifold is ALF by definitions. Okay, now let's back to the point mass theorem on AF manifold. Unlike the asymptotic flat map case, the point mass theorem And the polymath theorem on A.F. Manifold may not always be true. Now, we have the following common example, which is due to Horweight's. This concept example considered a four-dimensional manifold, that is very simple dimensional manifold, are two plus S2s. And M and Q be a two constant so that M is negative, Q is positive, then Q is positive. Then he defined this metric. This is also a very simple metric. And let R plus be the zero point of this function because Q is positive. So R plus is always positive. And we assumed R is at the big equals R plus. Actually, this is a complete metric on. Complete metric on this manifold, underlying differential manifold. Let me show you why. Here, when R approaches to R plus, this part is actually non-degenerate metric on S2. And that part, and by the weak parametrization, we can see this part is actually a complete metric on R2. So totally, the G is actually a complete metric. G is actually a complete manifold, complete metric on M4. And by direct computation, we see that the spherical curvature on RG is always equal to zeros. And when R tends to infinity, we see that those coefficients are tends to one. So when R tends to infinity, G is tends to the standard metric of R3. Standard metric of R3 cross S1. So this is ALF metric. And we can see by definition, we see that the total mass of this metric actually equal to n, which is negative. So this is a counterexample to quantum mass theories. Now, here are very interesting things. Here are some remarks. First, this manifold is spin. This manifold is spin, while a spin structure at the end is quite complicated. And we notice that here's this fact, S1 factor is on from R2, which is homotopy triple in this manifold. And when m and q approach to zero, then this manifold Then this manifold, I mean this remaining manifold, M and G come with G becomes standard flat metric on this R3 class S1, which is that which is flat metric. Okay. Now, here are some known results for the Party Man's theorem on asymptotic effect, locally flat manifold. Horvies and his collaborators. Horace and his collaborate had a series of work in physical spectra. About 2004, Tai Shenzhou approved a Poisson theorem for a spin manifold that asymptotic to product of Euclid space is compact, simply connected collaborative manifold. In his case, in Dais case, the spin structure at the end is unique, so it is quite simple structures. Structures. And in 2009, Winston Miner proved that he studied the spin LF manifold. In his theorems, we need to assume that the compatibility condition for spin structure on the end, that is, the spin structure on end must be the one pullback from this model space. This is not so natural. Uh, this is not so natural assumptions. He also considered with uh manifold without spin assumptions, but in this case, he had to assume literally curvature and non-negative. As we know that when we consider part of mass theorems, it is not so natural to assume Lich curvature is non-negative. These are two strong conditions. Okay, this is a result which is known to me now. Now I can state, now I can state what our result is. Let Ng be AF manifold is vector curvature and negative. We assume N is not bigger than 7. And the S1 factor at infinity is not homotopy trivial. That is, it represents a non-trivial element in. And non-trivial elements in pi one of n. This is crucial in our theorems. Under these concern assumptions, we can show that if n equal to 3, then theta cannot be larger than 1. Now, this result, this conclusion corresponds to non-negativity of mass. And when n is bigger than 4, then mass is non-negative. If we assume more. If we assume more, if we post more assumptions on the error terms, like this, that first derivative, then we can show rigid result that is if beta equal to one in three-dimensional case, then m3 is symmetric to flat model space, r2 cross one. And for if m big than four, big or equals n. Than four, or big or equal than four, and mass equal to zero. Then we can show n1 and m2 both equal to zero, and m is isometric to this model space. Now, this is our AF metric. I means if the total mass m, here, total mass equal to defined in this way. And if m equal to zero, then we can show m1 and m2 are. And M2 are zero. And actually, this is a flat stand flat space here. This is the digital serum. Okay, this is our serum's main result. Now, as I said before that in Harvest examples, S1 factor is homotopy trivial. But in our theory, we assume S1 is S1 is homotopy contributes. So, this is very important to us. Now, like asymptotic flat case, we prove pi-mass thermum in ALF manifold to reduce to a close manifold, a close manifold. That is, we want to prove that. We want to prove that yes, like in ALF asymptotic fat case, the blue of positive mass theorem for of ALF manifolds is reduced to the case of compact manifold. That is, we are going to show that if the masses of ALF manifold are non-negative, we are able to close up n. We are able to close up ends of those manifolds and get compact manifold with positive scalar curvatures. However, on the other hand, we can show those manifolds admits no positive scalar curvature method by the topological structures. So we need to contradictions. Now let me now here, this is our specific result. Now, this part is from n dimensional torus. And the boundary is actually the boundary of this part is n minus 1 sphere cross s1. And now let m2 be any manifold with the same boundary as this. We assume, then we grow in this together. Sorry, we assume as ones. When S1 is homotopy non-trivial in M2, then we grow in together and we can share the resulting manifold at the mid-low positive scale curvature metric. And we also have a widgeted part, which is the result. That is, if there is a negative scalar curvature metric on this resulting manifold, it must be flat. So yeah. So, yeah, this is our main result. Okay. Now, now here is two remarks. The first one is that if S1 factor is homotopy non-trivial in M2, then it will be homotopy non-trivial in resulting manifold as well. We can show these factors. We can show these factors. The second remark is that the assumption that S1 factor is homotopy non-trivial in M2 cannot be removed. Let me show you why. Now, this part is a from n-dimensional for n-dimensional torus and let B be a n-dimensional torture. That BAN dimensional 4 in this n minus 1 dimensional torus with radius 1 over 4. And then this boundary, the boundary of this part actually is this. And we just let this one be M, not M this one, this manifold be M2 manifold in our previous phase. M2 manifold in our previous result. And we can show that the mean curvature of this of the boundary of this is strictly bigger than that in the mean curvature in this manifold. So we just bring together. That is, we get this manifold. And we can, the metrics, the resulting metric is smooth. The resulting metric is smooth except on these boundaries, except on this boundary, and it actually reaches across these boundaries because the mean curvature in this part is big than strictly bigger than that. Then we can smooth this green metric to get a smooth metric with part of scalar curvature in the resulting manifold. So this is a counterexample if we remove the S1 factors in M. In M okay now, this is summary. In Sheng Yao's result, they surgery, just surgery at T n dimensional torus at one point, and then they were able to show that the resulting manifold admits no part of scalar curvature battery. In our result, we do surgery. But we do surgery on n-dimensional torus around S1 factors, then the curves. And if this curve is homotopy non-trivial in the resulting manifold, then this manifold N admits no partial scalar curvature matrix. And also, as I said before, that S1 factor is homotopy non-trivial cannot be removed. cannot be removed. Okay. Now here are some applications. Lap sigma naught be a convex surface in Euclid space and then we consider the fusion problem for these boundaries for this sphere for sorry for this surface and we assume that this S1 is homotopy non-tribules in omega then we can show the total mean commission boundary Sure, the total mean curvature of the boundary is bounded by this. Here, T naught is the total mean curvature of sigma in any dimensional Euclidean space. And if the equality holds, then omega g is flat. So this is a vegetative series. We also have the similar result for sigma naught plus t2s, which I will not talk about it. Not talk about it. And we, by this result, one may define the blow of mass in these ways. Okay. And we also have a specific estimate for S1 for the fueling problem of S1 plus S1. But I will not talk detail on this. Now, finally, I will show you the main result. Uh, the main result. Uh, first thing basically, I only prove this result for three-dimensional case. That is, let mg be an AF manifold with scalar curvature, non-negative, and mu big than one. Then we assume that if S1 factor at infinity represents a non-trivial element in the element in element group. Element group in fundamental first fundamental group, then beta must be bigger than one. That means mass is non-active. If we assume the high regularity decay conditions, then under beta equal to one, then this result, then the manifold must isometric to flat standard R2 class S1. Class S1. Here is a step is a model space. Okay, this is what I want. I will prove this theorem for you. Now, here is the main idea. If beta is bigger than one, that is negative mass, then we can modify the n and a close up to get a compact manifold with positive scalar curvature matrix. On the other hand, we are able to show that M admits cannot admit a partial scalar curvature metric because of special topological structure of M. So we get contradictions. This is the main ideas. Now, let me show you how to do that. The following picture illustrates the main idea is. Now, here R is a Euclidean distance in R2. And this is level surface for the function R. And omega R denotes the set bounded by this level set. So idea is to we want to construct a metric G tilde on the manifold on the Hall manifold so that when G tilde restricts on this omega. On this omega R naught, it is an original metric G. And outside this R equal to R equal to R naught plus lambda, actually lambda equal to one in three-dimensional case, then G tilde is a fat standard flat metric like this. Here, beta is constant, and the dx squared is a Euclidean metric, so this is a flat metric. And the scalar curvature actually at the G tilde is smooth outside these two level set level surface. And the scalar curvature is also an active except here. And at this two level surface, the mean curvature here satisfies these assumptions. Now I want to say because G is only reaches around. G is only reaches around this level set. And so the mean curvature at two sides of this level surface may not equal. But we will construct a GTL so that those mean curvature are equals. And at this level set here, we will prove that the mean curvature is actually the sum of the The sum of the mean culture at the two side is positive and because G tilde is flat outside here, we can close up this part and this part is corresponding to that part. So this is a two-dimensional torus and cross S1, so the total it is a three-dimensional torus. So, the total it is the three dimensional torus. And that part is corresponding to this part. And they have the same boundary. Actually, the boundary is here. It's S2 cross S1 here. Sorry, it's S1 cross S1. Is it Taurus? And if mass is negative, that beta is bigger than one, then we can show the resulting metric is actually positive, so the scalar curvature of the resulting metric is positive. But we can also show that such a manifold admits no positive scalar curvature metric. So we get contradiction. Now, let me show you how to do it. So the important part is to construct. The important part is to construct G tilde in this domains. And we use create a spherical metric here. Okay, now let me show you how to do that. Now, this is G tilde. As I said before, that we straight when R plus N R naught, this is original metric. And when R bigger than R0 plus lambda, actually lambda equal to one, it is a flat metric. Fracture metric. And we assume metric, we try to find a function u so that this metric in this in the domain between here and there is scalar fret. That is the g tilde is equal to zero. And the mean curvature. So okay. This requirement is corresponding to this parallel. Is correspondent to this parabolic equation, actually. And we also remember that we also need to assume the mean curvature at this two sides are equals. And this requirement is corresponding to the initial value here. So actually, this is not so bad equations, and we can solve this. Okay. Now this is a corresponding background metric. So by that direct computation, we see that the mean curvature of this map of G is equal to Z is look like this. So the initial value. And so the initial values is equal to this one. This initial values. And we may assume R0 is large enough. Okay. And by the maximum thing simple, we can show that when R equal to R naught plus one, actually, in our case, Lambda is equal to one. Remember that. So when R equal to R naught plus one, we can. equal to r naught plus one we can show u is less than less than this so at r r naught plus one the mean curvature of g total equal to this which is bigger than that once uh actually now now let me show you in these pictures uh we use quasar spherical metric here to solve evolution equation here and the initial date is is quite good and we now we are talking And we now are talking about mean curvature here. Hg tilde plus denote the mean curvature of this level set with respect to g tildas. And by the definition, we see that hg delta is equal to this once. So we have this estimate because u r plus one is less than zero. Plus one is less than this. Notice that this H G Tilda minus. Now let me show you in picture here. What H G Tilda minus is this level surface with respect to flat metric. Is the mean curvature of this level surface with respect to this flat metric? And we can show that actually the mean curvature. Actually, the mean curvature equal to this ones. Notice that beta is strictly big than one. So when R big is large enough, this quantity is strictly big than that quantities. So this is what we want. So the above argument relies heavily on the assumption that beta fix M1, that is negative mass. Okay. Once we get that, then we can close up the end. Here is the end and get the resulting metric and get a scale part of the scale of curvature on the resulting metrics. Okay, I will show you later. I will show you later that on the resulting metric, at least no partial scalar curvature metric, no positive scalar curvature metric. So we get contradictions. But for time being, let's just assume this. Now, this is a specific argument. Now, let me show you a related part. That is when beta equals one, that is for all metric G on M. On m and beta equal to one, then it must be flat. First, we want to show we want to show that for all AF metric G on N, with scalar curvature, the magnetic scalar curvature, and the beta equal to one would imply the scalar flat. Once we get that, then by which flow and once the minimum result, we will obtain the rigid part. Okay, suppose it's not true, since there's Suppose this is not true, then there is a point P on M, so that scale curvature at P is positive and the scale curvature is not negative elsewhere else. Then we can deform a little bit by conformal deformation and so to decrease a scalar curvature metric and to increase the mean curvature at the boundary. Now, just solve these equations. And when we can show that for this equation, for any R, here R can be arbitrary, the R naught is fixed. And for all those equations here, we have such estimates. That is, the solution has a uniform upper bound, which is strictly less than once. And now, we also want to estimate the normal derivative of this solution. It has such a low boundary. This is very important to us. Actually, because capital lambda R0 is less than one, then we have straight lines. So, this angle is always positive. And then we can, by maximum principle, we can show that our solution is. Can show that our solution is always under these straight lines. So we will have this estimate. This is the main idea. Now, this is the details, but I will not trouble you. I'll just skip it. Okay, once we share this and we have mean curvature estimate, this is very crucial to us. This is very crucial to us. And then we can use the previous argument to get the initial date. Initial value of U is like this. And at this initial value, and then when R1 plus lambda, and we also have this estimate, and then combined together, we can get the mean curvature. This mean curvature is bigger than that one. So we can use previous argument. So, we can use previous argument to get contradictions. Okay. Now, let me show you that there is no, I have several minutes status left. Now, let me show you that there's no positive scalar curvature metric on the resulting manifold. And the main idea of proof is dimension reduction, which is due to Shen the Yellow. Okay, now here's the pictures. Here's the pictures. This is rectangles, and if you glue in this two offside side, glue this one to that one, glue this one to that one, you will get T2s. And we have S1 factor here. Now, let's consider, now let T02 be this, this is S1 cross this one. Now, we consider early minimizing surface in this homology class of this T2 of this torus. T2, are this torus, and which denote S. So S is stables. And we also have this T2s. And this S1 cross that S causes causes factors. And again, another T2s. And we consider intersection set. And the intersection set is certain cross curves. We want to, if the manifold, the resulting manifold here. Manifold, the resulting manifold here, this resulting manifold admits a positive scalar curvature matrix. Then each component of S must be sphere. This is just by a stable second variation formula for our minimum surface. And on the other hand, these curves, okay, let me show you that. These curves, as intersection. The S intersection with T2, this curves C is homolog to this one, to S3, to this factor because in T2s. And then by Horwey series, we know that Horace theorem, we know that this pi one, this C is homotopic tributes, homophobic non-tribules. And so you can image that. you can image that there is a surface and there is closed surface s that s is the s is a surface is a closed surface and there is a is closed surface a close closed curve on s with homotopy non-tribules so the genus s must be at least one so we get contradictions i think i should stop here thank you for your patience Thank you, Professor. Any question?
