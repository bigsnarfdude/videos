So, what I want to talk about today, which is pretty clear from the title, is these sub-regular W algebras. So, the rough plan for the talk is the following. Let me make sure I got that right. Yep. So, I'll give some brief motivating remarks. I'll get through it pretty quickly because I know that this is an audience of experts. I'll define sub-regular W algebras. Fine, sub-regular W algebras for everyone. Discuss this idea about moving between W algebras using reduction and inverse reduction. Describe this procedure using some sub-regular examples and move on to the main result of the talk, which is this inverse reduction procedure for certain sub-regular W algebras. And then I'll briefly describe some future directions as well. So very quickly. So, very quickly, as a lot of you probably know, when we talk about vertex operator algebras in conformal field theory, often what we want is a vertex operator algebra and a category of V modules satisfying some properties. When this category is semi-simple, we know a lot of things. Often, affine vertex algebras at non-negative integer levels play a very important role, and we can kind of do everything we want to do. However, a lot of examples. However, a lot of examples where two-dimensional CFT is popping up in the real world seem to require conformal field theories that are not rational. So either C contains reducible but indecomposable modules, or there are infinitely many simple modules in C. And knowing that the affine vertex algebras plays a very big role in the rational cases, we anticipate that these same affine vertex algebras are important in the non-rational cases. Are important in the non-rational case, except where k is not non-negative integer, but it's admissible level. So these admissible levels were identified by Katsum Watimoto because there are certain LKG modules that have very nice modular properties precisely at these levels. The problem is that when you go in and you try to understand these admissible level affine vertex algebras, a lot of the information, such as pick a small... A lot of the information, so pick a small rank G, so SL2, OSP12, something like that. A lot of the information that we want from a conformal field theory point of view appears to rely on quantum Hamiltonian reductions of affine vertex algebras. And these affine reductions, or these reductions are sometimes rational and they're sometimes not. So my interest broadly is in the non-rational W algebras, so these non-rational reductions. The reason being is that the Being is that the rational W algebras, there's kind of some privileged classes of them, and there's some good information about them. And the non-rational W algebras actually appear on their own in the applications. So they're important in kind of two different directions. So to define them, so to explain what these sub-regular W algebras are, as a lot of you know, given a simple finite dimensional Lie algebra. Given a simple finite dimensional Lie algebra, some nilpotent element f, so that can always be upgraded to a SL2 triple by Jacobs and Morozov, and some number K called the level. We can construct a certain chain complex and take the zeroth homology or zeroth homology. On that zeroth homology, you can define a vertex algebra structure, and we call that vertex algebra a W algebra. This process we call Hamiltonian reduction. So we start with an affine vertex algebra. We start with an affine vertex algebra and we apply this reduction procedure. Given a G, there are plenty of different nilpotent elements. So if you pick a nilpotent element, or you pick two nilpotent elements in the same nilpotent orbit, the W algebras will be isomorphic. But given a G, there are plenty of different choices of nilpotent orbits. One such choice that's always available, no matter what G you pick, is you can always find in G a nilpotent. Always find in G a nilpotent orbit, a nilpotent element whose centralizer has dimension equal to the rank of g. These are called regular nilpotent elements, so we call the corresponding W algebra a regular W algebra. These are also known as principal W algebras, which have probably been encountered by a lot of you before. And for the purpose of this talk, when we talk about simple quotients, we put the K on the bottom. So the simple quotient of the regular W algebra, same notation, but K. W algebra, same notation, but k is pushed down to the bottom. These have a very, very long history of very fruitful applications in both physics and mathematics. In particular, if we take K to be what's known as non-degenerate admissible, these are certain admissible levels, these simple quotient w algebras are the so-called wn minimal models, taking g to be sln, which is the example that we'll talk about. A lesser-known example, which is A lesser-known example, which is my example, is if you take a nilpotent element whose centralizer is dimension of the rank plus two. So these are called sub-regular nilpotent elements. These are also appear kind of naturally in singularity theory and some other areas of mathematics. The associated W algebras to sub-regular non-potent elements we call sub-regular W algebras. And again, simple quotient we denote with putting K on. Simple quotient we denote with putting k on the bottom. In contrast to the regular W algebras, these are becoming increasingly more important. However, outside of particular choices for G and K, they're a bit of a mystery. So they're structure and their representation theory, which are two very important things for physics. So in an attempt to understand these sub-regular W algebras, we want to think in terms of the following picture. So we're going to terms of the following picture. So we're going to stick to SLN. So this is type A. For SLN, nilpotent orbits can be indexed by partitions. Partitions admit a partial ordering known as dominance ordering. Long story short, you can define a kind of natural ordering on W algebras. And it looks like this. So this ordering on W algebras is induced by a certain ordering on nil-potent elements. For SL2, there's For SL2, there's kind of two choices for nilpotent elements. One gives you the affine vertex algebra itself, and then the classic regular W algebra. In this case, it's actually just Verasaro. For SL3, if we take the Napoten element zero, again, we get the affine vertex algebra. Take a sub-regular or minimal element in this case, we get the Byschevsky-Polychov algebra. And the regular W algebra for SL3 is just the sum of. Algebra for SL3 is just the summological algebra. Higher than, I think, when n is greater than five or six, this stops being a chain and it starts branching. So it's a genuine partial ordering. So again, recalling that admissible levels are the ones that are kind of potentially maybe important. What's nice about this picture is that if we fix a non-degenerate admissible level, what exactly that means is not particularly important, but say if we take one of the non-degenerate admissible levels, If we take one of the non-degenerate admissible levels, the W algebra at the bottom of this ordering is rational. And as a result, it's well understood, just by nature of these things being kind of studied for a very long time. If one picks an admissible level that's not non-degenerate, so a degenerate admissible level, the W algebra at the bottom of this chain now becomes zero, or its simple quotient becomes zero, but somewhere along Zero, but somewhere along this ordering, we will hit a rational W algebra somewhere. So the idea is that, so regardless of what admissible level we choose, somewhere on this chain, we will hit the rational W algebra, even if everything above it is non-rational. So because these rational points in these paths are well understood, what we want to do in a kind of lofty sense is push that rational information back up the chain. Back up the chain and learn something about the non-rational W algebras sitting on top of them. A related question is what these arrows are. So we want to think of each one of these arrows as a kind of a partial Hamiltonian reduction. So Hamiltonian reduction is this process of this homological process. We want to imagine that there's some partial reduction procedure, and this pushing information up is inverting this reduction broadly. Spelling it out completely. Broadly. Spelling it out completely, what we really mean is that if this F1W algebra sits on top of this an F2W algebra, then we want to construct an embedding of the following form. Essentially, if we can reduce from the F1W algebra to the F2W algebra by killing off some degrees of freedom, we want to reinsert them by hand by tensoring with a lattice vertex algebra and trying to find an embedding. So that's the sense in which this means. So that's the sense in which this means embedded. This is an inverse. This is in general really hard. So what we want to do is maybe the first step. So knowing that the chains before always had the regular on the bottom and the sub-regular one above, the first inversion that we're almost always going to have to do is that bottom most arrow. And moreover, knowing that the regular W algebras are rational at non-degenerate admissible levels, we want to think about how to. How to learn about sub-regular W algebras, which are not rational, but are related to rational regular W algebras in that way. And again, to spell it out, what we want is an embedding of this form. And then we want to see, with this embedding in hand, if we can define it, we want to see what this embedding tells us about the subregular W algebra when the regular W algebra is rational. So So for V, we choose the following. So our lattice vertex algebra, in this case V, is this half lattice vertex algebra, a study by Berman, Dong, and Tan. One can think of this as kind of a two-dimensional half, a two-dimensional lattice vertex algebra, but we only take one direction in the vertex operators. So this, as it turns out, is actually very closely related to the history of this inverse. Closely related to the history of this inverse reduction. So, this is actually the vertex algebra that was used by Semikartov in 1994, where he performed this inverse reduction procedure for SL2, albeit through a string theoretic kind of lens. So broadly, so quite nicely, the case that Semikartov actually did in 1994 is the SL2 case of the embedding that I'm going to talk about today. So, to see what that case is. To see what that case is. So, for SL2, the subregular W algebra is actually the affine vertex algebra because it's the one that's one on top of the regular. And the regular W algebra is the Verasaro vertex algebra, which a lot of you know a lot about. So, as worked out by Semikartov and then rederived by Adamovich in terms of vertex algebras, if we take k not critical, one can define a conformal embedding. One can define a conformal embedding of affine vertex algebra into Verasoro tensored with this half lattice. The embedding looks like the following. The particular form is not too important. All we want to note here is that the Heisenberg field goes to a Heisenberg field, raising field goes to a raising field, and lowering goes to some stuff normally ordered product of the lowering operator. And importantly, this embedding actually descends to an embedding of simple quotients. To an embedding of simple quotients, so we can simple quotient on both sides if and only if the level satisfies its condition. So, what we want to think about is: well, this condition, if k does satisfy this condition, then SL2 is actually rational. So, in a way, this embedding is picking out points where non-rationality looks like it might occur. Now, again, going back to admissible levels, if we stick to non-degenerate admissible levels, so these are levels K. So these are levels k of this particular form. When k is of this form, the simple Verasoro algebra gives a Verasoro minimal model, which has been around for a long time. And we use this notation A1UV. Now, quickly, some consequences of this embedding is if we take the category of weight modules for A1UV, not highest weight modules, just weight modules, one can classify the simple objects and see. The simple objects in C. One can construct reducible modules. So, this is definitely not rational. This is worked out by David Rideau and Simon Wood. Then, modular transformations and fusion rules for A1UV can actually be written down. And key in this process is using this embedding and some other additional tools. But essentially, the modular data and fusion rules for A1UV can be written down in terms of the data for the Verasoro minimal models. The Verasoro minimal models by way of this embedding. So, the next example up is the example that I was working on for the first half of my PhD, which was the SL3 example. So for SL3, the sub-regular W algebra is the Bushvaski-Polycovalgebra. The regular W algebra is the Zamologicov algebra. So, the slides is broadly going to be a repeat of the last. Adamovich, Kosetsu, and Rideau worked out a conformal embedding for not critical K. Again, Heisenberg. Critical k again Heisenberg field goes to Heisenberg field. The embedding is conformal, raising goes to raising, lowering goes to some stuff product with some another lowering operator. Again, this conformal embedding descends to an embedding of simple quotients if and only if the level satisfies some conditions, which are not too complicated. And once again, we can start thinking about non-degenerate permissible levels. So take k to be of this form. And again, we use this funny notation. And again, we use this funny notation. These W3 UVs are W3 minimal models, as worked out by Zamolog in his original paper. And again, repeating what we saw for SL2, we take the category of weight modules for VP. So one can classify the simple objects in C. So this was done by myself, Kazuka Osotsu and David Rudeau last year. We can construct reducible objects as well. So BPUV is certainly non-national. Certainly non-rational. But fortunately, just like in SL2, you can work out modular transformations and fusion rules for BP, even though it's not rational. And again, all that information can be written down in terms of a rational W algebra, these W3 minimal models. And this is something that I'm currently putting together into a paper with David Riddeau. So for the general N case, so sub-regular to regular, in the last two examples, you can kind of You can kind of, with a cup of coffee in Mathematica, sit down and work this out by hand because the operator product expansions are relatively workable. You can kind of just brute force it. But for general end, you can't do that because the operator product expansions are very complicated. So the additional input we use here are screening operators. So the sub-regular W algebra emits a really nice free field realization as worked out by Neriki Gennart. As worked out by Neriki General, 2016. And to write it down, we do the following. So we take a Heisenberg vertex algebra whose OPEs look like this. And we take the beta-gamma ghost system. So the symplectic fermions or Weil algebra or whatever you prefer to call them. Now, when K is not critical, the subregular W algebra embeds into the tensor product of these vertex algebras. And moreover, And moreover, the subregular W algebra can be identified as the kernel of certain screening operators. So we see this beta of here coming from the beta-gamma GO system and these exponential vertex operators. So a good question to ask here is, well, I mean, we've got this free field realization. How does this help from a regular W algebra point of view? And the reason this helps is that going back to Fateyev and Lukyanov, again, taking K not critical. Again, taking K not critical, you can actually embed the regular W algebra into this Heisenberg vertex algebra on its own, and the screening operators are suspiciously similar to the subregular. So we notice that the only difference between the screening operators for the subregular and the screening operators for the regular is this factor of beta. So what we want to do is we want to get rid of the beta. And the way we're going to do it is we're going to absorb it essentially into the vertex operator. That's the idea. Essentially, into the vertex operator. That's the idea. So, what we do is, so as it turns out, this half lattice is chosen very nicely because the beta-gamma system actually embeds into the half lattice. And under that embedding, beta can be identified with e to the c. Now, we compose that bosonization with the free field realization for the sub-regular W algebra, and we can write a new free field realization for the sub-regular W algebra. For the subregular W algebra. And it looks like this: this last screening operator is the bosonization screening operator. And these first n minus one kernels are the ones from the Naoki-Kenras pre-fidualization. And as you see, we've kind of tucked away beta into alpha one tilde, which is why we get this funny deformation. So why this looks really good, because these first n minus one screening operators are kind of superficially the same as the regular W algebra screening operators. As the regular W algebra screening operators, the problem is that these first n minus one vertex operators act on pi as well, whereas a regular W algebra only cares about the Heisenberg part. As it turns out, so something I've worked out and I'm currently putting into a paper now is we can actually just take the so these alpha tilded fields span a sub-algebra of the tensor product. And if one considers all um and if one considers all fields in h alpha tilde not in h alpha these form another copy of the half values so we can somewhat change this is somewhat like a change of basis essentially so we can rewrite h alpha tilde tensor pi as h alpha sorry h alpha pi h alpha pi is isomorphic to h alpha tilde pi and this is really nice because if we act on h alpha tilde pi Alpha tilde pi with these screening operators, these screening operators don't see pi, and the regular W algebra is precisely the intersection of these kernels. So what we get from this argument is essentially that there exists an embedding of the subregular into the regular tensive of pi. And the known screening operator, the only remaining screening operator, is the screening operator over here, this one corresponding to the bosonization. And moreover, from some other arguments, And moreover, from some other arguments, you can show this is conformal. So, some consequences from this existence result is: well, even stronger than an existence result. So, owing to some results from Genera and Kuwabara, we can actually write down strong generators for the sub-regular W algebra in terms of field and pi and a certain basis for the irregular W algebra using the so-called Miura transform. And just like in the SL2 and SL3 cases, we can work out. And SL3 cases, we can work out when this descends to an embedding of simple questions. And this is precisely when the level satisfies these final conditions. So, again, these conditions reproduces exactly what we saw in SL2 and SL3. And again, so going back to representation theory, if we take non-degenerate admissible levels, the regular W algebra at these levels is rational. These are Wn minimal models. Via the embedding, we can construct a continuous family of simple sub-regular W algebra modules. So, if we just consider weight modules for the sub-regular, we know automatically that this is non-rational. And moreover, because we've constructed these relaxed modules by the embedding, one can write down characters fairly easily and compute an action of the modular S matrix on the characters. On the characters of relaxed modules for the subregular. And as it turns out, the modular data for the subregular W algebra is proportional to the subregular or the S matrix for the regular at these levels. So the next step here is fusion, using the same kind of approach as SL2 and SL3. This is a little bit more difficult because there's not a lot of information known about. There's not a lot of information known about, for example, the vacuum module, high-throughput modules, but it appears that everything that worked for n is equal to 2 and n is equal to 3 looks like it works for SLN. So some future directions really quickly, because I think I'm very close to out of time. So broadly, so just very quickly, this approach actually works for C2 as well. So we don't even need to be simply laced. Does it work for all sub-regular W algebras of whatever type we choose? Regular W algebras of whatever type we choose. We want to think about maybe, well, what about other pairs of nilpotent elements? This whole representation theoretic discussion was just non-degenerate admissible levels. We could ask, well, what about the degenerate admissible levels? For Pophatsky-Polykov, some stuff is known, but not complete knowledge. And finally, there's kind of the correspondence between affine W algebras and finite W algebras by And finite W algebras by the z functor. So there should be a finite W algebra analog of this inverse reduction procedure. So that's something else that we're looking into. But that's all I have to say. Thank you for listening.
