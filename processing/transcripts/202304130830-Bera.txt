Shall I start? Yes, yes, please. No, yeah, okay. I really didn't hear, so sorry. Yeah, so yeah, thanks, thanks for asking me to speak about our work. So it's really delightful, actually. So yeah, so I'm going to speak about uniform attracting basins and Heron maps. Okay, so it's a attempt to explain our recent work explaining the Our recent work explaining the Bedford's conjecture. So let's begin. So, yeah, I think my screen is visible. Okay, that's okay, right? Yeah. So let me explain. So the first, the Bedford's conjecture speaks about that if F is a complex manifold and F is an automorphism. It's just a Bedford's question: if F is an automorphism of M. And if we start with a compact set which is compact. With a compact set which is completely invariant under the action of F, then with a stable dimension M, then the question rests was whether the stable manifold is biholomorphic to Cm or not. Well, this is a sort of stronger case of the stable manifold theorem, which states that if such a case happens, the stable manifolds are biholomorphic to a complex manifold. So, this was a stronger version of the stable manifold theorem, and it is a consequence of Sternberg. And it is a consequence of Sternberg's theorem, which states that if K is a singleton point, then the stable manifold is biholomorphic to Cm. So, in this context, the question was raised. And Johnson and Marolin in 2002 answered the above question by with respect to a measure that all the stable manifolds with respect to almost every points with respect to a measure mu and K is biholomorphic to Cm. So, of course, the result was more general than. Course, the result was more general than this. They spoke about something called the oscillatic points, but yeah, when restricted to a compact invariant set, it would give rise to a measure. Okay. And in 2004, this question was realized as a question for non-autonomous attracting basins, which stated as: yeah, and it was realized by Foreigners and Stensions in 2004, which stated. Tensions in 2004, which stated us that if Fn is a sequence of uniformly attracting sequence of automorphisms of Cm, that is the satisfy this condition, that is the behavior of Fns at a ball around the origin satisfy this uniform bound condition, then the baseline of attraction would be biholomorphic to Cm. And the question, it is a question. The question, it is a question, and this implied an affirmative answer to Bedford's question. So, that was the motivation to study this. And the reason that this boils down to a question on attracting basins is because of the fact, because of Rosie Rudian's result. I think Rosie Rudian's result has been stated in this, like in this conference more than once, which states that if I start with an automorphism of CM. Start with an automorphism of CM, which is admitting and attracting fixed point at the origin. Then the bisin is bioholomorphic to CM. And it turns out, so I have that, I will explain it a bit. So and it turns out that Sternberg's result is equivalent to Rosé Rudin's result. So let me just go forward and try to explain them. So as I said, Rosé Rudin's result speaks about auto. Rosenodin's reserve speaks about autonomous basins of attractions. And if I start with an automorphism of Cm, and if P is an attracting fixed point, the basin by attracting basin of F is bioholomorphic to Cm. Okay, so the idea of the proof roughly depends upon constructing a conjugacy, well, a sequence of conjugacy to a triangular map. So I have roughly, so this is not a correct. So, this is not a correct replication of their proof. Their proof involved a bit more computation, but I just tried to pick out certain important steps from the proof. So, what happens is after certain stage, not immediately F, but after certain stage, one can get hold of a triangular automorphism and a triangular polynomial, lower triangular or upper triangular, whatever is like it's similar, but one can get hold of a lower triangular or polynomial automorphisms in the sense triangle. Automorphisms in the sense triangular automorphisms of the form this, like in C2, if I try to restrict it is of the form Tz1, Z2 going to Az1 from a BZ2 plus CZ1 and the polynomial on Z2. So the dependence on the second polynomial is only on Z2. So if one can get hold of a polytriangular automorphism such that if I try to look at, one can draw a commutative diagram like that up to jets of. Like that up to z suborder d. So that means I can, if I restrict it to the degree d terms, the power series expansion up to degree d terms, then it is possible to find x i's of this one. And what they additionally proved that this x i's can be replaced with a single x, and they are local, locally injective functions on a small enough ball. So I'm assuming my p is origin. So locally. Locally injective on a small enough ball. So we can actually speak about this function phi. Well, a sequence of functions in the term T inverse of I compose X of A Pi, which eventually converges to a biholomorphism between the attracting basin of the triangular map and the attracting basin of the given map, like the automorphism that we started with. So, and it is a known fact that if I start with a triangle, fact that if I start with a triangular automorphisms, its basin of attraction, attracting triangular polynomial automorphism, its basin of attraction is biholomorphic to Cm. Hence, these results prove that since these two basins, I can explicitly, it is possible to construct explicitly a bioholomorphism. One can prove that the basin of attraction of a single function f is bioholomorphic to Cm. Okay, so to attempt our To attempt our question on non-autonomous basins, this technique has been tweaked, and well, a lot of effort has been given on this existing technique. And let me try and explain one important consequence that could be obtained from this technique itself. So, okay, so if I so it is a result due to Peters and appeared in 2007. Peters appeared in 2007, which said that if I start with an automorphism of Cm and then there exists epsilon small enough such that if fn's and f are at a the distance between fn and f is less than epsilon on the ball of radius 0, 1. So basically the fns are close enough to f on the ball of radius 0, 1. Then the non-autonomous basin is biholomorphic to Cm. Is bioholomorphic to CM. So, this is a result for non-autonomous families. And definitely, we are pushing the epsilon fact can be chosen in such a way. So, it's chosen in such a way that Fns are uniformly attracting at the origin in the sense they admit the constraints A and B. And okay. And yeah, so it is proof that one can find an epsilon small enough such that if I choose a sequence which is obtained by Sequence which is obtained by perturbing F sufficiently small, the basin of attraction is biolomorphic to Cm. The proof essentially relies on the crux of Rosé Rudin's idea, which says that one can come up. So since epsilon is chosen appropriately small, such that we can construct the conjugacies with the sequence of triangular maps. So here we construct conjugasis. So here one construct. Uh, conjugacies, so Erbone construct conjugacies of triangular maps t1, t2, t3 with respect to x i's, and this construction is pretty technical. Okay, it involves computing certain coefficients appropriately and up to certain so I am not specifying what this d is, I will specify the requirement of the d at the appropriate stage, but it essentially depends on epsilon how how. Depends on epsilon, how I am perturbing the map F. So one can construct these maps appropriately, Xi's. And these Xi's have, well, I didn't say about this. So one can choose the FNs in an appropriate way, such that their linear part is a lower triangular map. So we construct a sequence of triangular automorphisms of the form. Automorphisms of the form. So, this is constructed appropriately. So, essentially, this diagram is kept in mind and constructed as jets of order D. And what happens is, at the end, we can try and construct, so construct this sequence, a limit of this objects, ti inverse xi compose fi appropriate limit, a sequence of Sequence of automorphisms from well, it is a priori, not a sequence of automorphisms. It might be defined on small enough neighborhoods, but the limit map psi makes sense on the attracting basin of Fi. And it turns out that it is on 1-1 injective map. So it gives a bipolar morphism between the basin of attraction of the triangular map and the basin of attraction of the sequence Fn. Okay, so and it is not hard to check. So, and it is not hard to check that if I start with a sequence of triangular maps having at admitting an uniformly attracting fixed point at the origin, their basin of attraction will be whole of Cm. So, the triangular maps are well studied, well understood up till now. So, and their dynamics is not difficult at all. So, yeah, so we can say that their basin of attraction is biological is equal to Cm, and thus in this case. To Cm, and thus, in this case, one can prove the biholomorphism, the basin of attraction of the sequence Fn at the origin is biholomorphic to Cm. So just let me state over here. So an application of this theorem can actually answer many cases of the many cases of Bedford's conjecture. For example, if B squared is example if b square is less than a so i have this a less than b so if b square is less than a less than b that is answer answered also uh if f n's are of the form f n z such that it is of t f n 0 z plus order k terms and you can so uh well these are this b square less than a can be answered but B square less than a can be answered, but I think there is another proof due to forners and all of this fact. And if this is of the form order k, then you if this is satisfied, then also one can prove that omega fn0 is biholomorphic to Cm. Okay, so there are multiple applications of this idea, and I think the last result in this direction was. in this direction was even this in this situation even in this situation you can push p to be p to the power k plus 1 less than a less than b it was due to peters and sme this is the last result that could be pushed and the ideas essentially so the last part module or the last result every other result dependent on actually looking into this technique a bit more carefully so okay so Okay. So, and what we understand is this technique is a reminiscence of Rosé Routine's idea. So, okay. So we proved this result. So the general result in SWE2, that is, if I start with any non-autonomous sequence of uniformly attracting sequence of functions at the origin, the basin of attraction is bioholomorphic to CM. We prove. To CM. We prove this result by diverting our attention towards anon maps. So initial step. So let me outline the proof. And if at all I get time, I will get into the proof of the general case as well. But for the time being, let me discuss the proof of Pedford's conjecture in C2. So, okay. So we start with starting with the fact that we start. Starting with the fact that we start with a sequence of NR maps such that they are satisfying the uniformly attracting condition at the origin. That is, there exist constants A and B such that the behavior of Hns is bounded by A times norm Z and B times norm Z. And Hn is a sequence of Non maps of bounded degree. So this bound on the degree is very important. This bound on the degree is very important. We cannot let loose this bound. So, all the Helon maps have a bounded degree, some degree with, yeah, it's bounded with some degree. That's all we have to assume. Then it is possible to prove that the basin of attraction of the henon maps at the origin is bioholomorphic to C2. So, just for the clarification, so sometimes henon maps are considered at considers as polynomial automorphisms of C2 with non-intersecting individual. Of C2 with non-intersecting indeterminacy sets. But to me, I will restrict my attention to the classical way of defining Henon maps that is H going to Y comma Py minus AX. And we look at finite composition of maps. So we know like we have seen this multiple times. If I compose two henon maps, it's still a henon map and it's the indeterminacy sets are still the same and all those things are continuous. And the inverse is also like conjugate to a henon. Is also like conjugate to a henon map. Okay, the main motivation to move our attention towards triangular automorphisms to henon maps is first of all because the henon maps in C2, as we know from Fred Milner, that they are the most important class of polynomial automorphisms with non-trivial dynamics. And yeah, otherwise the dynamics. Otherwise, the dynamics is understood. And yeah, so if one can prove something for Henon maps, it's expected that it will go beyond. So we so yeah, so the idea was to look for the analog of this result for henon maps first. So okay, it turns out that in such a situation, the basin of attraction of henon maps is bioholomorphic to C2. So let me just try and explain roughly a few steps involved in proving this. Steps involved in proving this theorem. So, yeah. And the proofs are classical. So, if there is any question, I can answer. If I can hear something, is there a question? Not at the moment. Okay, thanks. Okay, so yeah. So, let me start with the assumption that I started with. So, Hn is a sequence of Non maps and it is uniformly attracting at the origin. Attracting at the origin. So, what happens is you can just use Cauchy estimates to say that if a coefficient of some degree coefficients of Hn is non-zero, it should be bounded by some values within A and B. So, that is one thing that we can immediately see. And this gives me the facts. And since we are starting with Henon maps with bounded degree, we can claim that it has a uniform radius of filtration. radius of filtration. Well, filtration is the sets Vr plus, Vr minus and Vr where the sets where the behavior, so there exists a large n of R such that in Vr plus Hn of Vr is a Hn of Vr is a subset of Vr plus, Hn Hn inverse of Vr minus is a subset of Vr minus. So if you look if one looks into this Vr plus and Vr minus, we are demanding a unique We are demanding an uniform behavior of the agents at Vr plus and Vr minus. And well, what is happening is we are demanding a uniform neighborhood of I plus, which is a super attracting fixed point for the Henon maps when you move to the projected plane. There is a uniform neighborhood where the behavior of HN is controlled. That's what we are demanding when we say that it has a uniform radius of filtration. And that is given by our. And that is given by your assumption. This is given by your assumption on the uniformity at the origin. So this is pushed. It's not only pushed, one can actually obtain stronger filtration identities in terms of the non-autonomous sequence. In the sense, we have the constants, uniform constants and the constant r, such that on vr plus the time. That on Vr plus, the dynamics of HN is controlled by the filtration identities that I have written down over here. So, this is true for a single Hanon map. A single Hanon map, we can have a uniform radius of filtration and uniform constants M and M. But it turns out for this sequence also, we get this constants. And okay, so what this gives me is that there is certain uniformity of the behavior of the agents at the I plus and I minus. Okay, so. I minus. Okay, so this allows us to construct what is called the construct the analog of Green's function from the one-dimensional Henon math from the single Henon math. Okay, so moving on to the other properties, if I one knows the set K plus represents the collection of all points whose orbit is bounded, and K minus is the set of all points whose orbit is bounded. Points which orbit is bounded under H inverse of N. So yeah. So it turns out the identities similar to autonomous cases of Henon maps holds in the sense K plus and K minus K plus and U plus. So U plus is the Paisin of attraction of I plus in the projective space and U minus is the Paisin of attraction of I minus in the projective space. In the projective space, and they eventually complement each other. This is a phenomena that doesn't pull off to general polynomial automorphisms in C3 onwards. So, this is something that is enjoyed by the polynomial automorphisms in C2. So, for the henon maps, nice identities. So, this is also satisfied for a sequence of henon maps with uniform filtration bounds. Okay, and it is evident. Okay, and it is evident that the boundary of k plus is the Julia set. So, if I draw into this picture, I just left this picture a bit open. So, the k plus sits somewhere over here and k minus sits somewhere over here, as it is for the case of non-maps. It's not a very difficult observation to see these things as such. And this essentially follows that we are pushing on a uniform filtration radius for the sequence of. Radius for the sequence of enormous. Okay. So this gives me. So since these identities and everything are on places, similar to single han-on maps, dynamics of single anon maps, we can construct the Green's function, the dynamical positive and negative Green's function as constructed for the case of single hanon map. So it is just the limit. So as explained, it is just the. It is just so as again at infinity, it is blowing up at infinity at a super exponential level. So, yeah, so we just control that, capture that. So, log plus of the growth of Hnz by the degree. So, this is the degree of Hn basically. And the same happens for GH minus. So, what is possible over here? So, if we start with this construction. I start with this construction of Green's function. One can prove that this Green's function is pluricubharmonic and continuous function on C2, and it admits logarithmic growth at Vr plus or at the neighborhood of I plus or I minus. So both GHN plus minus. And the set K is obtained as a zero set of the Grinz function. And both GH plus and minus is fluorihormone. Plus and minus is fluoriharmonic on the escaping set, and uh yeah. And the result that if I take ddc of this, the current corresponding to the Grinz function is supported on the Julia set. Okay. Okay. So these are basically the results that generalize from BS1 corresponding to one iterative. So these are generalizations of the results from BS1. So this is kind of evident because it So, this is kind of evident because it's like a compact behavior of a compact family over compact families of non-maps. So, these results are kinds of expected. So, generalization of G-ingrence functions from BS1 basically. So, that's yeah, this is the first basical first things that we studied. Yeah, so and also the current is supported on the Julia set. So, essentially, we captured the Julia set via the Grinz function as it happens for the single. As it happens for the single henon map, and yeah, so if I now look into the basin of attraction of the henon maps, its boundary is definitely contained inside the Julia set. So that's kind of evident because it's boundary of it's a boundary. But yeah, so what happens for the case? So let me go through the next slide and try to explain. So what happens in the next case is Next case is, yeah, we cannot actually claim that it is whole of Julia set. We can, so in this slide itself, we said that this, we can say that the boundary of the basin of attraction of the Henon map is a subset of the Julia set of the positive Julia set. But claiming that they are equal, we don't, we cannot claim it as of yet, as of now. But yeah, there is one bit of problem to claim that exactly. One bit of problem to claim that exactly that is equal. I like I didn't complete the proof as of yet, so yeah, but this is something that is true for uh iterative henon maps or single henon maps family. So let me try and explain them once. So yeah, so if I start with uh so we started with a sequence anon map now, if I focus our attention to Hn, that is restricting fixing our n and looking at the map Hn at the N epsilon. The map Hn at the nth stage. So it is a finite composition of anon maps. So the general theory of anon maps applies to this class. So one can speak about the Green's function corresponding to Hn. And so we speak about the Green's function corresponding to individual HNs. Okay. And yeah, that's the definition. And we just recall the definition over here. So it's a standard definition that's not. So yeah. So we can speak about the So, we can speak about the general henon maps, Hn, the Henon maps, and the Green's function at every stage. We call them Gn. So, and also, since I started with an attracting family, right? So, at the uniformly attracting family of NRN maps, so every Hn has an attracting fixed point at the origin. So, since every Hn has an attracting fixed point at the origin. Attracting a fixed point at the origin, the basin of attraction corresponding to every Hn will be biholomorphic to C2. That's a consequence of Rose-Rudine. So what I have is I have a sequence omega n, which is biholomorphic to C2, corresponding to every HN. And the BS1 itself says this, right? That if I look at the boundary of del omega n, that is the boundary of n that is the boundary of h n's attracting basin of h n at the origin this is equal to j plus of h n that is just by understanding the current the convergence of current that's and the basins are equal that's that is a result because it's a attracting fixed point so it's it's kind of hyperbolic and all those things okay so what this gives me so this gives me a sequence of green's function somewhere and function somewhere and a existing constructed grains function coming from the non-autonomous family. So the question is how do these two sequences, this the sequence of grains function over here and the final grains function for the autonomous family relates and it turns out that this sequence g n the sequence of grains functions from individual agents they converge uniformly to the function g plus so this is an important observation to make This is an important observation to make that is G n plus converges to the corresponding non-autonomous Green's functions, non-autonomous dynamical Green's functions over the compact subset sub C2. So there is an uniform convergence over there. And since there is a uniform convergence over there, one can claim so the DDC of G n plus minus also converges to D D C of G plus minus of H n. So what happens? So well this is a What happens? So, well, this is an atrocious. It's not true as such, but I will claim something over here. Well, that is the motivation to go beyond and look into constructing explicitly the biholomorphism. What happens is this is this I can identify. So, this support of this fellow, I can identify this to del omega n and this is jn plus. So, what happens is if I So, what happens is if I also, if I look into the closure of del omega n, it is just i minus over there. So, this is, well, I'm not making sense of the convergence over here. So, it somehow feels that it converges to j plus hn closure, something like this. It's it's well, this is a wrong statement because I'm not making sense of the convergence of the sets as such. And if I try to remove the closure, it's non-compact, so convergence. Closure, it's non-compact, so convergence doesn't really make sense. So, yeah, but it kind of feels that the currents converges, the support of the currents converges to the boundary. So why not try to construct the biholomorphism from otherwise tools that we have in hand? So, that's that was the motivation to look into actual construction of a biholomorphism on omega etching. So, okay, so what happens is so. So, what happens is, so we mimic the technique. This appeared while there was a paper on a paper of old where he did something on increasing union of Fatu Paperbug domains that embeds in CM. So yeah, so using some techniques from Manderson-Lempert theory. So, what we observe first is if I take a compact subset of the basin of attraction of HNs, it is Attraction of H n's, it is contained in the omega n's so it is contained in the omega n's for n sufficiently large. So, for a sufficiently large, so these are every compact set of Hn is getting sitting inside omega n's for large genome. So, now the next step is a natural step is to look at the exhaustion by compacts of the basin of attraction. So, we look at we choose a basin come exhaustion by compacts of the omega HNs. Compacts of the omega h n's, and it turns out that correspondingly, I get a sequence nl so yeah, so I get so I get a sequence C sitting inside omega N L. Okay, C L sitting inside omega N L. So explicitly I construct corresponding to a exhaustion pi compacts, I pick out F domains omega n L's correspondingly. And what happens is. And what happens is I have the biholomorphisms φL defined from omega nl to c2. Okay, so that is already there because we know omega nls are biholomorphic to c2 by rosy-rudy. So the question is whether now since all the compacts are sitting inside that can we appropriately normalize this bio amortine and make sense of the limit, the technique that appeared in, I think it's an old technique due to textual asterisk. A old technique due to teaching astronomer for putting taking limits of automorphisms, appropriate, making sense of appropriate limits of automorphisms. So, yeah. So, it turns out, so I didn't really explain how do we normalize, but we have to take appropriate compacts and do some changes with respect to some ideals you can Anderson-Lemper theory to make this construct this sequence of normalized automorphisms, normalized biholomorphisms. Normalized biholomorphisms such that the limit makes sense and the limit is injective. So we make sense of not only make sense of the limit, but the limit is a injective map. That is a injective map from the basin of attraction of Hn. I exactly don't know the domain, but for here the domain, the range was C2 that I knew. So the question is to check whether the range is C2 or not. But here, this is a But here, this is a very crucial fact that we use that g n plus converges to g plus of h n. There is a uniform convergence convergence on the case of prince function over compacts. We use this crucially to obtain that the domain, the range is whole of C2, thus getting a biholomorphism from the basin of attraction of HN to the whole of C2. Okay. Of C okay. So, any questions so far? If there is any questions, I will be very happy to answer because I think I'm just speaking on my side. It is a question. It is a top question. Jasmine, could you give one hint for the last hint? Did you hear that? The relationship between the straight function and the range of files. Yeah, so what we start off is: I take a ball in the C2 and we pull it back by files. And if at all, if G H N plus. All if g h n plus is greater than at some point, we know there is an uniform convergence, so that z will go out of omega image of omega n l that's the idea. So it's just just handling those uniform convergence appropriately. If at all there is a point in C2 which is not contained in the pre-image of omega h n0, it will turn out that g that point will also have this. Will also have this that will be the problem. Pre-images of phi nlz. So it's not exactly this, just give me a moment. Yeah, so g n plus of phi n l inverses of z, this will also sometimes will be greater than zero. I can that will be the contradiction. That's the problem. And that is the reason, like we obtained that the attracting at the escaping set, the Green's function is vanishing completely. So those. Vanishing completely. So, those identities were nice enough. So, yeah. Yeah. So, this kinds of completes the argument that if I start with a non-autonomous sequence of uniformly attracting sequence of hon maps, the basin of attraction of this is biholomorphic to C2. Next, we move on to a next step: that how do we use this fact to further generalize the result for the general class of automorphism? Okay. Of automorphism. Okay, so what we prove is given a general class of automorphisms which is uniformly attracting at the origin, one can construct. So, well, so it's uniformly attracting at the origin, I can choose d0 such that this happens, right? A is less than b, but since all of them are less than a, I can choose a large n of d naught such that p of b raised to the power d0 is less than a less than b. So I have a d0. There is always an existence of d0. There is always an existence of d naught. So, what we prove is that one can construct a sequence of non-autonomous henon maps such that of degree bounded by d0 plus one, such that both of them are non-autonomously conjugated. And I claim that once we prove that our result is true, we can prove that the basin of attractions of Fn is biholomorphic to C2 by By the most important result on this, like I think it is the without this result, we couldn't have done anything is the result due to Abhate, Abonola, and Meyer, which appeared in 2015, which said that if so, if so if I when I was stating Rosé Rudin's theorem, it was like a conjugacy of with triangular maps, but this result is stronger in the sense that as long as we can obtain a conjugacy between two families. Conjugacy between two families of endomorphisms up to order subjects D naught, where D naught is as obtained previously, P to the power D naught less than A less than B. The basins, well, we cannot say about their basins because they are just endomorphisms, but what we can say is their abstract basins, their abstract basins are biholomorphic. So, yeah, so if I start with the sequence of endomorphism, the attracting basin doesn't make sense as such, but Doesn't make sense as such, but we can make sense of what is called the abstract patients, and their abstract patients are either. So it's the same diagram, but now the sequence of we can interplay with the sequence of maps. So that's an advantage that we have in this situation. And yeah, so the moment we can construct a non-autonomous conjugacy appropriately, we can say that their abstract basins are biholomorphic. But I think, again, it was a reminiscence of Fornas and. It was a reminiscence of Fernas and Stenson's paper, which says that one, if I can construct the abstract basins, the abstract basins will be biholomorphic to the actual attracting basins by when these maps are automorphisms. So it is probable that abstract basins will be biholomorphic to the actual attracting basins if my sequence HN or Fn are automorphisms of C or C2 or CN. Same. So, as long as we have this general non-autonomous result, if we can prove our last theorem, that is, given a sequence, if I can conjugate it with a non-anoton, please conjugate with a sequence of anon maps, our result is done. So, the next goal is to construct the sequence of anon maps, which does our goal. So, again, that is a constructive argument, and it is indeed a computational argument, which speaks, which essentially builds. Which speaks, which essentially builds upon Rosé Rudin's idea or Han Peter's idea of constructing the non-autonomous sequence. So, yeah. So, let me just quickly go through this. And this involves some technical steps, which I will skip. So, yeah. Okay. So, what we start with is we sequence, start with a sequence of Fn and we can assume that there. Assume that their linear part is a triangular part. So that's a fair assumption to start with. And then what happens is if I just look at the power series expansion of this, ignore the terms involving both x and y. So these are the terms that I will explain. Ignore and I will take note only those terms. So just let me use the different color. I'll note only these kinds of terms that appears in. These kinds of terms that appear in the expansion. I will only take a note of this kind of terms. And what happens is, well, this is not exactly perturbation. So if I this is not exactly in the denot jet, but from this E n's, we can construct a polynomial of this form and well, I don't know what happens. So another polynomial of this form from the E n's and g n's respectively. And we construct. And we construct a henon map of this form. So, yeah. So, essentially, we keep a construct this ENI's and GNIs from the pure terms of the power series expansion of Fn and look into this Henon maps and throw in this term purposefully so that there is an uniform filtration radius and a uniform filtration bounds. These terms are purposefully thrown in. And since each of these are henon maps, Since each of these are henon maps, if I look into their composition, this is also a henon map. And yeah, so it is a bit of a constructive argument to actually come up with that. So if I look into this HNs and the Fn's that I started with, one can construct the sequence Xn such that this relationship holds. So this is equal to Hn inverse compose Xn composed Fn truncated at the point T0 plus 2 or Upon d0 plus 2 or d0 plus 1. You can contrun truncate it at d0 plus 1 as well. Okay, so it doesn't really matter. So this construction makes sense. And the moment this construction makes sense, I can say that it is non-autonomously conjugated. So the basin of attraction of Hn is biholomorphic to the basin of attraction of M. This proves the case for C2 and it indeed involves the dynamics of Hn very crucially. Dynamics of HN very crucially, okay. But to move this argument to a general m. Uh, so I have a sufficient time, right? Some three, four minutes are left. So I will try to explain the general general case better. Yeah, so to trying to move on to this argument with the general case is first of all not a very straightforward because we do not have Fridnell and Milner's theorem over there. And okay, again, the automo, we don't. Okay, again, we don't understand the polynomial automorphisms also very nicely beyond C2. So, what happens is the first step is we rely strongly on AM theorem, so yeah. So, what we do is we start with the sequence Fn and then we construct a sequence. So, we give this name as weak shift. Give this name as weak shift-like maps. So, shift-like maps are maps of the form Z1, Z2, Zm going to Z2 to ZM. And here, there is a perturbation by a polynomial. It's no more. So, I think shift-like maps or case shift-like maps was introduced by Bedford and Pambuchin, but this is a generalization of that. So, I am allowing my polynomial to vary on all the coordinates. So, what we can do is we can construct a non-autonomous. Can construct a non-autonomous conjugacy of this sequence Fn with the sequence Gn, which is essentially M composition of shift-like maps. So this is what we can do. We can replicate that non-autonomous conjugacy diagram for a weak shift-like maps. So since we can replicate that weak shift-like maps, we can claim the last step that omega fn at the origin, the basin of attraction of fn's at the origin is at. Attraction of Fn's at the origin is biholomorphic to the Bayesian of attraction of Gn's at the origin, which is equal since this is just attracting, and one can prove that they are equal. So, it is not difficult to realize that they are equal. So, it's equal to the basin of attraction of the weak shifts at the origin. But even then, so the whole goal is to capture a class of functions, a class of sufficiently regular maps, polynomial maps in CM, for which we can replicate the. For which we can replicate the study of Rins function. So that was the idea. So, yeah. So, even then, looking into weak shifts is not good enough because, first of all, they are not regular. Even the weak regularity is not very nicely guaranteed because the polynomial PNs change at every stages. So, yeah. So, one has to take So, one has to take one more step, a little bit more stronger step than this, and we construct perturbs. We call it a deperturbed weak shift-like maps. Essentially, we take a shift-like map and throw in the terms z2 to the power d minus 1 and a big enough degree, a big enough term, a homogeneous term on z2 to zm on the last coordinate. And well, I did miss this assumption. So, pz's have a degree like. So, Pz's have a degree less than D. All the PZs have degree strictly less than D minus one. Sorry, so that's the thing that I missed this on this slide. So, PZ, so I am assuming that PZ is all having degree D minus less than degree D minus one. So, I throw, take a big enough degree and throw in these terms. So, what happens is this sequence, since PZ, the degree of PZs are all less than D, and I am throwing in. All less than d, and I am throwing in the high enough degrees. There is some amount of regularity ingrained on this sequence of maps. It is not regular again, it is also weakly regular, but we can so what happens is the forward dynamics is controlled by this term. And the backward dynamics, if you look into the backup inverse of this map, it the highest degree term is moved to Z1 and the backward dynamics. And the backward dynamics is controlled by the Z1 variable completely. So if it's not regular, but in fact, the dynamics can be understood in terms of trains function. And since I am throwing in large enough degrees, so I have started with a degree T naught. I have already constructed the conjugacy over there. So now I throw in big enough degrees here. So the conjugacy remains. So what happens? That we can prove that it is by. It is biholomorphic to the sequence of to the basin of attraction of D0 plus 2 perturbed sequence, perturbed sequence of shape-like maps. So this can be provable. And again, this proof is not at all technical. It is just writing down a few facts nicely, and the inverses are very well behaved. So this part is not at all technical. The technical part is step one. Well, Is step one. Well, I wouldn't say it's technical, it's computational. One has to carefully keep track of certain things and compute this identities out. So yeah. So what happens is we have reached up to the fact that the basin of attraction of Fn at origin is pivolomorphic to the basin of attraction of a sequence of D naught plus two perturbed sequence of shift-like maps. And now the And now, the last part of this theorem is to replicate the construction of Green's function for this specific class of shape-like maps. It turns out it can be replicated and the Green's function, as in the case of Henon maps, captures the basin of attraction to some extent. It can be done over here also. But that is exactly, you have to keep track of the dynamics a little bit more carefully. Little bit more carefully. And well, the fact that I'm drawing in homogeneous term poses that there is uniform radius of filtrations or uniform neighborhoods around the indeterminacies where the dynamics can be understood. So, and this kinds of completes the proof. So, I will not get into the proof of step three because it is exactly trying to replicate what we have done for Henon maps for the case of D0 plus two perturbed sequence of frequencies. Plus two perturbed sequence of fake shift-like maps. But it gives me that omega s n is biholomorphic to Cn. So this results complete that we start. So we have to apply the non-autonomous theorem twice and then come to the grains function argument. The argument is a bit complicated. That's that. I think again.
