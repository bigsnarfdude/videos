So yeah, I want to thank Kyle for a beautiful introduction to what I'm going to talk about today. When I was asked to give this talk, they asked me to present a bunch of good problems and even a solution. In fact, what I'm going to have to do is I in fact what I'm going to have to do is present a bunch of solutions and even good problems. So I'm a topologist. I'm going to be discussing a bunch of topological tools out of these references that I'll post afterwards. But these are tools for use in complex analysis, and I'll be giving some maybe surprising applications and examples of this that I thought of. Of this that I thought of as a topologist, but I'm hoping that some complex analysts here will see it from a very different point of view and find some problems to use these tools for that maybe I wouldn't have thought as a departress. So uh all right with that I uh I I'm gonna start with with uh I'm going to start with some questions. Of course, we're dealing with various sorts of convexity this week. And so I want to ask, given a complex surface, when can we find substance of it that are suitably convex, pseudo-convex, let's say? And I'm going to ask it in a very general way. In a very general way that is natural to a topologist, at least. Namely, if we take any open subset of a complex surface, when can we deform that somehow to make it into a Wallestein open subset? That would be the natural notion of pseudo-kinetic empirical. So, if the ambient complex surface happens to be shine, then that's what's called a domain of holomorphy. But I want to talk about this again here for any complex surface. So then what do I mean by deformed? Well, I mean isotoped. So we start with the inclusion map of this open subset and we homotope it through embeddings until Until at the end, we want to end up with an open set which is shying in the inherently complex structure. Now there's also a compact version of this question. So if we start with the compact form of all embedded inner complex surface, we can ask, when can we isotope it in the same way to be pseudo-complex? To be pseudo-convex, so now that natural motion is a compact stein, pseudo-convex boundary. And of course, whenever I say pseudo-convex here or like PC, I really mean strictly pseudo-conducts. I won't keep dragging that adverb all up and talk. And there are various ways of answering that. Answering that question. So starting with reference two, it turns out that both of these problems can be solved. We can always do the isotopy that we want to do, provided that the domain has the inherited almost complex structure, and the domain is at least homotopic through almost complex structures. All those complex structures to a sign structure. That's clearly a necessary condition, obviously. Yes. If you're compact for mindful, you're starting with something with smooth boundaries. Yes, for now. I'll relax that later. But for now, everything is smoother. So clearly, this condition I mentioned is necessary in that if I that if I do isotope the open set to make a Stein, then clearly, implicitly, I'm dragging that, I mean, I'm homotoping that complex structure, in fact, through honest complex structures in the case to make a Stein structure. So that condition is obviously necessary, but the deep thing here is that it's also sufficient. So why is this true? Well, we've sort of seen it comes from Elyasberg's technique. From Eliasberg's technique. And if you go back to Elyasberg's original paper, the way he made these handles convex in some sense is he wanted to make the cores totally real working inside of some larger complex surface, which may have been a handle of some sort, but it doesn't matter. He was working inside a complex surface already. So it shouldn't be surprising that... It shouldn't be surprising that his machinery works in that context. And, well, this paper was published in 2013, so all I had to work with back then was rough notes that would later become the Teeler-Bachel Joshua book. And so I had to do a lot of hard technical stuff that probably isn't necessary anymore. Or at least it would be easier. A lot of stuff, especially involving the screening condition that we heard about in the last. Condition that we heard about in the West. But nowadays the book is in print, and so not only would it be easier to do what I did, but in fact there's a theorem that implies this in all dimensions. I guess Kyle mentioned that his talk. But in any case, no matter how you prove this, let's look at some examples. Let's look at some examples. So let's look at what we can do first of all with contractible domain. Well, as we saw in the last talk, there's a standard technique for constructing compact contractible manifolds, even just with the sake of one handle and an algebraically canceling two handle. That will always be a contractible four-manifold. And if we take the framing to be sufficiently negative, Ellie Ashburg tells us that. Eliasberg tells us it's a stein. And then there's also a standard technique for taking such a manifold and embedding it smoothly into R4, C2, if you like. And now we look at this theorem. There's this hypothesis, but because the manifold is contractible, there's only one homotopy class of all those complex structures. So automatically, this embedding can be pinched on. So by that, That, for example, gives lots of examples of homology 3-spheres with pseudoconvex embeddings in C2, just because the boundary of a contractible form of hole is always some kind of a homology 3-sphere. So this gives us a whole mess of homology 3-spheres that pseudo-convex embeddings of C2. Now the technique doesn't work as well if you have a pre-assigned family of homology spheres in mind. You don't have Homology spheres in mind. You don't have so much control if you're just randomly drawing these link diagrams. So, what happens, for example, if we went to look at rescoring homology spheres? Well, I couldn't actually embed any of those in a pseudo-convex way inside of C2. So, in that paper reference to, there's a conjecture that, in fact, you can In fact, you can never embed a Greece-bane sphere in C2 with either orientation as the boundary of a smooth pseudoconvex domain. Since then, Mark and Tossin have at least proven that you can't do that embedding in such a way as to get a rationally convex domain. So that's some of our. Domain. So that's seven problems. But aside from that, for the more general question, that's completely open still as far as I'm aware. So there's one problem in the solution. But so that's really applying the questionnaire version to open subsets. But we can also ask. But we could also ask, or the question B version, how that substance, but we could also ask about the question A version and what we can do with that. And here we have, we heard in the last lecture about Stein exotic R4s and there's a whole family that, in fact, does embed in the Embed in the standard R4 and we can even draw link diagrams for it and just with the zero handle and a bunch of one and two handles. So in fact, in this 90s paper putting the animals that Kyle alluded to last time, one of the things I did was to prove that, in fact, you can. You could construct these things so that they actually were shy in the abstract. And then they automatically have these embeddings in C2. And once again, because they're contractible, the hypothesis for theorem 1 is automatically sending it. And so what that says is that, in fact, there are uncommonly many diffeomorphism types of exotic arbitraries that embed ash on an open substance of C2. Or another way of looking at it. Or another way of looking at it is that there are uncountably many open Stein subsets of C2, all of which are homeomorphic to R4, but are uncommonly in diffeomorphism types, realize. So that's one consequence that there are points. But now once we've got these, we can ask what happens if we take these and M yet when we And ambiently attach them with the one handle to other things. And so, what we can get out of that is that, in fact, every given n Stein-open subset is C2, then it's homeomorphic to uncountably many other diffeomorphism types of Stein-open subsets, all gotten by taking our uncountably many Stein-exotic R4s and attacking the fine diffeomorphism. And tacking and calling them to change it if you want. So, in fact, this is a very general result of what open subsets of two. So, Francesco, are these necessarily all infinite type, or is there. They're all going to have. Yeah, in fact, when it comes to exotic R4s, if you had one with only finite topological type. With the only finite topological type, you'd have a counterexample of the four-dimensional square-free conjecture. Sorry, what? It's not known if there's a finite type exotic theater. Yeah, again, if there were a finite exotic artifact, you'd have a kind of an example of the smooth Schoenfleas conjecture and the smooth forward mentioned a Poincare conjecture. So if you could find one, you'd probably have a Guilds metal, but you don't know whether they exist or not. Recorded. But, alright. So we've taken advantage here of contractibility to make this hypothesis trivial. What happens in more generality? Well, if there's homology in your domain, then we expect there to be a lot of almost complex structures in general up to homotopia. And then one way to proceed is to just keep careful track of those. Just keep careful track of those, which we can do as a design in Conwell's talk, and we'll address some examples later. But if that really gets in the way, there's another approach we can take. We can actually get rid of that hypothesis as long as we are willing to work in a topological category rather than smooth category. Well, what do I mean here? Well, instead of looking at smooth embeddings and smooth homotopies, we're just going to look at continuous embeddings and homotopies. So we're just doing C0 as the same thing, which in fact makes a really big change. And the feeling now from reference three is that in fact We look at any take any open subset of a complex surface, then there's a topological isotopy that sends it to a Stein open subset if and only if you can write it up to homeomorphism as the interior of a two-handle bump. Again, it's an obvious necessary condition. But in fact, that condition is also sufficient in the C0 settings, so we no longer. Zero sands, so we no longer need to talk about these all these complex structures. So let me a few words about why that's true. Before I do that, I should emphasize that this makes a really big change from the smooth point of view. Dimension 4, in fact, is the only dimension. Dimension 4, in fact, is the only dimension where, if you start with an open subset of a four-manifold, a smooth four-manifold, and you topologically isotope it, it typically changes the diffeomorphism type of the open subset you're looking at. That can only happen in dimension 4, but in fact, in dimension 4, it's actually fairly common. And what happens here is that even if we start with something really simple, like a not trace where you just have a zero head. Like a NOT trace where you just have a zero handle and a two handle, then when we apply this theorem, the result will usually have infinite type. So you'll need that to write it as the interior of a handle body, you'll need infinitely many halves. So now let's look at the basic idea of why that is true. That's true. And it's got a little picture, sort of standard picture that we always see for everyone. Well, what I'm going to do is go back to work of Cassin in the 70s and Friedman's Fields Middle Living work in the 80s that revolutionized topological formatfulness. So for the moment, we'll forget about the. So for the moment we'll forget about the complex part and just think about C0 and C infinity topology. And so there's this idea, going back to Casson, well the fundamental problem, the reason high-dimensional topology doesn't work in dimension four very well is that there are a lot of places where you need to construct, you want to find embedded two disks. And if you happen to be in Heimdimension, And if you happen to be in high dimensions, you can always wiggle the disc a little by general position, it's embedded. But in dimension four, you try to wiggle it, and the best you can do is get an immersion with isolated double points. So that's what I've drawn in half as many dimensions in these pictures of this old face curve that's supposed to represent an immersed two-disc informator attached to whatever the ray thing is. And so that remains. So that really is an insurmountable obstacle and differential topology at least. But Cassin, back in the days when we didn't know there was a difference between topological and smooth forms, said, well, okay, what's the difference between the image of this averse disk and a smooth disk? Well, the difference is that we have a fundamental group on this image coming from the double points. And so what Casson did was, let's calculate. And so what Cassin did was, let's kill this fundamental group by attaching more two disks. Of course, those we expect to be immersed as well. So it looks like we've made the problem worse and not better, which would have stopped a lot of us, but it didn't stop Casson. He said, well, let's take these double points and kill off their fundamental group with the third layer. And we'll kill the resulting fundamental group off of the fourth layer or the fifth layer and just go on forever. And then the maybe surprising thing that happens. Maybe surprising thing that happens is that resulting two complexes actually simply connect them. The point being that any loop is compact, so it lives in some finite sub-tower, and then you kill off the fundamental group at the next stage and you're done. Well then, Friedman put a good number of years into studying these castle handles and these regular, open and regular neighborhoods of these things. Things I've constructed. And his fundamental breakthrough was that, in fact, the Cassin handle is homeomorphic to an open 2 handle. So in fact, there actually is a topological disk where you want to find a disk, and that's really the key to doing topological format involved there. So later on. And later on, he saw that instead of using immersed disks, it's helpful to have embedded surfaces at some of your stages. If you put those in strategically, then it makes a lot of work simpler. And you can do that basically just by resolving the singularities every once in a time. So that's how topological form manifold theory runs now. And what's really interesting about this from our point of view. thing about this from our point of view is that what's maybe really surprising is that we can take all this topological stuff and make it compatible with Elyspur's work. So what we want to do is take this two complex and make it totally real. And as we saw in the last talk, well even if you start out with a smooth two disk in the beginning, you can't usually make it totally real because there's this obstruction involving the framing. And that's why, for example, And that's why, for example, S2 cross D2 is a very simple two-handle body, and you can't make its interior Stein, as we saw that in the last talk, because of the screening obstruction. But if you are willing to use immersed disks, there's no problem, because if you have a sufficient excess of positive double points over the negative ones, well, the bigger an excess you have, the more flexibility you have to get around that framing obstruction. That framing instruction. And so, in fact, if we're allowed to have arbitrarily many positive double points, then, in fact, we can make everything set totally real as we want. Or if we make the genus finish, the same thing happens. So, with either version of this one-set topology, we can actually make everything in sight totally real as we're going along. And so, we get this name. Prize in theorem I described here, where we just, well, we start with our two-handle body, and then we can find topological two-handles where we want to, and we can do it in a way that's compatible with Lioshical screen. So now we come to examples, and here's this S2 cross R2 I was just talking about, and we saw in the last talk. We know that S2 R2 R2 R2 R2 R2 The last talk. We know that S2 cross R2 can't be an H stein, but it is the interior of a two-handle body, namely, we'll think of it as a trace on the unknown, for example, S2 cross D2. And now there are lots of embeddings of S2 and C2. You can just think with the simplest one, or you could take your favorite knot intuce here. There's a whole knot theory of these things. And it's got a tubular neighborhood that's diffeomorphic to. A tubular neighborhood that's diffeomorphic to S2 plus R2. And so, in particular, that's the interior of a topological two-handle body, in fact, the smooth two-handle body. And so then we just hit it with this theorem, and that says that, in fact, we can topologically isotope it so that the material matched out. Of course, it can't have a smooth two-sphere inside it. It starts with a smooth two-sphere. Then, when we do this topological isotope, the material is. Then, when we do this topological isotope, it's coupling the sphere of all up, so now it's only topological. And you can't smooth it out inside of your stein neighborhood. You have to go outside of your stein neighborhood to make it smooth. So there's one thing we can do. But since I brought up the trace of this being the trace of the unknot, well, what happens if we look at traces of other knots? Zero hadle and a different two handle, the two handle attached to a different knot. Well, Well we can look at a well let's suppose the knot is topologically but not smoothly sliced. Well the fact that it's smoothly sliced as we've seen means that you can smoothly embed the knot trace in C2 but the fact that it's topologically not but sorry the fact that the fact is that it's yeah That it's topologically sliced means it would be topologically embedded in C2. But on the other hand, the fact that it's not smoothly sliced means that that embedding can't be smoothable. There's no way to find any smooth embedding in this thing in C2. So there's a very unsmoothable example, but it's still the interior of a perfectly good body, and so we can still apply the theorem and isotope it so that the interior was stein even though we started with something that wasn't smooth. Even though we started with something that wasn't smooth. So there's an application where we don't even have something smooth to start with. And now, in both examples A and V, we see that what we have is at least homotopic, homotopic equivalent to a two sided, which maybe is interesting because there was a conjecture a few decades back in the literature that said that no Stein domain should be. Objector equivalent for two spins. So these are counterexamples to that conjecture. Well, you might say, okay, but maybe the conjecture was really intended to apply to compact things, and these are clearly not compact. They have infinite differential topology. So maybe the conjecture is still good in a more restricted sense. Well, if we want to do something smooth and compact, we already know how to deal with that. That's our theorem one. How to deal with that. That's our theorem one from before. And so then all we have to do is find a Stein domain that can be embedded with the right constraint on the almost complex structure. So it's a Stein domain re-embedded in such a way that the almost complex structure that's inherited is homotopy. Is homotopic to the Stein structure. And then we get our example. So, in fact, that's an example from reference too, in fact, that there is a way to do that. You can't do it with a not trace because it would violate the junction inequality by basically complying. The argument Kyle was telling us about. But if you're allowed to have a one-handle and two, two-handles, then it's pretty straightforward. Then it's pretty straightforward to actually construct these columns. So here we have examples for which both theorems one and two are very useful. So, all right. This actually raises another question. This actually raises another question though, namely, our smooth version applies in a compact setting, but the topological version I gave you was only about open mallet points. So what can we say in a compact setting topologically? Now, these things we constructed are very unsmoothable, so there certainly is a topologically embedded compact thing, a NOT trace or S2 or class D2. S2, or glass D2 sitting in there in a topological way, but it's likely unsmoothable. In fact, it is unsmoothable in some sense. It certainly can't be smooth in a Steinway. But still, there is this compact boundary. And so, what can we do about that? Well, let's make a definition to include that. So, first of all, let's suppose we have First of all, let's suppose we have any compact two-handle body that's topologically embedded, C0 embedded in a complex surface. And, well, now that we're dealing with now that we're dealing with topological things, we have to worry about wild phenomena like Alexander's Lawrence Sphere and stuff like that. So, I just want to rule that out from the beginning. So, whenever we have a topological embedding of a compact format, Compact form manifold. I'm going to assume that there's a topological color. So that is outside of this compact manifold. We can enlarge it a little with a color boundary cross I, at least in the topological. And that color will get rid of all sorts of wild phenomena. So now we're in a setting that's more or less smooth setting. And I want to talk about pseudoconvexity in this sense. In this sense. So let's call this X topologically pseudoconvex, or TPC, if it's also a Stein compact. That's terminology from complex analysis that I wasn't familiar with until recently, but it just means a compact set that has a neighborhood system of Steinhogen sets. And so we're going to assume our compact. So, we're going to assume our compact form manifold has such a neighborhood system. If that's true, we'll call it topologically pseudo-convex. And then a standard theorem from complex analysis is that the interior of a Stein compact is always Stein. So then we can modify theorem two to We can apply it to compact topological two-handle bottles. So what the theorem, well, basically, the way to compare what I'm talking about now with our previous version of the theorem up at the top is we think of u as being the interior of this compact two-handle body x. Compact two kind of body X. And then the way I want to view the theorem now is that we can actually topologically isotope X to always make it topologically superconvex. And then when we do that, the interior will always be a Stein open subset. So then we're getting theorem two for the interior, obviously, some general theorem for the compact. And um so let's look at some uh examples. Well first of all the the previous examples A and B, as we've seen, are now going to automatically give us TPC embeddings of NOT traces, in particular S2 plus D2. So we could think of that as being a compact phenomenon, even though Compaction on them, even though these are very far from being screwed in that. But now, oh, there's also one other observation I want to make here. Namely, I'm using a stronger version of isotopia. Before we were just Version of isotopy now. Before we were just isotoping the inclusion map of the domain. Now we're going to do an ambient isotopy, which means that not only, well, I'm no longer just looking at the inclusion map, but we're taking the identity map on the entire rambling 4 manifold, and we're isotoping that, dragging along the subset, the domain that we're interested in. That's a much stronger notion, because, for example, it preserves this topological It preserves this topological coloring property because we're dragging along the color as we go, whereas the previous notion of isotopy doesn't preserve column in general. So we have a stronger notion of isotopy here. And you said that you get this crumbled S2 that itself have a little colour? Like, is that a Y? Yes, in the topological category, we just did an isotopy, which doesn't change anything. So topologically, Doesn't change anything, so topologically, it just looks like it did before, S2 plus D2 is our skin real students. Yeah, that's a good point. There are two very different ways of looking at these things. We can sort of take off our glasses and see things topologically, or we can put our smooth glasses on and see something very different. So, anyway, now we're in the topological world, and this stronger notion of isotopy actually. The stronger notion of isotopy actually allows us to dig much deeper into Friedman's proof. So, Friedman, how did Friedman prove that every Cassand handle is a two-handle? Well, he did it by working really hard and actually finding an uncountable nest of Casson handles inside the original Cassandra, this uncountable nest index by a count. This uncountable nested next by a cat. And then somehow in between consecutive castenhangels in these regions where we were in the open middle thirds of the cantor set, because in between regions, he did some really hard point-set topology to figure out what was going on there. And then that's how he constructed these things. And the maybe amazing thing is that a lot of that construction actually... A lot of that construction actually goes through in Bonashberg's context as well, because whenever we're re-embedding cats and angles or these more general things for the surfaces, we can always make the cores totally real whenever we want to, just by adding extra genus or extra extra double points. So in fact, we can get a lot more mileage out of pitching Friedman's proof to Eliaspur's machinery. And uh so let me make it a a definition to uh provide some uh picture data within something called a Stein onion. And the data we need is a closed predem called M and the picture we see a whole bunch of copies of the We see a whole bunch of copies of them running around this. They're zigzagging to indicate it's in the topological category. And then we have a shine surface U, which is supposed to be this whole thing I'm drawing. And we have a continuous surjection from an interval across the three-manifold into U. Think of it as parametrizing a whole family of three-manifolds, what's the parameter of the interval. And it's supposed to be. And it's supposed to be homeomorphic embedding on the open interval, which is just what we see here: that we have a whole bunch of discriminant parallel copies of n indexed by that open interval. But then at parameter value zero, what happens is that m gets crunched down onto some sort of a coral. And so you see this whole thing looking like an onion with a lot of layers. And what makes this a Stein onion is This is a Stein union is the condition that whenever the parameter value comes from the counter set, we want the corresponding copy of M to cut out an open Stein domain. So what that means then is that the core is not incompact, obviously, because it's compact and it's clearly a nested. And it's clearly a nested intersection of Stein open subsets, but we have a lot more structure there as well. We, in fact, have an uncountable nested union of these things parametrized by the counter set. And in fact, for uncountably many of these things, the closure is itself going to be a Steincompact, because it is also going to be a limited to these things, as long as we avoid indiscreet finance compact. Discrete defines a countable set of values in the counter set, you can add. So we have a whole bunch of these whole bunch of Stein compacts we've constructed here. And there's even more structure if we take off our glasses and see this thing in the topological world. Then, in fact, all these things are the same in a very strong sense. We can get from any one to any other one by a topological world. One to any other one by a topological ambient isotopy that just kind of stretches or shrinks, and it preserves, of course, point-wise, which is just kind of expanding or contracting the whole picture, throwing any one of these onto any one at once. So somehow they're all the same in the topological world. But if we put our smooth glasses back on, it's a very different-looking picture that I'll discuss in more detail in a moment. And anyway, why did I talk about this big complicated thing? It's because we can actually construct these very easily, or very commonly, I should say. There's a theorem that allows us to construct these. Namely, we take any colored topologically embedded two-handle body, as we were talking about before, and I guess for simplicity, let's assume it's. It's uh it's I find it many handles and because only it's compact, it it relaxes that assumption. But um so we've got this this topologically embedded two-handed body in a complex surface. And the claim is that not only can we make it a stein compact, but in fact we can ambiently isotope it to be a stein uneven so that it has all the structure I've drawn. Arrive by draw. So we have the conclusion then is that this very strange, like a severe complex analyst, this very strange looking structure is actually very common. It's easy to construct these images from any embedded two-handle. So an example Well, in fact, well, this is really an application, a more precise version of the viral that comes from Reference 3. Namely, let's start with any topologically embedded CW2 complex, i.e. a complex surface. We'll assume finitely many two cells, so it's compact. And we'll also assume that it's TAME, get rid of wild phenomena, tame here means that. Lile tame here means that it thickens up in an obvious way to a two-handle. Zero handles that connect with two handles and so on. Sort of the obvious thing to do in the topological pattern. Then this topological two complex is always ambiently isotopic to the core of Steinen. So it's very easy to get topologically embedded two complexes that are Stein compacts. That are Stein compacts, and in fact, surrounded by these uncountable families of Stein compacts that have all this nice structure we described. And you can say some things about what happens to the cells when you do this. You can actually arrange that the cells, in fact, are all smooth in the end, except for a singularity on H2 side. Now again, if we take our glasses off and see it topologically, then we haven't really changed anything. We haven't really changed anything. We've just kind of pushed it around a little, and we still see this tain 2 complex. So the singularities aren't there. But then, if we put our smooth glasses on, you see these really horrible singularities, one in H2 cell. They're not cone-wise. In fact, what they look like is that, well, you can center a smooth radial function on that singular point and see it as a Morse function on the two-cell minus the singular point. Cell minus the singular point. And what happens is that you need infinitely many critical points, in fact, infinitely many local minima. So it's a really kind of just somehow gets more and more complicated as we close it. So in the smooth world, this is a very complicated-looking thing, but in the topological world, it's still very simple. Yeah. Everything inside can be made Caesar is small, although in that case, Small. Although, in that case, you want to subdivide the two complex first, and then you'd have finitely many singularities on the original two cells. Yeah, pretty much everyone sees a small all right. Uh so there is one I think rather bizarre example. I think rather bizarre example. But let's go in a whole different direction. Let's sort of look at what this says about smooth things. So we'll start out with any complex surface, and then every homology class, every two homology class is, of course, realizing only some surface. And there's this deep question of what the smallest possible genus of that surface is. That's where the adjunction inequalities tend to come in and so on. Commit and so on. But let's just take any surface, and I don't care if it's mingled genus or not right now, start with any smooth surface representing the epomology class, and then we want to apply, well, actually I guess the previous example is what we want to think about. We know that this thing implicitly is a CW2 complex, so we can apply the previous example, and then we get the core of a shiny onion. And now, what that looks like in the topological world is we just see our original surface, well, we see an R2 bundle over our original surface, that's what it looks like topologically. Smoothly, it's going to be much more complicated. How complicated? Well, turns out we can choose this so that these neighborhoods realize all sufficiently large minimal genera. So, what does that mean? Well, remember, we have this whole unit. Well, remember, we have this whole uncountable nest of topologically embedded D2 bundles over our surface. And they all look the same in the topological world, but in the smooth world, well, for each one, the generator of the homology is Z. The homology is Z. We can take a generator, look at the minimal genus of a smooth surface representing that, and we can arrange it as we get smaller and smaller neighborhoods. What happens is that this genus What happens is that this genus increases without a bound, and in fact, you can arrange it to increase through all larger possible genera. So we've realized everything starting with the original genus all the way up. And in particular, what that says is that there have to be infinitely many diffeomorphism types of Stein surfaces in ONS because they're distinguished by the homogenous function. So that's one way to play the game, and a different way to play the game. That's one way to play the game. And a different way to play the game is you do this for a while and then you stop at some genus, you stabilize there so that every sufficiently small neighborhood is in its same fixed genus. And well then we're not distinguishing infinitely many diffeomorphism types anymore, but we're seeing that there are infinitely many different ways to make this Steinan distinguished by the genus in which we see stabilization. So there's a lot So there's a lot of flexibility in how we play this game. Well, still only countably many diffeomorphism types. But if we want to go even further, we can use our trick from before with embeddings of exotic R4s, Stein exotic R4s, and then, so it turns out that, well, to distinguish these for technical reasons, you want the self-intersection number not to be positive. But as long as the self-intersection number is But as long as the self-intersection number is non-negative, then in fact this trick will distinguish. Well, for each of the general part we're just talking about, we can distinguish uncountably many diffeomorphism types within that Stein onion. So somehow the Stein onion has infinitely many minimal genera represented by uncommonly many diffeomorphism types. So about as many diffeomorphism types as you can Types as you can possibly hope for in this. And this is, I started with a simple example of just a disc bundle over a surface, but in fact, I think this is fairly typical behavior for this time. So in reference 3, I stated a much more general theorem, but even there I had to state a bunch of probably unnecessary hypotheses just to get something I could state conveniently that could be relaxed. Relaxed and controlled. So, in fact, I think probably pretty much all the time when you see this behavior, it's just a question of when you can actually prove that that behavior is what's going on. So, alright. Well, now there's a different game that we can play here. And what And what frequently, when we're talking about pseudo-convex things and complex surfaces, what we're talking about is not four manifolds, but three manifolds. We want to know what about pseudo-convex embeddings and three-manifolds. So then there's the question, now that we've done all this topological stuff, what can we say about pseudo-convex, topologically pseudo-convex three things? So So, and definition there, we want to call the topologically embedded free manifold. It's not implicitly black colour, just to go away from the moment. We'll call the topologically embedded free manifold topologically pseudo-convex if it's got a neighborhood bipolomorphic to a neighborhood of some topologically pseudo-convex boundary somewhere. So, first of all, I want to think of boundary. So first of all, I want to think of boundaries of TPC4 manifolds as being topologically pseudoconvex, and then anything that looks biholomorphically like one of those three manifolds, they'll also call topologically pseudo-convex. Just so we don't have to be dragging around a TPC4 manifold all the time, although in practice, just about any time I can construct one of these things, there is a TPC4 manifold that cuts out. So I don't know if that is a useful thing. I don't know if that is a useful generalization or not, but it makes it a little more natural to talk about. You're not asking for a neighborhood basis. Just a neighborhood, that's right. So we just take some open set around our three manifold, we map it by holomorphically to some other open set. We do it in such a way that one three manifold gets identified holomorphically with the other one. And that's a And yeah, that's all we need. It's supposed to match up with the smooth case where we only have to see a neighborhood of three manifolds in accuracy. Although in that case, you're not required to know that it bounds something somewhere. You don't have to have holomorphic fillability in this movie world, whereas that's the only way you know how to define these things that impose that condition. So these are really analogous to To holomorphically fillable superconvex 3 map fields in our formats. You do require that M is mapped onto the boundary of the format. Yeah, so we're mapping the neighborhood biholomorphically, and we're mapping M holy morphically to the boundary of the format. And then All right, so what can we say about these things? Well, there are various ties between this strange new notion and the old smooth notion. Namely, just like in the smooth case, if you have a topologically pseudo-convex embedding in the Stein manifold, then it automatically cuts out a Stein compact, and in particular the open thing it cuts out as a Stein surface. So that's exactly. So that's exactly the same as the same as what happens in a smooth setting, and in fact the proof is exactly like the same. You don't really need smoothness in the three manifold. So in that sense, these things are like the smooth manifolds. But then you could ask about maybe the most subtle part of it. Maybe the most subtle part of a smooth pseudo-convex three-manifold is the contact structure that's induced on it. And I rather doubt that you have the full complexity and subtlety of the contact three-manifold theory applying to these topological things. But there's something we can say about it, namely, if we look at the homotopy class of the plane field underlying this contact structure, that is actually something we can talk about. So, what we notice is that homotopy classes of plane fields on a three-man fold can be canonically identified with homotopy classes of all most complex structures on R cross the three-manifold. So if we're looking at which, in the smooth case, if we're looking at which homotopy class of plane fields we're realizing, that's the same as asking which homotopy class of all most complex structures we're realizing. Of all those complex structures we're realizing in a tubercular neighborhood. And that is something that really is amenable to the topological setting, namely why does a TPC three-manifold have? Well, just by construction, it has a tubule of neighborhood, a topological tubule of neighborhood that's homeomorphic to R cross the three-manifold. And that admits it inherits some smooth structure by being embedded in this thing. It's a complex surface. It will typically be an exotic smooth structure now. But it admits some smooth structure and also, in fact, a holomorphic structure. And so we can ask which almost complex structure we're realizing. Well, it's not clear that that makes sense, but in fact, according to reference 4, if you work hard enough, you can actually. You can actually classify the almost complex structures up to homeotopy on exotic smoothings of R3 cross n in such a way that it's homeomorphism invariant. So you can just, for example, compare it with the standard R cross M. And now we can ask what almost complex structure is inherited on a TPC3 manifold because we just Pre-manifold because we just look at that exotic smooth structure and we say, well, there's a canonical way to think of that as a smooth structure. There's a canonical way to think of that complex structure as being an almost complex structure on a cross. And so now we can talk about pseudo-convex three manifolds and their homojopic plus plane fields in a topological set. A topological setting. And so those are the similarities with the smooth setting. But on the other hand, topological, in the smooth setting, these pseudo-convex three manifolds are really hard to construct. In the topological setting, they're actually very easy to construct. And so, the first part of the theorem for three is that That every closed-oriented three-manifold emits a TPC event. Now, in the smooth case, there are certainly manifolds, closed three-manifolds, that don't admit any tight contact structure, let alone an holomorphically fillable structure. They're pseudo-convex structure. But in the topological world, you can always find these effects. And furthermore, they're very common. One thing you can do is live in any. One thing you can do is that in any, well, if you just look at arbitrary, simply connected, compact complex surfaces, so the closed and that involved that you're simply connected, as long as the positive and negative parts of the second embedding number are sufficiently large, then you can always find such an embedding of your preassigned three number. So these things are very common. Well, what about complex structures? Well, now we go to reference four, and in fact, And in fact, every almost complex structure on every three-manifold can be realized in a similar way. Well, how does that compare with the smooth world, first of all? Well, every contact three manifold has infinitely many homotopy classes of plane fields, or contact structures, if you like. But only finitely many of those can be realized by tight contact structures, and so only finitely many. Structures, and so only finitely many by pseudo-convex embeddings. Whereas every possible J on our three-manifold can be realized topologically by an embedding. Well, there's this obvious condition that the divisibility of the ambient complex surface should be should divide or the divisibility of the Turing class of the almost complex class. Complex function. But lest you worry that maybe that restricts us in any way, notice that if s happens to be non-minimal, then the divisibility is 1, and that's a trivial condition. So if we just insert the word non-minimal in here, then we can a whole bunch of events of an arbitrary pair mj. So yeah. How do we do this? Well, the basic idea is to, in fact, realize the three-manifold as a Stein boundary with just realize it as a Stein boundary and then embed that whole thing in such a way that we can apply the theorem of Ausstein Eins, and then automatically the boundary is embedded. We make some messing around to It takes some messing around to have the right almost complex structure for part B, but we can always do that. So let me just very quickly mention one other thing we can do, namely, now that we've talked about pseudo-convex stuff, what can we say about pseudo-concave stuff? Just to illustrate the games we can play and hope that somebody else has better games to play. So what do I mean by pseudo-computer? So, what do I mean by pseudoconcave? Well, in this context, we're going to start with a closed complex surface, compact, complex surface without boundary, and we're going to remove some disjoint finite collection of topologically pseudo-convex things, or remove their interior so that we have a pseudo-concave boundary in some reasonable sense. This could easily be stated in the smooth of the topological world. But let's look at the smooth world first. Uh but let's look at the smooth world first. Uh well there are examples of both we can do. Uh maybe I'll just focus on this one and then throw the others up on the screen. But we have a take any knot trace well you can embed it in it it's fairly easy to embed it in a Hiritz-Brook surface in such a way that it complements another knot trace. So we can make that other knot trace pseudo-convex and the original one is pseudo-concave. Of the original one is pseudo-concave. Well, if you're careful with your almost complex structure, then well, we need some simple conditions to be satisfied, but then if those conditions satisfied, you can always play that game in a smooth world. If you want to do it topologically, you can drop those conditions. That's more complexity. Well, then other ways you can play the game that would be bikes. Can play the game and look at concave smoothings of i cross a three-manifold. That works a lot of times for circle bubble over the surface as the three manifold or with a lot of grease-forming spheres. Now, griece-for-none spheres are also boundaries of Melder fibers, which we think of as being pseudoconvex, but in fact, you can always find, in this case, you can find pseudoconcave complex structures of them as well. Complex structures of them as well. We saw early on that it's easy to find pseudo-convex embeddings and contractible compact things smoothly. And in fact, you can play a similar game with pseudo-concave contractible compact things. For all these things, it's just a matter of arranging the complement to be a two-handle body with the right J, and then play this game just like we did in part A. Part A. But if we want to go topological instead of smooth, then in fact we can do, well, maybe the most surprising thing we can do here is that we can get uncountably many exotic R4s with topologically pseudo-chai-cave embeddings in the same simply connected compact complex. Same simply connected, compact, complex surface that we were looking at before. So then the picture there is: we see a complex surface, we see somehow a rather large
