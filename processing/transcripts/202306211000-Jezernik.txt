Everyone. Hello, everyone. So many thanks to the organizers for the invitation to participate at this conference. So in the past two days, we've seen some talks and we've seen some beautiful mathematics that is somehow all built on top of some interesting low-dimensional phenomena. We've seen Phenomena. You've seen SK2s and these omega twos and stuff like this, and they somehow all boil down to the same object, which is this Bogomolov multiplier. So in this talk, what I will try to do is explain yet another piece of mathematics where this thing appears. And this is this problem of rationality of algebraic varieties that arise as quotients by linear group actions. By linear group actions. The camera is rotating, I see everyone. So it is, in fact, this sort of incarnation of this invariant that the Bogomolov multiplier gets its name from. So I will first explain what this problem of rationality or irrationality is all about, and then how these Pogomolov multipliers come into the picture. I will show you how groups with non-trivial Pogomolov multipliers. How groups with non-trivial Propomolov multipliers look like. And then I will, in the end, hopefully tell you a bit about how many such groups there are. Okay, so first of all, what is this rationality problem in algebraic geometry? So the thing starts off from a very difficult problem, which is to try to decide which algebraic varieties are birational to a projective space. Projective space, and we call such varieties rational. So, being birational to a projective space means that there is some open subset of this algebraic variety that is isomorphic to an open subset in a projective space. Or in other words, you can express this in terms of function fields, namely that the function field of the algebraic variety is isomorphic to the function field of the projective space, which is then just a purely transcendental extension of the underlying field. Field. So, this is a very difficult problem because famously, this automorphism group, birational automorphisms of the projective space, the Kremona group, is very poorly understood. Now, a particular instance of this difficult problem that makes it a bit easier is that you assume that your varieties are somewhat special. You restrict yourself to a class of very nice algebraic varieties, say they are also smooth and projective. Varieties, say they are also smooth and projective, and then try to decide whether or not such varieties are birational to the projective space. And a particular instance of this problem is a very famous Lurot problem, which says that, in fact, you should take for NICE algebraic varieties that are unirational. So these are varieties for which there exists a dominant map, a dominant rational map from a projective space onto this variety. Space onto this variety. Or again, in other words, algebraically, the function field at least embeds into a purely transcendental extension of the underlying field. And then somehow the question is, is it this thing itself, is it itself a purely transcendental extension of k? Okay, so what I want to talk about in this talk is again a particular instance of this Lurot problem, and that is to take algebraic. And that is to take algebraic varieties that are all unirational and are particularly nice, namely they are quotient varieties. So, what are these things? You start with a finite group, G, and you pick a faithful representation of this group acting linearly on a vector space V, and then you make the quotient. So, I want to make this quotient in such a way so that the result would be an algebraic variety. So, in order to do this, I will have to take the so-called Git quote. Do this, I will have to take the so-called git quotient, which means that I will define this variety in terms of its regular functions. And for the regular functions of this variety, what I take is the ring of g invariant regular functions, right? So g acted on v and therefore it acts on regular functions on v on polynomials. And then I get a ring of fixed polynomials, and this defines this quotient variety. So as a very simple. So as a very simple example, consider a cyclic group of order two acting on a plane just by flipping through the origin, right? xy goes to minus x minus y. So the quotient variety then is determined by the ring of polynomials in x and y that are fixed under this transformation. So you get x squared, xy, and y squared. And then I can rename these into u, v, and w. And there is a single And w, and there is a single generator relation between these, namely, the product of the first two is the square of the middle one, right? So, um, the quotient variety that we get in this case is a certain conic inside three-dimensional space. Now, when I pass through function fields, this means that I make everything invertible, I can express one of these, for example, w. I can express w from u and v squared. And v squared, which means that I don't really need this w, it's not a generator, and then the function field itself is generated by u and v, and there are no algebraic relations, so I get a purely transcendental extension of degree two. So in this case, this projective, this quotient variety is birational to a projective plane, right? And so that question of Lurotor or of Noetter has a positive answer in this particular case. Particular case. Okay. So let me tell you just a bit about somehow the motivation for studying these sorts of rationality problems for these particular quotient formalities. There are two pieces of motivation, maybe two points of view that you can look at the thing from. So the first one is sort of in direction of group theory gives. Sort of in direction of group theory giving something to the world of algebraic geometry or varieties, if you want. So, what I mean by this is that you can view these quotients, V mod G, as sorts of finite models for Bg. And one particularly nice thing about this is that you can look at cohomology. And then, cohomology of BG is the cohomology of the group G. And these BGs are varieties, right? And what I'm saying is that somehow. And what I'm saying is that somehow cohomologies of these varieties will be in a way related to cohomologies of groups. And I have a very concrete theorem regarding this. This is taken from a very famous paper by T.I. and Hirzebruch, but really the main idea comes from an earlier paper of Ser, namely that for every n, there will be a smooth projective variety whose co-homology up to this given dimension n Up to this given dimension n, it's going to include the full cohomology of any given group that you start with. You start with a group that has some strange things in its cohomology, and then what I'm saying is that you can construct a smooth projective variety so that its cohomology is going to contain this mess that the group is skipping. So, in this particular paper by Mattiya and Hirzebruk, this was put to very good use because what they do is they consider the group. Because what they do is they construct the first counterexamples using this to the integral Hodge conjecture. So they construct some particular phenomenon and group cohomology and then using this theorem they then construct a variety that also has these strange things in its cohomology. I will say a bit more about this a bit later in the talk. Okay, so that's one piece of motivation and the other piece of motivation is somehow in the other direction. Direction and that is that this world of algebraic geometry or quotient varieties is giving something to group theory. Namely, if you are able to solve this rationality problem for quotient varieties, so if you are able to prove that the quotient variety is birational to a projective space over the particular field of rational numbers, then as was known already to Amy Neutter and Hilbert, this thing will enable This thing will enable you to solve in a very strong and precise sense the inverse Galois problem for the group G. So, if you are able to say that this quotient theoretically spirational, you are projective space, then in fact you will be able to realize the group G as a Galois group of a finite extension of Q. So, in fact, this was the original motivation of Imminitter to pose this problem of rationality for quotient varieties. Rationality for quotient varieties. You can think of this as her sort of attempt to solve the inverse Gala problem. Now, unfortunately, this turns out to not work at all, this idea that you would prove the Anderskauer problem using these quotient varieties, because as it turned out later, there are many counterexamples, and in fact, this thing works for very few groups. So, Swan was the first to find counterexamples. Was the first to find counterexamples. These were some particular cyclic groups. And then Winsta also worked on this. And what is surprising is, for example, that even for cyclic groups, for finite cyclic groups, this question of rationality over rationals was somehow completely resolved only recently, a couple of years ago, by Plantz. So now we have a full classification of precisely which finite cyclic groups will have the property that potion varieties will be rational. Will be rational. Okay, so somehow this all fails dramatically, even for cyclic groups, but the reason is that you're working over the field of rational. So once you pass over the complex field, everything becomes much nicer. And let me show you how you can prove that for cyclic groups, now quotient varieties will be rational if you change the field and remove all of these crazy. Field and remove all of these crazy number theoretic obstructions. So, in fact, this is true for all abelian groups. The quotient variety will be rational for all abelian groups. This was known already to Fisher. So, let me show you the proof for cyclic groups. So, you have a cyclic group acting on a vector space, and I will just take the standard permutation representation. So, this will be an n-dimensional thing permuting the basis vectors. Now, this induces an action. This induces an action on the ring of regular functions. So, this is just polynomials and variables. And what I'm doing is permuting these polynomials in a cyclic fashion. Now, since this is a cyclic group, this permutation can be decomposed as a sum of one-dimensionals. And in fact, it's not difficult to write precisely what these vectors spanning the one-dimensional subspaces are. There are some linear combinations of these starting variables x1 up to xn. Variables x1 up to xn. So theta n here is the primitive nth root of unity. And our generator is acting on these as a certain power of this primitive root of unity. So how to construct polynomials or rather rational functions that are invariant with respect to this sigma? Well, this y0 is certainly invariant, and then y1 will have a here zeta n. Here, zeta n. So, if I take y1 to the n, this is also going to be invariant. And then for all the others, I can somehow cancel this power of zeta that appears in front of them by dividing by a suitable power of y1. So, the sigma is going to fix all of these rational functions. And now what I do is I generate a field with all of these rational functions. I call it big y. So, this big y is certainly fixed by sigma, so it lives inside the fixed field. Field and this fixed field itself is living inside the field of all rational functions and v the degree of this extension is n simply by Galois theory and if I add to this big y the rational function y1 then I get all of these y0 y1 y2 up to y the last one right which means that I get the full function field of Function field of v itself. So this extension is of degree at most n. So what this all means, if you put it all together, is that this y is precisely the fixed field under the signal group. And this thing itself is given here by algebraically independent rational functions. So it is purely transcendent. Okay? So the point being that over C, cyclic groups are not an issue anymore. Groups are not an issue anymore. Okay. So, one thing that we used here with the cyclic groups is that we used a very particular representation, namely the standard permutation representation. Now, you could wonder what happens if I change the representation. And it turns out that things don't dramatically change if you change the representation. But what you have to do is be a bit more flexible regarding this problem of rationality. So instead of rationality, So, instead of rationality, what you look is at is stable rationality. Okay, so a variety, in this case, a quotient variety, will be stably rational if some product of some projective space of this variety is rational. Okay, and then there is a lemma in this area called the no-name lemma, which says that if you're wondering whether or not this quotient variety is stably rational, then this in fact does not depend on the representation. This, in fact, does not depend on the representation. You can just pick whichever faithful representation you want and work with that representation. Okay? Okay, so let me show you some further examples. For example, I take the symmetric group. So the symmetric group acts naturally on the set of endpoints. And then again, as with the cyclic group, I get a permutation representation. For that particular representation, it's easy to compute this invariant field. We do this. Field. We do this with students, right? We tell them that invariants under the symmetric loops are precisely the symmetric polynomials and they are algebraically independent. And this is a then purely transcendental extension. So again, you get a quotient variety that is rational. What is a bit surprising is that if you change the symmetric group just a little bit, so you go to alternating groups, then suddenly the thing becomes much, much more difficult. So there are some papers dealing with the case. Are some papers dealing with the case n is equal to five, alternating loop of order of degree five? And for that thing, using crazy hand calculations, it's possible to prove that the quotient variety is rational. But from six on, essentially nothing is known. And it's interesting that these things are already too big to be able to handle them with computers. So it's still the problem of rationality, even for the standard action, is still open for the alternative group. Group. Okay, so if we now turn away from these sort of alternating and symmetric groups and we go to p groups, say look at two groups of very small orders. There are classifications of these groups. You can simply write all of these groups down and try to do hand calculations as we did with the cyclic group. And people have done this, and they have proved that for sizes up to 30. Uh, for sizes up to 32, all two groups are in fact going to give you quotient varieties that are rational. Okay, uh, but all right. So then you come to groups of order 64, and there you start finding some groups for which this procedure of proving rationality somehow doesn't work. You run into some difficulties. Work. You run into some difficulties. And then, of course, after a while, you start to suspect that maybe there's a good reason why it doesn't work and that maybe you would be better off trying to prove irrationality. So how do you prove irrationality? Well, you have to somehow think of some obstructions that are going to prove that your quotient variety is not rational. Let me tell you about this. So, first off, just to Um, so first off, uh, just a quick uh recap of what we what we did so far. So, there is a uh this projective space in the center of everything that's the model space, and then varieties birational to it are called rational. Uh, then what we were sort of uh looking at are unirational varieties. Uh, so quotient varieties are certainly unirational, and we want to put them somehow in this picture. And uh, what I also told you is that, in fact, if you if you are willing. In fact, if you are willing to replace rational by stably rational, then this problem of rationality for quotient varieties is independent of the representation. So it's really all about the clue. Okay. So then the second part is obstructions. Yeah, so there are several known invariants under birational transformations, even under stable birational transformations. Are stable by rational transformations that have the property that they vanish at projective spaces. Therefore, if I plug in the quotient variety into this invariant and the invariant is non-zero, then this will tell me that the variety is not rational. The first such invariant that is also a stably birational invariant was discovered by Ardn and Mumford. So this was by, let's say, a very strong indication by Ser. So Serre also looked at these problems. Looked at these problems and he wanted to find obstructions of cohomological nature. And he really indicated that probably the simplest thing that you can look at is inside the third cohomology, namely the torsion. So Arden and Mumford looked at the torsion of the singular third cohomology of the analytification of smooth projective varieties. And then they give an explicit example of a smooth projective variety that has this property that is unirational. That is unirational, and that this variety, this invariant is non-zero. So, something a bit different was done by Saltman a bit later for quotient varieties. So, these varieties by Ardmann Mutford were smooth, whereas these quotient varieties typically they're not smooth, even for cyclic groups. The example I showed you before was not smooth. And what Saltmo did was he And what Saltmo did was he devised an invariant, which is called nowadays the unramified Brouwer group. It's a bit messy to define it, but what is crucial is that this invariant is living inside the ordinary Brouwer group of the function field of the variety. So you have these essential simple algebras, and the only thing that this thing depends on is the function field of the variety. So this is a bit better than the Art and Mumford invariant, because here we needed this variety to be smooth. Needed this variety to be smooth. Whereas here, this is like by definition a birational invariant because it depends only on the function field. And you can take whichever model you want. You can also take a non-smooth model to compute it. So it turned out a bit later that, in fact, for smooth projective unirational varieties, these two invariants are really the same. This was done in a paper by Bokomolo. And it is in this. And it is in this same paper that Bogomolov actually gives a very explicit formula for these objects for quotient varieties. So what he proves is that this unramified Brauer group of a quotient variety has a quite explicit description in terms of the cohomology of the group G. So it really only depends on the group G, not on the representation. And the description is as follows. Folllows. So you start with this second co-homology of G, this is the so-called Schur multiplier. And then you restrict co-cycles to abelian subgroups. And then what you take is the kernel of all of these possible restrictions. So all classes in the cyclical homology that vanish once you pass to abelian subgroups. So let me give you just an indication of where. Me, give you just an indication of where this thing is coming from. So, how is this Brouwer group connected to the second cohomology of G. So, this Brouwer group, we said you can see it inside the ordinary Brouwer group of the function field. And ordinary Brouwer groups of fields, you can interpret them as second continuous cohomologies of profinite groups, namely of absolute Galois groups. So, here this function field is in fact the function field of D and then fixed points under. Of D and then fixed points under G. And you have an extension of this, namely simply remove the fixed points of G. So by Galois theory, this group, this big Galois group here, surjects onto G. And then in cohomology, you get an inverted map. And then the only thing that's left is really to change these crazy coefficients into C star, but this is not so difficult. So as a hint of how these two objects are. A hint of how these two objects are connected. So this object on the right-hand side, this intersections of the kernels, as I said, it lives inside the Shur multiplier, but it was really developed by Bogomolov. So nowadays it is called this Bogomolov multiplier and denoted by B0 of G. Okay, so let's turn to some examples. So I told you that for abelian groups, these quotient varieties. That for abelian groups, these quotient varieties over C are rational, therefore, this invariant definitely has to vanish. Bz of abelian group is always trivial. Kuniowski showed that if you look at finite simple groups, these Bogomolov multipliers are always going to vanish as well. So, in particular, for example, for alternating groups, they vanish, although the problem of rationality is still open. And so, this one invariant, this Tokomolov multiplier, is certainly not. Molotov multiplier is certainly not exhaustive. So, how do you find then examples for which this thing is non-zero? Okay, so it turns out that the right thing to do, and this was really the example that the Saltman already showed us, is to take suitable quotients of the fundamental group of a genus G surface for G at least two. So, these fundamental groups have a single relation, which is a product of common. Which is a product of commutators of generators is equal to one. So, if you want to produce groups with non-trivial B0, what you need to somehow find is elements that satisfy this sort of a relation, and the elements are as independent as possible. So here in this case, what Saltman did was he took this fundamental group and he made it into a finite p group in the simplest way possible. He took a class two quotient and then he made the whole thing of exponent p. And then he made the whole thing of exponent p. So in the end, you end up with an abelian with a finite p group, I think, of order p to the nine or 12, I'm not sure, that has this Bogomol of multiplier non-zero. So I did my PhD with Trimos Moravet, and he developed a computer program for computing these Bogomolov multipliers. But what he did was he didn't use this cohomological definition, and instead he rather looked at the dual of B0. So if I go a bit back to the definition, so the Bokomov multiplier is the intersection of kernels of restrictions. So if I dualize this whole construction, what am I going to get? So this Schur multiplier is going to transform into homology with integral coefficients. And instead of taking Instead of taking this intersection of a sub-object of this, I'm going to take a quotient and I'm going to quotient by corestrictions coming from homologies of abelian subgroups. So this is something that we have seen, I think, two days ago, this sort of homological description that is a bit more amenable for computers to do calculations with. So using this program, you can then do Program, you can then do many more calculations that were previously possible by hand. In particular, you can look at these groups of order 64 that seem problematic, and you can see that indeed their Bogomov multipliers are non-zero. So this was then hand-verified by people as well, not just computers. For odd primes P, if you look at P groups, problems start appearing a bit earlier, so namely with groups. So, namely, with groups over the p to the five, Pokemon of multipliers start becoming non-trivial for some of these groups. Okay, so we looked at these particular groups of order 64 and the order P to the 5 in more detail to see whether or not there are some structural properties that they share. And we found the following: so, for groups of order 64 with non-zero bogomode multipliers, as it Bogomode multipliers. As it turns out, they all have the interesting statistical property that their commuting probabilities are equal to 25%. So this means that I pick two elements from this group of order 64 at random. So independently, uniformly at random. And then I wonder whether or not they commute. And I measure the probability that these two elements commute. So this is. This is just a commuting probability, and what we proved together with pre-much is that one can sort of extend this statistical property that these groups of order 64 have, namely that whenever you have a group that is sufficiently abelian in this particular statistical sense, its Pokomov multiplier is going to vanish. So for abelian groups, we know that these B0s are zero, but here now is an extension of two, let's say, groups that are statistically close. To let's say groups that are statistically close to being obelian enough, right? And then these p0s are also going to vanish for these groups. Okay, then for groups order p to the five that I mentioned that have non-trivial multipliers, these turn out to have an interesting structural properties, namely they are all of groups of maximum potency class. So this means that these are groups of size p to the size p to the five and their null potency class is equal to four. So a group of maximum potency class in general is of size p to the n and has nil potency class n minus one. Now there is a beautiful structural theory of these groups of maximum potency class. Many people have worked on this. So just as a quick recap you can sort of collect all of these groups into a graph. A graph, you connect them in certain ways depending on you start with a group of maximum potency class, and then you do tiny little extensions by a single group of cyclic group of order P, right? And then you produce other groups of maximum potency class. And it turns out that you can see all of these groups of maximum potency class in a single big infinite tree. Big infinite tree, and then maybe there are finitely many groups that are sort of exceptional. So there's an infinite tree plus finitely many exceptions. There is one path in this infinite tree that goes to infinity, and this path determines as its inverse limit a propy group of maximal class. And then out of this main line, there are these branches coming out. And these branches are always finite, but they become bigger and bigger as you go deeper. Become bigger and bigger as you go deeper into the tree. So we proved together with Gustavo Fernandez that as long as you are far away from this main line, this infinite tree, then these Bogomodo multipliers are going to become non-trivial always. And not only that, we also looked at this in quite a lot of detail to inspect precisely how these Bogomodo multipliers. Precisely how these Bogomodo multipliers, once you walk along these branches, how they become bigger and bigger, and as this, as you go deep enough and then also go into a branch that is extremely big, these B0s can become essentially arbitrarily large, but these groups of maximum potency class. Okay. So, these Pogomodel multipliers, as we have seen in this conference already, they appear. Conference already, they appear in many different disguises. So, one disguise that we have found while working on another problem is that they appear in algebraic K-theory in the following way. So, you look at a finite p-group G and you consider its group ring over the p-adic field. So, by Maschke, this thing decomposes as a product of matrices and the K1, the algebraic. Uh, the k1, the algebraic k1, what it does is it sort of uh computes the determinants. So now instead of looking at this over the field qp, I will look at it over the integers, p-adic integers. So again, this map that is going from Zp of G into Qp of G on the K1 level can be thought of as a sort of a replacement for the determinant. But there is some information that might be lost once you do this. And this is gathered together in an object. Is gathered together in an object called SK1. Now we have seen SK1s before, but these are not the same SK1s. It is very interesting that these SK1s are completely different than the other SK1s, but they are at the same time the same, because as it turns out, and as Oliver proved, they are isomorphic to Bogomov multipliers. So these SK1s, they are the K1 is coming from this K1, and then the S is the same S as we use with matrices with determinant one. Uh, matrices with determinant one, like S L. So, this is the S. Okay, so what we were working on was a problem over finite fields, and this thing came up because, as it turned out, you can push this phenomenon to finite fields. So, these Bogomolov multipliers, you can see them here as living inside K1 of ZPG. And when once I push this to finite fields, these Bogomolov multipliers survive. So they embed. Prize survive. So they embed into K1 of FPG. And since this is a local ring, this is simply the group of units of FPG obelianized. But not only this, not only do these Bogomol multipliers live inside here, they live here in a very surprising way. So the units of this group FPG are just the invertible elements in FP and then one plus the augmentation ideal of this group algebra. So what I'm doing then. So, what I'm doing then is abelianizing this object. Okay, if I only look at the size of the thing, of this group, then I can interpret this as the number of linear characters of this group 1 plus i. Now, here's what's interesting here. These groups 1 plus i, they have very naturally associated Lie algebras. Namely, I simply take this augmentation idea. This is a Lie algebra. And in groups, it is often the case that you. It is often the case that you can transfer all sorts of phenomena from groups to the Lie algebras as long as there is a sensible way of constructing the Lie algebras. So, here what we are saying is on the left-hand side, you have the number of linear characters of this group. So, on the right-hand side, you have p to the k of g minus one. So, this is the number of linear characters of the Lie algebra. So, it is the size of this augmentation ideal Lie abelianized. And as it turns out, billionites. And as it turns out, this Bogomolov multiplier is the precise abstraction for these two numbers to be equal. So it's in a sense it's measuring the defect. You have a very nice correspondence between representations already at the linear level of this group and its associated V algebra. And this was certainly unexpected because the conjecture would somehow be that these two should always be should always be the same. So we were very surprised by this result. So we dug a bit deeper and Result. So we dug a bit deeper and found another explanation for this, maybe slightly more conceptual. So what I do is I take the same group 1 plus i, but I view this over the algebraic closure of fp. So in this case, I get an algebraic group, which is a unipotent group. And what we proved is that, in fact, this equality can be reinterpreted as a certain isomorphism of groups. So what I do is I take this algebraic group and I compute its derived subgroup. And I compute its derived subgroup. And then I compute the rational points of this derived subgroup. And on the other hand, what I can do is I can first compute the rational points and then the derived subgroup. So the difference between these two is precisely, again, this polygon of multiplying. So it's somehow in this case, it's measuring the difference between non-commutativity of two functors. On the one hand, I have this functor of taking the derived subgroup, and on the other, I have this fixed points of differing. This fixed points of the Frobenius. So, very surprising because usually you can explain these sorts of phenomenon for semi-simple algebraic groups in terms of their fundamental groups. But now there's something particularly interesting happening with this unipotent algebraic group. Okay. So the story with rationality and obstructions doesn't end with the Bogomov multiplier. There are also other obstructions as well. Obstructions as well. Namely, there exist higher unanimified cohomology groups. These come from spectral sequences that compare the analytic topology and the Ziriski topology on the variety. So I have this spectral sequence and the E2 page. In the E2 page, I look at the first column. Okay, so these are global sections from the Zariski topology of a sheaf that I get if for a Zariski open subset, I compute the singular. Open subset, I compute the singular cohomology. So I glue all of these singular cohomologies in the Zariski sense together, and I get an object that is called the ith unramified cohomology group of a variety. Now, these things, you can find nice interpretations of them for small values of i, because this sheaf here has a particularly nice resolution. And so this E2 page that you're using to compute. That you're using to compute the spectral sequence has lots of zeros. And so, in particular, from this, what you can get again for smooth projective unirational varieties is that the second unramified cohomology is in fact precisely this unramified Brouwer group that we saw before. So for quotient varieties, it is the Pokhomov multiplier. And what is very interesting is that the third unramified cohomology turns out to measure, to precisely measure, the defect of the entire... Measure the defect of the integral Hodge conjecture in degree four. So here you have these Hodge classes. These are integral classes in X of dimension four that after you pass two complex coefficients fall into the 2,2 component in the Hodge decomposition, and you are factoring out by the classes that come from sub-varieties. The Hodge conjecture with over Q, right? So instead of Z here, I would have Q would predict that these two. Of Z here, I would have Q would predict that these two are the same, and the integral Hodge conjecture is well, the defect of it is precisely measured, as it turns out, by third non-Rama Fact cohomology. Very surprising. So there's lots back into these obstructions to rationality. Okay, so you might wonder if we have for quotient varieties also similar formulas as we had for these second unramified co-homologies. We do, but they are But they are quite hideous. So, for groups of odd orders, there is a formula for computing the third unramified cohomology. It is much more complicated than the one for H2. So you will replace second cohomology of the group by third cohomology of the group. You will again do a sort of intersection of cardinals, but now we will have to run through all subgroups of the group. And I will also have to pick an element that centralizes the subgroup, this little G. This little g so I consider multiplication of this little g and elements from the subgroup. This big i is the group generated by g, and multiplication of h and g gives me a map from h cross g into g, which then gives me an inverted mapping cohomology. From this thing, I can, using spectral sequences, pass down to second cohomology of h with strange coefficients, which I fix to normal coefficients. Apart from this madness up here, I have to factor everything by certain corestrictions coming from subgroups of G. And the cores that I have to take are images of cop products. So here, let me explain. This is H1 of H with Q over Z coefficients, which is the same as H2 of H with Z coefficients. I make a cup product, I land in H4 of H with Z coefficients, and then I pull back into H3 of H with Q over Z coefficients. Of H with Q over Z coefficients. So it is interesting to note that this is a bit again somehow related to all of these results that I mentioned before by Tia and Hirzebruch regarding the integral Hodge conjecture. Namely, the thing that they use there in order to produce those strange counterexamples is a very simple group, Cp to the third power. And the fact that the co-homological strange And the fact that the cohomological strangeness that they use is that there is a particular element in the fourth integral cohomology of H, which is not a cop product. So what I can do now is I can construct from this particular group a certain bigger group by using an action of Cp squared, a certain action, which gives me a group of order p to the five. And so Hoshi, Kang, and Yamasaki implemented this formula and they realized. This formula, and they realized that actually one can find groups of order p to the five which have vanishing Bohomolov multipliers but non-vanishing third non-ramified cohomology. So for the moment, these are only computer calculations for p is equal to 5, 7, 11, something like this. But somehow everything is so tightly related that, of course, I absolutely expect that these groups will have in general. Will have in general this property that their third and ramific cohomologies will vanish, but it is surprisingly difficult to prove this. This formula is very complicated, and we're still not quite there. Okay, so looking at all of these formulas, you might think that it is very difficult to construct then groups with non-trivial obstructions, these co-homological obstructions, because essentially what you need to do Obstructions because essentially, what you need to do is find some very, very particular co-cycles. So, you think that this is a very special property of groups, and then that most groups or random groups or something like this are going to have all of these obstructions vanishing, and then possibly they will give you quotient varieties that are rational. And I want to address this in the remainder of the talk. So, again, just to recap, I showed you this example of Saltman, which is this little Of Saltman, which is this little tiny dot. He found an example of a unirational variety, a quotient unirational variety, that is not stably rational. And a way to see this is simply to use these Pogomon of multipliers. But as I said, somehow it seems that it is difficult to construct these examples, and that maybe you would expect that still most of these quotient varieties are possibly rational. Okay, so let me then say something about. Let me then say something about generic quotients, generic quotient varieties, or quotient by generic groups, something like this. So for Denrow varieties, not for quotient varieties, there are some recent results that are very interesting. So people looked at hypersurfaces and projective spaces of big enough degree, but the big enough is really logarithmic in the end, so not very big. And they proved that the very general such hypersurface. Prove that very general such hypersurfaces will not be stably rational. And the way people prove this is not based on these obstructions that I mentioned so far, on these unramified cohomologies, but they devise another invariant, which is the so-called decomposition of diagonal. Now, this is a bit technical, so I don't want to get into details regarding this. I just want to say that this thing is somehow sitting in between stable rationality and all of these invariants events. And all of these invariants vanishing. So, which is a more fine invariant than all of these cohomologies combined. So, apart from this, this decomposition of diagonal has a property that is stable under specialization in the following way. Suppose you have a family of varieties that is somehow fibered over a curve. And what this number two is saying is that if for a very general fiber over this curve, Very general fiber over this curve, you are going to have this decomposition of diagonal, then you are also going to have it for a very particular fiber, as long as some technical conditions, singularities are not bad enough. So, this means that if I start with one of these varieties that I constructed earlier and turn them into families, then since these varieties have non-vanishing invariants, they do not have a decomposition of diagonal. And therefore, very general members of this family also. General members of this family also do not have a decomposition of diagonal by number two. So, this is somehow behind this result for general varieties. So, what we did was sort of looked at these things for potion varieties. And the end result that we somehow get out of it, this is work done together with Jonathan Sanchez, is that if I do portion varieties by somehow random groups, random p-groups. Random groups, random p-groups, then I am going to get a variety that is not stably rational for many groups, for random groups, but in a logarithmic sense. I will explain precisely what I mean by this statement, but the moral is that somehow random groups are going to give you varieties that are not rational. And not only this, the method that we use is not this decomposition of diagonal, but rather simply we stay with Bogomol of multipliers. So you could also interpret this as saying that oftentimes these. Interpret this as saying that oftentimes these Bogomorph multipliers are going to be non-vanishing. Okay, so let me quickly show you how this is done. So, because we want to cover classes of finite groups, what we did was we focused on propy groups of an impotency class 2. And these groups are more or less the same as the Lie algebras, which I view over the p-adic integers. So, what I'm going to tell you now has been done in Now has been done in another paper for the case where you don't work with nil potent propy groups, but instead where you work with semi-simple groups. Okay, so for Lie algebras of nipotency class two, well, these algebras are not very complicated objects. They have this abelianized part at the top with generators, if you want. And then apart from this upper piece, you also have to specify how you do a library. Specify how you do Lie brackets. And in order to specify how you do Lee brackets, well, you do a map from the exterior square of this L abelianized into the derived subalgebra. You take two of these generators, x, y, you lip them onto the big Lie algebra L, you compute their commutator, and this is the element that you get. Okay, so this map is certainly subjective, but it might not be injective because it might happen that. Because it might happen that you get relations between commutators, and I will collect all of these into this object R. So, this is like the subspace of all commutative relations in this Lie algebra. Now, assuming some additional properties on these Lie algebras, namely that there's no torsion involved, I can invert this procedure. Namely, I start with R, which is any submodule, ZP submodule, inside this exterior. Zp submodule inside this exterior square, and then I define a Lie algebra. I take this Lie abelianized, and then I add this other part, which is nothing but the quotient of the exterior square by R, and it's going to represent the derived subpart. So by defining this, I get a Lie algebra. From a submodule, I get a Lie algebra. And not only this, if I'm willing to change the Zp by Qp, which is a field, Which is a field. In order to do this procedure, I don't need to look at submodules. I just need to look at vector subspaces. So every vector subspace is going to give me a Leology. So how do I produce these vector subspaces? Well, they are all coming from a Grossmannian variety, right? I fix the dimension of these subspaces. Say I'm looking at R-dimensional subspaces. And then this R is simply a point in this compact variety. And to this point, I associate. To this point, I associated the attribute. Now, what we aim to somehow resolve is this business with Bogomolov multipliers. So, what I now want to do is associate a sort of Bogomolov multiplier to this Lie algebra. And there is a very natural way to do this. I define these Bogomolov multipliers of these Lie algebras to be the commutative relations. So, this is very much related to this dualized version of the Bogomoli. This dualized version of the Bogemon multiplier that I was mentioning before, you look at commutative relations and factor out those that are elementary wedges. So elements in R are sums of elements in, right? They are sums of terms x, wedge, y. So what I want to factor out from R is the sort of the decomposable tensors, if you want, the decomposable wedges. And what I'm left with is this Bogomolo multiplier. left with is this Bogomolov multiplier of the Blie algebra, or at least the sort of the correct variant of the Bogomolov multiplier now categorically transferred into the world of the algebra. So what I want to address is this question of whether or not these Bogomolov multipliers are trivial, and when are they trivial. Now there is a very clean way of seeing this, namely you can produce subspaces for which this is going to be zero by simply selecting if you want a basis for R. If you want a basis for R. And this basis is going to have to be made up of decomposable wedges. And I get decomposable wedges, so each decomposable wedge is essentially a plane in the L abelian. So what do I do? I pick X, wedge, Y many times, R times. Each one of these is essentially a plane, so I can view it as a point in the Grassmannian. And then out of all of these, I span a vector subspace, this subspace. A vector subspace with subspace R. For generic choices of these x1, y1 up to xr, yr, I'm going to get truly an r-dimensional subspace. So this whole thing is a rational map between these beautiful algebraic varieties. And the subspaces are that are giving the trivial Bogomolo multipliers are precisely the ones that are in the image of this map, right? Those generated by decomposable models. What I really need to understand is this map. Sorry. Okay, a very quick example. Suppose my L abelian is four-dimensional. So essentially, I have an Lie algebra generated by four elements. And then I take for this parameter r is equal to one. So I pick one-dimensional big R. This means that I only need to pick one plane in this map psi. And this map psi in this case is nothing but the standard Pluker embedding of a Pluker embedding of a four-dimensional variety into a five-dimensional one. So, generically, what is going to happen? Well, the image of this is going to be captured inside some sub-variety, and therefore a random subspace R is going to give me groups with non-trivial Pokemon multipliers, or groups rather, Lyan terms. Something different happens if R is equal to two. So, here I need to pick two of these planes. So, I have a product of two Grassmannians. This is now an eight-dimensional space, and I'm shooting into an And I'm shooting into the big Rasmannian, which is an eight-dimensional space again. Now, generically, what's going to happen here is I'm going to have two of these planes, each one determined by a wedge, and then I construct this two-dimensional subspace inside the six-dimensional. And generically, this psi is going to be a two-to-one covering map because I can swap these two around and get the same plane. And this map. And this map psi is going to be locally an isomorphism. So, in fact, I'm going to cover almost all points in the image. So, in fact, these Bogomov multipliers, they're going to mostly vanish. Okay. So, we analyze this situation in full generality, not just this particular case. So, locally, the behavior, if you want, from the point of view of differential geometry, varies with changing these two parameters. Varies with changing these two parameters, R and D. So D is the dimension of this L Belianized, and R is the dimension of the subspace of relations. It turns out that for little small values of R, you get an immersion. For big values of R, you get a submersion. And then there is a critical sort of value of R where you get local isomorphism. So this critical value, where does it come from? So you can. Where does it come from? So, you can view these baby Grassmannians blocker embedded into the projectivization of L abelianized exterior square. This is a certain sub-variety in this bigger space. And my subspace R is essentially generated by certain points inside this, right? I pick a bunch of points inside this baby Grasmanian, and I span a subspace R with these points. And what this number, this critical value of R, is, This critical value of R is. It is precisely the number where a sort of random procedure is going to work. Namely, when I pick a random linear subspace in the big one of precisely this dimension, the intersection with the baby Grismanian is generically going to consist only of points, at least if you're over an algebraically closed field. And the number of those points is simply the degree of the Grismanian. So essentially, what this is is sort of everything happening over happening but over um over uh periodics right which are which are not algebraically closed okay um so uh what i uh really want to do is say something about uh these finite objects right finite p groups uh so what we need to do now is sort of look at everything we've done so far and make a sort of descent to finite fields so uh to do this uh To do this, what you need to do is look at this morphism ψ that I defined not over p-adix, but as a morphism defined over Z, as a scheme, and then see what happens over Fp. So in this case, I can still construct these cross-mannians, but simply over finite fields, and they will produce Lie algebras, but these Lie algebras, they will be finite over Fp, so I can transfer them into finite P groups of Neutropensi class II. Open C class 2. They will have a certain size depending on these two parameters R and D that we pick. So, what I want to do is cover the general case. So, I want to pick these two parameters, R and D, in such a way that I will get the biggest amount of groups possible. If I do this, then it turns out that we land in this submersion zone of the graph that I showed you. So, then you would expect that most groups are covered by this map, and therefore, that most Pogomolov multipliers vanish. And indeed, this is. Vanish. And indeed, this is the case. We can use the standard machinery of arithmetic geometry to prove this as long as p is big enough. So p is this prime and it's tending to infinity. And for big enough primes, if I randomly pick these subspaces inside the Grassmannian, I am indeed going to get groups for banishing Ogomolov multipliers with some positive probability. And this probability is going to depend on these two parameters, and ultimately it really depends. Parameters and ultimately it really depends on the degree of the Grismania of this baby Grismania. Now, of course, this is very nice and it's somehow indicative that many groups have trivial Bukomonic multipliers, but the problem is that this constant tends to zero extremely fast when these parameters go to infinity. So if I want to observe groups that are of bigger and bigger orders and I count the number of groups that I get out of this result, because this constant goes to zero so fast, this is going to be. Constant goes to zero so fast, this is going to be completely useless. You will get simply a tiny little amount of groups with trivial logomodic multipliers. Okay, so it is for this unfortunate reason that we then looked at somehow the opposite. Ah, okay, so maybe the situation over Fp is essentially different than the one over characteristic zero that we saw before. And we considered the opposite, right? So we have in this big Rasmannian one particular subspace, the one given by Saltman. The one given by Saltman. And through this subspace, we found that one can find a certain sub-variety that completely avoids the image of this psi. So it will produce groups with non-vanishing Bogomolov multipliers. And at the same time, it is of a huge dimension, so a tiny little co-dimension. So as I count points on this sub-variety, I get many, many points if I am willing to sort of set. If I'm willing to sort of satisfy for this logarithmic count. And in fact, I get the amount of points and therefore groups that I get is so big that it is by some famous results by Higman and Sibs comparable to the log count of all finite p groups of a given order. So I look at all finite p groups of order p to the n. And now p is fixed and n is tending to infinity. So you look at five groups or something like this. n is tending to infinity. I look at the count of all Tending to infinity, I look at the count of all groups and I compute the log of this number. What I'm saying is that groups with non-vanishing Bogomolov multipliers, and in fact, arbitrarily large Bogomolov multipliers, are going to be in this log sense comparable to the number of all groups. So somehow log generically, you will have non-trivial multipliers. Okay, so this is a bit in contrast, and what I was sort of trying to explain before: that you are expecting maybe. That you are expecting maybe to get very few groups because of this, the way these obstructions are made. But in fact, you get really many examples with non-trivial problem of multipliers. So the picture, in fact, that I was showing you before looks a bit more like this, right? There are many, many examples of quotient varieties that are outside of this stably rational zone. And as I was sort of trying to explain, if this result that we have with this constant C is in any sense, In any sense, close to being optimal, then in fact, there won't be many groups with rational quotient varieties. Okay, so I think I'm out of time. So thank you very much for your attention. So, let me first ask the people that are on Zoom if there are any questions. Any to for questions or comments? No. So let me open the floor here for questions or comments, Eric. Hi. I guess I can wave at the camera. See, I can wave at you. Yeah, okay. Hello. Yeah. Oh, you see my leg. Yeah, great. Well, yeah, nice talk. Talk. So you're looking at kind of models of random p-groups, I suppose. But just maybe you can confirm my intuition is somehow if you look at all groups, you know, of a given order, then is it true that somehow the fraction of all groups is something like is overtaken by p groups? Yes, absolutely. In fact, it is overtaken by two groups, even. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And then I guess a somewhat related question. Have you thought anything about? Related question: Have you thought anything about non-solvable groups and Bogemall of multipliers or rationality in this context? Me personally, no, not much. We mostly focused on p-groups. So, I guess the very relevant questions here. Yeah, I've mentioned some. Maybe these things related to alternating groups. I think these are very interesting questions, but I haven't personally thought about this. Sure. So, another question. So, this formula you have. And so, this formula you have, it's essentially a definition, I suppose, you're giving for the Bulgarmola multiplier of one of these Lie algebras. And that somehow corresponds in some rigorous way, I imagine, to what you were saying, the homological definition. So I guess I can that formula is kind of like a hop formula, but in the Leo. Exactly, exactly. Yeah, yeah, this is you. You can view it like this. You can also do, as you say, a very rigorous way of doing this would be there. Would be there is this so-called Lazard correspondence between certain types of groups and certain types of D algebras. This is a categorical sort of equivalence, and it is sort of this definition of B0, what it's doing is categorically transferring this object into the world. So, maybe one last comment. So, something Carlos and I and Marco have been thinking about is: well, when you have a group action on a surface that you know extends. On a surface that you know extends for reasons in geometric group theory, it's interesting to know if it extends across a handle body. And so these somehow in your situation where you have in one of these regimes where you have that the probability of the Bogomolov being zero is like non-zero. Like, I guess a question is like, well, these, somehow, is the Bogomolov multiplier of Is the Bogomolov multiplier of these things trivial for a trivial reason? This is a vague question, but it's kind of related to this question of extending over a handle body. Because what we would like is lots of examples of actions that we know do when they extend, they can be made to extend across the handle body. Okay, so I think the opposite, so from my point of view, the opposite is true. I mentioned two results. There is the result of many Bogomorphological. Of many Bogomolov multipliers being non-trivial and many being trivial. But they are in two different regimes, right? P or N and neutral infinity. The one with non-trivial Bogomolov multipliers is sort of for free because it all comes from one example. And I would say that this is sort of the easy. There is an easy construction, right? It is non-trivial for trivial reasons. But the result with non-trivial multipliers, I think here what is happening is really. Here, what is happening is really it is all about this map, right? This map of psi, and the fact that you are in the submersion zone. And I think this, well, this is at least the explanation that I see. So you're saying when the Bogomolov is trivial, it's not for trivial reasons, I guess. Yeah. Okay. Exactly. All right. Interesting. Yeah. Great. Thank you. Any other question? Sorry, maybe this is a silly question, but do you have any predictions? This is a silly question, but like, do you have any prediction for the higher unramified collomology of like these potion varieties you're considering? Yeah. So, do you mean? Okay, so I showed you one example where I predict that the thing will be non-zero for this whole family of groups, but I don't know how to prove it. I have, I don't know, 100 pages of spectral sequence calculations that I don't know how to finish. And this is for one particular family. And this is for one particular family, groups of order p to the phi. So it seems that this formula is much more complicated for higher non-RFI cohomology. You could wonder whether or not you can say something in the generic case using similar sorts of things that I showed you today. We were looking at this for H3 because for H3 there are sort of again similar ways of looking at this, similar types of formulas, although more complicated. I don't know, maybe we've spent a Um, I don't know, maybe we spent a month or so looking at this. Uh, it didn't seem that the one could get a result that is very similar to what we did get here with H2. Maybe if someone else looks at this, maybe there's a way of doing it for H3. It wasn't even clear, like you asked about the intuition. From what we looked at, it was not clear what is going to happen in general. Okay, thank you. So, any other question or questions? So, any other question or comment? So, Carlos? Thank you, Urban. Yes, I would like to know your point of view about the rationality of cocksetter groups. I know that is true, but I don't know how you. So, I haven't worked on this, but they are rational. So, Coxeter groups are complex for. So, Coxeter groups are complex reflection groups. And so, the Todd-Shepard theorem tells you that the quotient variety not only is rational, birational to projective space, but it is projective space. So, so their Bogomolavs all vanish. Okay. There you have it. So, any other question for Urban? Well, Urban, thank you very much. It was a very nice lecture. Thank you. Thank you very much. Enjoy. Thank you. I will resume in twenty minutes.
