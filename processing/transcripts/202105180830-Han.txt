Okay, so it's my pleasure to introduce Jing Huan from Notre Dame. He's talking about geodesics and isometric emergence in Kirigami. Thank you, Paul. I would like to thank organizers for having me here to present one of. Present one of my recent most recent work. And for those of you who know me, it will be a completely turn, this completely new field. It will be a relaxing talk. You won't see any equations and no estimates. It could be an impressive talk if I know technology well, but I don't. This is, I cannot draw a says uh i cannot draw fancy pictures and i i'm we are still waiting uh this uh for the for the movies for the uh videos uh this are following on this uh our work uh so so i will i will use uh the low tech to write on papers and then demonstrate just by hands and so this is a dream work with mata from pittsburgh and also maha given from And also Mahat Ivan from Harvard. He's in the physics department, and the work is to justify some experiments in his lab. And so there are several words I want to explain before I continue. So the key words in my talk, these key words are cutting and stretching or pulling. And so this, and this another, I mean, this to make a, well, this. To make a well, this is what we intend to prove. This is the result related to cutting and stretching, but at this time we are unable to do it, to achieve. So the work we can achieve involves cutting and folding. And so this is kirigami. And so that is a word in my in the title of my talk. And another word is origami. And that in And that involves a folding. And I will not touch that completely, but just for the comparison, I want to bring up this one. So this is what we intend to do, but we can only do this. So this, before I go to the details, so that we can tell mathematically, so the difference between stretching and the folding. So the stretching preserves. Though the stretching preserves regularity and folding creates singularity. So that's okay. So let me this so let me start by this simple demonstration. So consider a planar domain, a bounded domain. I call it sigma. And then I fix two points, P and Q. And then I fix two points, P and Q, and ignore the red line for the moment and make a cut along the green line. So this cut through this green line. So the domain, so that we are actually working on is the convex domain, the planar domain, this omega, and with this cut, without, so this is deleted. Okay, so this is an experiment that. So, this is an experiment that we can do. So, we hold this, just think of this as a piece of virtually a piece of paper. So, we hold at this two point T and Q, and now we stretch to opposite direction. And if there is no cut, and of course, we cannot stretch it. And of course, here we assume that the paper has no elasticity. But because the cut, so this is a two-dimensional plane will Dimensional plane will open along this cut. So it becomes a surface. There's a curved surface. And we can continue pulling this to the opposite direction until the last moment. We cannot pull further. And if we pull, we will tear the paper. And we don't want to tear the paper. This is the domain. I mean, it is a fixed domain we want to work on. And so we can imagine. And so we can imagine what happened. So, this is what I said. You know, if I can show the video, it will be very impressive. So, this is what happens during this process. So, when we are pulled to this direction, and of course, as I said, it will open up along this cut. And so, these two points will get closer and closer. And of course, these two points, P and Q, will get further away. Further away. And so, this is an intermediate step. So, it is not really show this a three-dimensional picture. And then we want to examine what happened at the last moment that we cannot pull further. So, this when we cannot pull further, we can imagine. So, what happens is that these two points, and so here, for simplicity, I assume that. simplicity i assume that i have a full uh symmetry uh horizontally and the vertical so this uh so what happens is that these two points will collapse to one and a closer exact look on the surface so now we have a three-dimensional surface and a closer look on this surface this reveals that there is a straight line segment connecting these two points Connecting these two points. That is the final stage that prevents us from pulling further because there is this line segment, this street line segment on this three-dimensional surface. But of course, once we finish pulling, and there are other actions we can do. So imagine we have a dangling part, two parts here. So we can squeeze this a little bit, we can press a little bit. So in all these actions, A little bit so, in all these actions, then we preserve this straight line, and of course, we can squeeze further, right? So, we can squeeze further to create a singularity along this line. So, that is a folding, and this is what I said. Okay, so and we can do this experiment. And so, here it is a simple case, just one cut, and we can put millions of cuts, not millions, but 10 cuts or five. Not millions, but 10 cuts or five cuts, that's already very complicated. And do the same this experiment. And all the these experiments, these point to one outcome. When we cannot pull further on this surface, there will be line segments connecting these two points. And there may be more this line segments, not just one. As this example, there are two. Example, there are two. So, so there are two. And well, okay, so here is the mission. Let's formulate this into a mathematical statement and prove it. And so when I first was presented this problem, I was thinking, well, what kind of math problem is it? Or is this really a mass problem? So this ideally, we want to model this, the entire process, this stretching. Entire process, this stretching, but this is completely out of our reach. So we just want to describe this final state. And now let me present another slightly difficult, this is a more complicated situation. So it is similar to the case I presented, but this time, well, it is symmetric horizontally, but not symmetric this vertically. not symmetric this vertical. So this when we are this try to go from the this to connect these two points by avoiding this cut and of course this this is more economical than this. So we can still do the same. We stretch. So we stretch until this we cannot pull further. So this is the situation. So this is the situation. So, this is a situation. So, there will be a line segment that's connecting these two points coming from this lower part. But then the upper part becomes like this. So the surface, the paper opens up. But then there are more actions we can do for this one. So imagine, so this point, we can pull this point toward this one. This one. We can, because of this lines, this has larger lengths than this one. So we can pull this point toward this one. So it becomes like this. So here it becomes curved, this part. And in fact, we can pull it. So there is a range here we can pull, not just to this particular point. So this is a So, this is another picture. And so we pull and we can squeeze, we can press, and also we can pull. So the second math question is, what is this difference between this one and then with a further action? So what makes this stand out from all the rest? Stand out from all the rest. And okay, so these are two questions. And so now we want to formulate into a mathematical statement. And well, that really doesn't take long. So the one thing we just need to realize is this, if we draw an arbitrary curve, just by avoiding this cut, arbitrary curve. And during this process, this stretching. Process this stretching, the length of this curve is preserved because we assume the paper has no electricity. So the length of the curve is preserved. So that is asymmetric. So this is the mathematical formulation. So let me so first the setup. So that we consider a bounded convex set in R2, and then we consider And then we consider a collection of cuts. So this cut, of course, is in the set. And then we fix two points in this set without the cuts. And of course, the set may have several connected components, but we want to put P and Q. To put P and Q into the same connected component. So there is actually a path connecting P and Q, right? Avoiding the cuts. So here is a mathematical problem. So the find C2 isometric immersion, find the C2 isometric immersion, this into R3, so that the image, the image contains. The image contains a line segment connecting these two points, and so this, if we look at this process, so along this process, before the final stage, it is actually asymmetric embedded. Only at the last stage, it stops to be embedded. Because as the first example demonstrate, we may have two lines. This means this straight line can come from two. Come from two paths. So, this is the first question. And so, this question, well, this and so the main issue here, what we do want is this regularity, this C2. And it is likely that it may have higher regularity. But we need C2 to formulate the next one. So, the next one is what makes this. So, the next one is what makes this the outcome of the stretching this different from all the rest. So, the rest involves some pressing, this squeezing, and also this pulling. That is when we don't have these geodesics, this to enclose a region. And so, here, the second question. So, among So among all those isometric immersions, find one to minimize certain energy. And of course, there are many ways to prescribe this what is the energy. And the most natural one is the L2. Is the L2 norm of the second fundamental form of the surface. And so this L2 norm of the second fundamental form appears frequently in the material sites. It describes on average the deviation in L2 norm from this planar, this from a planar surface. So this Surface. So this, and since it is an isometric immersion coming from a planar region, so the Gauss curvature is equal to zero. And then the square of the square length of the second fundamental form is nothing but the square of the mean curvature. So it is just, we want to find one, this, so among all those. So, among all those immersions, this asymmetric immersions, we want to prove there is one actually minimizing the L2 norm of the mean curvature. So, that is this one corresponding to this opponent, not other actions. So, other actions, you need to put more energy on it. Okay, so these are the mass formulations. This is of those. This of those. And in fact, there is an ultimate this goal here. So I didn't write it here, but I assume that the cuts are given on the domain. But there is one related problem, one problem related to the road design. We were only given 10 line segments. 10 line segments of different sizes. And now put them. So the domain is given, omega is given. Now put those 10 line segments on the domain to serve the cuts. So we have the freedom to put them and find the configuration so that the energy is the smallest. So the energy is smallest, not for the fixed configuration, but among all the possible configurations. So it is like an inverse problem. So, it is like an inverse problem of this issue. And so, that is more in this out of reach for us at this time. Okay, and so what can we prove at the moment? And so we have a hard time getting this the regularity. And so, so this and without This and without this C2 regularity, and of course, there is no way for us to proceed for all the rest questions. So, let me present the main result that we can prove at this point. So, this is the main result. the main result this uh so we look at the this uh this uh configuration a fixed domain a fixed complex uh the convex domain and the fixed this several line segments uh serving as cuts and we fix two points and so we can find a piecewise smooth isometric immersion into R3 so that the image has has a line segment. Has a line segment. The image has a line segment. And so here, the surface is singular. Globally, in fact, it is Lipschitz. Globally, it is Lipschitz. And it is not C1 exactly along these pre-images of this straight line. Of this straight line segment. So, in other words, if we go back to this planar domain, so this geodesic connecting these two points, so our constructed asymmetric immersion is not C1 along those geodesics. And so we believe, I mean, it is what we expect is true at this time, but we are unable to prove it. And because this low regularity, And because this is a low regularity, so the in fact, so this we can squeeze, we can fold, and so we can do one more thing so that the image in fact is a planar, is in plane. So we come from a two-dimensional plane, and then we end up with two-dimensional plane. So this part involves folding. So this squeezing or so one thing I would like to point out. I would like to point out that this asymmetric immersion maps all the geodesic into this straight line segment. So that is what we are able to prove. And so as I said, this is very different from the math, this problems I did. So it's very hard to imagine what kind of It's very hard to imagine what kind of technique that we should expect at the beginning. And it turns out that this, well, it is not a, this is not a high school Mass Olympia problem. I mean, it actually involves some mathematics. For example, at a certain stage, we need to use Hambana theorem. It's very hard to imagine why the Hambana theorem has any role in this kind of investigation. Okay, so to finish my talk, and of course, there are some crazy ideas in this process. But to finish my talk, let me just make a remark on the cuts, the type of the cuts. On the cuts, the type of the cuts. So, this example, I only demonstrate this time constraint. I want to demonstrate this one cut. And in fact, there are several types of cuts. And the first type is this distrained cut. So, cuts are three lines and they are distrained. And another types of cuts, we allow the cuts to be intersecting. The cusp to be intersecting, but still straight line, but they can intersect. So they can go like this, and then they can intersect like this. But then for this mathematical, this formulation of the problem. So when we have this situation, right? So here it's like we have one, two, three, three cuts. But for this one, we don't view this as two cuts. This one, we don't view this as two cuts intersecting each other. We view it as four cuts. They share the same one vertex. And so this, you know, either for both cases, this our theorem apart, this distrained cut and the intersecting cuts. And there is one, this cut we are working on this time is a curved cut. So we allow the cut, this of the, we allow this uh uh the we allow the cuts uh to be uh to be uh to be a curve right instead of uh instead of the this uh um this line segments so uh to finish my talk uh let me present a picture uh for this one i i do have a nice uh i do have a nice picture so uh Let me let me share this picture. Okay, so the so here is a the so there are three pictures. Let's go from the from from from this side to to this one. So the so the cuts are long circles. So those are dots. Long circles. So those are dotted lines. Dotted curves are cuts. So there are several cuts here. So in this picture, so all cuts, this are this smaller arcs. So the North Pole and South Pole, they are the two points. So in this picture, there is a line segment going through from the north to south, avoiding all the cuts. And in this picture, Cuts. And in this picture, let's move this cut, this extend the cup of this beyond this diameter. So that we go this cut a little bit further and this cut a little bit further. And now the lines, this now the shortest path zigzags. This because we need to avoid the cuts. So they zigzag and going from the north to the south. And for this picture, we extend the cuts even. We extend the cuts even further. So we extend the cuts even further. So let me point out: there is an entire cut here. So this is the entire cut. But this time, now the shortest path goes line segment from this point to this end of the cut. And then another line segment going through this end toward this cut tangentially. Cut tangentially. And then it follows the cut a little bit. And it follows the cut and then tangentially, leaving the cut to this end by line segment and then here. And so now we stretch. And of course, when we, for this picture, nothing happens because this is already a line segment. And for this one, and it becomes, it's very easy to tell that this becomes a line segment. Becomes a line segment. And it is hard to imagine that when we stretch this, this also becomes a line segment. And this picture is not very well drawn here. We really couldn't tell that this red line becomes a line segment, but it actually does. So this is a picture that we are working on. And of course, we can put more cuts, right? If we don't like this circles, Don't like the this circles, for example, we can put lots of s's, this the letter s's, capital S's, and different sizes, and that serves to be the cuts. Okay, thank you. Stop you. Oh, are there questions? So, in your first example, yeah, is that for the minimizer? I believe so. I believe so. But we don't have the regularity, so we cannot talk about yeah. You don't want to introduce any boundary term in the energy. Okay, so there is no boundary. Okay, so let me just. There is no boundary here. So, this, okay, so let me say this. This is the entire region. So, when we pull this, so the this also changes shape. And so, this at the final stage, well, the shape of this curve, well, we cannot determine the shape of curve to start with. shape of curve to starways. At the final stage of this poding, this has its image, but it is determined by the process. We cannot prescribe it. And if we prescribe, then we mean we will increase the I mean, we will increase the energy. What I mean by the boundary is the cut L. You want to basically embed L into R3. So you don't want to attach any energy to this boundary curve? No. That's well, that's the okay. So let me put it in this way, right? This we haven't been thinking. We haven't been thinking about what should be the correct energy in this. At this time, we want to resolve the C2 issue for the next part. But all their experiments, I mean, this is from the material science, they point out to this L2 norm of the second fundamental form. They didn't, I mean, it's very likely that there might be some. That there might be some boundary integral involved. But that will add the complexity to the problem. Are there other questions? May I ask one? Yeah. To study regularity, do we maybe need a monotonicity formula? Well, at this time, we don't know how to associate. We don't know how to associate anything regular to this problem. So, this the way we construct this isometric immersion, we have a very quite a complicated procedure to divide the domain by using the geodesic. And then we construct region by region. So that creates a singularity. Singularity. So we don't know how any formula, like what you suggested, even this monotonicity formula or monotonicity of the or any energy associated to this problem. So it is before we prove the C2 regularity or after? We don't know. Anyway, it's 2D, so maybe there's. Anyway, it's it's 2D, so maybe there should be like model singularities, right? So I believe so. Yes, yes, I believe so. Okay, let's thank Professor Jingha.
