was accepting to make a working session so he will first make a presentation and then we will go into the into some points that he wants us to discuss and henrik is a professor of computational microdynamics at the university of cambridge is also director of the sensory lab he developed uh with his group for more than a decade now Group for more than a decade now. Many tools and concepts related to computational approaches in homeristene development. And this integrates genetics, hormonal signals, geometry, biophysics. And he's going to speak today about pavement cell shape irritation and maintenance and how to improve the model. Thank you, Christophe. Thank you, Christophe. Yeah, improving the models, that's the idea of the afternoon session. So I'll be around for that one and see how many others who would like to discuss the current models and see if we can improve them. And I took a test case of payment cells. So this is a little bit a side track to what I usually do. I usually work on Meristams. And then I have collaborative people doing Collaborate with people doing payment cell experiments and try to do modeling on that. And the idea was actually to have Arun Sapakur here to do the experimental part in one session, and then we could do the modeling session in my part. But I will try to combine it a little bit. So I will start with discussing some of the experiments and then some discussions around that, because I think it is a little bit problematic when it comes to payments, how different groups are measuring things, and then get. Different groups are measuring things and get different kinds of results. Which I don't think means that someone is cheating. It could actually be that we are just measuring different things and won't find different things. And then I will discuss the models. But initially, I would just like to thank Annie and the organizers and make people not here a little bit envious. So yesterday we went for a nice great And then afterwards, had a little bit of mezcal trying. So it was a really great excursion. But also the whole meeting, I think, has been very useful for me. And I actually re-interpreting my own models. So I think that is a really good thing of this. And I can all directly say that my own models, which I will discuss towards the end, is not like. Like simplifications, so constitutive models of mechanics with the idea to include all the growth such that we can model morphogenesis. So, we cannot do this on very much detail, but I hope we can improve these by the other type of models we have. I will also do a little bit advertisements. So Sarah and I we work at the the Sainsbury lab. We work at the Saintsbury Lab, which is a great place to work. So it's in the botanic garden of Cambridge, and it's a relatively new building, 10 years old, but it was dedicated to plant sciences. And it was fully paid by David Sainsbury, and he continues to pay all the research. So if you come, you will get a core funding every year of 300,000. Of Â£300,000, and you can do whatever you like with that. We will make sure you get the equipment you need to do your experiments. And we are currently looking at two professors. One more classical plant development, but people who can quantify and understand mathematics because the idea of the lab is to do lots of collaborations. And one that is more towards the modeling side, or we call it the quantum. We call it a quantitative plan development. But we also have for union people five-year career development fellowships where you also get some core funds. So if you're a professor in Cambridge, they write your retirement date in the contract. But these ones are more a five-year and no extension type. And we're also looking for proposed stocks. This one is actually full announced. This one is actually full night. But they are currently open, as in many other places, but come and have a chat with me if you feel slightest interest or maybe coming to Cambridge. Not as good weather as here, but a very nice environment. Okay, so as I said, I will focus on pavement cells today. So these are these digital-shaped cells. Shaped cells, at least in arabidopsis, that forms in the epidermis of leaves and some other organs as well. So, one thing to note, and I mean, most people have seen them get a little curious, how can they form? So, I think even if you're not working with them, you might still kind of have ideas on how you actually can form these shapes. But they originate while the plant leaf is growing. Leaf is growing. And one thing I actually learned a few days ago when I read this review is that half of them are more or less formed directly, but half of them comes from this model images. And that might be useful to think about when we see that there are some contradictions in what we measure. But then if you look at different plants, then they have very different shapes as well. But I will focus on in terms So, but I will focus on in terms of the data on our glosses. And I chose this because when I am a physicist by training, I started working on plant meristens and then some papers came up on these pavement cells. And everyone I collaborated with was complaining on the papers. I know they measure it wrong and it's not right. And what the image is not what you see, and blah, blah, blah. And I think that has been kind of continued. And I think that has been kind of continued. So a lot of this kind of people don't really trust or that they believe their own ideas better than the others, I guess. But today I hope we can have a discussion that is more on constructive, trying to improve and also kind of believe what the other ones are seeing and see, can it be integrated? Maybe there's not a single solution for the problem. Good. Good. And one reason I'm kind of interested in this is that some models are based on molecular interactions, some are based on mechanics and stress and so on and growth. And that's kind of my ambition in life, to try to figure out how plant develops, not focusing on one single kind of mechanism, but trying to integrate different mechanisms because I really believe you need that to be able to explain the whole system. Okay, so if I start with some of the molecular, and these were kind of those that appeared when I started working with plants. So here I heard lots of complaints. But the idea is that you have these rough proteins that locate at the lobes, which are called the indentation. The lobes, which are called the indentations, and other rough proteins on the necks. And now we will see one of the issues here. So here they have quantified what happens if you knock down these rocks and you do get an effect on the shape. And probably each slide I'm going to show you, there is a different quantification method used to define the shape of a payment cell. So this is one thing we really should discuss in the. One thing we really should discuss in the community to try to use a very similar thing. So they seem to have an effect. And as I said, they are localized where you get this bulging forming. So that seems good. And I had to go back to all of these original papers. So there might be better data available now that I didn't look at. That's also something I'm quite curious about. Because this was something one of my collaborators complained about, whether this actually was the wrong. Complain about whether this actually was the rock image that's wrong. But if you knock them out, you can also see there is an effect on microtubles. So there is a connection between the rocks and microtubules, which is interesting. So the idea then is that you have a cell, you get patches of rocks, and that somehow interacts with the microtubules, and from that you can emerge. One of the main questions then is how you communicate between cells because you want. Because you want, if you want to do an indentation, you want rock on one side, but not on the other, or the other type of rock on the other side. So, the suggestion for that was that probably auction is involved. So they could quantify here, now they quantify differently. So now it's average low number per micrometer square. But they say that they get an effect when you have the yucca, which is oxygen synthesis. Is oxygen synthesis. And the other thing that they kind of note is that the rocks are actually induced by oxygen. A little bit differently. Superintendent. And then I will come back to Veronica's models on this a bit later. Because I guess in the models, that's actually important. And if they're equal, they yeah, they don't digitally digitize. So, the idea is also that pin is involved. So, pin is localized according to this third again in the lobes and can move the oxygen out in different places of the wall by doing that. And the gene mutant has a phenotype in terms of shape. Now, we can come to see a little bit of the problem that when they quantify this, at the same time, they use the ABP. At the same time, they used the ABP1 mutants, weak a little, and got similar kind of phenotypes. And I don't know if everyone is aware of this, but this is one of the kind of interesting things that happen. So this is not a mutant, it may be, so it's supposed to be an oxygen-binding protein, but this mutant is not a mutant one. So it's something else, but they kind of get the same kind of phenotype, which they connect to the. Type which they connected with so yeah. So then do you trust the big data? Do we trust the whole thing? Yeah. ABP1 thing, that's the bucket of cold water. But that is still, if we just are on bias now and go through what we see in the paper, that you have been occupying getting oxygen out, somehow it can affect the rock binding as well. The raw binding as well, so you can have people and you can communicate between the two cells by having the but plus thickening. So here's another pin one, the same mutant apparently. And you have a really not the same result. You have, in principle, what they say is no. What they say is no phenotype at all. When they look at the expression, this is the payment cells completely black. So what's going on? This is things I like to discuss. What I do see, however, is that in the multiple thing mutants that they get a phenotype in there. But something is clearly different in these two studies. Yeah, that's good discussion. Okay, and then we and others started to look at magnets and compare it with stress patterns. So this is of course a little bit more difficult because you cannot measure the stress, but you can model the stress. So between weight, payment cells shaped cells. In this case, isotropic material and In this case, isotropic material, and just look at the stress directions and magnitudes that come and compare with the single cells. In this case, we can see that you get these kind of high stress nodes in the necks. And if you look at the stress directions, they kind of span across between these necks in the frequencies when the shape is warm. This is an A. This is an AFM. Well, we kind of indicate that this could be the fibers. This is just scanning the surface. And the other did a similar thing, and I also showed that if you have a 3D model, then you can see in that climate walls, the magnitude will go really strongly upwards, which correlates with the stress patterns in that climate walls. Happens in that kind of box. If you have a 3D model of credit risk payment cell, and then they also indicate the cellular patterns that kind of follows the market. So when we now look at that following the undefined walls and measuring multi-dubal presence, we measure the curvature and we measure the We measure the predict the stresses in our models. We can see that there is a strong correlation between the curvature and the stress pattern. And there is a relatively good correlation between the curvature and the market tubal intensity you see with these spots. Where do you measure the curvature exactly? So following the unplanned wall. So a positive one is this is a negative one. Okay. You can see it goes from positive to negative numbers. But you have a certain scale, right? Because there are some micro curvatures also. We used to wait. So we, yeah, we can discuss that. Use Richard's idea of this. How large balls can you place them as one way? Kind of placed that as one way, which was the red curve and then measured local village. Okay, so this is kind of the correlation now with your marketual intensity. So if it's negative, it goes to the next. If it would be positive, it would have gone to the lows. And it would follow the black curve and follow the development because these cells are cross-growing. We can see that the strong correlation we only get at specific time points. We only get at specific time points. There is some correlation, but the really strong kind of marketable pattern we only see at specific developmental stages. And this is when we follow the growth, this is kind of when the total areas starting to increase. So it kind of indicates that if you want to base it on, I mean, this is kind of for all models. If you want to have a strong model. To have a strong model using the kind of neck-to-neck interactions via micro-dubles, that is not lasting throughout the development of things. And of course, the same group who did the pin one indicated this, that these kind of places where you have strong microtubal signal is actually not completely constant if you look over long lifetimes, which I wouldn't expect if. Which I wouldn't expect either because when you have a very different shape already, then you don't need that kind of connective interaction to shape. Another thing that they noted, which no models really have addressed yet, is what happens at cell division, because they kind of noted that when you have the junctions, that the pattern looks typically different. Okay, so. Okay, so to address a little bit some of the discussion that has been going on, we now see a correlation between microtubles and stresses. Or I can also argue you have the raw polarity signal that correlates with some of the multitude positioning and so on. So other perturbations we can do where they might behave differently, but they might also behave very similarly. Behave very similarly. But one thing we did was to deflate the cells. So it really reduced the spreadsis. And if you remember, minus one was when they were correlated with the curvature to the next. And then if we do the minus all, that one disappears. So it seems like there needs to be inflated. There needs to be stresses in the system for having this correlation with the micro two volt. Having this correlation with the micro two-fold asterisk for more or less curvature positions. If we do ablations of tissues, we can see a reorganization of the market walls that kind of follow the stress patterns we predict in ablation simulations. And then something that some of the models are actually are including, but that there is also probably some stresses coming from. Some stresses coming from the larger scale of the tissue. This is an example we had in 2014 paper where we couldn't understand initially why there was this kind of circumferential pattern of microtubules surrounding this somata. But then the color here is the elevation. So this somala is actually growing out upwards, which means that if you apply pressure, circumferential is actually quite. So, conferential is actually quite reasonable, and that's what we saw if we introduced the kind of that aspect in the models as well. Which means that the cells get stresses on the inflating the epidermal wall, but also from like tissue stresses, depending on how the tissue is organized. And of course, how it's rolling in different places. Point of clarification: on the figure at the right, it's a stretch pattern. It's a stress pattern. This is a simulation of a stress pattern where we have added an elevation of, and what kind of stresses are these stresses in the wall or something else? Yes, there's a stresses in the wall. In which wall? In the promo wall. Thank you. So in these simulations, we fixed the connections that have the kind of wall and then just inflated the promo. But the result is very similar to Anya's where they have a It's ones where they have the three results in terms of what the epidermis stresses look like. Yes, question clarification because I'm not sure to talk. Regarding the stresses in this world, I would say in anticlinal world, if you don't take into account an overall scale of tissue stresses, so locally speaking, the stress would be radical coming from the inflation, right? I cannot briefly show this part. Right? I can't briefly show this one, but I must say that microtubles will go this way. Yeah. In in particular in these spots where you have high stresses. And the modeling predicts this as well. But the modeling I will come back. So then if you have auto-real tension, maybe this could be some coming from the overall tissue current thing. Yeah. That's true also? Yeah. So the approximation. Yeah, we see that in but particularly when we have done some micro tubal perturbations that that Perturbations that some of them respond, some not when we do kind of larger scale perturbations. The good question is: how can be a local local stress be different from the tissue stress? I mean, they all have to be integrated. Yeah, it's the same kind of stress measured, but the origin of it might come more from the tissue scale or in this case, the like. What we see here is criterional wall, right? Or yeah. Okay, I'll see you on one here in this. Thank you. So I will not, I will have one slide on this. I talk a lot about the like cellular market tuple connection and that connection to stresses, etc. Which I was very convinced when Daniel and his talk that this is the way to do things. But lots of people, a lot, but there are people who also count. People a lot, but there are people who also kind of indicated that there are other changes going on in the end planner walls just before and during the kind of log formation. So yeah, I don't go into detail of that, but there are other suggestions of changes of the decline of walls in terms of the wall compositions that might have a magnetic response. Okay, so we have a little bit different kind of ideas how things are working, but I do think we agree on that. Most of us, maybe these other people then might not. But at least the market tubles with the solos are quite important today. So this is when we want to better out the market tubal behavior. We really don't get the digso-shaped cells. Shaped cells. So, this is kind of my summary. I don't know if you have questions. I can probably not answer them, but a good set of expertise in the group here, I think. But is there something I kind of missed, you think, as an important mechanism for payment cell? There's just an observation which I should like to ask for the biophysicists and the seller people. So, I've seen when a payment cell. I've seen when a pavement cell divides sometimes they divide when they're already quite advanced in their life, so it's not always, but they form, as you said, this plate. So it starts in the middle. And before it connects, that wall can already wobble, already starts getting up, which is really strange because it hasn't even partitioned yet, so to say, those two sides. So I would assume, you know, there seem to be. I would assume, you know, there seems to be some connectivity still. There is a wall in the middle, and yet it's creating a curvature. I just wanted to throw this in, it's yet one sort of strange observation. I don't know what it means in light of all these models, in fact. But it is. But I think it's a very good question in terms of the cell division as a process and what happens around that. No one has really investigated that. You know, because when people think, oh, it's a conflict between two independent. A conflict between two independent cells in the growth rates. Yet we see a buckling in a structure which is within a contiguous pressure, but it buckles or it deforms. And the mechanics of that should also be explained. I know it's a very rare event, but it sort of gives us an extra constraint in what these models should be able to explain. So I just wanted to throw. Yeah, so I just wanted to throw that like the cell plate hasn't reached the berry. No, no, the cell plate, no, but there's acting connecting the cell plate. Okay, right. So it's not that there's nothing. No, there's nothing, but the pressure, I don't know what's sort of. And I'm not saying acting pulling, I'm just saying there's a physical signaling. Yeah, but wouldn't you say that the pressure in that room would still be equal and then size? Should be here. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, okay. So, yeah. Know so yeah, and I don't know how connected out to the because things can go on very tight picture you know something is how you can see that but you don't see anything besides yet and it's it's wobbly but it has a final wordal probation i see that shemek has a question thank you christophe and thank you henrik for the presentation so so So, one thing which is not clear to me is how the questions which you are raising now are related to the models of payment patterning which have been already proposed, and in particular the model of Sapala and Ranion's well from Miltos' lab and with Richard. seems to be reproducing patterns of observed patterns of pavement cells well quite faithfully so so it would be quite helpful at least for me to understand where the new problems are by saying what in your opinion has not been addressed in that model yes so i will discuss that model as the model i i think when i now describe the limit stresses versus polarity Described a little bit stresses versus polarity. What the rock models versus the stress-based microtubule organization, and I think in that paper, they don't want to take sides, so they say it can be either. It just because it's based on curvature. So as long as the rods is in the right place in the curvature and the stresses are in the right place, it could be either in the home. But I will come back to that. But I still face the same potential problem. And I don't know if they measure this because they. Measure this because they maybe should have this discussion after the model is presented so that people understand. But they also have more or less fibers going across. And one of the groups now shows that these are not stable. So the question they can ask now in their model: are they staying stable or not? Sorry, Henrik, just play the yeah, so we could see the. Sharing, yeah. So, we could see the person speaking, maybe, or have you have more slides? Yeah, so I have a mummy, yeah, so and I think this one we can continue to discuss this now.
