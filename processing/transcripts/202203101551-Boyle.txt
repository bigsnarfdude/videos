Armin already enjoyed. Just in case everyone was asleep, you know, we have some snacks. So we're happy to have Egan Boyle from the University of British Columbia who's going to tell us about some snacks. Yeah, thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks everyone for being here. Since it's probably nicer outside than in here, but I want to talk. But I want to tell you about some symmetric knots in a particular kind called strongly negative anthrochiral knots or snacks. And I think that at this particular gathering, the goal of this talk should be to give you some good problems that you can apply your fancy tools to. And in particular, I want to suggest to you how you might be able to define an equivariant knot homology theory for these particular knots, which are notorious. For these particular knots, which are notoriously difficult to study, and give you some questions that you might be able to solve using such theories. So, the first thing I want to do is define what I'm talking about. So, I guess I want to say what a symmetry is. And for me, I'm only going to talk about knots K and S3. And some people might have a different idea. And some people might have a different idea of what a symmetry is than I do because this word is super general. But let me tell you what I mean specifically. So this is a finite order diffeomorphism of pairs, S, I guess I want to name it. I'm going to use rho throughout the talk for my symmetry. And it should be a finite order difficulty. You know, finite ordered diffeomorphism from the pair S3K to itself. And that's not quite the definition of symmetry because anytime you define an object, you should tell the equivalence on it. So for me, this is up to, I guess, equivariant diffeomorphism of pairs. Okay, so what I mean by that is if you have two different Two different knots in S3 with symmetries, then they're the same symmetric knot. If there's a diffeimorphism of pairs in S3 to K, such that if you do the symmetry and then the diffeomorphism, it's the same as doing the diffeomorphism and then the symmetry. This is not the same as some other people's definition of symmetries. For example, some people consider these up to like isotopy, but not aquivarian isotopy, so some of these things would become trivial. But this is my definition. And I want to tell you. And I want to tell you, well, the first question you might ask is, what can these be? So I want to start by telling you that. So I'm going to start with a theorem that I'll attribute to Smith, but I don't think, well, I can't understand what Smith wrote, so just copying other people when I say this. So if you have finding order Finite order action on a space x, and I'll try not to say exactly what that is, but certainly if it's a manifold, I'm happy. If it's a smooth action on a manifold, then I'm happy. And it's got fixed set F. Then the, I guess, sum of the ranks of the homology of, okay. Of x, and I guess the coefficients should be z mod the order of rho is at least the sum of the ranks of the homology of the fixed set with the same coefficients. Okay, that line was longer than expected, but the point here. Was longer than expected, but the point here is that if you've got a sphere like S3 and you've got an action on it, then you know the homology of the fixed set can't be bigger than the homology of S3, which is not very big. So in particular, in my setup here, the homology of the fixed set of rho is the same as the homology of the sphere. It can't be any bigger than that. Can't be any bigger than that. So the only options here are basically that the fixed set is S0, S1, S2, or S3. And here. So now I'm going to tell you a really hard theorem. And I'll try and tell you who to attribute this to, but it's a lot of people. So if k is prime, And the order of rho is prime, then rho is one of the following. Okay, now Tess will finish this theorem up here. So, by this theorem of Smith, we can By this theorem of Smith, we can think about the different possible fixed sets, and they can only be spheres. So we can start with empty fixed set. Okay, and I think, well, the only way I know how to prove this implicate, like that this case is what I say it is, is by the geometrician theorem of Perlman. So, this is probably not easy. Then, rho is the deck transformation action of LPQ. I guess a priori there could be other reactions on S3, but these are the only ones. If the fixed set next case, The next case would be the fix set is S0. So just two points. Then we have sort of two cases, which I'll call strongly negative amphichiral and strongly positive anthrochiral. So strongly negative amphichiral means that this S0 is on the not K. And this And this strongly positive amphichiral means that this S0 is not 1k. Okay, so we like to distinguish these cases just because they tend to use different methods. This implication that fixed that S0 exact, well, okay, I'll draw you a picture of this in a second, but the point is that this has to be point reflection. Okay, so the fact that there's sort of only one Only one fixed set S0 symmetry on S3. Okay, this could be some slight generalization of point reflection, but remember I said it was prime, so the generalizations will all be even order bigger than 2. So this must be order 2 in point reflection. And I think this theorem is due to Livsay. I think Hearst Smail wrote a wrong proof of this, and it got fixed. So that also is not easy, that this reduces to exactly point reflection. And the third case is. And the third case is the fixed set of sets one, which Irving was talking about before. So, this is now again we sort of have two cases as to whether this fixed S1 is disjoint from the NOT or not. So S1 intersect K is empty. Then we'll call this periodic. And S1 intersect K is not empty. We'll call this strongly invertible. Okay, and of course we need the Smith conjecture to know what these are going to look like, because otherwise you might think the fix that could be a knotted S1. In fact, these all look exactly like rotation around an unknown. So this one is also hard, because it uses the Smith conjecture. So sort of all three of these cases have some hard theorem behind them, but then Have some hard theorem behind them, but then in fact, we understand exactly what they look like. Okay, what I want to talk about is mentioned knots. These cases I would say we know relatively a lot about. I could also talk to you a lot about these, but today I really want to talk about this interesting case. And I want to say a couple words about why this case is interesting. So first of all, in this case two, these are orientation reversing symmetries on the three-sphere. So a lot of things that you might like to try just don't work. A lot of things that work nicely in these cases sort of fail when you have an orientation reversing symmetry because it doesn't take the things you want to the things you want. It takes them to minus the things you want. But nonetheless, I'm going to tell you about how we can study this particular case. I would love to tell you about the strongly positive amplicaral case as well. About the strongly positive amplifier case as well, but I think that's like sort of out of reach to say very much about it. And in particular, there's not very many examples of these, so it makes it really hard to get your hands on it and do something. Like the first example is 10 crossings. These are also very interesting. There's not a planar diagram that has this symmetry because the deck transformation doesn't fix any two-sphere to project to. To project to. So that case is really annoying as well. So if we believe these are easier, then this would be the next case we want to think about. So that's my motivation for why we're going to talk about snacks. Is there any restriction on the cues that can come up in your lens space? Any lens space, deck transformation action will have some knots that's invariant under it, if that's the question. I guess in order for this to be a lens space, I want Q to be. In order for this to be a lens space, I want q to be relatively prime to p. I can ask for q to be between 0 and p minus 1. And I guess my p is prime again, so. Okay, so So I wanted to find a couple of invariants about these particular, like strongly negative amphochiral maps. And I guess I want to point out that this is a shift in perspective from what's usually in the literature. In the past, people have mostly studied symmetric maps from the perspective of, here's an interesting question about knots. What can I say about it in the case where this knot has the symmetry? And I want to take the perspective of, here's a knot with a symmetry. What are the symmetric questions I can do? Are the symmetric questions I can ask about it? So I'm sort of changing what questions I want to ask about. So I want to define a couple of things. So the first one maybe would be the equivariant Anadi number. And it's just the equivariant unknotting number, but you ask for your crossing changes to happen equivariantly. Changes to happen equivariantly. Okay, so is the minimum number of crossings or the minimum, yeah, the minimum number of crossing changes, self-crossings, maybe I'll say. I meant to say equivariant self-crossings to change k to the unknown. And I'll just give you an example. I'll give you a few examples. So the trefoil has a nice symmetry where you rotate around this axis. So this is a strong inversion. You might ask about the equivariant unknotting number. Well, this crossing down here is equivariant, and if I change that, I get the unknot. So my equivariant unknotting number, which I'll deny. My equivariant unnodding number, which I'll denote U twiddle one. That's also the regular unnodding number, so that one's not so interesting. I'm going to draw the same picture again, like a dummy. But there's also another symmetry here where I rotate around this. That's three-period on the unknown. And I'm going to leave this as an exercise. And my hint is to think about. Well, the way I know how to do this is to think about the arf invariant. Sorry if you're bored. You can think about that. I'm not going to promise to you that the answer is a finite number. One more example I wanted to give, because we're talking about snacks. And And I'm going to draw my snacks in two colors so you can see the symmetry. Okay, so this is the first snack I've drawn, so let me discuss the symmetry briefly. So I set over here, it should be point reflection. So the theorem, of course, is that if the fixed set is at zero, then it must be point reflection. So you have a diagram that looks like this one, where there's a fixed point at zero, and my other fixed point's at infinity. And the symmetry is, well, reflection across this point or rotation by. This point or rotation by 180 degrees within the plane, and then, well, the crossings don't line up, if you just rotate, so you have to reflect across the plane of the diagram as well. So, in this one, the white and the orange arcs are going to get exchanged, and that's my snack involution. And if you want to know the equivariant unknown number of this one, well, unlike in this case where I had a crossing that could be equivariant, you could never have a single equivariant crossing in these diagrams because the Because there's just a fixed point at zero and a fixed point at infinity, and there's not like any axis to do an equivariant crossing change across. So you must do your equivariant crossing changes in pairs. Well, if I change this one and this one, I get the unknown. So it's at most 2. Well, it can't be 0 because it's not the unknown. And it can't be 1 because it has to be even because they come in pairs. So an unknown number of this one is 2. So we don't have to do any work to show that the So we don't have to do any work to show that the equivalent unknown number is different than the regular unknown number. But nonetheless, I think it's still interesting to ask about that invariant. I'm not in the definition. Yeah, that's a great question. So for the strongly negative amphichiral case, there's a unique strongly negative amphichiral symmetry on the unknown, so I can say the unnaught. Same thing in the strongly invertible case or the periodic case where I fix the variant or the period. It's sort of, yeah, okay, I don't want to talk about the periodic case at all, but for me, yeah, there is a unique unknown. So the next thing I want to talk about, the other invariant I want to define, is that equivariant 4 genus. I think a lot of us kind of like the four-dimensional questions here, so this is good. So this is minimum genus of an equivalent. An equivariant surface in B4 with boundary surface S, boundary of S equals K. And there's some hidden things in this definition, so let me tell you real fast. So, what the heck do I mean by an equivariant surface in the four ball when I've only defined for you a group action on the three? For you, a group action on the three-sphere. Well, for me, this means take any extension of my group action on the three-sphere to the floor ball. There's at least one, which is just the cone on the group action on S3, B4. So you can definitely find one, but in fact, take the minimum over all possible extensions of my group action to the four-ball, and then the minimum genus of such a surface in any of those group actions, which is equivariant, and then restricts equivariantly to the boundary. To the boundary. And a priori, this sounds difficult to study because you don't even know which group action on B4 you're trying to look at here. This should be the minimum over all of them. But okay, let me give you a couple of examples where we can say something. So the first thing, I'm going to call this G4 Twiddle. So this is for aquivarian, this is the four genus. This is the four genus. So I don't know, we can ask about this symmetry on the trefoil. And, well, the genus 1 surface for the trefoil, which is this checkerboard surface, well, that's the minimum genus surface for the trephylene and the four-ball non-equivariantly. It's also equivariant even in a three. So this is like an easy example. So, this is like the easy example where we can say it's one. Very nice. Let me also give you an example where I'm not in S3. I've recently learned this is a famous example that I didn't know about before, but that's great. So, So, and I'm going to try and draw this nicely because I'm going to save it. That's not right. Yes, it is. Perfect. Okay. I did it eventually. So this is the not 89, and I've drawn it in a particularly nice position. So this is a strongly naked amphichiral symmetry if you rotate around that. You get the same diagram with all the crossings wrong. And furthermore, this is an equivariant ribbon diagram in some sense, which is super annoying because you can't actually draw a surface in S3 that equivariantly bounds a snack because you would need a fixed point, and there are no fixed points away from the ones on the knot. So in S3, you can't really draw it. But what we can do is draw here an equivariant pair of bands. And when you do these two band surgeries, you get that. And when you do these two band surgeries, you get the three-component unknot equivariantly. And each of those components you can then cap off in the four-ball. And now in the four-ball, there's an extension where the involution has a fixed arc connecting the two fixed points at the fitting of the origin. So there is an extra place for my unknot to equivarially bound a disk. In fact, any equivariant surface bounding this must contain that arc because it's got two fixed points on the boundary. Contain that arc, because it's got two fixed points on the boundary, it must have a fixed arc in the interior. We can't draw that, so we just have to believe it. So, of course, this is zero, because this is a ribbon dagger. Okay. So, of course, we want to find a lower bound on this number so that we can show that sometimes it's not just equal to the regular 4 genus. Obviously, the two examples. Obviously, the two examples I've given you now, we don't learn anything new. It's just the same as the regular four channels. I guess Irving gave us examples of the strongly invertible and mentioned the periodic case where we have many examples where they're different. So for the strongly negative amphichiral case, what can we say? Okay, so let me just tell you a theorem. This is my work with Akma Nissa. And so if K is a snack with G for the equivariant for genus equal to zero, then the determinant Determinant of k is k squared plus b squared squared for some a and b integers. Okay, so you say it's the square of a sum of two squares, but it's some numerical condition on the determinant. And in fact, this is like pretty effective at ruling out equivariant slice-ness for these guys. This is for these guys. So I'll give you an example. I don't want to draw too many knots today, so I'll just tell you the determinant of the knot 10, 1, 23 is 121, which is 11 squared. This knot is sliced, so its determinant is a square. It's 11 squared. But 11 is not the sum of two squares, a squared plus b squared. That tells you that this knot is not equivariantly sliced, which Is not equivariantly sliced with respect to its strongly negative infochiral symmetry. So the aquivariant 4 genus of 10, 1, 23, well, it's bigger than 0. We don't know what it is. I think the smallest equivariant-like surface diagram we found is genus 2. Maybe it's 4. We found a genus 4. We found it to be support. Okay, great. So I want to tell you sort of exactly how successful we were at ruling out equivariant sliceness for those guys. So there are 16 snacks, sliced snacks with 12 or fewer crossings. 12 or fewer crossings. And we found ribbon diagrams for five. This theorem, which I guess I'll call star six fail fail theorem star. Star. So that's 11. Two, we worked really hard with Donaldson's theorem to rule out. So in this paper that this theorem is in, we've got like one page where we prove this nice determinate theorem. And we've got like ten pages where we try really hard to use Donaldson's theorem to rule out these last two. Two have G4 twiddle bigger than. g4 total bigger than zero by some argument involving Donaldson's theorem. And then there are three that we don't know. And I'll say these are, well I could tell you the names, but it doesn't matter. They're alternating 12 crossing knots. Seems kind of approachable. I'll say that I only searched for ribbon diagrams by hand. We never got around to coding that. So it's totally possible that those are So, it's totally possible that those are equivariantly sliced, and we can try hard enough to find a rhythm diagram. But it wasn't obvious to me. So, my motivation for the rest of the talk is I really want to know an obstruction that rules out these ones for being slice. Since I couldn't find a slice disk equivariantly, I'll leave this directly. So, here's So here's my idea. Um what I want to do is define like a linking number between strands. Okay. So I'm this is my diagram that's on the board, so I'll point to it. So we've got like this white strand and this orange strand, and their endpoints are fixed, at the two fixed points of the symmetry. So we might hope that we could somehow define So, we might hope that we could somehow define a linking number between these two arcs. And because it's a linking number, hopefully, it would obstruct, you know, or count at least this many intersections between some disks that bound these arcs. That doesn't really make sense, but you could hope for something like that. So let's just look at a little example here, the same figure-eight knot that I've drawn before. And let's just look at the sign. And let's just look at the signs of these crossings. So this will be a minus crossing, this will be a minus crossing, this will be a plus crossing, this will be a plus crossing. So you just do this, the obvious thing of counting the signs of the crossings on the diagram, you're going to get zero, because the crossings come in pairs exchanged by the symmetry, but it's orientation reversing, so it changes the sign of the crossing. So we always have a positive crossing and a negative crossing in pairs. So it seems like the slinking number idea. Like the slaking number idea is, well, it doesn't immediately work. But the observation is we can find a clever way to choose half of these crossings, and then for each pair, each equivalent pair of crossings, we want to assign them, you know, a sign. But there's not an obvious coherent way to do that. So this is like the main trick and the one thing I want to communicate the most in this talk. Which is, if we put an orientation on our knot diagram, and I know that sounds silly because these knots are strongly negative amphichiral, so the reverse, well, the point is the reverse mirror is the same as the knot, but the reverse might be different. So what I want to do is choose, well, for now, let's choose a base point. That choice won't matter. But let's choose one of the two fixed points and an orientation. Let's choose one of the two fixed points and an orientation on the knot. And now, what we can do is order the crossings. So, for example, in this diagram, this would be my first crossing, my second crossing, my third crossing, and my fourth crossing. And I can, I guess, notice that these come in pairs. One and three are a pair, and two and four are a pair. Pairs, one and three are a pair, and two and four are a pair. And so for each pair, I'll just assign it the sign of the one that I saw first. So give a pair of crossings, so I have a pair of crossings C and rho of C assign of the first. Oh, the first one. Yeah, whatever, the one I see first. Okay, and yeah. In order to do that, we might have to make a choice, for now, let's just say a choice of a base point, one of the two fixed points, and an orientation on the map. It turns out that's the information you need in order to define an equivariant concordance group for these things, in order to define the connected. Group for these things in order to define the connected sum. So that's a really natural thing to do, like choosing an orientation on a knot. In this case, it would be choosing one of the two fixed points and an orientation on a knot. And so I can now define the first invariant here. So I'm going to call this the half-linking number, and I'll motivate that more later. Of course, I've tried to define a linking number between these two darts, and I chose sort of half the crossings, so this makes sense to call it the half linking number. And it's the sum over the crossings, which I'm going to write c less than rho of c. So this is the crossings that come before their image under the symmetry. Under the symmetry of the sine of c. And this is almost the definition I want, but there's one extra annoying thing. So I was trying to define this as the linking number between the two colored arcs. So I don't want to count the crossings between an arc and itself. So this is C less than rho of C and C between the, you know, The different arcs. So, in my pictures, I want to see two different colors at my crossing. Okay, so let's go ahead and compute this in this example. So, sorry, this is totally a lie. I need to divide this whole thing by 2 in the way I've set this up. So, okay, so first I see the 1, 3 crossing pair. So, I'm going to count 1, and it's going to count negative. And it's going to count negative. So I'm going to call h for the half-life number. So right here, I first see a negative crossing. That means that I'm not going to count that one. Then I see another negative crossing, and I'm not going to count that one because it's this magic pair. And then I don't count those two, and that's it. So in this case, it's minus one minus one over two is minus one. And the nice observation about this invariant is that it's obviously a lower bound on the aquivarient unknotting number. Because if I take an unknotting sequence, well, what's going to happen is I'm going to change some crossings in my diagram. And when I change a pair of crossings, it's going to change like this minus to a plus and this plus to a minus. That's going to change. That's going to change two, you know, exactly two of my crossings. It's going to change exactly one of the signs of my crossings in this set. So it will change the half-linking number by, well, from minus one to plus one or plus minus to minus one, I'll change it by two. And I divide it by two, so it'll change it by one. So the immediate corollary then is that h of k k, I guess the absolute value of h of k has to be less than or equal to the equivariant unknown number of k. Can I ask? How does that only obvious that it's great question. It's not totally obvious now. I should write a theorem. I wrote a corollary before I wrote the theorem, so that's really good. The theorem is that h of k is invariant. H of K is invariant, is an equivariant isotope invariant, just like you said. And the proof is you write down the equivariant Reidemeister moves for equivariant isotopy, and you check its invariance under them. So, what are equivariant isotopy moves? Yes, I can totally answer that. Totally answer that. There's the three obvious ones, which are you do the regular, the regular Reidemeister moves equivariantly. And then there's one extra one, which I'll draw for you real fast. Do you think you can R2 over a dollar? What was that? R2 over a dollar. Exactly. Yeah, I'll draw it since we talked so much about it already. But yeah, it's exactly what you said. I used the green. I used the green, I'm sorry. So you're going to start with something like this. The colors can permute in different ways, and the orientations could be different, but they all come down at essentially the same move. And then you're going to just do this arching move over the, yeah. So you'll get on green. Okay, yeah. Exactly, exactly what you expect. And yeah, the theorem is that this move plus the three regular ones are all you have to check. That's really not a satisfying proof, I have to say. And we spent a lot of time, Winjo and I have spent quite a lot of time trying to figure out what the heck this number means geometrically, and we don't know. Yeah. In some sense that might be sort of encouraging. In some sense, that might be sort of encouraging, like it's telling you something that's not obviously geometric, might hope that it's going to be a stronger invariant. Let me give you a couple properties as well. So Well. So this is just obvious, not really theorem or something. But if I reverse the orientation on k, then that negates the half-linking number. Okay, and if you, excuse me, if I do the connect sum, and I haven't defined this because I don't have time basically, but there's, you can do an equivariant connect sum for these knots because you have. Connect sum for these knots because you have a fixed point to do the equigrant connect sum at, then the path-linking number adds under the equivalent connect sum. So at this point, if you're me anyway, you think, oh, this looks like an equivariant concordance invariant. This is the inverse of an equivalent concordance group, the reverse, and the, you know, it's additive under connect sums, so that sounds like a group homomorphism from the concordance group to Z. Group homomorphism from the concordance group to Z. But the problem is it's not well defined by concordance classes. Let me give you that example. So we'll go back over here. So this was our equivariant slice diagram for our A9. But if you compute the half-linking number, you're going to find that it's 2. And I'll leave that as a little exercise here if you really want, but it's not hard. You just orient the knot and then count the crossings between the white and the orange. So what that tells you is that even though So what that tells you is that even though H really looks like a concordance invariant, it's not. An equivariant concordance invariant, it's just not. So here's a question. So H, well, it's definitely a group homomorphism from the growth indeed group of stacks. To Z, where you mod out by something. For example, you can take the growth and D group of, so first of all, snacks form monoid under a very connected sum, which I haven't defined for you. But you can take that monoid and you can quotient by, at the very least, setting a not equal to minus its reverse. And the h will give you a group commercial from that to z. To z, but probably you can quotient by something geometric. So the question is: what should this be? Okay, for example, you might ask something like, if I quotient by the like equivariantly doubly slice equivalence relation, then is this a group homomorphism? And I don't know the answer to that question. Know the answer to that question. Okay, so let's maybe this is question one, and then question two is what, I mean, which is related is what the heck is this invariant? This half thinking number. Okay, we don't have an answer for either question, and we don't have any letter concordance in various. Any better concordance invariance. But I do want to tell you about some speculation, I guess. So, well, actually, I want to give you one more example first. Now that I look at my notes. Okay, so I have this knot drawn in my notes, but I don't think I have time to actually draw it because I'm slow. So, but this knot, let's call it K. Okay. Um we don't know whether the regular unknotting number is two or three. Um but if you compute h of this knot you get three and I realized over here that I'm missing a two in this statement. Because each equivariant crossing changed with two crossings, my equivariant unknotting is actually, what am I saying? I want to say, I want to put a one-half here to account for the fact that it's parented crossings. So h of this guy is three. So the equivariant on a nodding number has to be at least six. In fact, it's sort of obvious. In fact, it sort of obviously is exactly six. And this is kind of nice because here's the knot where we can't answer this question in the non-equivariant case, but as soon as we have the symmetry, now we can actually sort of answer the question of the equivariant non-knotting number. And there's a bunch of examples like this. This isn't a particularly special one. Okay, great. And Great. And sort of an obvious corollary of this example is that there's a family k sub n of stacks with the equivariant unknotting number, you know, I'll say much larger than the unknotting, the regular. Unknotting, the regular unknotting number. Okay, and maybe I'll say arbitrarily Okay, so these can be different. Yeah. Okay, great. An example is you just take this knot and you connect sums of it. This knot and do connect sums of it. So, that concludes the part of the talk where I'm going to tell you about theorems and things that we proved, and I'm going to now talk about some speculation. Can you make a greater than, more than like a factor of two, or just give that lucky with that example? Yeah, definitely. You can do that stupidly by putting a two in here and here, but you can do that in a better way by That in a better way by just using that example where it's bigger. I think it's also easy to come up with an example of prime knots if you wanted that as well. Are there typically many smack calls per given content? Say good? Are there typically many like these in a tree? Okay, that's great. I was about to say that next. I was about to say that next. So, the next sort of corollary here is that there exists, and I think this is known classically, but I don't really know of another proof, or if I do, it's much harder than this. But there exists knots k with arbitrarily many of the same. Strongly negative amphipyral symmetries. And to more properly answer your question, let me say for hyperbolic knots, they can have at most two strongly negative infocyl symmetries. So these necessarily, actually, yeah, these necessarily are not hyperbolic. In fact, they're not prime. But the proof of this is consider. Consider the equivalent connect sum of a bunch of, say, 12, 8, 11, 24, or you know, any other not where the house linking number is not zero. And, sorry, not the aquarium connect sum, the regular connect sum. And now, on one hand, sorry, this is, yeah, this knot's fine. So, okay, here's another fact about this knot: is that it's not only is it This knot is that it's not only is it strongly negative amphichiral, it's also reversible. So the reverse of this knot is itself in S3, not equivariantly. So when I do this connect sum, I can think of it equivariantly as connect summing it with itself or connect summing it with its reverse. And in particular, when I do a bunch of these connect sums, let's call this k sub n, I can get that h of k sub n, well, if I do a bunch of 12a, 1124s, I'm going to get. 12a, 11, 24 is I'm gonna get 3n. And if I do a bunch of their reverse, I'm gonna get minus 3n. And if I do sum of each, I can get any number in the middle, like any multiple 3 in the middle. So 3n minus 3, et cetera. And so as n gets large, I get more and more numbers here, which show that these are distinct strongly negative amputial symmetries. So I disconnect some has a lot of them. Okay, sorry, that's also Ethereum, but now I want to talk about some some speculation. Do you know a prime example if you can sorry? Do you know a prime example? I think prime maps can only have two strong negative infocaral symmetries, in my definition. Yeah. And the reason for that is I think satellite maps They're strongly negative amphichiral, like if and only if the base not just strongly negative amphochiral and the pattern and the something about the pattern, something to the pattern. So you can sort of classify exactly what those have to be. So those have to be numbered. Okay, so here's, I guess this is speculation, so I'll call it a conjecture. I think we don't think that this is necessarily difficult to prove, but we. Think that this is necessarily difficult to prove, but we sort of just discovered this relation this week, so that's why we haven't proved it yet. And the idea is we can use this observation about the order on the crossings to try and do something better than just like a linking number. In particular, we want to try and define like an equivariant Homsley polynomial. So we'll do that like this. I'll write down some nonsense and then I'll explain it. So. Okay, so whatever Okay, so what I've written down is sort of like a skein relation, but instead of on individual crossings, it's on equivariant pairs of crossings. So this is meant to be an equivariant pair of crossings. This is meant to be that same equivariant pair of crossings, but I've changed both of them equivariantly. And this is supposed to be those same equivariant pair of crossings, but I've resolved both of them in an oriented way. And the problem, like the obvious problem with doing something like this is: how do you tell whether your equivariant How do you tell whether your equivariant pair of crossings belongs in this plus-minus pair or in this minus-plus pair? And the point is that you use the ordering on the crossings to tell you, well, whichever one comes first goes on the left side. So this plus-minus should be the one that comes first, and this minus plus, or, you know, if the first crossing you see is positive, then it would be this one. If the first crossing you see is negative, then it would be this one. I'll do an example computation in a second, but the conjecture is that this defines I guess I'll call this a half hom fly polynomial. First max. Okay, and I don't know, we think this is true and probably not that hard to prove using the equivariant Reidemite source. Also, I have literally no idea when I'm supposed to end. I think there's a bell. Hopefully I haven't missed it, and we're still good. Okay, so well let me give you one easy example here. So one thing I can do Is take a knot and connect some with its reverse mirror, or it's negative in the concordance group. And that's a strongly negative amphochiral knot. So put any knot you want in here. This is strongly negative amphochiral. It has the same symmetry. You can rotate and then reflect, and you get the symmetry of this diagram. So you can define this stain relation on there and see what happens. And, well, of course, what's going to happen is you're just going to. What's going to happen is you're just going to do the Hampton polynomial of k. Then you can kind of ignore that part because it's the symmetric thing that happens with the second crossings, but you don't care. Because you always see the crossing of k before you see the crossing of minus k. Okay, sorry, I'm going to take like two more minutes, and I'll finish. And so the point here is that you just get the normal Hansley polynomial. For K. So this thing should really be a generalization of that in some sense. And the second example, which I was going to do for you, but I told you around time, which is fine, is I'll just tell you the answer and then be done. So if you look at the figure eight-knot, well, what are you going to do? You're going to look at this equivalent pair of crossings. If you switch it, you get the unknown. If you resolve it, you get the unknot. So, if you look at that relation, it's going to tell you that the polynomial is a times a minus z. Okay, and in particular, you can do the normal specialization that you would do of the Homfley polynomial to get an Alexander polynomial or a Jones polynomial, which is super interesting because I think it's really not at all clear that you should be able to define a Jones. Clear that you should be able to define a Jones polynomial for these things, or what the heck that should mean. And I ran out of time, but I can say that we have some meaning that we can assign to the Alexander polynomial thing you get out of this. And we have no idea what to do with the Jones polynomial thing you get out of this. But that gives us hope that you should be able to define an equivariant not floor homology for these guys or an equivariant Gavana homology for these guys. Okay. All right, I'm out of time, so thank you. So I have a question. Equivariant signature to see. So I don't know how to define an equivariant signature for these guys because of the orientation reversal. It kind of screws anything you would try and do. It kind of screws anything you would try and do up. There is an equivariant signature that we've defined for strongly invertible or periodic knots. That gives a lower bound on the equivariant 4 genus, which is sort of obviously a lower bound on the equivariant unknown number in the same way that the 4 genus is normally a bound on a knotting number. So it does in that case. Yeah, I agree. Actually, the really interesting thing about the half-linking number is that it isn't a bound on aguarian 4G. A bound on the equagrand four genus, but it's like a, so it's a stronger bound than the equagrand four genus is on the equagent and nodding network. Which is, I don't know, it's cool. I could indulge though hotly, this is really kind of an intriguing idea, I guess. I guess there's a lot to show though, right? I mean can you really set up a a sc a a scheme? Yeah, I think so. So I think that the proof should be basically the same as the proof of invariance of the regular homosely polynomial. The only additional thing is we have to check this one extra equivariant Reidemeister move. But the equivariant pairs of R1, R2, and R3 moves should be essentially identical to the regular proof of invariance from a Humphrey fauna. Admittedly, we haven't checked that last one, so maybe it's harder than I'm giving it credit for. So the half-linking number, I don't think is it bound on the equivariant 4Gness. 4 genus? Well, it's definitely not because there's slice knots where it's non-zero. Using the soup depomphy polynomial, you might hope that something like the Fox-Milner condition is going to work on the version of the Alexander polynomial you get out of this, and that's going to tell you that things can't be accompaniedly sliced. I don't think something like that's going to work. It's like a little bit wonkier than the regular Alexander polynomial. It's like the dark side Alexander polynomial. Yeah. Um yeah. I don't I don't know what that's that's very important. Okay. We'll adjourn till uh tomorrow morning. The proof I know of invariance of the regular complete polynomial is you just define this king relation and then you define the invariant on a not inductive. Invariant on a not inductively by saying, like, we're going to add some crossings and then define it however you do that. And then you need to check that if you did it in two different ways, you could, if I write a nice moves, that it didn't depend on how it happens. But like, given the diagram checks, you need a reason you can actually want to cover it or how that like reaches it. That's okay. So do you do something like define like take a diagram or then define like the ascending diagram where you just go all over first and then all under? all over us first and then all under.
