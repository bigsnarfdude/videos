So I'm very proud to introduce George Okirani from MIT and she will talk about energy transfer for solutions to the non-linear sodium requirements. Thank you so much, Javi, for the introduction and thank you to the organizer. This is not the usual crowd that I hang out with because I do more dispersive equation and word closeness. But I hope to convey different directions of research that Different directions of research that, in my view, has a lot in common. And in fact, in order to explain that, let me just go to this first little cartoon. So, many of you probably know that a few years ago, Mayor, Raphael, Rodansky and Saptel proved something that the community on dispersive equation were really very surprised by. So, in particular, without really many details, they proved that if you take the focus That if you take the focusing energy supercritical NLS in some dimensions, certain types of nonlinearity, but in general, supercritical defocusing, that's the key word, you have blow-up. Now, this was surprising because everybody assumed that if you are defocusing and have a conservation laws of the energy mass, you shouldn't get blow-up. And the way they obtained this result was actually by using the hydrodynamic variables or the non-monify. Variables or the non-linear transformation and transport results that I also got around the same time, at least the paper were posted at the same time in the archive, that dealt with loose implosion of compressible or an earlier stop. So this body of work is incredibly interesting and one thing that I want to remark about, which somehow tells you, explain more what comes next, is that this result is a radial result. Is a radial result, and there is a perturbation along a certain type of profile, and that's a radial perturbation, and it's an scenario. Now, Javi and I, and both doc and graduate students, just recently finished a paper in which this part was expanded to contain also no radio perturbation. One reason for doing that is because originally Is because originally we wanted to extend this and also this possible in the periodic case. So if you have radio, there's no way that you can extend in the periodic case. So we first passed on no radio perturbation from there. It was relatively simple to also say that you have these results also in your periodic case. And another reason why I personally was interested in exploiting more of this connection was because I have been working for many years. I have been working for many years, and I will explain this. In fact, this cloud is exactly the point of my talk. So although here I just mentioned energy spectrum of periodic sub-proteins, so we would like to explore the dynamics of this energy spectrum and, in particular, whether it's possible that some results that are existing in the case in the fluid world, so perhaps growth. The world, so perhaps growth of Soviet norms in the Peleordi Sg equation, whether this can be transported over here. So it's a big kind of long-term plan using these theorems that I mentioned up here, and then try to use fluids in order to answer some questions that I will express today in details for this person equation. Okay, this is just to motivate my talk because it's not about food. Okay, so. Okay, so it's good to have in mind at least one example of the dispersive equation that we'll be looking at. And this one is the cubic focus of the focus depending on the sine of lambda and ls in torus of dimension two. What do we mean with torus? Well, we just mean that this is a periodic situation that we are looking at. And I'm gonna condense in these two lines a lot of work that A lot of work that in particular was done by Rougen, which consists in proving that this initial value problem is first locally well posed in for initial data that are in HS as strictly greater than zero. So the L2 question, in fact, meaning if you assume that the initial data are finessed mass, do we know that this is even local position? We don't know. That's still open. Except two case. But anyway, I don't want to go into that. Except to case, but anyway, I don't want to go into that. But if you have a little bit more regularity, you can prove that it's logical post, and then in particular, if you are in the defocusing case, lambda equals one, you can use the concentration of the energy of the Hamiltonian in order to extend from s greater than 0 to S greater than 1. Alright, so now in particular, we know that this initial value problem, dimension 2, cubic defocusing, has moved to global solutions. Once that's settled, which took Once that's settled, which took some time to do, then the question is: what can we say about the evolution of this solution for long times? And this is a reversible equation, so when I say t equals plus infinity, it's equivalent to say, you know, you can also say, you can also equivalently talk about t equals to minus infinity. All right, so now I mentioned in the first slide something about energy spectrum. So what do we mean in this particular context? mean in this particular context? Well if we have a periodic solution UTX as some dispersive PDE, doesn't have to be just NLS, so the energy spectrum is going to be the magnitude square of the Fourier coefficient of the solution itself. And this depends in time and one question is what is the dynamics of this spectrum? What happens to it as T goes to plus or minus infinity? And even more, you know, we wish whether You know, we wish whether there is an equation that this spectrum satisfies. Okay, so that's the question. So let me connect this with what is called the transfer of energy, but also forward cascade. We saw today in the talk about forward and backward cascade. So these are concepts that really are under the big umbrella web turbulence, which doesn't just contain obviously dispersive. It doesn't just contain, obviously, the spurs equation, it's probably more for fluids. But you can still ask the following questions. I'm going to make it kind of more specific and precise. So let's assume that time zero, your spectrum is all localized around small frequencies. So the question is, what happens later on in time? So when I should say here, I think that much better than one really large time. And the conjecture is that, well, this should happen, at least for the NLS, to be mentioned. At least for the NLS to dimension, there will be more in details on that. That it might be a moving motion from low frequency to high frequency, so from large physical scale to small physical scale. But this motion is not something that will happen easily. There are many constraints here. For example, the conservation of the mass, which is delta norm, corresponds to the area of the subgraph. It's not going to change, that remains constant. So it's a rigid kind. A rigid kind of motion if it happens from here to higher frequency. So, even more complicated, if there is such a motion, this is just to be a cartoon, does it happen in a sort of disorganized manner? Like in average it goes down, but it kind of bounces back and forth, or is it more organized manner? This is definitely more complicated to understand. So, this question in the area of dispersive equations, which started making sense when we had Which started making sense when we had global solutions and smooth solutions was reinterpreted by Bourguan in the following sense. So if this spectrum moves to high frequencies, then we will see that even more effectively if we can multiply by this weight and to a certain power. And then let's sum all of it, all the frequency. And this, as we can see by puncher L is not. As we can see by Plancher L is nothing else than the HS norm. Now, if S is 1, we know that this is uniformly bounded thanks to the Hamiltonian being conserved. But if S is greater than 1, the question is not simple at all. It's a very complicated question. And many people looked at this. This started in the mid-90s with Bugan, and then there are two approaches. One is more a PVE-type approach, another one is more dynamical system-type approach. System-type approach, and then there are some computation, but not that much. Alright, so then there is another way of thinking about the same question, which is much more sophisticated. And of course, we are asking much more in this approach too. And this says whether there is an effective dynamic for the spectrum. In other words, is there an equation that the spectrum satisfies? That equation is called the wave-kinetic equation, but I'm going to talk, hopefully I'll... Gonna talk, and hopefully, I'll get to that towards the second half of the talk. Deriving this, what we consider to be the wave kinetic equation, the effective equation that the spectrum satisfies is not easy at all. And so far, both rigorously, but also more, you know, without taking the limits in the very strictly analytic way, has been done by first having to put some kind of probability background. Some kind of probability background, and also by taking the lambda, which is the coefficient in front of the nonlinearity going to zero. This is going to be a very weak nonlinear situation. And this kind of argument here goes back quite a lot from Perls, Hasselmann, and so on. If you note, Hasselman actually received the Nobel Prize three or four years ago for climate, a study of climate change. and it's surprising that he was one of the first ones to derive in an informal way this wave kinetic equation. Alright, so I'll give you these two different approaches and let me try to go a little bit deeper into one of them and then the next if possible. So we are now settling in to understand the growth of sobular norms. And I explained to you why we believe that this gives us some information about the motion of the spectrum. Information about the motion of the spectrum. Well, why do we consider, why do I claim that the first interesting equation to look at is the cubic NLS dimension two. Well, in fact, if you are in dimension one, the cubic NLS and also the KDB are integral systems. So there are infinitely many conservation laws. And if you match them correctly, you can prove that all the HS norms are bound, not just the H one that comes from the Amistonian, but all of them. From the Amistonian, but all of them. So there is no, you know, increase of the HS norm. Another thing that it's interesting to know is that if we are not in the periodic case, this growth to the sober norm does not happen. In particular, look at the again cubic and LS, but now in R2. So these are dispersive equations. If there are no boundaries, you spread out at infinity and the amplitude becomes zero. And in fact, you can prove scattering, which means that the Can prove scattering, which means that if you get this solution, you can find a profile in HS, by the way, here SS from L2 up, such that if you evolve linearly, this is what I mean with S T of U plus, if you evolve linearly this profile and you subtract the original solution and you look at this difference in Hs and you look at P goes plus infinity, this goes to zero. So in other words, your non-linear solution approaches a linear profile. VM profile. And right in here at plus infinity, but also minus infinity, there is another profile minus, but that's the same. And why does this give us a uniform bound for HS? Well, that's pretty simple. You draw a triangle inequality. You're worried at t e goes to infinity. If t is not compact interval, you're good because it is continuity with respect to time for the solution. So this is going to be small. The linear operator is unitary, so the HS norm remains constant. So this gives you the bound. Constant, so this gives you the bound. So, this is the claim: why periodic, cubic, and LS2B is the first interesting question to look at. Now, let me tell you briefly, since I don't have much time, briefly, what are the results that we know? And let me just say that in this kind of questions we don't have any short results. We have some results that tells you what's the largest bound that could happen. I mean, with the um the I mean, for the asymptotic behavior. So, so far, and this is not sharp, we know that again for this problem, the HS norm is bounded by some constant, which also depends on initial data, and then a polynomial in time of this degree. We expect much less than this degree, maybe an epsilon fact. So, I mentioned here some people that have proved that. And the interesting fact, and again, I'm not going to explain details, that if you take the It tells that if you take the torus to be instead of a square torus or a torus that is rational, meaning the two periods when you take the portion of it is a rational number, you get results which are worse than if the ratio between the two periods is an irrational number. So there is very interesting number to rating apart, which I'm not going to discuss. But this tells you that mathematically you see difference, where in physical is orientation, you shouldn't be able to see the difference. Orientation, we shouldn't be able to see this. Anyway, that's a whole different story. Now, let me talk about: do we actually even have a solution that grows at all? That's what we expect, but when we have an example, we don't know. Even that, we don't know. There are two results in those directions. I'm going to talk more about this fact. So, this is a theorem that we proved some time ago. It says the following: fix your order of derivatives. We are smooth here, just fix a large S. smooth here just fix a large s greater than one because we know what happens s equals one then fix a small constant delta and fix a large constant k so fix also that the torus is rational just think about 2 pi 2 pi the two periods then we can construct and this is a constructive proof initial data in Hs which is smaller than your fixed delta and if you wait long enough it is a very long time actually that this Actually, that the solution of the NLS in this rational torus becomes larger than your fixed K. So, this unfortunately doesn't tell you that there is a growth. I will mention this in a second and the next slide makes a remark of this. But this basically is the best we can say so far. And then there is a sort of a companion result by Carl and Farouk. Here we are considering the HS norm. Here they were actually considering more the actual forward customer. The actual forward cascade. So they construct in the same kind of way we did an initial data which is excited only in the first four modes. And then they prove that when you follow the dynamics, if you pick any k in your lattice of the frequencies, you can wait. If you wait long enough at Mtk, you still see something here. So there is this spreading in a spread. Is this spreading in a sense? But again, not very strong estimates of that. Okay, let me talk a little bit more about fact two. Okay, so how do we prove this? Now, if you are constructing a solution, first thing you think about is I'm in the frequency space. In the frequency space, the NLS that I just took is this example, the cubic NLS. This example of the cubic NLS is a Hamiltonian infinite-dimensional system. So there are infinitely many ODE coupled and all of that. So if you try to do some kind of dynamical system analysis, this is going to be really hard because the infinite dimension. So we had to make a bunch of reductions and came up with a toe model. Such a toe model, you had to make sure that it is close to original question, the original NLS. We proved that as well. We proved that as well. But then we studied the time model. And here, in just one slide, the toy model behaves in the following way. The whole dynamics is on this complex sphere. So why is that? Well, because this reflects at least the conservation of mass. Okay, so the dimension now expanded because we reduced to a toy model. This one is just the normalization of the conservation of mass. So everything happens here. But also, you see when you But also, you see when you look at the dynamics that there are some large circles that are actually invariant. So, if your initial data sits on here, then it just keeps rotating on this circle. And this forward cascade in this language basically said that you had to prove the following, that you should start close to the first circle and go all the way to the last circle, in some sense. And really, that's what we did, which is something that is not exactly because there are this. It's not exactly because there are these constraints. It's now easy to prove that you avoid all of these obstacles and you end up to the end. But with some kind of dynamical system argument, you do. And that's the proof here, the picture of the proof. We did this by hand, and then people who really know aerodynamical systems, Cardi Kalash and Hausen Pro Chasing, redid the analysis much more detailed and they have a better estimate how long it takes in. Better estimate how long it takes in time, all of that. But I just wanted to give you an idea of how this is true. Now, some remarks. Well, this, as I said, it's not very satisfactory theorem because, for example, we have no idea what happens after capital T. It might be that, okay, we managed to make the solution very big at capital T, but it might go down afterwards. We don't know that. Another remark to make is that Carl and Fawud, the example that I also The example that I also here before uses the same kind of construction, there is still the same kind of set of frequencies that we excite in order to do the dynamics. And then what do we know when the torus is irrational? Well, the same kind of proof cannot be done. In fact, that mechanism of growth that we use in the case of the rational torus does not work if you are irrational. But never mind that, Guardia and Giuliani Guadalajara. Guardia and Giovanni Guardia very recently proved that as long as you are irrational, but your irrational number is very close to the rational, you can still use the same kind of argument that we did. So again, there is this very interesting kind of number theoretical thing in there coming up. Now I want to go briefly to the approach number two, meaning do we find an equation that the spectrum satisfies. The spectrum satisfies, and how do we do that? And what do we know about that? Okay, so let me emphasize once again, and in order to do this, to find this effective equation, which we call wavy kinetic equation, there are two things you have to start with. First thing, it's a weak nonlinearity. So that lambda that I wrote now becomes epsilon, because I want you to think that epsilon is small. And then another thing that you have to do is, well, you have to take a square to. Well, you have to take a square torus now, and let's call L the size of that torus. And then what we do is at time zero, I mentioned already before, that we have to use some kind of probability. So at time zero, this is the initial data, it's going to be distributed in a probabilistic way, in a general sense. You don't have to make many assumptions, that would be a little bit more precise in a moment. And then what you do. And then what you do is, well, you take the Fourier coefficient of your solution up here, you rescale with respect to this epsilon, and epsilon to the minus 2 is actually called the kinetic time, and that's the correct way to rescale. You have an expectation, because, like I said, there is a probability behind it, and then you take the limit first as L goes to infinity, then epsilon goes to zero, and there it pops the n k tau which satisfies this solution. Which satisfy this solution, this equation here, which is called the Way-Kinneli equation. Now, this is just like the principles of how you do things. I didn't tell you what Q is. Hopefully, I get to the point which I have to give you an idea what Q is. And also, when I say limit goes to infinity and L goes to infinity and epsilon goes to zero, this you should really take very you know quotation marks, and I will explain you in a moment why that. Explain you in a moment why that. And doing this limit process is extremely hard and can be done, at least it's known to be true in the appropriate, meaningful way in some cases. And I will tell you in a second. So fundamental original work on this topic or from these people, and in particular, I want to mention the work of Nazarenko, which is in fact, he derived this equation in the case of the KDB type equations. Hype equations, and I will tell you in two slides how he derived that in a formal way. So, how do this work starts? It starts from a certain dispersive equation with the weakly nonlinear, with the parameter epsilon from. Then you have this parameter epsilon L, so the nonlinearity and the size of the domain where you are. And then you take some formal, really formal approximation, and there at least you get a guess for your equation. For your equation. Now, making FOMO into rigorous, that's where a lot of work goes. And let me explain how that goes. Alright, so let's now be arm of great patience because there's going to be a lot of notation here. I wanted to propose to you the derivation, the formal derivation of Nazarenko that you can find in his book. And he uses a different kind of a sparse equation. This is the multi-dimensional KDD. It's called KDV. It's called Zacharov-Kartzmax equation. And why is it a KDV? Well, this you see, it's third order, and here you see the quadratic with the derivative. Now, this derivative with the little index one means that you're thinking only with respect to the one direction, and the Laplacian means Laplacian, the whole space. So again, we need to have a certain size of the domain, and there is some probability in the background. On probability in the background. In fact, the probability that I use is phase amplitude, random phase amplitude. That's the type of probability. And in fact, in the kinetic time, epsilon minus 2 and then tau here as a small thing, you get this thing. And in this case, I promise to you that I will give you an idea of what Q is. That's called the collision operator. And that's what it is. Now, don't spend much time looking at it. The only important thing to Looking at it, the only important thing to notice that because we are looking at the KDV type, you have only two interactions. This is called the three waves because you have an outgoing wave and then two incoming waves or so on. And one important remark to make is that omega is the dispersive relation, which in this case, because we are looking at the K D V type, has the absolute value of k square, which will be what you have if you have a Schrodinger that corresponds to the Laplacian. And then the first The Laplacian, and then the first component of your vector k, which corresponds to the first derivative of this vector, so which is right here. This is just for you to get an idea. Now, the next five minutes I want to tell you at least what is the formal derivation and then what are the difficulties if you want to try to get to this equation, this equation correctly. Now, I want to say that there is a lot of math going on in just studying this, okay? But for now, we're only interested in derivation. Only interested in derivation. Okay, so let's do the derivation of Nazarenko. So let's normalize first, just because there is that kind of derivative with respect to the first coordinate, we want to be rid of that. So now I'm going to call ak the Fourier coefficient of my solution divided by the magnitude of the first coordinate in the sequence space. As I mentioned, we use random phase amplitude, a kind of derivatives. And then, as usual, this is a very common argument to. This is a very common argument to do. Well, you want to write the solution as a sum of terms with respect to the parameter epsilon. So here I just stopped at epsilon squared because that's where you stop. The time is epsilon minus 2, and that's enough. There is some physical reason for that. And then you have an equation that just is the Courier transform of the physical equation. And in order to understand what these coefficients are, Understand what these coefficients are, you just plug in and you calculate. You arm yourself with great patience, and then the first thing you notice is that the first coefficient is just initial data, and then the second coefficient, the one in front of the epsilon, is an expression such as this. And then you have the second one. I mean, I don't want you to look at the details. The only thing I want you to think about is that from here, you already start seeing the so-called Feynman diagrams. And what's the And what's the first one? The first one tells you that you go from a K, which is that frequency, and composed or given to you by the combination of two frequencies, K1 and K2. And this is the corresponding diagram. When you go to the second, the A2 here, what are going to be three frequencies? There is K equals K1 and K2, and then K1 equals K2, K3. And this should be the symmetric one, which is K2 itself equals something else. Itself equals something else, but whatever. And so you go from this diagram to here. And then you see these chains. And this is exactly what gives you the Will-Kinetic equation. So you are interested in understanding this expectation for this spectrum. And then you just write it down, you start doing your multiplication, you remember that you are a random phase and amplitude. So lots of things cancel. So lots of things cancels, and then you take the limit as epsilon goes to zero and goes to infinity, and there it comes. Now, this is completely formal, especially because we ignore everything that is smaller than epsilon squared. And in principle, when you do a proof in math, you cannot ignore. You have to understand what happens with the other terms. And well, let me tell you what has been done mathematically. There is a story that goes back to There is a story that goes back to Erdus Yao and Stanley Verniao. They looked at the linear Schrodinger and not the continuum. They looked at, it's just the setup, like if you were doing numerical stuff. So it's really finite differences, the derivative, and so on. So that's in the lattice setting. And they actually not just went to the, sorry, I went back to the lambda, but I apologize for that, but this is the coefficient in front. So they went even beyond the kinetic time. Then Luka and Spawn were the first one that. Then Lukarin and Spone were the first one that did the non-linear part, but their distribution, so the probability underlying is the measure which remains invariant. But really, what really started this more modern way of doing it, more recent way, started with Black Master, Germain, Aniette Chateau. And I'm not, you know, this is recorded so you can see all of the references here. The references here, and I just want to mention the work that let's see, where is it? Right here. Okay, so I'll tell you what I did in a second with my collaborator for, so all of this is for Schrodinger, and there is a student of UNESCO, which after the work I did with my collaborator, Tran, also looked at the CK type. And this is just briefly, let me say in the last minute, the Minute the work that I did with Bintran. So we take the KDD multivariable KDD, but you see it's written in terms of like a stochastic equation. And that's because we have a noise here that we have to add. And then we put ourselves also in the lattice. So our derivatives are actually finite differences. And what you can see when you're doing the lattice now, before this was the dispersive relation, it was K1, but then the Laplace now, here for the lattice, becomes more complicated. This is a little bit what is the noise. And let me just say, let me just go to the file, yeah, I want to go to the theorem. So we actually proved rigorously that what Zarenko. What Zanzarenko proved in a formal way is true, and this limit here has to be considered in a very special way when we prove these results. I want to make just one remark here and then I'm going to stop. So what are the difficulties when you do all of these arguments in a rigorous way? Like I say, I show you only two kinds of Feynman diagrams. You have to estimate Finite diagrams, you have to estimate all of them. So there is a lot of combinatorial stuff you have to do. The discrete setting is much more complicated than the continuous setting because the dispersion relation is complicated and so on. The dispersion relation itself is singular, unfortunately. Like if you are on the Schrodinger, it becomes zero only at the point the frequency is zero. If you are on the K dB type, becomes zero in the ideal plane K1 equals zero. And the noise has been added. The noise has been added there, so I really started the stochastic equivalent because too many waves get struck on this singular system and there is not enough interaction between them. So we had to have a way of kicking it out of these manifolds. And the quadratic, this was a surprising somehow, the quadratic nonlinearity is actually much worse than the cubic nonlinearity for a reason that um no I don't have time to explain. No, I don't have time to explain here. So, this is all. I'm going to stop here. And just I hope that I give two different perspectives of a question that is very, very relevant. And it's kind of one of the main questions of this collaborative program that we have with the Summer Foundation. So, thank you. Are there any questions for Giovanna? The difference between rational and irrational Torah you mentioned is because of multiplicity of eigenvalues of Laplacian or there are some other something there but yeah so for example one way to think about it one simple way is when you start doing this estimate of the HS node you might start seeing small denominators so that's and in other words it's important to understand which are the To understand which of the frequencies are in resonance, and the resonance set it's smaller in the irrational case. You need to know a little bit more than just this, but that's where you can see already a difference. How does that theorem that you mentioned at the end fit in the picture at the beginning with the Martin transport? Right. So maybe you... I don't know where anymore. I don't know where anymore. Where did it go? The final. This theorem here. Yeah. So, alright. So, in that picture that I gave at the beginning, at the moment, my hope is that we, like, talking about the growth of the sovereign norm. So, let's just, and that's a completely deterministic type of question. There's no probability there whatsoever. So, I had seen papers in the fruit, I mentioned one of them, an SQG of the One of them, SQG, or the growth also enormous in there. This is a result of Kisolev, thank you. Kisolev, yes. So there's a growth there. And my hope is to be able to transport something like that in the dispersive case. But of course, before we have it, we had to see how things work in the periodic case. So we had to do, just for now, we just looked at the theorem. For now, we just looked at the theorem of the blow-up, but hopefully, one can go down and try to transport that in there. So, yeah, that's the idea. Now, how is this related with this? We don't even know how this is related to the growth to the software norm, just itself. So, forget the fluid and everything. So, this is we don't know who it goes. But maybe there are more connections between this weakened equation.
