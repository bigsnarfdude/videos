Go ahead. Okay, thank you very much. Thanks for this invitation and for the organizers, to the organizers. So I'd like to start with some motivation. So many of you will know that the slogan that Stotonovich calculus is coordinate independent, whereas Ito is not. So, for example, if you consider this stochastic differential equation written in Strathonovich form. Written in Strathonovich form, and the Fs are vector fields defined on some manifold. This expression here written in coordinates does not depend on the system of local coordinates. If one changes chart, this expression has the same form. And this statement was clarified by Paul Andr√© Mayer and Michelle Emery that. and Michel Emery that made the slightly made the point that while Satanovich calculus is connection independent, once one has a connection, a covariant derivative that is a rule for differentiating vector fields on manifolds, then Ito calculus can also be made coordinate invariant, although it depends on this connection. And what Malivan called the transfer principle, which is what I just said. Principle, which is what I just said about Stefanovich calculus, that this expression is coordinate independent, also has a counterpart in etho calculus. The only thing is that these the ether differentials need to be corrected with terms that depend on the connection. So to see an example of this, let me just show you this plot. So here, what we see here is there's a sphere and there are two paths. There are two paths solutions to differential equations defined by the same vector fields, but the path in green is a solution to the Strathonovich equation defined by those vector fields, and the blue one is the solution to the ether equation. And these paths are generated by the same random seed, the same omega. And you see that, well, these vector fields. Uh, well, these vector fields which I haven't plotted happen to be tangent to the sphere, and you can see that the green path does not leave the sphere while the blue one drifts radially outwards. And the observation that Emery made is that you can actually have an eto theory for manifolds as well. The only thing is that it will depend on the geometry of the manifold. So, here I've plotted this additional red. Additional red path, which is a solution to the intrinsic Ito equation defined again by the same vector fields, and you see it picks up a tangent drift, but it stays constrained to the manifold. Okay, so what I want to talk about in this talk is kind of the generalization of this principle that you can take a calculus that is defined on Euclidean space and turns out. On Euclidean space and transferred to curved space for branched rough paths. So, rough paths is a generalized integral calculus against a path of low regularity. And this has been done for geometric rough paths in earlier work and also for non-geometric rough paths, but only when p is between two and three. So, in kind of the same regularity regime as semi-market. The same regularity regime as Sammy Martingale's. And in this talk, I will try to convince you that this can be done at arbitrarily low regularities, even though the same laws that hold for ordinary calculus do not hold anymore. Okay, so I will start with some algebraic background. So, as I was saying, a rough path can be viewed as a kind of an integral calculus against a reference path. A reference path. And if we do not want this calculus, such as Ito calculus, to satisfy integration by paths, then we need to define the rough path on a larger algebra. Usually, geometric rough paths are defined on the shuffle algebra. But these more general rough paths need to be indexed by non-planar rooted trees. Non-planar means that this, you need to think of this kind of Uh, you need to think of this kind of uh existing in space. So, uh, you know, here one could kind of switch this around, and if one drew the tree like this, it would be the same tree. And this is an expression of the fact that products between real numbers are commutative. And these trees index integrals as follows. You see, in geometric rough paths, one only needs to consider linear iterations. Needs to consider linear iterated integrals. For branched rough paths, one needs to consider integrals of products of integrals of products and so on. So, in this example, you can easily see the structure of this tree kind of reproduced in the order of integration and products on the right-hand side. Of course, if x is smooth, then this is defined by ordinary Stiltes integration. Stilti's integration, but here, kind of, this is this kind of this definition will have meaning also. One can postulate that this holds even when Stiltes integration is not available. Okay, on this vector space generated by trees, actually by forests, one has an abelian, a free abelian product given just by juxtaposing. Given just by juxtaposing forests, and one also has a co-product, which I will tell you the meaning of in a second. And this makes this vector space of this graded vector space of forests into a Hopf algebra. Okay, so a P-branch droff path is going to be a functional on this vector space of forests. And there's going to be a regularity condition that tells you that the more vertices. The more vertices in the forest you have, the more regular your thing representing an integral is going to be in the Holder sense with respect to some control omega. And then there's going to be a Chen rule that is expressed through the use of the KhanCrimer co-product, which is defined by taking admissible cuts of trees. No time to go into that, unfortunately. No time to go into that, unfortunately. And there's a product rule, which, so in the geometric case, the product rule tells you that it's expressed through the use of the shuffle product, which tells you that your rough path basically satisfies integration by paths. And this product rule tells you nothing at all. Since this is the free abelian product, You are not imposing any sort of integration by parts identity. So, this is the most general type of rough path that you can imagine. Okay, and the fact that this X is defined on a Hopf algebra allows you to build up the theory much as you would for geometric rough paths. There's a notion of an X-controlled path in the Gubinelli sense and a notion of rough integral, and you can also define a rough differential. Can also define rough differential equations driven by a branched rough path. Okay, so I want to just very, very briefly give a stochastic example because there are very few examples in the literature where one really needs non-planar trees. So here, if h is between a quarter and a third, and we take x to be a fractional Brownian motion. One can define a branched rough path as follows. Basically, you use the divergence operator in Malevin calculus, the scorecode integral, to define the rough path as you would quite naturally between time zero and t. And then you can recover the rough path between s and t by imposing the Chen identity. So this inversion is inversion in the group. Is inversion in the group and to write it in coordinates you use the antipode in the Kant-Crimer-Hopf algebra. And this, then you can, it's possible to compute all the terms, which are given also thanks to integrate one-sided integration against the covariance function. So, R is the covariance function, a fractional granular motion. And the nice property that this Branstdorf path has is that integrals of functions. Integrals of functions of x vanish actually are equal to the scorecode integral, and therefore, in particular, they vanish in expectation. So, this is just one example. It's in my PhD thesis, but not in this paper. It's kind of a separate thing to the topic of this talk. Okay, so moving on. Can I ask a question about that? Yeah, sure. So, in your star there, right? In your star there, right? The X yeah. Do you have weak products there or just so this? Sorry, yeah, this star, I didn't have time to explain. This is the dual of the Khan-Krimer co-product. So it's the Grossman-Lassen product. But when you have products, are they weak products or just usual products? Products of what? Do you mean? So, this identity here will still hold. This is actually a lemma. But is this what you were asking? No, I was just asking if you have a product of numbers, right? Not fancy things. Are they weak or because the scorehard integer is more compatible with weak products? Um no, so okay, so um the issue is so are you are you alluding to the fact that here, if I have a random constant inside the integral, I cannot take it out of the scarcot integral. Is this what what you're saying? Not really. Well, here, let's postpone that. Yeah, okay, okay, yeah, maybe we can talk later. Um, this was only to give kind of an example, uh, because otherwise there are very few examples in the literature. Very few examples in the literature. Okay, so a fundamental ingredient in the study of branch-rough paths is kind of an eta formula, so a change of variable formula that allows one to express the increment of a function of x as an integral against the Branch Rough path. And the person who realized how to do this was David Kelly in his PhD thesis, who Who came up with the formula to generate these correction terms? So, this first correction term, you should all recognize it from it basically being if X is a semi-martingale, this is just quadratic variation. So it's a defect in integration by parts, okay? And then when the regularity is lower, One has further corrections. So, for example, this is an order three correction. And what you notice here is that in this definition of this sum of trees, for example, here one has a double label. So, what this means is that we actually have to extend x beyond our original x. So, x evaluated against. So, x evaluated against this thing here is going to be like the integral of beta gamma dx alpha. And so, here this was not included in the original definition of the Branchdroff path. And so, one needs one actually needs to extend x in a, and this is possibly non-canonical. So, one needs to make this non-canonical extension. And then, once this exists, you have this eto formula, okay? Ito formula. Okay. And something that comes out of this is that actually, if one wants an eto formula for solutions to rough differential equations, such as this, and one wants to express this difference as an integral against x, for general Branstroft paths, this same Ito formula does not hold. And maybe there will be more on this at the end of the talk. And this is because one needs to consider corrections. This is because one needs to consider corrections not just between single labels. So here we had alpha beta, here we have alpha beta gamma. These all represent coordinate directions of the original path. Here one has more general corrections that are trickier to deal with. Okay, so the final ingredient that is needed to study branch drop paths on manifolds is kind of if I have a branch drop path that comes with a bracket extension. With a bracket extension. So, a bracket extension is just a branch rough path that has this extension, this consistent extension where one also defines x evaluated against these forests indexed by these generalized labels. Yeah, and so if one has x and one has a function f, can you kind of push this branch draft path through? This branch draft path forward through F. And this can be done. And the theorem in this paper gives an explicit formula for doing so. Something that I'm hiding in this formula is kind of that this integral needs to be interpreted in the rough path sense. So I don't just need a path, a function of time. I need a group valued path. And there is some combinatorics involved in here that there's no time to go into. In here, that there's no time to go into. Okay, so here are some examples when p is between three and four. Kind of the easy case is if you have the order three corrections are expressed only using the order three corrections, whereas the order two corrections, these ones, are expressed as this integral involving both the order two corrections. Involving both the order two corrections of x and the order three corrections of the original x. So this is kind of a change of coordinates that also involves the correction terms. Okay. And once you have this, you can define a kind of a bracketed branch struct path and a manifold in charts in the obvious way. You define x to be a collection of x phi's indexed by charts with this compatible. Charts with this compatibility property that tells you that whenever you push forward the rough path through a change of charts, you get the corresponding one in the other chart. Okay, so now the purpose of this project was to find an expression d nabla x, where nabla is a covariant derivative. So recall from differential geometry, this means that you can define You can define dvw, where v and w are vector fields. This is the directional derivative of w in the direction v, and this is again a vector field. And this is not canonical. For example, for any Riemannian metric, you have a canonical covariant derivative or connection. And the goal is to look for an expression of this. An expression of this sort, where these gammas, these gamma twiddles, are going to be coefficients with the property that, first of all, you have this eto formula. Okay, so this is just the eto formula that I wrote a few slides ago, but with the only difference being that here one has covariant differentiation instead of coordinate differentiation. And then also one wants. And then also one wants the d nabla x transforms like a vector. And this is what one will allow us to integrate invariantly against a field of one forms, say. Okay, so the way of doing this is if you take the, so here I'm defining nabla of a tuple gamma one through to gamma n in this way here. n in this way here these deltas are the basis given by the the local coordinates and so here one defines you can always you take the symmetrization of nabla beta f this means a symmetrization and you can always express this as a linear combination of the coordinate partial derivatives times some coefficients L and this L instance L and this L is going to be a diagonal matrix with ones of the diagonal and so you can invert it and you define gamma twiddle to be the inverse of L. Okay, so here is for example what the gamma twiddles look up to level three. This is this matrix which has basically ones and the dia identities on the diagonal. On the diagonal. Here you recognize that this is just the Christoffel symbol of the connection, and here everything is symmetrized in the bottom indices. And then here you have some functions of products, symmetrizations, derivatives of the Christoffel symbols. And these, in principle, can be you can get this the expression for these gamma twiddles at any order. Here I've just written down the ones of up to order three. ones of up to order three. Okay, and the main theorem then says that if you define d enabler x in this way here, this is just the length of the tuple alpha, this is the length of the tuple beta. And so if you correct the naive expression for dx, you can get an expression for an integral that is that is That is well defined in a coordinate chart. So, for example, the expression for if p is between 3 and 4, you have terms of up to order 3. And what I'm saying with this theorem is that this expression here, written in local coordinates, does not depend on the system of local coordinates. So, if you change coordinates in x, in the correction terms of x, this one and this one. Of x, this one and this one, and in all the Christoffel symbols and the derivative of the Christoffel symbols and the integrand, this expression will remain invariant. Okay, so I think I haven't got time for much else. I just wanted to say very, very briefly something about rough differential equations. So remember at the very beginning, I said that the Ito formula for rough differential equations is strictly more complicated. Differential equations is strictly more complicated in general, but there is a case lying between geometric rough paths and the most general Browns rough paths, which is that of quasi-geometric rough paths. This is based on the quasi-shuffle algebra of Hoffman. This already captures eto calculus, for example. And in this case, I was able to show kind of an invariant an invariant Expression for rough differential equations. So I haven't got time to go through the details, but this is. So if now x is a Brownstruff path lying in a Euclidean space, so you have canonical coordinates for x, and y instead lies on a manifold, so f are vector fields on a manifold, then this is the expression for that is invariant under change of coordinates. Change of coordinates. So you see what I'm saying here is that you have these coefficients that multiply kind of the correction terms, and these are in some sense unique. There is no choice here. This is the unique and canonical way to conceive of a rough differential equation on a manifold, assuming that the Branchdruff path is quasi-geometric. So there's a way of doing this kind of in general. Doing this kind of in general, but I think I should stop here. Thank you very much. So any questions, Emilio? Thank you for your talk. So I just wanted to clarify, so the definition of branch path on a manifold, is this given chart-wise? So you define things for charts and then in some way that's compatible? That's compatible? Yeah, that's right. So you take some atlas, and it can be the maximal atlas, for example, and in each chart, you assume that you have a branch-droft path. So you could have kind of an infinite amount of branch-droft paths, but since manifolds are paracombo. Uh, paracompact, right? You can always extract a finite subcover or something, so you can always reduce this to a finite representation. So, you can always assume that you have a finite number of Branchdroff paths, one in each chart. So, this is just the regular definition. And then you assume that these all agree when you change chart. And for this, you need the push-forward operator that was defined in the That was defined in the previous slide. Okay, all right, thank you. Thanks. Other questions, either from the room or the Zoom audience? Yeah, so thank you for the nice talk. You defined rerough integral on many flows for an integrant f of x. Does this directly extend to like control drop paths? Controlled paths? Yeah, this is a good question. So, I think it does. So, in the previous paper that I mentioned, where we do this for P between 2 and 3, we gave kind of a general definition of a controlled integrand. But this was a bit of an ad hoc definition. So, we just had to say, like, H is a controlled integrand if it's if H, so H is. If h, so h is going to be like a path, a path valued in the cotangent bundle above x, and then you're going to have some derivatives that satisfy this kind of ad hoc change of coordinates. And so I think the same can be done here, but there was kind of a bit of a cost associated to doing this in the most general case. And I opted for not giving this definition because also because I don't. Definition because also because I don't really know of too many other possible integrands. One possible thing that you could integrate is like cotangent bundle valued RDE solutions. So this would be another example. So to answer your question, yes, I think it can be done without too much modification. The thing that is really different is when you consider rough differential equations. Rough differential equations in the integrator. So, like solutions to rough differential equations. Okay, thank you. Okay, so in the interest of time, I think let's talk and take the gig once again. Thank you very much, and thanks for the questions.
