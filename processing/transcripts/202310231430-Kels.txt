And so, this is something that I've been interested in, and it's kind of overall it's like we have connections between statistical mechanics, at least integrable models of statistical mechanics, and the discrete integrable systems is based on multi-dimensional consistency. And in particular, you see through this connection, these kind of nice aspects. Kind of nice aspects of the Lagrangian multiform theory that arise. And the specific things that you can see explicitly is the important closure relation for the Lagrangian multiforms, as well as a form of the closure of the action functional. So in statistical mechanics, the analogues of these would be a star triangle relation, which is a form of the Yang-Baxter equation, and the analog of closure of the And the analog of closure of the action functional would be a property called Z invariance introduced by Baxter. And this means that the partition function of the model is invariant under the star triangle relation. So this is what my talk is about today. And I think that maybe not many people know so much about these kind of models of statistical mechanics. So at the start, I'm going to give kind of an introduction and a bit of history of how these things are. Bit of history of how these things arise, and then I'll go on to these connections. Okay, so this is the first example in the literature of a star-triangle relation, and it didn't appear in statistical mechanics. In fact, it appeared for engineering, electrical engineering, where this work of Cannelli in 1899 showed how two different networks of resistors are equivalent. So you can see these are these. So, you can see these are two different networks of resistors. And for people that have done physics, you might be familiar with the Kirchhoff laws. And the equivalence of these two networks of resistors follow from these Kirchhoff laws. And this is kind of a now fundamental property for electrical network theories. And then it wasn't until nearly 50 years later Star Triangle relation appeared for statistical mechanics. So there was a very famous. Mechanics. So there was a very famous work of Lars on Saga, where he actually solved the two-dimensional easing model, which was thought to be a very difficult problem, but he used some kind of ingenious methods to solve this model. And that was a very important work. And he recognized that this model satisfies star triangle relation, but its relevance or the power of it wasn't realized at that point yet. And it also appeared as this. And it also appeared as this kind of duality between models of statistical mechanics on honeycomb and triangular lattices, where you can see here you have this kind of star for the honeycomb, and this is a duality between also to the triangle lattice. And this follows from this kind of relation, which is satisfied by the easing model. So, here the mu's are your variables of the model. For easing model, they can take values plus. Model they can take values plus or minus one, so it's a two-state model, and L is like an interaction coefficient, that's like a strength of the interaction for this model. And easing models can model, can be interpreted as a model of a magnet. So these are kind of models of magnetic systems where plus or minus one corresponds to your dipole of an atom pointing in an up or down direction. And it's kind of a crude model of a magnet. And it's integrable because, well, it satisfies this relation, and yeah, I'll talk a bit more about that here. Okay, so Buxter went into some detail about this star-triangle relation in his book. And so he gave this relation for the star-triangle relation. And but in our works, or in kind of the modern times, we work in terms of the Boltzmann weight. So, for these models of statistical mechanics, they're defined on edges of your lattice, say the square lattice, and you have the variables at vertices. So, the variable here is mu i and mu j. They're connected by an edge, and you have some interaction coefficient for each edge, which is denoted here A. And the Boltzmann weight for this is, for the easing model, is simply the exponential of the product of A, mu i, mu j. And then, so if you write. And then, so if you write this star triangle relation in terms of Boltzmann weights, you get this expression here. And so this says that the sum of the product of three Boltzmann weights is equal to another product of three Boltzmann weights. And here on the left, you see you have the three variables mu1, mu2, mu3. They're paired with mu0. That forms your star. And on the right, you have all pairs between mu1, mu2, mu3. This forms the triangle. This forms the triangle. Yeah, so this is a very important relation for models of statistical mechanics. So this is two-state models. So we have here a sum over your two states, but you can get more general models like n-state model. Then you'd have your spins taking n values and you'd have a sum over n states. And then, like more recently, we've been dealing with continuous spin models where spins take values on some interval, then you have an integral. Interval, then you have an integral instead of the sum. And what you can also think of this as is an equality of two partition functions. So this is kind of a simple model of statistical mechanics with no degrees of freedom. You have the boundary spins fixed, and this is the partition function for that model. The partition function is just a product of three Bolsheviks. And this is equal to another partition function where we have one degree of freedom, mu zero. This would be here, excuse me, mu zero, not mu. Excuse me, mu zero, not mu, so it's a sum over mu zero, and then that these boundary spins are fixed. So it's inequality of two kind of very simple models of statistical mechanics, or equality between their partition functions. And the importance of this kind of relation is you may have heard of something called the commuting transfer matrices. So the star triangle relation, which is a form of the Yang-Baxter equation, implies commuting transfer matrices for the model. So I'm not going to go into detail of what So, I'm not going to go into detail of what these transfer matrices are, but we can see from a nice graphical representation kind of how this works, how the commuting works. So, if we rotate the square lattice, we find these we have these two types of edges where the edges kind of go up and down. And these are assigned, well, associated to two different types of transfer matrices, say U and V. And the entries of a matrix is simply the Entries of a matrix is simply the product of the Boltzmann weights on each row. So these are the entries. You get some product of Boltzmann weights, and they're different for U and V. Okay, so and the rows and columns are indexed by the values of spins here. So for example, for the easing model, you can have values plus or minus one. So one of your entries will be all ones here and all ones here. Then you can have minus one and all ones and so on. So these One and all ones, and so on. So these are these are transfer matrices, which should be thought of as matrices where the entries are just products of Boltzmann ones. And these are important because, well, it's actually known before Baxter that these can be used to solve for your partition function of your model of statistical mechanics. And by solve, what I mean, well, I haven't written what the partition function is yet, but it means you. function is yet but it means you can find a closed form expression for the partition function which i'll show later what this is so we have some transfer matrices and now we're going to use the graphical representation and kind of nice way to show how the star triangulation implies that we have the commuting transfer matrices so for each row you can think of like if you can see the red and the blue the red is associated to one set of The red is associated to one set of variable parameters, these are spectral parameters, and the blue is associated to another set of spectral parameters. And we want to use star triangle relation to show kind of a commutation relation. And so what we do first is we insert the identity and we have periodic boundary conditions. So if we insert these two edges and their associated Boltzmann weights, our transformation Associated Boltzmann weights, our transfer matrices or a product of transfer matrices is unchanged. So insert the identity, and now we see we have these triangles here. So, what we do is we use a star-triangle relation and turn this into a star like this. And you can see the effect is that the red edge will go up and the blue edge will come down. So, we just continue along the kind of chain like that until we. Until reach the end, and then that is how basically how the commutation relation works. And we, this is a generalized commutation relation where the product of transfer matrices UV is equal to the other product with the different parameters. And this can be used to solve the model in the thermodynamic limit, which is the limit as the lattice goes to infinity. And that's something that's very important for statistics. That's very important for statistical mechanics because you can find important properties of your model and so on, which I'm not going to go into detail, but I do definitely recommend if people are interested that the nice book of Baxter, which you can download for free from the internet. Yeah, so that's the basic idea of why people are interested in these star-triang relations and these connections to these integrable models of statistical mechanics. And now I want to go on. Mechanics, and now I want to go on to how to show how they're related to these discrete integrable systems. Okay, so I think that this kind of connections was realized first in the works of Bazanov, Mandesev and Sergeyev, where they showed some specific solutions of the star triangle relation, how you can get discrete integrable systems. And so they did that in their works. And then we wrote a kind of more general And we wrote a kind of more general paper where we showed the general idea of how this kind of correspondence between models of statistical mechanics and the multi-dimensional consistency works. So this is a kind of review paper. And this last paper, this is specific to the ABS list where I showed how it works for the, this kind of correspondence works for the whole ABS list. And a kind of nice paper that was done by other Ben Con source where they are, they were. Consource where they realized that there was a connection between these independent works of Bazanov, Mengazev, and Sergeyev and the original Lagrangian multi-form paper of Lov and Niov, where they both come up with these closure relations in different ways. So this was realized by Babenko and Sawas. Okay, so this is what I'm going to talk about. Okay, so this is what I'm going to talk about for the remainder of the talk. Okay, so this is a kind of complicated identity which I showed, but the main thing, the reason that I showed it is because it's related to a star triangle relation. So it depends on these kind of six complex variables and it has elliptic gnomes and so on. But the main important thing is you can have a simple change of variables and it takes this form of the star-triangle relation. And so this is. And so, this is a kind of more general form of the star triangulation that I showed earlier. Now, the spins take both discrete inconvenience values, that's why you have a sum and an integral, and you have this kind of complicated Boltzmann weight, which is given by so-called elliptic gamma functions. And this is the most general known form of star-triangle relation, which contains the easing model, Bajanov and the Sergei master solution, and so on. Okay, and we studied the quasi-classical limit of this model, and this is a kind of a generalization of this work of Bajanov and Sergeyev in 2012. So in the quasi-classical limit, if you look back at this identity, which I showed here, we have two elliptic knowns. And the quasi-classical limit, we take the limit of one known to this quantity here, where h bar. Our quantity here where h bar goes to zero, and this results in an asymptotic limit of our star triangulation or a model of statistical mechanics. So, on the level of the Boltzmann way, what we find is we get this kind of asymptotics, where the important part is in this exponential. So the leading asymptotic, you get this one and h button, which appeared a lot in Frank's nice talk that he gave this morning. He's leading part one and h. These are leading part 1 and h-bar, and the coefficient here can be identified with Lagrangians of discrete integrable systems. So these are not Lagrangian multiforms, but actually Lagrangian functions that are associated to edges of when you consider Lagrangian structure of discrete integral systems or specifically the ABS equations. So this was already noticed in the original paper. Was already noticed in the original paper of Adiel Babencom Saurus, I think, that you have these Lagrangian structure for atheist equations. And then simply substituting such expression for the Bolsonarate into our star triangle relation, we find this expansion here. Again, of course, the leading part is going to be 1 and h bar. And the leading term, well, on the left-hand side, you have the product of three Boltzmann weights. So you're going to get a sum of three Lagrangian functions. Get a sum of three Lagrangian functions. And the right-hand side, you have another product of three Bosmates, and you get the sum of another three Lagrangian functions. And so such integrals can be evaluated using saddle point method. And so doing that, the equation for the saddle point is exactly when this, the partial derivative of this a star with respect to integration variable x0 is equal to zero. And so we get this equation. And so we get this equation here, and this is exactly identified with the so-called three-legged forms of the ABS equations. So, again, we start from star triangle relation, we find this asymptotic expansion, and evaluating this in the saddle point method, the saddle point equation is exactly these three-leg forms of ABS equations. And so we have expansion of the star triangle. Expansion of the star triangulation and in all orders, but at the leading order, we equate the one and h bar terms. So we get basically an identity a star equals a triangle given here. And these are exactly what you find from the Lagrangian multiform theory as the closure relation for the Lagrangian multi-forms. So yeah, so I think that's a in this In this sense, the star triangle relation can be thought of as a kind of quantum closure relation, where this classical star triangle relation or closure relation arises in these quasi-classical limits. Okay, and the second thing that I want to talk about now is what I talked about earlier, was the partition function and this so-called property of Z invariance. Property of Z in Brownians. Okay, so again, we go back to our model on the square lattice and we have our Boltzmann waves. And what I mentioned earlier was we have a partition function. And the partition function, so usually in statistical mechanics, we fix the values and the boundaries. This is our boundary conditions. And we consider the spin variables in turn interior to the lattice to be fluctuated. Interior to the lattice to be fluctuating. And the partition function is simply a sum of all Boltzmann weights in our lattice, sorry, of the product of all Boltzmann weights in our lattice. A sum over all configurations, if you will. So this is like an analog of a path integral where in quantum mechanics, you have a path integral where you sum over all parts. In this case, we sum over all states of the system. And so And so we've already done such a thing in the case of the star triangle relation. We have a star triangle relation here. As I mentioned, these are partition functions. So here we have a sum over all states. And in the quasi-classical limit, the system becomes fixed to the equation of motion, which is exactly described by discrete integrable system. So this is more complicated case of partition function, which is now the partition. Of partition function, which is now the partition function of our model in a square lattice, and that's the introduced property of Z invariance, where basically you can deform this lattice by using the moves as a star triangle relation. And because this star triangle relation, you can think of it as a duality, the partition function of this model is invariant under such deformations. So this is kind of. So, this is kind of the idea that you can get these kind of quite significant deformations of the lattice by doing these kind of moves, and you still have invariance of the partition function under this property. Okay, so this was work that was very much inspired by Lobb and Niehoff's results. So, this is something what I've Is something what I saw in their paper that you have these surfaces made up of your quadrilaterals, and they interpreted the closure relation as implying the partition, no, not the partition function, the action functional for the system is now invariant under these cubic flips of the surface. So, because we had these connections to statistical mechanics, I wanted to see if can you get something similar for models of statistical mechanics? For models of statistical mechanics, and it yeah, it turns out that you can. And this is a so this is your regular model, and then you put it on an underlying surface. And so here you have all diagonals associated, sorry, the edges associated to diagonals of squares. And so these are your Boltzmann weights. And then you have these are regular model of statistical mechanics. And then you can do these cubic kind of deformations, and the partition function will remain in very. Partition function will remain invariant up to some unimportant factors. And this can be interpreted as an extension of Baxter's invariance. And the reason is in Baxter's formulation, you have this property that you cannot have closed directed paths of rapidity lines. So I didn't mention what are the rapidity lines. So these are the dotted lines here. And under Z invariance, you cannot have closed rapidity lines. Have closed directed paths. But to have this kind of form of Z invariance, you actually need to introduce these closed directed paths. And this remains, and this is kind of a violation of its property, but you can show that you still have the Z invariance. So this is an extension of Wax's property. And the last thing, we can also take a quasi-classical limit of this partition function here, the same way we did for the star-triangulation. So we replace the Boltzmann weights by exponential of Lagrangian functions. And what you find is you get basically the same picture, but now with Lagrangian functions on each edge. And this is this appears in the literature as the discrete Laplace equations, which are Uri. Laplace equations, which Yuri talked about earlier. And so this is kind of an invariance of this action functional for discrete Laplace equations. Yeah, so that's basically the end of my talk. So yeah, I think that you see that this This kind of connection between the model of statistical mechanics and discrete integrable systems, I think it's quite nice, but it is at the moment limited to ABS case. Like we can only get these, well, I only know how to get things that are related to ABS equations. So I think there is scope for, if I know that people have worked on the brand. That people have worked on Lagrangian multi-forms for other, many other types of equations. And particularly, it's interesting. I saw this morning that there's been work in quantizing such systems. So I think it's very interesting if you can kind of get something maybe new also for models of statistical mechanics by doing this kind of quantization. Maybe in that way, you can kind of go backwards from what I do. Can kind of go backwards from what I do. I start from the model of statistical mechanics and then I kind of take the limit and go to the discrete interval systems. But from Lagrangian multi-form point of view, you're starting from the discrete integral system and you want to quantize it. So I think there's definitely scope for getting something new there. And in that case, it'd be interesting if what you find for your quantum closure relation maybe is related to some new form of Young-Baxter equation and maybe your And maybe your well, when you quantize also your action functional, this possibly could be some partition function for maybe new types of models of statistical mechanics. So I think that's definitely an interesting direction for the future. And maybe I'll stop there. And thank you very much for your attention.
