So, what I would like to talk to you about today is a collaboration with groups from the NCBS in Bangalore, in India. So, it's on the experimental side, the group of Rajladia and Anubaf, who did all the experimental results that I'm going to show. And then also working together with Bara Rao on the theory side and the simulations and most of the theory that I'm going to present. Theory that I'm going to present has been done by Julian Wieninga in our group in Geneva. So, as I'm speaking to you, there's a sound pressure wave that hits your outer ear. And when it hits the outer ear, it goes towards the inner ear. And here, some magic happens. And then through this magic, the pressure wave is translated into an electrical signal that can then be produced and transfused and further analyzed by your brain. And this magic that happens here in the inner ear really happens in these cells, which are called hair cells. They're called hair cells because they have this hair bundle on top. So these are finger-like protrusions called stereocilia. And as this pressure wave impinges on this hair bundle, they're going to get deflected. And as they are deflected, some ion channels open up and thereby calcium ions flow in. The cell here, the hair cell, gets depolarized. Here, the hair cell gets depolarized, and thereby you can then elicit an electrical signal that goes along this axon here towards the brain eventually. If you look at the auditory epithelium where these hair cells sit in, then what you will see is, at least if you do electron microscopy and can do it very nicely, then you see that these hair cells, so here you see the hair bundles, here you see the surfaces of the cells, that these hair cells are very nicely, very regularly. Very nicely, very regularly organized, and the hair cell bundles they point all in the same direction. And this organization is really important for the functioning of the auditory epithelium. So it's important for the transduction of sound towards an electrical signal that can be then dealt with by the brain. And it's this kind of organization that I would like to understand. Okay? Okay. Um, okay, and so in order to understand how this comes about, I would need to first introduce to you the system and tell you a little bit how development works. And we are going to do this in the context of a chicken. So this is a schematic of a chick head. And the auditory system is this part here. And this little appendix here, this is the auditory epithelium in the chick. It's called there the basila papilla. And here you see a And here you see an image of a whole basil apapillus. It's about two, three, four millimeters in length, has this banana shape here. And this is happening, or in this form, you will see at embryonic day 15. So the E always stays for embryonic days, so it's after fertilization. So this is about two weeks after fertilization. And in order to find our way along this basal apapilla, along this epithelium, it's really one cell thick layer. One cell thick layer. I will introduce here this notion that you're here close to the base where the sound comes into the inner ear. This I will call zero, then this will be 25%, 50%, 75%. And in the end, at the apex, this will be 100% position. So I will call this end here the proximal end, which is proximal to the opening of the ear. This is the distal end. And maybe sometimes I will also talk about the superior and the inferior end of this or side of this. Inferior end of this site of this epithelium. So, this is just so that we have a coordinate system and find our way along this basal apopilla. If you look at it a little bit more carefully, then you will see that the hair cells, so these are the cells with the hair bundle that are able to detect the sound, that their surface area, so the apical surface area is really graded. So, you have large apical surface areas here to the close to the proximal end. Close to the proximal end and very small epic surface area. I mean, in comparison, at least here towards the distal end. And this gradient is really important because it conveys something that people call tonotopy. So the hair cells, they are arranged in a particular way, such that hair cells that respond to high frequencies are close to the proximal end, whereas hair cells that are responding to low frequency are close to the distal end. Are close to the distal end. And tonotopy means that two air cells that reply to or respond to two frequencies that are close together are also spatially close together. And so you have this gradient here of a frequency detection. And that also then afterwards gets mapped to the brain, where you again have this property that hair cells or that neurons rather that respond to different sounds of frequency are close together. Of frequency are close together, corresponding to the frequency they detect. Now, this tonotopy is very closely related to this epical surface area. And this is how it works. So the hair cells that respond to high frequency, they would have a short hair bundle. They can vibrate much faster. And those cells that are here at the distal end, they respond to the low frequency, they have a large hair bundle, a long hair bundle. A long hair bundle. And this is related to the apical surface area. How? Well, there seems to be a constant amount of actin that is filling up these stereocilia, so these hairs. And here you have a big apical surface area, so the hair bundle is wide. And so you have many, many stereocilia. And so you have not enough actin to make long hairs, but only short hairs. Whereas here, the apical surface area is small. So there you have only fewer hairs. So, there you have only fewer hairs, stereocelia, so fewer hairs if you want, but then you can put this same amount of actin in these fewer hairs, and so they are longer. So, this is one feature that I wanted to point out, that the positional order that we see here in the basila papilla in this auditory plithelium really has a strong relation to the functioning of our hair cells. And here, in this case, also provides. Here in this case, also provides this tonotopy. And last thing that I would like to show you so that you understand the basila papilla is that so here you would see the hair cells in green actin is labeled and you see here also the surroundings and the red doesn't matter here. But you see between these hair cells where here these things are the hair bundles and they are more or less aligned here. You also see smaller cells if you have good eyes and these are supporting cells. And these are supporting cells, and these supporting cells give you a second cell type that makes up the basal apapilla. And there are only these two hair cells and supporting cells. And these supporting cells are very important because they help to seal the basal apapilla so that you have two different chambers, if you want, on top and on the bottom. And so what we need to understand, if we want to understand the spatial positioning and also the orientational order. And also the orientational order of these hair sets, you also have to take into account that there are these supporting sets. So, this is just to introduce to you the system. And the general question is, how does this order come about? I mean, that's the general question that I would like to ask. And in order to see that, we have to look a little bit into the development. So now we go seven days back to E8. So that's embryonic day eight, eight days after fertilization. And at that point, the basal apapilla The basal apapilla has not yet quite this extension here, so it's much shorter, and also it doesn't yet bent. And only in the course of the next week or so, during the development of the chicken, you will see that this form here takes shape. And the interesting thing is that this expansion of the basila papilla occurs without any cell proliferation. That is, there is no cell division. That is, there is no cell division. There are no new cells essentially coming up. And what is more is that the cell volume here from E8 to E1514 also stays essentially constant. So all this transformation that we see here from the short to this long basal apapilla is really occurring just by stretching out the basal apapilla, which then also has to flatten because otherwise the cell volumes. Because otherwise, the cell volumes could not remain at least roughly constant. So, but there is no cell proliferation, no cell death, and that simplifies, of course, the system and the understanding of the system. If I look at E8, then I will see here chemically, so cells have differentiated already. In the beginning, they were all one cell type, but here you see these blue cells. These are these hair cells, they have already started to. Hair cells, they have already started to differentiate. But you see that in the beginning, the surface areas of the cells that are blue and those that are not blue, so the hair cells and the supporting cells, is the same essentially. And only during the course of this development of seven days, you see that the hair cell apical surface area increases. Whereas those of the sporting cells that you can see here in between, it's really decreasing. Again, here you see in blue. Here, you see in blue this marker for the hair cells, whereas in green, you see the F-actin. So that you can see again the membranes here because of the actin cortex and also the hair bundles. And so that's one feature. And here, just to quantify this, so if you look at the apical surface area, so in gray, you see the supporting cells, so it's decreasing slightly, but then for the hair cells here in red, you see that they dramatically increase. Here in red, you see that they dramatically increase by up to tenfold. So there's really dramatic changes that are going on in the basala papilla during this development during this one week of development. At the same time, here you see that these blue cells, they are more or less disordered. They're appearing here and there. They don't touch each other, but otherwise there's not really any order in their positional order. If you remember, maybe this very nice electron micrograph in the beginning where you Nice electron micrograph in the beginning, where you saw this very regular order. But then here you see that they are much better ordered. And this you can capture by this hexatic order parameter. If you're not familiar with this, it's something that is similar to really a hexagonal lattice, only that instead of really looking at a lattice that can be displaced in six directions, what you hear is you look only really at the number of the next neighbors, which is here six. Neighbors, which is here six, so you really look only at the directions, but the distances they can be a little bit different. In any case, what happens is that over the course of evolution of development of the basal papilla, again, you go from a low order, so this is this part here, to a high order, so you really can quantify the positional order that the cells are assuming and that the epithelium is assuming. So, and one thing that I would like to mention already, and you will see later why this. To mention already, and you will see later why this is important: the degree of hexatic order is rather uniform throughout the basilar papilla. I told you already that the apical surface areas, they are bigger here than here, but the hexatic order is the same throughout this tissue. So, you see that it's not perfect. You see here some white and blue, even in there. So, part of it is because the system is out of focus, so that makes tectonic surface areas a little bit different, difficult. Also, when AnoWav takes. Difficult also when Anuba takes the basal papilla out of the embryo. I mean, you have to do it, you have to touch it somewhere so that can also lead to some defects. But overall, you see that here you have a higher hexatic order than here. And most importantly for this slide is that it's really uniform throughout the basilar papilla. And the last feature that I would like to mention here is that during this process of increasing the surface area of the basilar papilla, there's something else happening. And there is something else happening, and that is what we call partial extrusion of the hair cells. So, in the beginning, what you see is the monolayer, the basal apella, let's say, at E8. You see that the nuclei here in gray, they are somewhere along this height here. There's no particular order. All the surface areas are essentially the same. But then, after a week, you will see that now all the nuclei of the hair sets have moved up. So, now the hair sets are. Moved up. So now the hair sets are sort of floating on the background of the supporting cells. The supporting cell nuclei are going down, and here you see the nice arrangement of the hair cell. Yes. Here there are no, yet, this is at E8, so there is no distinction between hair cells and supporting cells at that point. I mean, in fact, I could already point out here and mark some of them, but because I mean, geometric. Geometrically, they are still the same, and it's only after one week. I mean, I also should say in parentheses, this is really from mouse and not from the chicken. But the scheme I wanted to still show before, because if you look at the real images now from the basila papilla, it's a little bit more messy. So, here you see at E8 the nuclei here in this turquoise color, they are really everywhere. You see here an epical marker in magenta. You see here an apical marker in magenta, and you see the F-actin going down a little bit. But now, here at E15, then you see that all the nuclei of the hair sets are really nicely lining up here. The hair sets are here, and here's the apical area, and here below it's getting a little bit more messy. So, this is why I think the sketch, at least I hope, was helpful before. So, now we I have at least roughly sketched to you the development, the experimental findings. And of course, you would like to understand a little bit how does course you would like to understand a little bit how does the how do these things come about and the first thing if you think about an epithelium is well let's lose a vertex let's use a vertex model and a vertex model you describe every cell just in a 2d plane at least in the original version and each surface of a epical surface of a cell or of a cell is described as a polygon yeah so we describe really this part here of the epithelium only Really, this part here of the epithelium only, if you want. And these red dots and the gray dots, they don't really have any significance at this point. They're just marking the centers, the geometrical centers of these polygons. And the red ones, they are supposed to be the hair cells. But otherwise, there's no difference. It's just for your eyes to be able to distinguish the hair cells from these supporting cells. And how do we describe such a system in more Such a system in more detail. Well, for each polygon, you have a surface and you have also the length here of the edges. And these are the things that are really the important quantities that will give us how this system will behave. So we have the surface area, we have the parameter. These are really the only two parameters that will characterize ourselves, if you want. We will replace the parameter of this thing here by the so-called shape. This thing here by the so-called shape parameter, and this is just because the shape parameter, if it's small enough, then the system will behave as a fluid, whereas when it's big enough, it will behave as a solid. So, this is why people usually look at the shape parameter rather than the parameter. But it's really only two of these three quantities that are sufficient to characterize ourselves. And then, how do you physically characterize this network? Well, this is done through a work function or an energy if you want. So, we have one. If you want, so we have one penalization of deviations from a preferred area, where this is the area elasticity, and we have also a penalization what if you deviate from the preferred shape parameter. So this is the actual shape parameter, the actual area, and A0 and S naught are the ones that the system wants to take if you want. And what we do now, we are going to minimize. We do now, we are going to minimize this work function to get the configuration of our network, and thereby we allow also topological changes. In particular, we allow neighbor exchanges. So, here this magenta cell or Valik cell and this green cell, they are separated by this blue and red cell here. But then after this exchange, they are now neighbors, whereas the blue and the red cell are now separated from each other. So, these are the so-called T1 transitions or neighbor exchanges. Decisions or neighbor exchanges, and we will allow for such exchanges as we minimize this work function. So, now there is still one more thing that we have to include, otherwise we will not see anything interesting, and that is that we have seen that the surface area of the hair cells increases with time. So, let's impose this. So, all these cells that have a red dot, they will have a surface area that increases and then see what happens. Otherwise, everything is. Otherwise, everything is constant throughout the system. We will also suppress contacts between hair cells, because this is what you see in the experiment. But otherwise, we are going to keep the total area constant. So this surface here will not change. And in the end, we will see that the hair sets, this is at least done for this simulation here, have a four times higher surface area than in the beginning. And so I will not show you the whole movie. This is how it looks in the beginning. Not show you the whole movie. This is how it looks in the beginning as you minimize and as you increase the surface area, and then there was a jump, but it takes some time, otherwise, and you see in the end, yeah, you get a very nice hexagonal arrangement. So the idea here is that just by expanding the surface area, the cells in order to arrange and to fit in all this area here, they have to arrange in a nice packing way, if you want. And this is the hexagonal or hexagonal. This is the hexagonal or hexatic arrangement that is most favorable for that. However, if you look at the evolution of the hexatic order with time, so here we have the Hassel area that increases from some value, say one, this is here, to four times that height. What you see is that this does not follow the same thing as we would observe in the experiment. So what we have done here is we have normalized the head. We have done here is we have normalized the hair cell surface area because we cannot really do long time sequences of the basila papilla, but we take the normalized hair cell area as our fiducial marker for the proxy for the time. You see that it increases here nicely, but here what you see is, and it depends, does not really depend on the parameters that you choose, that you first get the linear increase and then this jump and then it's constant. This jump and then it's constant. So, this doesn't really fit very nicely. So, there seems to be something that is off here. And there are other quantities that also show you that this simple version of the system is really not sufficient. And why it's not sufficient? Well, there's one hint that comes from this observation that Anuba did. He looked at the single phosphorylated version of the myosin light chain and the double phosphorylated myosin light chain. So, the single phosphorylated myosin light chain, so they are the myosin. Myosin light chain. So, there the myosin is active. If it's doubly phosphorylated, it's even more active. So, you can say here they are weak and here they are stronger. But you see that the double phosphorylated only at least at some junctions and not all of them. And here you have to believe me also. So, all these junctions where you see the magenta, where you see the double phosphorylated one, is these are junctions between two supporting cells and not between supporting cells and a hair cell or two hair cells. Well, there are no contacts between hair cells here, but. Context between hair sets here, but whereas the single-foss-related form you see at all junctions. So, now let's explore what the consequences of this observed heterogeneity are. And for that, we will include another term, which really gives us the contractility along these supporting cell supporting cell junctions. And we only have them there, we will not have any increase along the hair cell-hair cell junctions or hair cell supporting. Hair cell junctions or hair cell supporting cell junctions. So it's really to mimic the effect of the double phosphor relation that we've just seen. And if you do that, then again you get this hexagonal organization. So there's nothing changes from that point of view. So that's all nice. But there's something that is interesting why I'm showing you this. And this is when you look at what happens. If you look at the system here. The system here, and you let it evolve, then you get the feature that I was just showing you. But now, what you can do is in the theory, you can switch off the contractility. And if you switch off the contractility, that's what we do here, then you see that suddenly the number of contacts between hair cells goes up. Before there were no hair cell-hair cell contacts, and I did not explicitly forbid them, contrast to the previous simulations. Here it was just a feature of a Was just a feature of the description. But if I switch off this strong contractility along the supporting cell junctions, then you see that suddenly you get contacts between hairsets and hairsets. If I switch it on again, the high contractility, then indeed the number of hairset hairset contacts gets down again. So while in the previous thing we had to really by hand exclude hairset hair cell contacts. Hair cell has a contact. This is also what you observe in the beta of Biller. There essentially no hair cell has a contact. Here, now the double phosphorylation on the supporting cell, supporting cell junctions, they avoid these contacts. So now, of course, let's see if this is also going on in the experiment on the baselopilla. So what Andeboff did here, he took out a basilopapilla and kept it alive for 16 hours. So he first treated it with a drug that inhibits the double phosphorylation. That inhibits the double phosphorylation. And indeed, in that case, you see that there's here in the theory a little bit more, but also in the experiment, you now have hair cell-hair cell contacts. So, as in the theory, if you destroy the double phosphorylation on the supporting cell supporting cell, you now get contacts between hair cells. If you wash this it out afterwards, then again, you see that there are really no hair cell hair cell contacts anymore. So, this gives you confidence that there is really some functional importance of the hair cell. Some functional importance of the HASA of the supporting cell supporting cell increased contractility. So that's the first thing. And also, if I now look at the hexatic order, it fits much better to the experiment than it did before. So it seems that this double force relation on the supporting cell, supporting cell junctions is really important. What I have not shown you at all for the time being is why does the surface area increase of the hair cells? Increase of the hair size, right? I just impose that. So let's see. And I didn't talk to you at all about the partial extrusion of the hair set. So let's see whether we can get more insight into that. And what I did not tell you either is that here I have fixed the density of the hair cells to get this curve here, where there are still some deviations. But I told you already that along. But I told you already that along the basila papilla, and I show you it to here again, that really there's a gradient of surface area, although the hexatic order stays constant along the basal papilla. So how can this be? So here I just quantify that again. So the hair cell area here, surface area is larger here than it's at the distal end. So here's the distal end, here's the proximal end. But the uh and this also comes But the and this also comes along with a change in the density of the hair sets. So the fraction of hair sets here is lower than here, and yet the hexatic order is constant. So how can this be? And for that, we have to go beyond the 2D vertex model. And here's a pseudo-3D vertex model. So the hair sets now have an extension into the third dimension. These are the supporting cells. So this would be a hair cell that is partially extruded. Be a hair cell that is partially extruded, so it has a height that is a little bit lower. Here we have the supporting cell, supporting cell junctions on which we put this increased contractility. I'm not going to show you the vertex, the energy function or the work function here. I'm not showing you how we do it in detail, but this is the geometry that we consider now. And the first thing, indeed, as we increase the contractility along only these junctions here, we see that the See that the hair cells are extruded partially because their height, so this here really goes down. And this is here done for different fractions of the densities of the hair cells. But in any case, what is important is that really the hair cell height goes down with the contractility gamma. So the partial extrusion that is observed can be traced back here to this double phosphorus. Be traced back here to this double phosphorylation, this increased contactility along supporting cells, supporting cell junctions. At the same time, also the surface area increases. I don't show you that here, but you can see it here. So, this is for different densities of hair cells. Here's the lowest density, and you see that the height here is color-coded. So, this blue means a lower height, whereas this darker blue means a higher height. Well, what you can see definitely. Well, what you can see definitely here is that the epical surface area of the hair sets is larger than of the supporting cells. So, again, here the color is really only to indicate where the hair sets are, and it indicates also at the same time the height. As I increase the density of the hair cells, then you see that the increased surface area becomes smaller and smaller, as is also the case in the experiments. But you also see that you get higher and higher hexatic order. So, that's a little bit strange because here we see. So that's a little bit strange because here we see that for low densities, this is what we have in the experiment, we have obviously here lower hexatic order than we have here. So that looks a little bit strange. It's not in agreement with what we have seen in the Basela papilla. Here, well, let's not go through that. Let's look at it here. So there is something else that must come into play. And what comes into play is that there are indeed gradients along the basilar papilla. I've shown you the Along the basala papilla, I've shown you the gradient and parasite apical area. How does this come about? So, for that, we need to do something else. We need to impose a double gradient into our system. And we tried a number of them. We're not yet sure which is really the good one. I show you only one that works. And this is here when I look at the extrusion of the hair cells. So, here it's easier than here. Okay. Here. Okay, and if you do that, then indeed you see. So here's the proximal end, here's the distal end, and these are really rigid boundary conditions. Whereas in this direction, here we have periodic boundary conditions. And you see indeed now that the hair cells here, they have larger surface area than here. And you also see, if you count, that there are less hair cells here than here, which means that the sprouting cells, they must have moved from here to there. Have moved from here to there, and there's indeed in the simulations a flow of supporting cells from the proximal to the distal end. We don't know yet whether this is also the case in the basal apapilla. Most likely it is, because otherwise I don't see how this can come about. But we don't have live imaging over seven days, so I can't tell you whether this flow really exists. But what this shows you is that at least here we get this gradient in hair cell area in the density. And now, of course, we have to look also at what happens. Have to look also at what happens for the hexatic order. And here you see that along the baselar perpilla, measured here again by the relative hair cell area, the crosses and pluses. So these yellow are experimental data. And if you look at the circles here, these magenta or whatever color this is, they agree quite nicely. So here we now have achieved, by adding this gradient, we have achieved this. The constancy of the hexatic order in the Bayes Lappilla. You can also look at the Hesse fraction and also the number of neighbors. There are some theory that I will not go into now, but you see that it matches quite nicely. And with this, I'm at the end. So I hope that I convinced you that the heterogeneous tension or junction tension alone is essential for really pattern formation in the beta papilla. This increased supporting. This increased supporting cell, supporting cell junctional contractility can be made responsible for the increase in hair surface area, for the, this I didn't talk about, to get the right numbers of neighbors, for the hexatic order and partial extrusion. So there's one parameter that you, or one feature that you add, and suddenly everything comes out. Now, there is this thing with the gradients there. We are not so sure yet how things are, but. I showed you at least one example of a gradient that can really lead to this gradient in Herc surface area while still having the hexatic order constant. So in this sense, I would say that this increased contractility along support cell support cell junctions also has to say something about autonotopy. What I did not talk about at all is the polarity of the hair cells. There's also a mechanical component to that, but we are still trying to figure out in detail how it's... Still trying to figure out in detail how this is going. So we'll have to wait for some other time. And with this, I would like to again thank Julian, Anubov, for their work, and also Madan and Raj and you for your attention and take any questions.
