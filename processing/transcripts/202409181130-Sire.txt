So I will talk about a recent model which we introduced with Junction, Wei, Fancra Lin, and Yifujo, which is like a variation of the liquid crystal model that Lin introduced many, many years ago, but with so-called free boundary, which is a bad word, but it's used. I will try to explain why. I will try to explain why it's a bad word. Okay, so the original model that Lin introduced in the mid 80s, end of 90s, the simplified model, the simplified version of Erickson-Leslie model for liquid crystals is the following. So this is like this system of coupled equations in the static. In the in the static of incompressible flows, and so I mean, as usual, v is the fluid velocity, p is the pressure, u is orientation of the liquid crystal. So it's, I mean, it's a vector on the sphere, right? And basically, you couple on one piece of the one, one equation is Lavier-Stokes, the other one is the heat flow of harmonic maps. One is the heat flow of harmonic maps, and the coupling is through this term, right? Which, once you have given, and the transport term on the heat flow, once you have given you, right, it acts as the forcing on navy-stokes, right? So, this is like the flow that lead, I mean the system that Francois Lin considered. System that Franco-Lin considered. And basically, so it's set in a bounded smooth domain. And once again, it couples these two equations. This one, so if you think about two dimensions, right, this flow is critical, right? And as well as Nagel-Stokes, but in three dimensions, everything becomes super tricky. Mentioned everything becomes super critical in a pretty strong sense. I will come back to that. And I mean, basically, like it couples these two well-known equations. And so it's impossible to exhaust the literature for obvious reasons. So, on one side, you have the incompressible navy stokes, on the other side, you have the heat flow of harmonic mappings. And let me point out just two reasons. I wrote just two results on both. So, first, what I will come back to is the partial regularity of Cafe Kohn-Nirenberg, which is, of course, the interplay between the dichotomy between blow-up and global well-positance in 3D. And in the case of Armada Flow, one of the famous results of Strive in dimension two, he proved that if you start with a large class of Class of flows, you always develop, weak solution will develop finitely many time singularities on finitely many points. Okay, so you have blow up. So in higher dimension, this is super critical. And there have been like some, besides formal analysis, have been like some famous papers of where the like explicit, somehow explicit finding time blow-up have been constructed. Have been constructed. And the last general result that I'm aware of is the one by Jun Chen Grandavila and Manuel El Pin this year. Well, okay, so as far as the liquid crystal flow is concerned, the situation is much more complicated. And actually, the equivalent of, I mean, some equivalent of the Café Con Nirenberg. Of the Cafare-Konirenberg argument. So, sorry, partial regularity is in dimension two already, right? Because remember, I mean, you are coupling Navi-Stokes with harmonic map heat flow. So, the heat flow of harmonic map by structural is critical. So, you have finite time blow-up, finitely many points. But Navi-Stokes become nice in two dimensions, right? So, already dimension two is you should see partial. Is you should see a partially smooth solution. This is what, oh, here there is like a mistake. This is smooth away from countably many points. They don't prove that finitely many. Okay, it's the conjecture that it should be finitely many is still open. And in dimension three, the situation is vastly open. The best result they lead and want the wang is Changu Wang. The one is Chang Wang. The proof is that the target of the orientation field is any sphere, for instance, so that you become geometrically subcritical. So the harmonic map is not, I mean, similarities are not coming from a harmonic map in some sense. Then they don't manage artistically to prove that the weak solutions they construct are partially smooth. The weak solutions they construct are partially smooth, but they manage to construct partially they manage to construct weak global weak solutions. Okay, so dimension three, the problem is vastly open in full generality. And I mean, by removing this assumption. So basically, in a relatively recent paper by Lai Linwei Wang Zhou, they construct explicit that I will come back to that blow-up solutions. To that, blow up solutions of the system in two dimensions. Okay, so many years ago, I was visiting Courant. And at that time, I was like interested in some Neumann type condition for the harmonic map heat equation. And because in geometry, I mean, what I mean, all the previous results that I that I state. Result that I stated are for Dirichlet type boundary conditions. Okay. So, but in geometry, Dirichlet is not geometric. Okay. In most of the geometric problem, like it's not a Dirichlet condition which comes up. See, this is like a Neumann one. And so basically, I asked Fancois, but is there like a model which could be derived and being physically meaningful, which were like Neumann type. Which were like Neumann type boundary conditions could come into play? And the answer is yes. And basically, these are the boundary conditions that you have to put are of Navder type, no slip Navy boundary conditions. So this is no slip and S is a stress, I mean the symmetrized gradient of the. Of the fruit. And this boundary condition is called the free boundary condition for harmonic mappings. So let me just draw a picture. So if you look at an harmonic map from a domain, let's say, into whatever you want, but let's take a sphere. Okay. So of course, like an harmonic map. So, of course, like an harmonic map would be looking at critical point, let's say, of that, right? And an harmonic map with free boundary is a critical point of this Dirk energy with the free boundary condition, which is some sort, which is a non-linear, Neumann, non-local boundary condition, which consists in constraining the image by the map of the boundary. map of the boundary to a sub-manifold of the target. So think about this to be S1, an equatorial circle, right? Okay. So this, so in the geometry literature, this is called a free boundary condition, though this is not a free boundary problem in the Kaffarelli sense. Not that you're putting like an equation on the domain where that you don't know. It's just a constrained map. A constrained map, actually. But when you look at the first variation for this type of business here, even like in the elliptic case, you get, I mean, you can see that formally exactly this Neumann boundary condition, okay, which is reminiscent of the distributional equation you would get for harmonic maps, right? Except that for harmonic maps you would have Laplace U orthogonal to the You develop u orthogonal to the tangent when the map is as codomain the sphere, right? Okay, um no, so yeah, any manifold story, not necessarily that, but in any case, uh, the good thing is that when you check that one of the features of this liquid spristor model is that they are dissipating energy, right? And this is what you want to preserve also if you have this boundary condition. Preserve also if you have these boundary conditions, and this is what happens exactly when you have this boundary condition. Okay, so basically, like now you see like the model, the equations are the same, right? But you see, like you can even consider more general boundary conditions, like particularly this tangential part here, but you see, like, this. Here. But you see, like this condition is highly non-linear and highly non-local, right? Because you're like prescribing the Norman condition of the whole domain, but this is a very non-linear condition. So everything boils down. I mean, as far as everything boils down as far as regularity is concerned, to understand what is boundary regularity. So basically, So basically we started with some sort of well when we derived the model with Yifu, Fanhua, and Junchen, basically the first result that we proved is a finite time blow-up result. And so let me try to state it like in a more formal way. So basically, what you can prove is that if I give you, okay. Is that if I give you okay, so let's so the geometric situation is the following: you are looking at the system where now your domain is a half plane, right? And if I give you a time, I give you like this call a coupling constant, okay? And I give you arbitrarily finitely many points on the boundary and arbitrarily finitely many points inside. Points inside, I can construct a blob solution of this model at finite time capital T, the one that you give yourself at the beginning, which boils down to construct an initial data and running the floor. And so that like the harmony map part of the floor is blowing up like a tree, a bubble tree, right? So finitely many bubbles, right? Bubbles, right? These are the bubbles that is W1, W2, right? With this rate lambda j, okay, which is written somewhere here, okay, which is type two, right? And with concentration along this concentration of energy. Okay, I don't know what the V part, the velocity fluid part does, okay, it might blow up or not. Does okay, it might blow up or not, but for sure, like in the sense that there is only this upper bound, okay, the construction. But however, you have a very precise way to describe how you blow up for the heat flow part, okay? So the picture is the following. I mean, you give this constant, okay, and then I run the initial, I can cook up an initial data, right, u0, v0, such that I will develop bubbles. Bubbles, both on the inside and in the boundary, provided I mean, I chose points on the boundary or the inside. I can do both. If I want to blow up only on inside or only on the boundary, I mean, like this is, I have to, I construct another type of solution. Okay, so this type of thing has been recently developed by Junshen and his collaborators. By Junshen and his collaborators, and it's done through parabolic gluing, right? Which is some sort of refine like time-dependent gluing method inheritated from geometric gluings for ellipso-stationary thing. And let me let me. So, these are for example, these are the blow-up profiles. Okay, this is the glow. Are the blow profiles, okay? These are the global harmonic maps, okay. But what I would like just to uh to uh to describe a little bit more is this heat flow part, okay? Because somehow like what I thought, I mean, the way I started like thinking about this problem, the oligarch, is coming from trying to have a better understanding of exactly this problem, right? Right, which is the harmonic map heat flow, sorry, which is harmonic map with free boundary. Okay, so this, what I wrote here is just a more general formulation of this problem here, right? And one way to construct such map, if we have in in if you have like in mind the Elix Sampson gradient flow to Gradient flow to build like this in the closed case is to run heat flow, right? To run the gradient flow of the energy, which is the level formally, you are solving this highly non-linear, non-local problem, right? Okay. So, gamma u is just, think about the sphere, right? So, so that this term is just what Armin wrote yesterday. Is just what Armin wrote yesterday, u greater than u square. Okay, so the difficulty of these types of maps relies on two things in the classical of on somehow the geometry of the unknown space. In the classical harmonic map problem, you start with a map between two manifolds and you embed by Nash the target, the codomain, right? So you have one embedding to choose, you fix it, okay, and you write your equation. It okay, and you write your equation. The problem here is that that two uh uh how can I say that two spaces to take care of there is the target of the map U, right, which is one space. And here, this is what I denoted N, okay, that you can embed by Nash, okay, if you want. But here, there is this sub-manifold sigma, which is embedded in the target, right? So, you have this interplay between this sigma here, which is a constant. Between this sigma here, which is a constraint you put on the map, right, inside this other embedding. So recently there's been a lot of work because of motivated by other problems to look at those maps. And it happened that the theory for those maps is much more like technical. And actually, at the moment, they are like open, still not completely understood. Like, because you have this. Like, because you have these two sorts of spaces to deal with the sigma and the n. Okay, does that make sense? And however, there is an easy, and I will finish by that because probably I'm running out of time. Oh, no, I have time. So, let me look at a very simple situation. Just trying to understand this business and to build. This business and to build like a kind of relaxed energies so that I have a little bit of more of a hand on what's going on. So, now what I will do is that I will take for capital N to be a big torus, flat torus, okay? And sigma to be a sphere inside this torus, right? So, I put a sphere like S L, right? I put N, I embedded trivially in a big flat torus, okay? Flat torus, okay. So this gamma will be zero, the flat torus, right? Okay, so I have a caloric equation. I'm very happy. The domain, I don't care, it can be flat, right? For the regularity purposes, it doesn't matter. Okay, well, at least like for, yeah. And I have my sigma, which will diosphere, right? So now I have a very simple equation, right, which looks like a lot what Pavel discussed a lot, except that Discussed a lot, except that instead of having critical part-time nonlinearity, I have this geometric Boeum condition, right? Okay. So this model, which is some, okay, these are special classes, right, of harmonic map with free boundary, huh? Well, it happens that, well, okay, this let me it happens that you can build a very refined relaxed A very refined, relaxed, or well, like nice relaxed energy by looking at a singular perturbation on the boundary. So, you put a Gilsborn-Lambda potential on the boundary. Okay. What these people, Struve and Chen and Lin to some extent, they put a Gisbolanda potential inside. Here, I want to put a singular perturbation on the boundary, which is much more relevant to capture. Much more relevant to capture this type of boundary condition, right? And so you do like the usual relaxation and you try to look at what other limit epsilon goes to zero, of course. Okay, this is like always. So let's look first. So let me mention, let me see if I have a slide coming later. No. So let me mention what is first. Let me comment on what is what are stationary solutions of that, right? Because it's pretty important to understand. If you want to understand time dependent, you better understand or try to understand first what are the stationary states. So if you look at the stationary state, what do you have? You have an harmonic function in the half space, right? With this direct latency. Uh, this Dirichlet Neumann operator here, right? So, if you take the trace of your assumption that everything is smooth, if you take the trace of your function u epsilon at y equal to zero, and there are space, okay, then the trace of an like then this by Fourier, you can prove easily that this Norman derivative is just the square root of the Laplacian in the x variable. So, you get this Ginsburg lambda. This Ginsburg-Landau type equation, right? Up to signs. And here, u epsilon is a trace at y equal to zero of capital U epsilon. So here then you fall into some variation of Betuel Brésis Lin, but for the root of the Laplacian. Of the Laplacian. So it happens that this, if you look at the penalization epsilon going to zero, right, you create what has been known, what has been introduced by Dalio and Rivière several years ago, which I've known as half-harmonic maps, which are like constraint maps for the H1 half energy. And it happens that I prove with Miyo that indeed some sort of With me, you that indeed some solutions of this Ginzbo-Landau-type energy equation are going, we're going to these Dalur-Rivier maps. But more interestingly, you can prove using like this analogy between the equation you get on the boundary and the caloric or harmonic extension inside, okay, you can prove actually a full partial regularity. Partial regularity result in the sense that you can construct solutions to this flow, right, as limits of Ginzburg-Landau approximations. And these limits are smooth, you have smooth everywhere except on a set which has some Ausdorff dimension, parabolic Ausdorff dimension, which is located on the boundary. Because of course, inside you are parabolic, okay? So you cannot have the, I mean, you are smooth inside, right? I mean, you're smooth inside, right? Okay. So, so basically, exactly what as oh, so actually, if you look, at least you can make a sense of it, but if you look at what you get in the limit epsilon goes to zero, the trace of this capital U star is satisfying this funky. Is satisfying this funky equation, which is not a classical pseudo-differential equation because it's the square root of the whole heat operator. Okay, so in Fourier space, Fourier Laplace, you would have i tau plus mod psi to the whole thing one half, okay. And this is not a classical space-time multiplier, right? Multiplier, right? But in any case, this point of view, I mean, this allows you to derive this partial regularity result. And of course, like you recover classical result that if you start with a small energy, then you have like everything is smooth and so on. And so let me finish by why did I do this some sort of digression around this? These special classes of harmonic maps, well, because this model is pretty hard to deal with, even in the case of special solutions, because this problem is highly non-local. So, if you look at the radially symmetric solution, think about the half space for M, radially symmetric in some variables, you are never like an Never like an ODE, okay. This model is never boiling down to an OD, okay. And this is a bit of a pain, particularly if you have in mind to construct blow-up solution and try to stick your weak solution between two barriers, right, to prove blow-ups. Okay. Well, but it happens that by fully exploiting this parallel with the recent development of non-local. The recent development of non-local equations, so this fact that you one can express what is the kernel of this operator, then actually you can indeed blow and this. Oh, let me just find give to you. I thought I would have it. No, okay. Using this analogy, okay, let me let me come back here. Using this analogy, okay, because you have an explicit. Okay, because you have an explicit expression of this operator that you can use by Fourier, you kind of reduce your problem in 2D somehow to a problem in 1D for this operator. This is still not no DE, but this is good enough to use techniques which have been developed recently for integral for non-local operators. So using this analogy, Using this analogy of, not this analogy, but this dictionary between a non-linear New Yemen boundary condition and a non-local equation, just like the reformulation, the dictionary between the two formulations, you actually like manage to actually prove somehow analog results which were attainable somehow by more classical techniques before, like elementary techniques like audio. Before, like elementary technique like ODs. But to be honest, like there is a lot of things that technology to do because I know what is this kernel, but I don't know what to do when I have this local formulation, if you want. So somehow, like I will finish with that. This is some sort of advertisement or like advertising or whatever you call it, a commercial for using non-local. Commercial for using non-local for local instead of doing the other way around. Like, and let me stop here. Thank you very much.
