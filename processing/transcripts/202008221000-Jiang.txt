Is collaboration between me, my supervisor, and co-supervisor. So I really should include their name here. But when I sent this draft to my supervisor, he said it's better to just write your own name. I said, okay, but just to acknowledge both of them. Yeah, so our model is a random in a quarter plan. It appears in, so these are transition probabilities and you can assume some of them are zero. But we only want nearest neighbor transition and we count this also as. And we count this also as nearest label, so you can go diagonal. Here are some examples in queuing theory. For example, two demands, two switches. And if you count this x-axis as Q, this axis as some label, for example, face, then it is also fine. So our problem here is to find the stationary distribution. Our problem here is to find the station distribution of that probabilistic model. And we use Jeroen function method. Like yesterday's talk, the Jeremy function method also was also used. So we are now facing a German function of two arrivals, x and y, and both of them we can use complex numbers. Complex numbers. When we get the equation in probabilistic model and doing this, doing this joining function, we get this equation. And we call this equation the function equation of the model. And this polynomial Q, we call it kernel. And Q is a known polynomial. It is related to your transition probability. Those small Q and Q tilde reflect the boundary conditions on X. The boundary conditions on x and y-axis, and they are not our concern here, so I do not even define them. And pi x is invariant measure and transformed, and those are the event measure on the boundary, and this is the event measure on the region. Qxy is a polynomial. Okay, so you define this joint function, it is only defined for x and y. It is only defined for x and y in a unit circle. But since it's a polynomial, so in fact, you could define it on the whole C2. And if you write this, if you multiply this out, it becomes a bi-quadratic polynomial, which means if you view x as a parameter, then it's a coordratic in Y. If you view Y as a parameter, then this is a coordinating X. This is correct in X, and this is an important observation. We define some useful numerics. The partial discriminant is what you get when you view X as a parameter and Y as a parameter, then you get the usual discriminant for quadratics, B minus 4ac. And we also define Eiffenstein invariants for generic quadratic functions. General quadratic functions. This is a we write this in this form, but 4B, 6c, 4d, they are for convenient reasons. And this d and f related to these quadric functions, they are called Eisenstein invariants because they are related to Eisenstein series and Eisenstein series. If you go along the imaginary The y, the imaginary axis and Eisenstein invariance will approach Riemann zeta function. So let's get back to our kernel qxy. This is a polynomial in C2. So it cuts one dimension. It's a curve in C2. It's a complex curve. And if you look at it really. And if you look at its real part, if you look at its real part, it's a closed curve. And we define two, no, not we, some others, define two maps, the vertical switch and the horizontal switch. If you see in the real plan, then the vertical switch is keeping x constant and you draw a vertical line, and that line will intersect the curve q. intersect the curve Q in two real points. And the vertical switch is simply the map from the first intersection to the second intersection. And horizontal switch is similar. You draw a horizontal line and it intersects the curve in real plan by two points and you switch those two intersections. And their composition is a well-known map in discrete community. In discrete dynamic system community called QRD map, named after three persons, three people. This is a delta. We know these switches, they are switches, so they have order too. They are involutions. If you do it twice, it means you do nothing. But their composition, however, is much more interesting. So So, a Russian mathematician Malyshev introduced a group generated by these two evolutions, and he calls it the Galois group. And the reason he named it a Galois, because he defined this not as us, we defined very explicitly as the switches on the curves, but he defined as the transformation on the function field. On the function field, which are completely equivalent because Q as a complex curve, its function field can also be viewed as a complex curve by some algebra method called evaluation. So we focus on the subgroup H0 generated by the QRT map and this subgroup can be finite order. Can be finite order and can have even order. And why it's always important because the solution of our kernel equation can be found. If h0 has infinite order, then this pi x will never have a simple expression. You cannot solve it. You cannot have a formula for it. Maybe you can. Maybe you can have an integral representation for it. But in a paper, it is proved that if that h0 is infinite order, that pi xy cannot even be represented as a solution of any differential equations. And our interest here is to study the financial structure of H0. The strategy for this study is to do coordinate exchange, coordinate transformation. We suppose those PIGs are rational numbers. For some reasons, first reason is that we are going to apply the theorem from number theory, and that theorem applies only to rationals. And for the second reason, rational. Rationals are what you can actually get in real life, in computer, in combinatorial setting. We need two quadrant transformations. First, we map this Q defined by that bicode polynomial to a C quotient a lattice. Quotient lattice, and then we map this say quotient lattice to an elliptic curve. And to use that theorem in number theory, Karnamazu theorem, we need to make sure this EC is an elated curve over rationals. It is not at all clear that this EC can be defined rationally because both j and j prime minus one, j prime minus one, they are defined analogically. So even you start with a rational q with rational coefficients pij, it is not obvious at all that this e will also have rational coefficients. And moreover, to define an ellipse curve to be rational, you have to have a rational point on it, otherwise it is empty. So, this strategy we need to prove that E C have rational coefficients. So, let's look at this Q, this Q, that by quadratic, and some physics invariance. This is kind of like a Hamiltonian of a dynamical system. If it's a Hamiltonian, so we can define a Hamiltonian vector field. This is a Hamiltonian vector field, and we found it is not vanishing anywhere. Is not vanishing anywhere by direct computation. And if you have a vector field, then you can have a differential from it. And this is a pairing between differential and vector fields, like a pairing between any dual space and vector space. And the lattice lambda, the lattice. Lambda, the lattice here, is generated by this integral, the integral of two bases. The integrand is a differential determined by the Hamiltonian vector field. This map has a name called Abel-Jakob map. It maps Q to the... So if you view Q as an algebraic curve. An algebraic curve, then this guy is called Jacobin or Jacobin Taurus. But since we have only an algebraic record of genus 1, which is Taurus, and for Taurus, Jacobin is also a Taurus. So left-hand side is a Taurus, right-hand side is a Taurus. They are isomorphic, not only topologically, but also complex analytically. Complex analytically. And this map is actually well defined, but it depends on the choice of your point P0. And this gamma A, those two bases for the homologic group, if you view them as curves, they start at P0. But the dependence on the P0 can be eliminated by a transformation or action on your Transformation or action on your lattice. And so you can fix omega 1. You can fix one of them by choose a P0 and the integral can be made. So for example, you can fix omega 1 to 1. You can do that. And you only left omega 2 as a free parameter. And the second map also has a name called uniformization. This is like a projection from the universal covering of this curve to this curve. And this is accomplished by a Verstalas function. Verstal function is defined analytically and Its derivative is also defined analytically. It's a basic training analysis to see: okay, this series converges uniformly, absolutely, in any compact set not touching the lattice. So you can exchange the summation and differentiation, and you get formulas for its derivative. We also define two modular invariants. We also define two modular invariants, G two and G three. And if you are familiar with the theory called automorphic forms, then you immediately recognize these two Eisenstein coefficients in the Eisenstein series. So both the Abel-Jacobi and the uniformization map are analytical. However, they are However, their composition can be given in a polynomial. And that's a very astonishing fact. So, the modular invariance is defined as a summation, a transcendental summation, and it a priori depends on the named, but this can be shown just it is equal to Einstein stand in very. Invariant for the partial discriminance of the bioquadrotic curve. And that is a miracle, but there isn't any miracle in maths actually. This is called modular invariance, and it is related to Eisenstein series. And this D is defined, is called Eisenstein invariance. And since they are all named after Eisenstein, so they should equal, and in fact, they are equal. Should equal, and in fact, they are equal. So, what's the conclusion here? So, if q is a rational bicochet polynomial, then y also has coefficients over q. So, we finish half of our stuff. The second ingredient is to look at how that QRT map transforms under our change of coordinate. First of all, under First of all, under the Abel-Jakob map, the QRT map transforms into a map on this quotient, on this C-quotient lattice as just an addition modular lattice. So it's like in number theory, if you're working in Working in module P, then you have your have an addition structure in that module P group, and same as here. This is a lattice, a two-dimension stuff, but the idea is the same. And moreover, this uniformization map transforms this addition also into an addition. And this addition we write as delta two stars. This is an addition. This is an addition on the EDTB curve. And the UDB curve is an abedian variety, so it has an abelian group structure on it. And if you write that abstract UDB curve in your coordinate, in a coordinate coordinate, and in a very special coordinate called Verstlass normal form, then that addition can have a very nice geometric picture, which is a quad tangent construction, because this is a cubic. construction because this is a cubic curve. A line will intersect in three roots if you count roots properly. And so it because it intersects in three roots. So you have two and you naturally define the addition of them as a third one. But in fact you need to also further do a reflection with regard to x-axis. So you have an addition on the EV curve as well. Curve as well. And that's very interesting. So the QRT map induces an addition on the UDB curve. And we are really interested in this omega 3. Is that a rational point on the UDB curve or not? And the answer turns out yes. And here is a formula for the coordinate omega 3. And I found this formula in reference 1, which is Reference 1, which is a very book on discrete dynamical system. But I did a little bit research on this omega-3. I want to know who was the first one to discover this formula. And the first results show that the German Fubenius studied it in his study on bioquadratic curves. But then I found it's just a I found it's just a folklore, it may not be true. Maybe Isaac Newton had known this thing in his study of the classification of elliptic curves over rationals. So these things somehow was known by Newton. That is really astonishing to me because normally people only know Newton for his physics. Maybe some people know some numerical stuff. numerical stuff of Newton, but he also studied the classification of EV curves over R. Now, this is clearly a polynomial, so if all those P's are rational, then we have a rational point so that subgroup H0 is isomorphic. Is isomorphic to the group generated by omega 3. And since omega 3 is a rational point, it is a subgroup of the E over Q. And the very celebrated theorem of Masur says for an elliptic over Q, its torsion part can only have two possibilities. And one is this, the other one is this. And from this, you may know, okay. And from this, you may know, okay, H0 can at most have order 12. And if you multiply the involution part, we know H at most can have order at most 24. If it has finite order at all, obviously it can have infinite order. And there's kind of a dichotomy here. And remember that Q, that curve Q, you define that vertical switch and horn. that vertical switch and horizontal switch and you iterate their if you iterate their composition you get a dynamical system and if that if that delta qrty map has a periodic then it will visit finite number of points forever and it just follows its its trajectory it comes over over and again but if it has infinite But if it has infinite order, then you may ask, okay, so now it will visit infinitely many points. Is that trajectory dense in the Q? Because of course you can visit a subset of Q. There is a possibility, but the theorem of Val showed that's not the case. So you have a dichotomy, either you are periodic or you visit this. Or you visit this trajectory, which means you are eroding. And so the proof is finished, but this work also has some other implications. For example, can we have an explicit criteria for H to have final order? And these criteria for order 4 and 6 have been included, have been found. Included have been found decades ago, but their method was to use some algebraic method, especially they want to show: okay, certain functions becomes linearly dependent in some function field. And their computation is rather long. But since now we view them as an additional curve, so we get results. So we get result instantly because, for example, if the omega 3 is order 2, so H has order 4, and if the UDB curve is in the Verse Tales form, we know it can only be on the x-axis. So that means its y-coordinate is 0, which means that that p is 0. And point only to have all the 3 if it's passing vanishes. So we Vanishes. So we by direct computation, we get this. And if you compare, no, I didn't include the compare. There, the existing criteria for order six is rather complicated. It's a big determinant with some cofactors as its content. And we can also get criteria for general, not only for 4 and 6, we can work for arbitrary m. And for that, we need division polynomials. And you can find those division polynomials from any textbook on elliptic curves. And they are called division polynomials because if you have m divides n, then you have phi m divides phi n in this polynomial. This in this polynomial ring. And xy, as a point-only deliberate curve, has all the dividing, not exactly, but only a factor of even only if it vanishes this polynomial. But for our case, we'd like to work with Eisenstein invariants, those modular invariants. So we need to do a Cornell transform. Those formulas. Cornik transform. Those formulas, I believe they have been known for at least decades, if not decades, maybe centuries, but it's very hard to find. You can easily find this, but after a simple change of you also have this. So the criteria for the group having certain order is by requiring this x. By requiring this xy vanishes those polynomials. And using those division polynomials, we can give the criteria for h to have order 8. And this is a simple polynomial. x and y are coordinates for omega 3 and e are Eisenstein invariants. They are all determined by the coefficients of the transition matrix Pij. And that's compared. And let's compare our solution to the criteria, the existing criteria. The existing criteria is the vanish of this determinant. And this determinant, each element has a form of a big polynomial. And each delta are some cofactors of the matrix P. So if you really want to write this out, it will occupy. Out, it will occupy your whole screen. So that's all. And the first reference is a valuable reference on discrete integral system. And after the author finished the book script, he passed away, which is quite a loss. And the second reference, Favie in Snagrodosky, and also another Russian Malishev. Also, another Russian Malyshev, they were the pioneer in this kind of work to find the group structure and algebraic solutions in random works, and they applied in queuing systems. Thank you very much, Richard. Pardon? Any questions?
