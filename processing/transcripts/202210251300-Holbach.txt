We talk about infrared geometries and rheological properties of subsurfaces, regional systems, baby, region, levels and mapping. Okay, thank you for the introduction and also thanks to the organizers for inviting me and giving me the opportunity to present the work here. The work I present today is a joint collaboration with Georg Stadler from the Brandt Institute and Mike Guernes from Kelzev. Mike Gern is from Kazakh. And the question that we want to answer is: what does the Earth look like inside? So, what you see in this figure is a schematic cross-section of the India-Asia plate collision zone. So, you see the Indian plate subducting underneath the Eurasian plate, creating the Himalaya on top of it. And what we're really interested in is where are the boundaries of the plates? What are the material properties like densities, viscosities? Like densities, viscosities, and that is our aim. Data that's available in our case is mainly surface data, so we could have plate velocities as data, stress measurements either on the surface or close to the surface, topography data, and many other things. Seismic tomography might be also something you think about when you think about imaging inside of the Earth. We will not focus on this, it's a little bit of a different approach we take. Okay. So, in this deep benefit setting, the main assumption is that
