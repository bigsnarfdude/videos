Ama. And well, it's kind of returning to old roots. So, what are generalized polygons? These are the rank two case of spherical buildings. So, the concept of buildings was invented in the mathematical sense was invented by Jacques Tits in order to give natural geometries for the simple. The simple groups of Lie type and simple algebraic groups. So they typically arise from algebraic groups, but as we know, in some cases, they can also arise without groups around. So this concept of buildings or also generalized polygons, they generalize the concept of a projective space. So we know projective space. We know projective spaces arise from the groups of type AN, so PGLN over any field for n at least two. And the other algebraic groups correspond to polar spaces rather than projective spaces and other spherical buildings. So, in general, the definition of a spherical building is nothing to write down in one line, but in the rank two case, it's a very basic. Case it's a very basic graph theoretic concept. So let me start with giving the definition. So a generalized polygon. So that's the I will be speaking about generalized n-grounds to give a specific M. So what's the definition? A generalized n-ground. Is a bipartite graph with diameter n and girth 2n. And the diameter of a graph is just the maximal distance that any two vertices can have, and the both is. And the good is the minimal length of the cycle in the graph. And typically, we want our generalized polygons to be thick. That is, every vertex is supposed to have valency at least three. So, in a way, this condition here that the diameter is equal to n and the girth is equal to 2n makes it an extremal graph. We cannot decrease the diameter with keeping the girth, or we cannot increase the girth with keeping the diameter, because inside any c cycle of length to n, you actually need to have diameter n, obviously. Need to have diameter n, obviously. So, and these extremal conditions make for restrictions in many settings. So, let me give you some examples. So, examples for the case n equal 2. Well, it's clear if n is equal to 2, that is, the maximal distance between any two vertices is Two vertices is two, and the graph is bipartite. It just means that you end up with a complete bipartite graph because from any set of points here and any set of vertices here to any set of vertices here, there has to be a path of length two in each direction. So it's just a complete bipartite graph. For the case m equals 3, we have again we have two sets of vertices and well distances between vertices of the same time type have to be even. So the only even number less than 3 is 2, which means Less than three is two, which means that any two vertices on either side have to be connected by a path of this form, of path of length two. And because we're not supposed to have cycles of length less than six, this connecting part has to be unique. And the same on this side. And so you see that this is exactly the definition of a projective plane. So Any two points here, if you think of this as the points and this as the lines, then any two points are connected by a unique line, any two lines intersect in a unique point. And similarly, of course, for n equal 4, we get generalized quadruns. And maybe let me comment on the name of it being a generalized trigon in this case, like a generalized triangle. Like a generalized triangle. So the smallest cycle in this graph have length six. So this doesn't exactly look like a triangle. But on the other hand, if you think of one of the types of vertices as points and the other type of vertices as lines, say like this, it's bipartite. And then this translates into a triangle where we draw the Triangle where we draw the lines as lines and the points as points. So let's say these are the ones with the circles and the lines are the vertices that were represented by the other type. So, and for n equal to 4, we get similar pictures. So, there are some classification theorems which Classification theorems, which seem quite strong. The first and maybe most important ones is by Feid and Hickman. And they proved that this rather innocent definition of a graph with these conditions. These conditions in the finite case leads to the restrictions n must be equal to 3, 4, 6, or 8. So they proved minus 3, 4, 6, or 8. Similarly, Teets proved that N is again the same restrictions if you assume that the That the geometry comes from an algebraic group. Well, I should say finite in the finite case, and here in the algebraic group case. And in fact, if the algebraic group is over an algebraically closed field, then even A does not occur. K algebraically closed implies N is one of these. Um, n is one of these three, four, six cases. So A disappears. On the other hand, it's very easy to construct infinite generalized n-gons. Namely, you just start with something that doesn't contradict it being contained in some n-gon, and then you complete it by adding everything to make it have diameter n. So that process is called the free. The process is called the free completion. So let me start with another definition. A partial M1 is just a bipartite graph without small cycles. Bipartite graph without cycles of length. And whenever you have such a graph, which could in principle be contained in a generalized n-ground, then you can complete it by just adding all the paths that make the diameter of the graph b n. So that was also something that Tits invented: the concept of a free completion for n-rons. We can just add a new path which does not use any vertex that we had before, so we call it a clean arch. So add clean arches. Arches. So it's just if you see two vertices at distance n plus one, so they are too far apart, so n plus one here. Then we add a fresh path here of distance n minus one, so that you don't create a small cycle. So So if gamma 0 is a partial n-bound, then we inductively define gamma i or i plus 1 is the graph that you obtain from gamma i by adding all the parts of length n minus 1 between elements of distance n plus 1 in the previous level. In the previous level, add paths of length n minus one between vertices at distance n plus one in gamma i. And then, of course, the union is a generalized M1, sorry, gamma i, the union here is a generalized m1, at least if gamma 0 contained enough elements to get started. So, of course, if you start with a graph that doesn't contain any invertences at distance n plus 1, then this is just. This is just going to stay the same forever, and we call gamma the free completion of gamma zero. So I mentioned that these polygons were invented by Tits as geometries for the algebraic groups, and especially for algebraically closed fields. The algebraic groups only give rise to n-gons for the values 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3. For the values 3, 4, 6. So it was kind of a natural question a long time ago in the context of the Cholin-Zerbo conjecture: what happens with finite Moirank? So do we have generalized M-rons of finite moly rank, or do we have restrictions? And I a very long time ago. A very long time ago, I proved that we can actually have almost strongly minimal generalized n-grons for all n at least 3. So I mentioned for n equal to 2, it's just a complete bipartite graph, so only the case n at least 3 is interesting. There are almost strongly minimal generalized engines. Generalized n1s for all n at least three. And well, okay, this was done by way of Wolzovsky amalgamation, extending origin of some idea that John Baldwin had, who I see in the among the participants. Among the participants. And the delta function that was used in the process actually goes back to Marshall Hall. And I used the generalization of that in this context as well. So now I wrote some more papers about how to amalgamate generalized engrams in many ways. For example, M-bounds in many ways. For example, the free completion over a finite set, you can amalgamate it, you get some nice limit. But here, to get finite Maulerank was actually quite a bit of work. It was a Wushlovsky construction, so you had to make sure that the situation where delta is zero, so the algebraic case only happens finitely many times, was kind of a non-trivial construction. Construction. So in the free setting, when I considered generalized n-gons that are free over a finite set, you see that they also have a Freesi limit. And the freest thing that you can have is you start just with a long line and then you take this free completion in the sense that I just described. So let's say a free generalized A free generalized MCON is the Fresel limit, sorry, is the free completion of just, let's say, a long line free generalized enran is the free completion. Of some path of length k at least n plus 3. So that's about the freest thing that you can have. But you see that if you embed this and if you take a limit, you end up with the result which is not going to be. Result which is not going to be free, it's not going to be the free completion of anything. And there are actually results due to what was the name, Kelly and Sopinka, actually Kelly, showed that you can have limit structures that are just the union of three generalized MONs in the sense that I defined. In this sense, that I defined, but the limit is not going to be the free completion. So, this concept of freely generalized n-mounts is not closed in a good sense, not closed under limits. And Marshall Hall came up with a definition called generalized, actually, he was only talking about projective planes because it pre-defined. Planes because it predated the definition of a generalized M1, but so it's due to Marshall Hall the definition a generalized M1 is open on the mainstream. If every finite subset has a clean arch, has a clean path of length n minus one. So something that we just added, or a loose end, so a vertex that has That has at most one neighbor. And now, of course, the nice thing about this definition is that this is a first order definition. So Tn is the theory of open generalized n-cons. And one nice observation, actually, due to Littinen and Paolini, who I don't know whether they actually came up with this or whether this is also present already in this older literature about free and open projective planes. But one can show that every open generalized enron has an ordering. So I showed. Ordering. So I showed you here that if we take the free completion, then in a natural way, the elements are ordered in levels. And of course, it's clear that if I take an ultra product, I will have things that have, so to speak, infinite height in this completion. And not everything can be obtained from a completion. So what one can show is that every open generalized end-bound can be ordered. Endon can be ordered kind of as a refinement of this completion stages in such a way that everything below has to be created before we can continue. So the proposition is every Every open generalized enron has a partial ordering and let's call it following Paolini and Tutinen who did this for the projective planes, let's call it an HF ordering, which is a partial ordering. Is a partial ordering kind of mimicking the stages of the free completion. And so my time is actually quite short. In order to show that the theory of open generalized en-brons, which is a very natural theory, that this is a complete theory, we can do the following, which is very much like in the Bushovsky construction case. Construction case. So the theorem is that TN is complete and actually stable. Complete and strictly stable. So how to see that it's complete? It's just kind of the standard proof. Let K be the class of Finite open partial n-rons and we consider them with this HF ordering with embeddings given from that. Then it's very easy to see because the minimal extensions in this are just. Extensions in this are just by a clean path you're extending, you can amalgamate. So, this is a Freeset class, is a strong Freiss class. And from that, one can see easily, like in the other constructions in this context, that the theory. That the theory is complete. And this way of construction is, of course, very similar to the construction of the free pseudo-space that I did also a long time ago. And it's also quite similar to the construction that I did with Isabel Miller to create building-like geometry. To create building-like geometries, and exactly like in these examples, one can show that the following independence notion is exactly the one coming that gives us stability. Namely, we can define A and C are independent over B if and only if. The algebraic closure of ABC is the free completion of the free amalgam of these graphs. Maybe let me write it here. If the algebraic closure of ABC is isomorphic in the model In the model to the free completion of the free amalgam of these graphs. So, this is exactly the same as in the pseudospace situation or in the paper with. Or in the paper with Isabel. And one can quite easily verify that this condition satisfies the assumptions of stability. So we get that it is stable. Also, we get from these infinite descending chains that we can have from these HF orderings that it's not super stable because we actually do need infinite sets for as the base here. Is the base here, so we cannot have it's not always enough to have a finite set here, so the theory is not super stable. And then what's also very nice is that very much like it feels a bit exaggerated to compare it to the free groups because the work on the free groups is of course much deeper, but it's nevertheless very nice. Very nice that I mentioned these free projective planes, the free completions of some part of length K. So let K if gamma K is the free completion of a path gamma of length K, then we have their elementary. They're elementary embedded into each other if and only if k is less or equal to m. And actually, this is very easy to see using the delta function that I use to produce the almost strongly minimal examples. So, one, like in the case of free groups, we have this family of stable. Structures which are not super stable, which are embedded only if they are in the proper order, and only if they are. So, elementary substructures can only happen if you're lined up in the right way. So, if you look from very far without knowing the mathematics behind it, it looks a bit like the stable situation for the free groups, but of course, it's. Groups, but of course, it's much more elementary. And I finish here just on time, I hope. So, thank you. Thank you. Do we have big questions? Well, okay. So, if there are questions, could I ask a question from Zoom here? Yes, please. Yes, does the theory of generalized n-gons have a model companion for all n? I don't know. Sorry, I kind of swapped. I don't know. One could ask then. Yeah, it's not, I mean, it's not. Then yeah, it's not, I mean, it's not model complete. That's uh, it doesn't have quantifier elimination, it's not model complete. Um, you can see that exactly from this uh condition. Only if they're properly aligned are they elementary substructures. So, not every sub model is an elementary substructure. So, I don't know about the model companion. Yeah, nice question. Okay, thank you. So, any other questions? Questions? Audience or those of you want to sneak caption again? Thank you for your accommodating me and bye. I hope you have a nice last day. Okay, and then we'll resume stuff.
