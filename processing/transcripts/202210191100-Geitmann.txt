Right, so welcome back, everybody who is in person as well as joining us over Zoom. And our next speaker, who might sound familiar to you, is Amy Geitman, who is the Dean of the College of Agriculture and Natural Sciences, I believe. I'm probably butchering that name. Yeah, Dean of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences, I apologize, at McGill University, and is also a At McGill University, and is also a candidate research chair in biomechanics and plant development. So, Tanya, the screen is yours. Thank you, Mr. Chair. So, I wanted to talk to you about the project that I'm doing, but the question that I'm going to ask you at the end to discuss is more general than that. And I'm going to give you away the question immediately is how do we go about to do true multi-scale modeling and where are the challenges and where the probably the pitfalls? The probably the pitfalls. And so, what I'm going to show you is one of the examples where we could use that potentially. We haven't actually done any modeling yet, or basically none, but I'm going to show you the system. And the system is one of the examples where plants move. And we all know that plants can move. For example, the sunflower can turn its head, right? We already had various examples of our retrofitism, but I'm not going to talk about these. Oops. I'm going to talk about something. I'm going to talk about something that happens on a time scale that is shorter than the example you see here on the right side. On the right, you see the nicknastic movement of bean leaves, which happens on a diurnal rhythm. But the concept of what I'm going to show you is very similar, just much faster. And that will be the mimosa that you're all familiar with. So the mimosa is a leaf that is able to move within seconds when you touch it or when the plant gets shaken. When the plant gets shaken and that movement recovers after a while. So the movement itself takes two to three seconds, but the recovery takes about 30 minutes when you then let the plants without any stimulus. And the question that we asked a couple of years ago is really how are plants able to accomplish these relatively rapid movements? And it's not only rapid, it's relatively drastic. You can see that here, this would be the base of. You can see that here. This would be the base of the leaf. This pointer is quite a challenge. The base of the leaf right here. And the angle within only a few seconds actually bends down more than 90 degrees. So it is quite dramatic. And the leaf accomplishes that, or the mimosa leaf in particular, accomplishes that through regions of the tissue or the organ that are called polyviny. And the mimosa leaf has three of these. And you see them here in orange. So the main one that you see here. So the main one that we see here is the primary pulvinus and then you have secondary polyvinis and then tertiary provinis that would move the leaflets together. And the one that is acting here would be the primary pulvinus. And so what happens at several articulations, essentially the leaf and stand and the biological purpose of that or benefit to the plant is probably a defense mechanism. So when insects come or even herbivores come and want to eat the leaf, it just evades that movement and shakes. It just evades that movement and shakes off the insects. And so it just looks less attractive, so to say. So we asked: what are the structural underpinnings of this movement? And we really looked at an atom here. And so starting out here, so this would be the primary pulvinus. Yes, primary pulvinus just here. And when we cut this open here to the right, we see at the center we have a vascular tissue. Then we have the epidermis, of course, and in between we have the Of course, and in between, we have the parenchyma or cortex tissue that surrounds the vasculature. And that is already a first interesting point because, in the rest of the petiole, the vasculature is actually spread out, right? Whereas in the plevinus, it's central. So that's already a mechanically interesting point. But we're getting to more interesting things. So we believe that the movement is driven by a change in turgopressure in these different tissues. Well, in the parenchyma, so in the cortex tissue, and so that there would be largely an exchange. There would be largely an exchange of fluid from one side to the other side, which would then cause the organ to bend because of the differential pressure situation. So in order to understand how this might be working, we started out building hypotheses from macroscopic models. And the first model that David Slabova built, who was a postdoc in my lab, is simply two silicon tubes. So elastic tubes are connected at both ends. And then you would apply differential. Both ends, and then you would apply differential pressure in these two. And of course, not very surprisingly, the whole thing bends right towards the side that is of lower pressure. But what you also observe, because these tubes are somewhat elastic, right, is that there's a lot of swelling in a direction that's not very beneficial to the whole bending movement, right? I'm talking about the swelling in the horizontal direction here. And so, in order to prevent that, he applied circumferential stiffening, so to say, and then did the whole bending again. And what he found. The whole bending again, and what he found. Oops, and what he found is that the bending movement. Let me see whether the video actually works. Wow, so that's again. Oh, I realize I wanted it to you. Okay, so the bending would happen. The bending happens and it happens actually much more efficiently. So, with a lower amount of work, you achieve the same angle, so to say, right? Because you draft every swelling or most swelling into the directional s actually. Into the directional is actually beneficial to generate that differential length, of course, that's generated to the turbo. So, what we are thinking then: okay, is that a concept that the plant actually uses in order to optimize its bending motion and that very rapid motion that we see in the mimosa? And so, for that, we have to go back to the anatomy and see what we could find in terms of circumferential rigid stiffening or stabilization. And so, we started out with just trying. Started out with just trying how does this orchid even swell when you put it in different osmotic vacs, so to say. So, what David did, he cut out these parts of the province, he measured the length, the width, and the height, essentially the dimensions, and then put it in different concentrations of osmotic value, manitol by using manitol. And then he measured these dimensions of the entire organ piece. Okay, and so the first thing he found is that this cutout organ piece. Found is that this cutout organ piece that we see here actually shows when it swells a strong preference to swell in length, whereas almost no swelling in height or width. So that was interesting. Clearly, there is a very oriented or anisotropic swelling. And when he then removed the acidermis by just cutting it off using a scalpel, that anisotropy in the swelling was much reduced. It wasn't completely eliminated, but it was much reduced. You see here the It was much reduced. You see, here the difference between the three directions is reduced. What he did then is he looked at the cortex, the parenchyma tissue, the actual tissue that does the swelling, and looked only at that. So he excised pieces of that and did the same swelling experiments. And what we were expecting really is that that tissue is relatively isotropic because it actually looks isotropic in terms of cell size and shape. But no, the cortic tissue on But no, the cortic tissue on its own too had a very strong N-isotropy, so that is quite interesting, too. So, that circumferential swelling that we achieved in the silicone tubes by circumferential stiffening, now the longitudinal swelling that we achieved through circumferential stiffening seems to happen at several levels. So, that was the first indication of that. First of all, the epidermis does part of that, but then also something has to happen and the cortex tissue itself that seems And the cortex tissue itself that seems to direct the swelling in the beneficial direction, so to say. All right, so, and here, just to illustrate, this looks like very spherical cells, right? So how come they swell in a particular direction? So we started out by looking at the outside of the epidermis because that was the clearest tissue that played a role here. And when you look at this in a little bit more detail, you can actually notice that in the polinous itself, there are structures that look really different. That look really different from the rest of the petioles. And the first difference is actually these folds that you can see. So there are folds in the palinus. And of course, you're all sort of engineers. This reminds you of a corrugated material that actually bends very easily without breaking, right? So these folds might be beneficial to just permit the bending without being destructive to the organ. That's our thinking. But the second thing is the orientation of the cells. So very typically in the petiol, the cells would be elongated. The cells would be elongated in the direction of the organ, but in the pulvinus itself, they are actually perpendicular to the organ. So, complete change in the orientation. And that, too, if you think of the structure, it reminds us of the corrugated material concept, right, where finding is facilitated in perpendicular to the cell orientation. But now to the cortex. Okay, here again, cells are relatively isotropic or aspect ratio one or close to at least. And so we started out by looking at the cell wall. And so we started out by looking at the cell wall itself and what we found. And this is, of course, a reminder to showing you what is in the cell wall, a lot of cellulose. We have talked about this in elaborate ways already at this workshop. And this is what we find what the cell wall looks like in these cortic cells, which look relatively spherical. They still have a very parallel alignment of the microcrybloss perpendicular to the organ axis. And that is quite surprising because that usually Quite surprising because that usually you see like longitudinal cells, not so much in sphericity. The other feature we only sort of realized much later is these things here. Any idea what these are? Biologists? Pits. Pits! Pit fields, actually. So since these are primary walled cells, they are not pits, but pit fields, so primary pit fields. And they're penetrated by plasmonismata, so they have a lot of holes in them. Not only a lot of holes in them, the cell was also very much. Holes in them, the cell wall is also very much thinner than the rest of the cell wall. So, we were, and the remarkable thing was: pit fields are usually sort of circular, right? Um, in these cases, they seem to be all or most of them oval or even spindle-shaped, and the orientation of the spindles always perpendicular to the organ axis. So, we're thinking, okay, so this is sort of a close-up of such a pit-filled primary pit-fill, right? And these are connections between cells and in terms of the exchange of liquids between. In terms of the exchange of liquid between the different tissues, that totally aligns that they have a lot of those, right? In order to promote exchange of liquid, what is the scale? Okay, let me see. Do I have a scale bar here? No, that is horrible. I do have it on the other one. No, that's 50 micron, but so that means this is about five microns, maybe that's probably four to five. Yeah. Yeah. And so what are And so what Arvind in my lab, he's a postdoc in my lab did is simply simulate that in fact of the presence of these spindle-shaped pit fields, assuming that they're softer because they're thinner, plus holes, etc. And you stretch those. And so not very surprisingly, in the orientation of these pits, the material would actually be stiffer, whereas perpendicular to the orientation of these pit fields, it would be somewhat more elastic. Be somewhat more elastic or softer, less stiff, right? So the orientation of these pits too might be a structure that increases the deformability. So finally, we're going to the cell shape. I kept going on and on. These are sort of, you know, have an aspect ratio one, but we realized that they actually don't. When we look very Huda Kun-Focal microscope at how these cells deform when we put them in osmotic media, we realize that they actually deform only when you swell them into form only when you swell them into an aspect ratio one, but before they start out slightly more this shape, right? And so that optimization towards aspect ratio one gives of course a direction towards the gives an isotropy to the strong behavior just because of the default cell shape in this tissue. And so he quantified that too and did a little macroscopic model too just to illustrate that effect. Illustrate that effect for better visualization. And so, just to remind you, we have effects at several scales that contribute to the directed swelling of this organ. And that would be the epidermis, so cell shape, as well as these folds in the epidermis. We have cell geometry, so not completely perfect aspect ratio of these cells that then tries to optimize the aspect ratio one. And then the cell wall outer structure, both the cell wall micropickles, as well as these. Some low micropickles, as well as these pit fields. And so we really have a multi-scale directional strengthening here. And so what will be required in order to model this situation is, I think, a multi-scale modeling approach. Before I go hence to my final question, I'm just going to acknowledge the two people who really did the work, and that was mostly David Slovada, who did all the experiments, and Arvind, who did the finite element modeling here. But really, come back. Here, but really come back to this slide here and ask you what are the things that we need to consider when we try to do multi-scale modeling. Right? I borrowed a few images from people in the room and online. You know, this would be the cell wall scale. This is the cell scale, this is the tissue scale, how do we integrate it? And how do we do this with limited computational resources, so to say, right? It goes without saying that applying Daniel's model onto a multi-site. Uh, Daniel's model onto a multi-scale tissue is probably nonsensical. So, we have to go about integrating this somehow, but I just wanted to have a short brainstorm and discussion on what we need to consider while we go look like that. So, thanks a lot for your input. Good stuff. And yeah, thank you for the talk and also on a very unusual topic, I would say. What sort of contribution would you expect from the different levels at the different scales from the experiments and from the already done work? Yeah, so that is already the first question. How do we identify which of these structures is actually relevant? And we don't know. We really don't know. What would be the lead? We don't see a major component. Well, what we saw is in that one experiment, right? Let me see where that was, where we did. Um, where we did the cutting off of the epidermis, right? This one here. So, based on this, we would be able to at least distinguish epidermis and everything that's inside. The inside is, of course, more complex than just the cortex tissue, because if you look really closely, oh yeah, from Stockholm, this is Stockholm, this is October, is it? The hubris, the hubris. No, but here you have the vascular tissue still in there, you have the epidermis removed. And if you look really closely, this actually devolves into a shape that is sort of football shaped, right? Because the vascular tissue keeps this in. The cortex swells up and so it deforms because the vascular tissue prevents the whole thing from swelling up in a shape that remains rectangular or. Shape that remains rectangular or brick shape. So that's the first thing. So, in terms of experiments, I think we need to sort of cut this further apart, drill out the muscular tissue here just to start out to better understand the cortex. But then we got to this first surprise here, right? That this, the cortex alone is already very anisophile in terms of its swelling behavior. So, what we probably have to do is look at what in the erect situation. In the erect situation of the leaf, so in the default situation of the leaf, it's actually the cell shape. Because what we did here is we started with a very osmotic medium down to water, right? So we're exactly, we have, we determined where the neutral value is, where we don't get any spelling from when we cut it out. But what we haven't tested it is to trigger belief to actually move and then cut it out, so to say. So, what the natural states are and all these things. And yeah, I'm. And yeah, I'm rambling on, but it's going to be hard to pull out the different factors, hence what we would like to do is the actual model. All right, looks like Shemek has a question. Very interesting talk, Anya. I have the following question. What is known regarding the nature of this response to external factor in the following sense? If you attributed this to very active act of bending, Active act of bending, but isn't it possible that simply pulvinus is becoming very soft and these leaves are simply hanging down due to gravity? No, no, it's not. It happens in any orientation, so to say. You could hang the mimosa upside down, which already triggers the response, and then let it equilibrate, which of course would bend the leaf somewhat because of gravity, but then you trigger it and it will go against. Then you trigger it and it will go against gravity. So it's not just a wilting, so to say, which is what I translate from what you suggested, right? It's not just a wilting response. Okay, thank you. Go ahead, Bud. So very interesting. Just in terms of bending, the further away it is from the center, the more important it is, right? So if we're to tear things apart, I would start the furthest away from the center. Yeah. Away from the center. Yeah. I think this would count the voltage. Absolutely. The further from the center bending. So the epidermis definitely has an important role to play. So this gets us to a part of the project that I didn't talk about yet at all, and that's the perception of the trigger, right? We also actually try what we need to do in order to trigger it off. And so we have to touch it at the base of the podinus or at the tip of the leaflet, which is that Lieber effect as well. But that's a completely different task. But yeah, absolutely. So the more decentralized, the bigger there. Centralize the figure bit. Angela. Sorry, I didn't unmute. Thanks, Anya. You introduced a lot about the timing that you were interested in, the movement, but then you didn't do any experiments with timing. What are you thinking about that? Yeah, so that is the absolute shortfall here. So these swelling experiments actually took minutes, if not half an hour, to do, whereas the actual bending is accomplished in three minutes. We were never able to get it to. We were never able to get it to swell that quickly or deswell. So, we don't even know how physiological this is or whether all that water transport actually doesn't even doesn't even get shuttered around osmotically, meaning across a membrane, but through those plasmodesmata that we're seeing, which I don't even know how to pull apart, right, in terms of meaningfulness. So, long story short, we haven't been able to swell the system artificially at the same speed. system artificially at the same speed as it works in the plant. So great and final question from Bernal? Yeah, I think this is very interesting because actually you were asking where you start from. I will start from this tissue scale and trying to the model and to find out which one can match both the motion and the speed. And then this will kind of it's a bit top down and you then can zoom. Then can zoom on what is very important. I think it's starting with this, but also with the time scale. And I was wondering when you turned upside down, the speed of the motion is just the same? And we haven't done those experiments. That would be interesting. That would be interesting, yeah. And then we send it to the ISS to see how it is with our gravity, too. So, yeah, no good point. Yeah, the problem is with the speed, like we our focus was really on the structural underpinning who we're not. The structural underpinnings. We were not, I don't want to say we were not interested, but we didn't focus on the actual mechanism of fluid exchange, which is a whole different beast, right? Is there aquaporins? Is it the plasmodysmata? Is there, et cetera, et cetera. So it's two things, but I think your question is a really good suggestion to do this upside down and see whether there's a differential in speed. All right, let's thank Anya one more time. Our next speaker is Eric Neil Smith, who's a professor of information and computer science at UC Irvine. Eric, the floor is yours. All right, thank you. I apologize in advance if my internet cuts out for the last talk. It was problematic. But it's been stable before that this morning. So let's see what happens. I'll try to share this. I'll try to share this, share the screen with
