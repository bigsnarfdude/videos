Okay, I'm ready. Okay, so yes, it's time to start. You're right. Our next speaker is Masakazu Teragaito, who will tell us about generalized torsion element and hyperbolic links. Okay, thanks for introduction. Good morning, everyone. Seven o'clock before seven o'clock in the morning. Seven o'clock before seven o'clock in the morning. In Japan, okay, the third state of emergency was lifted on last Sunday, but the situation continues to be uncertain. And at last, the vaccination started at my university. In fact, I'm going to get a vaccination today, four hours later. Anyway, I'd like to talk about generalized torsional elements found in three manifold groups. In particular, I will focus on. In particular, I will focus on minimal volume hyperbolic 3-minefords. Okay, first, I give a background. Background. A three-manifold group is a fundamental group of a compact connected 3-manifold. And it is not too much to say that most 3-manifold groups are torsion-free. For example, not all linked groups are. Link groups are torsion-free and the fundamental group of Hawkeye manifolds, and more generally, the fundamental group of orientable reducible 3D manifold with infinite pi one, they are all toshovi. However, we can expect that most 3D manifold groups have generalized tosho elements, which are defined in the next slide. In a group, a non-trivial element is called a generalized torsion element if some non-empty finite product of its conjugate equal to the identity. So here, for example, Z2A is the conjugate of the element Z by another element A. I have a very simple example. For the Klein bottle, the For the client model, the fundamental group has a presentation with two generators, x and y, and just one relation. Here, one generator y is, of course, non-trivial, but if you look the relation, okay, left-hand side is a conjugate of y by x. Hence, the relation changes to this way: y to x times y equals to identity. Equal to identity. Now, of course, as I said, y is non-trivial. This means the generator is a generalized torsion element for the fundamental group of crime bottle. So what is the importance of generalized torsion element? Here's one answer, but before that, I have to review biodiversity on the group. A group is said to be bi-order, abbreviated as B-O. As BO, if the group admits a strict total ordering, which is invariant under right and left multiplication. Here, the trigger group is treated as BO, and I have an easy observation. It says that BO group does not admit a generalized torsion element. Hence, this is the answer. The existence of generalized torsion is an obstruction for biodiversity. Obstruction for bioordering, for existence of bioordering. The proof of this observation is very easy. Okay, you have a non-trivial element, then it is bigger than one or smaller than one. Okay, bigger than the identity or smaller than the identity with respect to the total ordering. Okay, if it is bigger than one, then its conjugate is still bigger than one by the bi-orderability. By the biodiability. Finally, any product of such conjugate is also bigger than one. Therefore, you cannot create the identity as the product of such conjugates. This is proof. Okay, as I already mentioned, we expect that most three mindful groups have general social elements. And here are some My risk. Number one, a long time ago, it had been expected that if a group is not PO, then the group has a generalized torsion element. However, this is not true. In 1972, Boldorf first gave a counterexample. Since then, only a few examples are a few examples showed up. In my view, In my view, all known examples are artificial. At least they are not three-manifold groups. And number two, most three-manifold groups are not BO because any finitely generated BO group subject onto the infinite secret group. So, Motegi, okay, Mottegi, maybe he's here. Motegi and I proposed the following conjecture a few years ago. Conjecture a few years ago. Okay. For three magneto groups, by order ability is equivalent to be generalized or torsion-free. But one direction is easy, as I already observed. So practical conjecture is this. For a three-marved group, if it is not BO, then the group admits a generalized torsion element. That is, when given a non-boxing, That is, when given a non-BO3 manifold group, I want to find the generalized torsion element. This is my purpose. And thanks to a classical result of Vinoburadov, we can concentrate on only prime three manifold. Okay, and the next, okay, this slide shows various classes of three manifold for which the conjecture was verified. Which the conjecture was verified. Okay, so including some not true single complement and all the 25 manifold. So on. Okay, now I'm going to part two. This is a summary of part two. Next, hyperbolic three manifold admits generalized total elements in their fundamental groups. The weeks manifold, the affiliate system manifold, and the white-headed system. system manifold and the whitehead system manifold. Now why do we focus on this manifold? First, the weak manifold is the unique closed oriental three mind hyperbolic three manifold of three smallest volume and easy description is some dense surgery on the white edge link. Also Caligary and Dunfield proved that the fundamental group is not BO. In fact, they showed not left order of. Not left all the album. Secondly, there are some classifications of cusp hyperbolic three manifolds of minimal volume. In case of one cusp, the manifold is either the figure eight naught complement or the figure eight sister manifold. In case of two cusps, the manifold is either the white headlink complement or the whiteed sister manifold, which is a minus two, three, eight. Which is a minus two, three, eight plecho-link complement. In either case, the former has BO fundamental groups. This is known, but the latter has non-BO fundamental groups. This is also known. Therefore, we need to find the general social elements in the fundamental groups of weak manifold and the figure-eight system manifold and the white-eight system manifold. Okay, I would like to explain the brief outline of proof. This is a white link. The link group has a presentation generated by two meridians, A and B, and with one relation. And as I said, this group is known to be BO. Okay, so you cannot expect a general stoichiometric element here. We perform dense surgery on one component, the WMO by M. Wm over L is the M over L damn filling, or one boundary component of the white interlinked exterior. Okay, this is the result. The denominator M, also sorry, the denominator is L. The denominator is always assumed to be positive. Then if the numerator M is at least twice of the denominator, then the resulting manifold of the surgery admits a generalist total element. As meets a generalized social element in its fundamental group. In particular, we can settle the figure to system manifold. Next. This NASC slide shows a calculation. Okay, so actually it is just a calculation. Starting from the legal group presentation of the first line, we add the surgery relation on the second line. After modifying the first relation, put into the second relation. Put into the second relation. And if I use this symbol capital U, the second relation can be rewritten as in the red box. The point is the capital U is a product of just two conjugate of the positive meridian A. It doesn't contain a negative meridian. It is just product of two conjugate of the meridian A, positive A. And if you If you m, okay, if m is at least twice of m, the left-hand side of the red box is a product of the conjugate of the only meridian, positive meridian A. By the homological reason, the meridian A is still non-trivial after dense surgery. So the element A is a generalized total element. Okay, so here is immediate corality. quality m is the resulting uh closed manifold of m over n then filling on the also sorry m is the the same the before same as before sorry m is a resulting manifold of m over n then filling the white data link is exterior on one just one component okay uh we keep the assumption that uh m is at least twice of l denominate then any damn filling on the remaining damn filling on the remaining boundary component of M which creates a closed manifold okay admits a general tosh element in particular we can settle the weak weak manifold the proof is immediate okay the closed manifold sorry the manifold m the original manifold m has a it has a still boundary okay the manifold m has a generalized torsion element as i said before actually the the element m Actually, the element A was the generist element. But the second of them filling never kills this element A by homological reason. Now, of course, the relation written in the red box is the same. It holds still. So the element A still gives the general social element after the second surgery. Okay, the only remaining target is the whitehead system manifold. The whitehead system manifold. I'm going to attack it in a broader setting as part three. Okay, so here is your familiar screen of SNAPI and the folder minus 238 virtual link, whose exterior is our present target. The SNAPPI tells us the fundamental group generated by two generators, one relation. Here you can see the link group has a simpler presentation. A simpler presentation. Starting from the output of SNAP Pi, I performed some, how to say the T transformation. Okay, I want to focus on the final one. Relation, left-hand side of the last relation is just a single commutate. Okay, here, just one commutate. But if I use a commutate. If I use a commutator identity like this one, the left-hand side of the final relation is decomposed as a product of five conjugates of the commutator of C and A. Now, of course, commutator of C and A is non-trivial because A and C are generators of the link hysteria. Okay. So, sorry, no, no, no, no. Okay, the commutator C and A is not. And the commutator C and A is non-trivial because, okay, C and A are generators. If the commutator is trivial, that means the link group is abelian, and which implies the link is oblink. Okay, so therefore, I showed the commutator C and A is a general total element. And okay, so this slide shows the result of part three as a general as a generalization of the minus two. As a generalization of the minus 238 pressure link, we found the generalized torsion element for minus 232L pressure link for any positive L. The link group was known to be not BO by King Andrew Lusen. Here is my strategy. I feel that the building presentation is problematic from my experience. The two-generator presentation is handy. General presentation is handy. Unfortunately, this link minus 232M which link has tunnel number one. Actually, as you see, the arc gamma is the analytic tunnel. This means that, as you know, the outside of the regular neighborhood of the union of the link and the analytic tunnel gamma is a hundred body of genus two. In other words, the link extra is. The link extellia is obtained from a genus two-handle body by attaching a two-handle along the curve L here, this one, this co-core of the antigunnel. Okay. Okay, that was the recipe for getting the link group presentation with two generators and one relation. Okay, I'm not. Okay, I will not discuss the deformation from the previous picture to the standard handlebody picture, but everybody can do the same thing. Okay. Anyways, I deformed the underbody, actually, the form outside hundred body. And I stopped at this final form because it is enough to see the outside is a hundred body of genus 2. You can see. See, okay, here are two loops, Adufo and Beta, bound disjoint meridian disks for the outside underbody. So, and here is the Cocoa L. So, if we track the intersection between the loop L and this alpha and beta, then we get a relation for the link group. Okay, so this is the answer. We get a presentation of link group. Presentation of link group. Okay, this is a link group. And like the test case of minus 2,38 pressure link, the relation can be changed into a single commutator. And you see that as, okay, so it decomposes into the product of conjugate of the commutator of A and B bar, the inverse of B. And of course, this commutator is non-trivial. Okay, they are generators. Generators. The link group will never be abelian. So, this commutator of A and B bar is a generalized torsion element. Okay. I have two more slides. So, according to King Andrew La Lusen, we have other targets. Actually, more pressure links and the two bridge lengths of length two. As you know, that they all have. As you know, that they all have tunnel number one. So I try the same procedure, but the relation is not breakable for me. But of course, there is a hope. But it's more complicated. And the next, another problem comes to mind. Today I showed infinitely many hyperbolic links of two components. Link of two components whose link group admits a generalized torsion element. But there is no known hyperbolic link with more than two components whose link group admits a generalized torsion element. For example, I try the magic manifold, which is a complement of three, okay, which is some hyperbolic link with three components. But in my feeling, it may be PU. Maybe PO. Okay, so I cannot, I, yeah, I suspect the mask manifold is not a good target. Okay, this is the last slide. In this talk, we focused on hyperbolic links, but of course, we are the most interested in hyperbolic knots. So for negative twistonots of genus one, starting from the minus one. Starting from the minus one twist naught, which is a tolerable actually. Negative twist naught of genus one give the only known hyperbolic knots having a generalized torsion element in the knot groups. But Motavi and I recently showed that there are infinitely many hyperbolic knots with arbitrary high gena whose knot group have generalized torsion element. In particular, it contains the minus 2, 3, 2n. The minus 2, 3, 2, and plus 5 pressure naught, starting as a famous minus 2, 3, 7 pressure naught. So, that's good. That sounds good for me. Thank you for your attention. That's all. Thank you very much for your talk. Are there any questions? I have a question. You didn't say so much about genus otherwise, right? Genus, otherwise, right? Was this sort of an accidental finding that you realized that these knots have arbitrarily high genera, or is it actually related to what you were thinking about in terms of generalized torsion elements? I did catch that. Oh, yeah. So I'm interested in genus, right? And so I'm just wondering whether this is a like a Like a not accidental, but an unrelated observation that this class of knots has arbitrarily high genus or arbitrarily high genera. Or was that related to is that coming out of the algebra from generalized torsion elements or is it independent? Oh, I think there is no relation. No relation, right? That's my opinion. We're looking at the knots and You're looking at the knots, and then you observe that. Oh, yes, and also interesting about these is that there's no restriction on genus, right? Yeah, as I said, there seems no relation. But of course, I guess we all have an interest in the geometric meaning of general social element. Well, I do, of course. But still, it's a dream for me for a long time, but still, it's just a calculation. It is just a calculation. Okay. Other questions for the speaker? Okay, in that case, let's thank the speaker again for giving us the talk at any unbearably early. Talk at an invariably early hour of the morning. Thank you. And I think we will meet together again at 11 o'clock. Oaxaca time tomorrow, if I'm not wrong. Yes. All right. See y'all then.
