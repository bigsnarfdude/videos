Either people. So this is about four people, five. So one of the features. Yeah, so as I was practicing the talk with some of my staff, they said they had no idea what I was talking about. So that's the first error that I've made because this book came out in 1969 and the movie came out in 1973. But kind of growing up in Scotland in the 1980s, anything about sex was more information than we could get otherwise. Was more information than we could get otherwise, so it was a very important thing. The second thing is that the title arrogantly gives you the impression that I'm going to tell you everything that you want to know about the sex chromosomes, but I certainly don't know everything about the sex chromosomes, and I don't think we as human geneticists spend enough time thinking about the sex chromosomes. So I'm going to talk a little bit about sex chromosomes and some genotyping, talk about the Typing, talk about the state of genome-wide association studies related to the X chromosome, then cover some aspects of X chromosome data quality using some examples from the UK Biobank using the array data, the semantic computation, and the whole exome sequencing, and then talk about some data from the thousand genomes height from which whole genomes are considered. So here we have the X chromosome. It's about 156 megabases in length. 56 megabases in length. There's two kind of very famous regions: pseudotosomal region 1 at the tip of the PR, and pseudo-tosomal region 2 at the tip of the QR. And physically, they're relatively small, around 3 megabases and 0.3 megabases. They have small hydrogen genes, some SNPs. The interesting features is that there's obligatory recombination between the X and the Y in PAR1 in male meiosis. In male meioses. Part 2, there's not necessarily the obligatory recombination. There's this third region that's called the X-transposed region, sometimes called the PAR3. It's a region where, according to the literature, there's at least 99% sequence similarity between the region on the X chromosome and a region on the Y chromosome, which can cause some challenges with both sequencing and genotyping. And then the rest of the X chromosome, which And then the rest of the X-chromosome, which is what kind of people generally talk about, is what I'll call the marked pseudo-autosomal region, or the NPR. It's about 150 megabases in length, has about 800 genes, and of course millions of SNPs. But of course, females have two copies of it, the males have one copy. So just to blow up, the pseudotisomal region on the tip of the P-tip of the X chromosome is here. The Y chromosome, the full figures at the top, with The full figures at the top with the two pseudo-villainal regions at the beginning and the end, and then you can see this X-transposed region that on X is here, on Y is actually pretty close to the pseudothermal region 1. So, this is some of the complexity of the sex chromosomes. I think we can hear someone online. So, I wanted to talk briefly about genotyping because actually, yesterday evening we were talking. Yesterday evening, we were talking about genotyping, and it's perhaps relevant because part of the phenomena that we're seeing on X may be related to genotyping. When we measure a SNP on a hortosome, we measure usually the A allele intensity and the B allele intensity, and we see three beautiful clusters corresponding to the three autosomal genotypes in the Cartesian plots. And we can convert these Cartesian plots into these polar coordinates. Plots into these polar coordinates where we effectively have the angle on the x-axis, so 0 versus 90 degrees, and then the normalized intensity, just the sum of the intensities of the two mules. So when we get to the X chromosome, this is another example of what we would expect to see on the autosome, kind of three obvious simple clusters. But on the X chromosome, in the non-snotosomal region, we actually have five. Region, we actually have five clusters of data. We have females with the usual kind of situations that we would expect to see for autosomal stem. For males, we have either hemizygous A or hemizygous B. As I understand, most of the genotyping software for the arrays doesn't call genotypes any differently on the X chromosome as opposed to the border zombies. So, effectively, when you give your genotype data, effectively, these A's, the hemozygote. These A's, the hemozygous A's, and the homozygous A's are together coded as zero, and these two are together coded as two, as far as I understand. And that's kind of where most people start with genotype data. So over 10 years ago, WISE and others looked at the X chromosome in genome-wide association studies. They did two things. They, first of all, looked in the GWAS catalog. They first of all looked in the GWAS catalogue to see how many signals there were on the X chromosomes compared to the autosomes. And in fact, they also went through every GWAS published in a two-year period, which nowadays would seem to be a more feasible task. And they actually went through the detailed methods to see whether they specifically mentioned analysing the X-chromosome. And at that time, they documented that only 33% of GRACE were analysing X-chromatic. And when they looked in the camp, And when they looked in the catalog, they compared the X chromosome to autosomes. Chromosome 7 is the autosome that has most similar physical length to the X chromosome. It had 120 associations at that time versus only 15 associations on the X chromosome. So clearly, there appear to be a paucity of GWAS signals on the X chromosome. But just as a contrast, if I go into online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, which is a database of rare GWAS. MAN, which is a database of rare genetic variation of diseases, there's actually more disease genes on the X chromosome than there are on chromosome 7. So this kind of gives us a hint that there might be a problem with how we're dealing with the X chromosome in genome-wide association studies. And here's one of these classic plots from the GWAS catalogue, each dot representing a GWAS signal. And I'll draw your attention to X here. You can see very few signals. Here. You see very few signals. This was at 2013 versus chromosome 7. So, in fact, the situation isn't that there's just clustered signals on chromosome 7, there's a great paucity of signals on the X chromosome. So, last year, Lei Sun, Chan Yante, myself, and others effectively kind of repeated what the Rice study had done. And we not only looked at the extreme, but we also looked at the vitrom. But we also looked at the Y chromosome. And what we did was we looked at the GMAS catalogue to see whether the problem of the X chromosome not being analyzed in two-thirds of studies was still the case. Here we're cataloging effectively the GWAS signals per megabase on each of the autosomes, and you can see a range of between 10 and 16 per autosome, whereas the X chromosome is down here roughly one signal per megabase on average. Signal per megabase on average. So the question is: why are there so apparently so few X chromosome loci in the GWAS catalog? So it could be that there's truly fewer GWAS loci on the X chromosome, and that's been argued by some other authors. But we were thinking that probably people are still tending to ignore the X chromosome. So rather than using the regular GWS catalog where you just search for your SNP or whatever, the GWS catalog also hosts GWS. GUS catalogue also hosts GUS summary statistics, which allows us to look to see whether people have actually analysed the X chromosome. So in 2021, there were 136 papers that deposited GWAS summary statistics into the GWAS catalogue. And we randomly selected one analysis from each of these papers. And we found that only 25% of these papers actually included results of the X-roman compared to 33% from 2013. So in fact, despite So, in fact, despite providing recommendations for including the X chromosome in GWAS, the problems actually got worse rather than better in the 10 years between this. And this isn't just kind of related to GWAS alone. If we go into a polygenic risk score catalog, we took a random sample of 400 polygenic risk scores, and there's actually no rosy and the extromosomes in any of these samples. So it's potentially impacting polygenic risk scores. Impacting polygenic misclose as well. So, if only a quarter of GWASs are analyzing the X chromosome, here we're plotting the number of GWAS signals for the autosomes in dots over time versus the X chromosome in crosses. The current situation is that kind of, as you can see, the X chromosome is lagging far behind the autosomes. But if, in fact, everybody was analyzing the X chromosome, the situation may not look so dire, that the X chromosome may be getting close. X chromosome may be getting closer to the average on the autosomes. So we've been trying to understand why people are reluctant to analyze the X chromosome. We haven't asked people directly, but we've looked at some data to try and investigate some of the phenomena that we think are contributing to this. So there are potentially some challenges in the analysis of the X-chromosome. People are a bit concerned about how they should code genotype data, whether they should include sexes and Whether they should include sex as a covariate, whether they should even include an interaction between the slip and sex, whether they should do the analysis in both sexes or separately or combined. But kind of we've not focused on that specific aspect. We've more focused on the data. So the data quality aspects that we've looked at are whether there is differences, sex differences in the genotype missingness that steps on the X chromosome. And one phenomenon that we've seen, especially. And one phenomenon that is seen, especially in exome sequencing, is that there's apparent males who are heterozygous on the X chromosome. And this potentially raises quality questions about the quality of least exome sequencing. We've also examined the phenomena of sex differences in the allele frequency on the X chromosome and also rather understudied topic of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium on the X-chromosome. So some of this work was published earlier this year in this paper. Earlier this year, in this paper, where we take data from the UK Biobank and we look at the differences in the missingness and the allele frequency differences, not only on the X chromosome, but we also do it across the order of the XOR. And here we're using the array data, the centrally imputed data, and the exome sequence. So I'll start off with the missingness. This is the UK Biobind Axiom array. So this is the array that was used to genotype the majority of people in the UK BioBank. And here we just By the way. And here we're just looking at the sex difference in the missingness on the extremism in the white British individuals. So we have the extremism here. In most of these figures, the pseudo-autosomal region one is at the very start here, and I've colored it in grey, the points. And then here's the centromere. This is this X-transposed region here, and then pseudo-thisomal region 2. It's a very small region at the end of the X-ray. And here we have negative 1. And here we have negative log 10p on a log scale. And you can see that there's a lot of genome-wide significant differences in the missingness of genotypes on the X-chromosome. And it's important to note that in the UK Biobank, they genotyped the non-pseudosomal region SNPs, so all of these black SNPs, they were genotyped separately by sex for some reason that they don't allude to. But I presume it relates to data. But I presume it relates to data quality. But by doing this, it appears that this either generates or kind of at least contributes to sex differences in the missingness of genotype data. And on the array, it appears that females typically have higher missing rates than males do across the at least the pseudo-some region in the X-ray. So the next topic we looked at was sex differences in the allele frequency, and this In the allele frequency. And this paper wasn't explicitly a GWAS of sex, but ended up being a GWAS sex. This was using data from 23andMe, where they were investigating the genetic basis of sex differential participant bias. But when they presented their results, they limited it only to the autosomes. We actually don't know what the 23NV data looks like in terms of sector differences in the middle sequences. Some of these apparent. Some of these apparent differences appear to be technical problems. So, although you may think that the human genome project is finished, in fact, full sequence of the Y chromosome was only published last year. And if you have variants on the autosomes that have sequence similarity to regions of the genome that you've not sequenced yet, then potentially they can be interfered with by these unsequenced regions of the genome. So here we take the axiom biobank array. I thought I skipped one slide. Yes, sorry. Here we're just analyzing the directly genotype SNPs on the axiom array, looking for sector differences in the allele frequency. Again, same format of the Manhattan plot. Sudo Sol Region 1 here. Part pseudosomal region one here, centromere here, part two here. The most remarkable situation that we see here is that close to the boundary between pseudosolomal region one and the non-pseudosomal region, we see this highly significant difference in allele frequency between males and females. And this is just to zoom in on that. It's really kind of limited to SNPs within the last roughly few hundred kV of the pseudo-largal region one. Of the pseudosomal region one, but we also see this phenomena at pseudosomal region two as well. Most people, when they're analysing UK biobank data, are not using just the directly genotype SNPs, they're using the centrally imputed data. And here, we repeated that analysis on the centrally imputed data, where effectively everybody has every SNP imputed. Again, we see this phenomenon at pseudosomal region one, we see some problems with allele. We see some problems with allele frequency differences around the centromere, another region here, some problems around the XTR, and again at PAR2 with some other isolated regions as well. So it appears that there's some sex differences in missingness on the array, and there's sex differences in allele frequency, both in the genotype data and the imputed data. And then we move to the exome sequence data in UKBioBi. Here again, we're looking at sex difference in the missing. We're looking at sex difference in the missingness. Again, we have kind of a Manhattan plot here, this time not lock-scaled. And the direction appears to be generally opposite to what we see with the array data. So males tend to have more missingness than females do in the exome sequence data. And because the exome sequence data is this kind of capture, you see this kind of punctate nature of it related to particular exons and genes that are being captured. And then finally, And then finally, looked at sex difference in the allele frequency on the X chromosome from the exome sequence, again in VPABioband. We're seeing from the exome sequence, again, at the boundary between PAR1 and NPR, that there's a sex difference in all the frequency. And then there's other regions, probably mostly limited to specific genes, where there's quite large differences in ordinary frequency across the X chromosome. So we were interested in the exome sequence data to see if we could identify features, bioinformatic features of the variant that would predict whether that SNP might have a sex difference in the allele frequency. So here I'm just showing you kind of take-home message from a multivariate model where we kind of look at a whole host of different features to try and identify those that are associated with sex difference in the allele frequency from the ex. Sex difference in the allele frequency from the exome sequency. There's some weak effect as to what the alternate allele is. If there's high missing rates in either females or males, they tend to have sex differences in the allele frequency. When the female allele frequency is higher than males, that tends to increase the risk of them having a sex difference in the allele frequency. SNPs that deviate from Hardy-Weinberg in females also, SNPs that erroneously are producing male heterozygous. Erroneously producing male heterozygous calls. And then, kind of, these classic problems of parts of the genome that are difficult to sequence also increase risk that SNP is likely to have a sex difference in the lane frequency. Although this is excellent sequence data, there is some intronic sequence, so in fact, variants in intronic sequence are less likely to have sex differences in the moon frequency, and then some other features here as well. So then the last thing I want to talk about was Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium on the X-chromosome. And it's a topic that doesn't seem to be discussed very much. Kimura in 1970 and then kind of reinforced by Graffelman and Muhammad in 2016 have shown that kind of Hardy-Weinberg on the X chromosome doesn't follow the same rules as Hardy-Weinberg on the autosomes. So in the autosomes, we're told within one generation of random Within one generation of random main, we should have equilibrium, but on the extra level, it takes a number of generations for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium to be present in the non-sutrasal region. So there's actually been, although people used Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium early on in, say, the HapMap project and kind of early cleaning of GWAS arrays, there's been less attention to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, I would say, in the in the recent past. Say in the recent past. This was the only paper that I could find that had looked at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in 1000 Genomes Phase 3 data. Here they're using data from 50 Japanese females. And you can see, even with the sample size, there's lots of regions or SNPs on the X chromosome in that data that appear to deviate from Hardy Minecraft. So there's lots of problems with this data. This is mostly very low coverage, whole genome sequence data. Whole genome sequence data, which doesn't produce highly reliable genotypes. So, we wanted to revisit this question using kind of contemporary data. To do that, we used the high-coverage whole genome sequence data from the Thousand Genomes project, and we used the version of it that had been aligned to the TRAMATERMATO genome V2. I'll cut to the chase. We did this analysis separately by superpopulation and Superpopulation and in the pseudo-lower regions, we did it separately by sex. And I'll just perhaps go to the meta-analysis where we combine across sexes and populations. We see quite a bit of Hardy-Weinberg deviation in the pseudosomal region one. In NPR, at the boundary between it and PAR one, we see quite a bit of Hardy-Weinberg deviation, and most of PAR two also is showing a deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equal agreement. From Hardy Weinberg, I could agree. So, to take home, the message is: unfortunately, the situation on the X chromosome in terms of G bias has to be getting worse rather than better. There's, with some data sets, sex differences in the missingness of variants on the X chromosome. There appear to be sex differences in the allele frequency, especially around the boundaries of the pseudotosomal regions, and also Heidi-Weinberg deviation, which may be a follow-on from the. Deviation, which may be a follow-on from the sex difference. But I think we need to pay more attention to quality control on the sex chromosomes, and we need to try and again include the sex chromosomes in our non-and acknowledgements. So, all the theoretical work is from Lei. Unfortunately, she was not able to be here. And then Chan Yun and other people involved in the project. Thanks. Is there one quick question? Pete and Neil, you can do that. Whose question is most burning? I have a comment about those. What an explanation for the submitted planks. It sounds like you have a burning comment. But, okay, because we've looked at a lot of the accidents. Right. So you showed a perfect cluster diagram. The problem is a lot of them don't look like that because they overlap. Don't look like that because they overlap. The clusters overlap. And the algorithm makes cluster splits. And what I'm thinking is: if you can do it in males, there's only two clusters. But in females, there's three. And if the heterozygous cluster overlaps and doesn't have clean separation for one of the homozygous ones, you're going to have a higher error missing rate for that set. Okay? And you're also going to get a different wheel frequency. So, I mean, I can talk to later about this. We have a lot of experience with the axon arrays from looking at this kind of stuff. All right, Arnie.
