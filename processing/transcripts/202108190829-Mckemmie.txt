Do you see the place where the videos are? Okay, so I should. No, I don't think so. Sometimes you see like a gray shape in the side covering the slides. No? I can only see the slide with your point on it. Great. Okay, so it's it's 8.30 in in Banf, so I think we're ready to start. Veronica, could you start the recording? It's already recording now. Okay, so our first speaker today is Aileen McKemi from the UK University of Jerusalem, and she's going to tell us about the probability of generating invariable. probability of generating invariably a finite simple group. Go ahead, Adrian. All right, thank you very much for inviting me. This is joint work with Daniel Libgarzoni from the University of Padova, but he just moved to Cal Abib University. Okay, so first we should define invariable generation. So if G, we're only going to be working with finite groups. If G is a finite group and you take a set, a subset S, A subset S, then we say that G is invariably generated, the subgroup of G, which is invariably generated by S, is the intersection over the intersection of subgroups generated by S, conjugated in any way we want. So we're intersecting over all the different ways of conjugating. And so if we could say that S. We can say that S invariably generates G if S is a generating set for G, and also it remains a generating set if we replace any element by a conjugate of that same element. And we can conjugate them all by different things. Okay, so for example, if you take G to be the symmetric group, then we can think about invariably generating transitive subgroups. Generating transitive subgroups. So, first, let's think about just normally generating them or the classical notion of generation. If you take a set of elements, then they will fail to generate a transitive subgroup if and only if those elements all fix a common set. So, this is basically just by definition. Now, let's think about invariable generation version of this statement. So, if we are invariably generating, we're allowed to continue. Variably generating, we're allowed to conjugate any element however we want, and in SN, this just means replacing any element by something with the same cycle type. So a set of elements in SN fails to invariably generate a transitive subgroup if and only if the elements all fix a set of a common size. Because when I conjugate, really all I'm doing is relabeling the set of letters that SN is. Set of letters that SN is acting on. Okay. So the motivation for studying invariable generation, at least in the SN case, comes from computational Galois theory. So if you're given a polynomial F with degree N, you know that its Galois group is contained in a symmetric group. So a natural question is to ask, given that polynomial, is the Galois group the whole group? Is the Gao group the whole symmetric group, or is it something smaller? And there are some algorithms for computing the answer to this question, but in general, and their linear time, I think the best is big O of n to the 40, but it's in practice very slow. So, what we want to do is use a Monte Carlo algorithm instead. So, if you take a prime p that doesn't divide the P that doesn't divide the discriminant of F, then you can factorize F modulo P. And you look at the powers of the distinct irreducible factors, so the set of degrees of factors, and that they should sum up to n, which gives you a partition of n. And a partition of n is a cycle type in Sn and so given a prime. Given a prime, you can factorize and get a cycle type, which is going to be an element in the Galois group. So, in this way, you can pick some, you can get some information about the Galois group because you can get some information about the cycle types of elements in it. So, if there is a set of primes, which don't divide the indiscriminant, such that the set of cycle types The set of cycle types invariably generates Sn, then you know the Galois group must be Sn because we know that there is an element of those cycle types in the Galois group. So then the question is, if I pick some random primes in some way, I want to know if I apply this system, how likely is it that we get a false negative, which means that. Negative, which means that we pick, so the Galois group is SN, but we manage to pick elements that don't display that it's SN. So the elements don't invariably generate Sn okay so the first thing is to look at the Frobenius density theorem and it tells you what the distribution of so we are picking primes. We are picking primes so that we can get some information about cycle types of elements. And the Frobenius density theorem basically says that those two things are distributed in the same way. So if you fix a partition, the proportion of elements in the Gao group with that cycle type for a partition is the same, basically, as the proportion of primes that give you that. That partition of n when you factorize modulo the prime and then look at the degrees. So, in this way, we can pick random elements of the Galois group and then lose the information except for the cycle type. So, yeah, we're able to pick random elements, but we don't quite get to know the element. Okay, so then the answer to the question is that. Then the answer to the question is that the probability that we get a false negative applying this Monte Carlo algorithm is the same as the probability that k random elements do not invariably generate Sn. Because we're in the case where the Galois group is Sn, we've picked some random elements and they don't invariably generate. All right, any questions so far? Okay, so I'm just gonna give some notation for this stuff, and then we're gonna compare the results that are available for a classical generation as opposed to invariable generation. So P of G and K is going to be the probability that K random elements generate G. And then when I write a sub inv, then it's the invariable generation version. The invariable generation version. So, for example, we know that if you have a finite simple group, then the probability that two random elements generate the group tends to one as the order of the group goes to infinity. So a natural question would be, can we write an inf here? And the answer is not really. What we can do is show What we can do is show that there are two elements which invariably generate our finite simple group. So I've written it here in a probabilistic statement, but this is just saying that for each finite simple group, there is a pair which invariably generates. However, there's an absolute constant that bounds the probability of invariable generation by a fixed number of elements away from one. So here if we put two in there, we'll see that we can't possibly get this result by writing an in this place. Okay, so then the question instead becomes how many elements do we need to pick to have the probability of invariably generating bounded away from zero? Because we know it's bounded away from one, so we just want it bounded away from zero. Bounded away from zero. And the answer for Sn is very nice. It's four. So the probability that four random elements invariably generate Sn is bounded away from zero. And if you pick three elements, then in the limit as n goes to infinity, the probability goes to zero. And then you can extend this to You can extend this to the classical groups. So, if you take a finite classical group, rank R, so R will be the rank of a finite classical group all the way through, and you take a field of Q elements, then GRQ is going to be your finite classical group. And so, here we have Q as well as an R. So, R is basically the same as N in this case. So R is basically the same as N in this case. But you can show that the probability that four random elements invariably generate is bounded away from zero as long as you have a large enough Q. And you should be able to write down, you know, if you take Q greater than, I think, I don't know, something like 300, I think you should be good. Then for three elements, as R goes to infinity, the probability tends to zero. Tends to zero in the limit as Q goes to infinity. So all of these results are basically for a large Q. Okay, so now a slightly different question. Instead of just picking some random elements and seeing if they generate, let's take a subset in G, call it A, and then we want to know what's the probability that one random element from G One random element from G invariably generates with at least one of the elements in A. And the idea is to try and choose A so that it's a small set, but the probability is large. And again, we have invariable and classical versions of this notation. So I've written down these two results in probabilistic language again, but they're not really. So Geralnik and Cantor showed that finite simple group Cantor showed that finite simple groups are three halves generated, which means that in this notation, if you take the whole group, then the probability that a random element from the group invariably generates with something else in the group is one. So that's just each element has a partner with which it generates. And then there's another result of Vernessen Harper that says that there's infinitely many finite That there's infinitely many finite simple groups such that they have a subset of size 2, which is good enough for this. So, our aim was to try and get some invariable versions of these statements. Okay, so we proved that, so G is going to be a finite simple group always. We proved that there is an element in G which Element in G which generates with a lot of things. So there is an x in g such that the probability that a random element of g invariably generates with that element x is bounded away from zero. And we also showed that the maximum size you have to take for a to get the probability to go to one is six. And that's just one case. Mostly it's four, and there's a lot of cases where it's just one. Except for some exceptions. So the exceptions are these ones listed here. So we've got a G2 in characteristic 3, and I'll show an example of why that doesn't work later. In those cases, you can never pick a set A large enough to get the probability equal to 1, because actually, even if you take the whole group, it's bounded away from. Even if you take the whole group, it's bounded away from one. Okay, and then okay, so we give for a finite group of Lie type, we give some more specific results. So we show that there's an absolute constant such that for almost all elements in the group, it's The group, it's a good element. So it invariably generates with a lot of other elements in G. So this constant C here, so we show that for almost all of the elements x, you can put them here and say that the probability of invariably generating with a random element of g is bound. Random element of g is bounded below by this thing. And then, as a corollary, we see that the probability of invariably generating by picking two random elements is bounded away from zero by something that depends on the rank. So, previously, we said that if the rank grows, then you need four elements. But if you fix But if you fix the rank and you just let q grow, then you only need two elements. So that's nice. And then that leads us to conjecture: you just have to finish for small q to show that for any finite simple group, the probability of invariably generating with four random elements is bounded away from zero as the order of the group grows. Okay, so now I'll just talk a little bit. So, now I'll just talk a little bit about some of the ideas behind the proofs. So, just like with normal generation problems or classical generation problems, you need to look at maximal subgroups. Because if you pick two elements and they're contained in the same maximal subgroup, then you know for sure they cannot generate the group. So, in the same way, we're going to think about Way we're going to think about conjugates of maximal subgroups. So we're going to take curly m of x, so x will be an element in your group, and then you will take a union over all maximal subgroups containing x, and then take the union of all of their conjugates. So this is what curly m of x is, and then you can see that one minus the probability of Of a random element of g invariably generating with something in A is just the intersection of all of the mx's for x in A. So it's the proportion of this in the whole group. So our aim is to show that this pro is to find like this probability, find an a such that that probability is large, which means that we want to find some elements x. Find some element x such that this union of conjugates of maximal subgroups, this curly m, is small. Okay, so for example, the alternating groups are really nice because they're basically already done for us. So let's just, for example, take n to be odd. Then you take x to be an n cycle and x. And X is contained in some transitive subgroups. In fact, if you take the union of all of the conjugates of maximal subgroups that contain X, you get the union of all transitive subgroups. And Wishek and Pieber already showed for us that this is of negligible size compared to the size of the group. And so you get this probability goes to zero, which means that we means that we, in this case, will have the size of A is one because just take A to be equal to your n cycle X and that should work out. So now let's think about groups of lead type and we're going to fix the rank. So I'll go through some notation, but if you want to just think about But if you want to just think about the SLN example, that's the easiest way to do it. So if x is a linear algebraic group, then we're going to let w be the vial group of x. So for example, you can take x to be sln over a field of characteristic p, and then the vile group is just the symmetric group. Then we need a Steinberg endomorphism. So for example, we take this, which is just applying the We take this, which is just applying the Frobenius to each component of the, if you see it as a set of matrices. And then you take the fixed points of the Steinberg to give you your finite group. So for example, we get SLNQ. And then your Steinberg acts on the vial group, and you can write the extended vial group like this. So for us, the Steinberg doesn't do anything, it's still SN. anything it's still SN and then we have a nice set of elements so those elements we're going to call them as a set delta and they're going to be regular semi-simple elements such that all of the maximal overgroups have maximal rank. Okay, so regular semi-simple means that it's a diagonalizable element over the algebraic closure and it's also And it's also contained in a unique maximal torus. And then overgroup of maximal rank means that that overgroup has a maximal torus in it. And so all of the elements in delta are contained in, they're going to be contained in some maximal subgroups, and in each one of those maximal subgroups, they're contained in a unique maximal torus. And it's the same torus across the board. Okay, and one of the reasons why these elements are nice is that they're almost all of the elements. So Fulman and Guralnik show that they're almost all of the elements. If you're fixing the rank and letting Q go to infinity, then they are all of the elements. Okay, so now we're going to look at just maximal tori. Because our regular semi-simple elements are just contained. Regular semi-simple elements are just contained in one maximal torus, it makes sense to concentrate on the tori. So, we're going to let curly t of x be the set of all conjugates of maximal tori which contain x and also they're of this form. So they are yeah, so they're contained in some maximal subgroup. Subgroup where that maximal subgroup is the closed, is the connected component of the fixed points of the Steinberg. Basically, these are just the nice maximal subgroups, the ones of maximal rank. And okay, so if I'm gonna briefly show this, that the theorem. Show this, but the theorem is that if you have the intersection of your curly T's for your set A is empty, then for every element of delta, which is our very big, nice set, there's some element of A which invariably generates with your element of delta. Okay, so let's say that X does not invariably generate with A. Then that means Then that means if we write X and A, it means that they share a common maximal overgroup. So they're both contained in this maximal subgroup of G. And then there's going to be, you know, A, we'll have maybe some other things, you know. And then we'll have some maximal tori contained in these things. Maybe this one doesn't have any. Have any okay, so let's say that M has these maximal tori, then X is contained in a unique. X is contained in a unique maximal torus of the group because it's regular semi-simple. And because all of its maximal overgroups have maximal rank, that means that M has maximal rank, which means that M contains the torus which is related to X. So M contains the only torus that contains X. So for example, let's say that X is in T and that's the unique maximal torus. So X is contained in this torus here. In this torus here. Okay, but because A is also contained in M and M is of this form, its maximal rank, then T is in curly T of A. So it tells you that, okay, so if X is in T and the group invariably generated by X and A is generated by x and a is not g, then t is contained in the set of curly t of a. And so if x doesn't invariably generate with anything, then there's something in the intersection. Okay, so that gives us the theorem. So what it means is that we only need to know about the maximal tori, which The maximal tori, which are nice. So currently, we need to know about elements which are nice and maximal tori, which are nice. And that's good because for the most part, those nice maximal tori, there's just lists of them. So all we have to do is just go through and check all of our cases. So for example, in the nicest case, so this happens for quite a few of the groups. For quite a few of the groups. If you take, for example, G is E8, then there is a maximal torus which is cyclic and it only has one maximal overgroup. And so all you have to do is pick one element which is in that maximal torus and one element outside of it. And then they will invariably generate. Okay, so I just want to briefly say how we can think about the maximal tori, because there's a nice bijection between the vile group and the maximal tori, which is going to be useful. Okay, so conjugacy classes of sigma-stable maximal tori in our infinite group X correspond in a natural one-to-one bijection with With W conjugacy classes in the coset of sigma w in the extended file group. So if we're thinking about SLN, then really here we just have SN and here we have maximal torus and SLN. And we're just going to write T sub W for the maximal torus, which is related to the conjugacy class. Taurus, which is related to the conjugacy class sigma w. In our case, if we're looking at just Sn, we don't need to worry about what sigma is because it doesn't do anything. And we're also, we're going to write T sub w for both the infinite one and then the fixed points, which is going to be a maximal torus in the finite group. Okay, so the G2 was our example where it's different from. Was our example where it's different for a characteristic 3. So if you take G2 of Q, it has value group D6, which has six contributed classes. So that's really nice. You can just list the six maximal tori. And there's two tori, which contain about half of the elements in the group. And if Q is not divisible by three, then we can pick two elements such that one of the elements, curly T, will be T will be tori 1, 3, and 5, and the other element will have tori 2, 4, and 6. And then we have two elements, so when you intersect the curly T's, you get an empty set, which tells us that our A, so in this case, A is just going to be x1 and x2. The problem is that in characteristic 3, there's Is that in characteristic three, there's an extra graph automorphism and it conjugates T1 to T2, which breaks this argument completely. And so that's the reason for G2 and characteristic 3 being an exception for us. All right, so now, how about classical groups? SLN is the nicest one. The vowel group is SN. Now let's take Now let's take A to be a regular semi-simple element, which is related to an n minus one cycle and then a fixed point. In that case, then our curly T is just one conjugacy class. And so all we have to do is find an element that's outside of that conjugacy class of maximal tori. So for example, if you take some regular semi-set. Some regular semi-simple element in TN. So this is the torus relating to the n cycle. Then its overgroups do not fix any one spaces, and so the intersection is nothing. And so in this case, we have again an A of size 2. So basically, we're saying that every element we're saying that every element in delta will invariably generate with either a or a prime and that's almost all elements okay so how about for a large rank so let's fix q and again let's look at sl n where n is an odd number then uh geralnik and cantor give an element Geraldic and cantor give an element such that the curly m of that element is the union of all groups that fix an m space and an m plus one space. And this is nice and easy to work with because Fulman and Guralnik showed for us that the proportion of elements that fix a k-space is at most some constant times one over k to some constant power, positive power. And so power and so if you take because here we're taking m goes to infinity we're and we know that our curly m of a is the union of groups that fix an m space and then m plus one space which both go to infinity then here we just get zero okay so in this case oh I've used a for a constant but a is I've used a for a constant, but a is also my set. So for my set A, it was just going to be one element. Okay, so here we just have A of size one. And then finally, I'll do another example that goes wrong. So this was one of the ones where you can't get a set A such that the probability goes to one. So, if you take G to be the symplectic group in even characteristic, and you fix Q and you let the rank go to infinity, then, okay, let R plus be the union of all stabilizers of hyperplanes of plus type, and R minus is going to be the union of all stabilizers of hyperplanes of minus type. Then, every element is one or the other. Is one or the other. So every element stabilizes either a hyperplane of plus type or minus type. And in fact, there are also a positive proportion of elements which stabilize both. So this is the proportion. So if we're fixing q, then this is a constant. And so the probability that an element fixes both is going to be, well, it's going to be. Well, it's going to be greater than this. And if we take one of those elements, it can't invariably generate with anything because it's contained in the same stabilizer up to conjugation as every other element. So in this case, we actually have an explicit bound for the probability, and it's bounded away from one. All right, so that's all I wanted to talk about. Thank you for listening. All I wanted to talk about. Thank you for listening, and I'll take any questions. All right, thanks for your talk, Ellie. And I think if somebody has a question, maybe just, well, okay, I mean, I see hands now, so maybe I'll just ask Alexei a little bit to ask first. That wasn't actually a question, that was just me clapping, saying thank you. Oops, it was muted. If anybody has a question, please just speak up. If not, then maybe I'm going to ask one thing. So, in the beginning, you had this result about boundedness away from zero. You were saying that you get this result with four elements, but only when Q is large enough. Yeah. I just wanted to ask what the problem with small Q is. So, do you need your field to have sufficiently many elements or something? So, the problem with Something? So the problem with small q is that, well, if q is large, then you can assume that some random element is regular semi-simple. But if q is small, you can't do that anymore. So you don't have the nice properties. And so you would need to have some other way of thinking about it. Because the way that I approve this thing is by this relationship between Tauri and the... This relationship between Tori and the vile group, and so if you don't have that anymore, then it breaks. Thanks. Okay, so if there are no more questions, then well, let's thank Ailey again. And I suppose we. Um, I suppose we will break of 25 minutes, so until what should be 9:30 in Bath, um, until the talk of Eden Thomas. So, see you then.
