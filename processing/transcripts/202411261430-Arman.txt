Movement symmetry and some graph theory in this geometric problem. You'll tell me later if I succeeded or not. So, uh I'll start with this definition. I work in high-dimensional geometry now, whatever that means, but there are a lot of discrete mass type of problems. So, one of such problems is this Kali-type problem. You have a ball defined by this BXR, and you take intersecting family of balls. So, it may have Family of bolts. So it may have a few of them drawn, but the only condition is that I want them all to intersect. They may touch, they're closed balls. Touching is having an empty intersection. I want them just pairwise to have some intersections. Maybe this is my picture. Every two of them have an empty intersection. And I am interested in the cover number or a piercing number. I want to know how many points I need. Points I need in order to cover all points. So, in this case, two points would be a graph. And this estimates, the number of points that I need to cover in this family will depend on the dimension. So, if I have a planar pictures, then it would be called G2. If I have 3D, G3GM would be n-dimensional. I'm interested in the worst case scenario. The worst case scenario, of course. So I'm taking the supreme, which are, of course, maximum proportions. So where did this start? According to Toth, so let's unravel this. I don't read German, so I trust Echo that Toth claims that this is a question due to the line. And you heard it from me, right? So this is continuous. From here, right? So this is continued. But that problem is pretty old. And Galai was interested in what is the value of G2. And if you want to play with it, you can probably show that G2 is equal to 4. And the challenge is that the proof of Donzer has 11 circles. They are all, some of them are of different radii. The most, the easiest one, construction. The easiest one construction that I know that I can verify quite quick has 21 circles. So this already becomes a bit ridiculous in the plane if you want to do it by hands. And the upper bound of four is also quite complex. Then Banzer and Reckhall, they provide this bound. So the quantity grows exponentially. And sometimes, yeah, what do you do if the quantity grows exponentially? It grows exponentially, your bounds don't coincide, so you try to squish them closer. Alright, so what do I need to show you how to squish those around? I need some more notations in high-dimensional geometry, so this is a cap. So, first of all, Sn minus 1 will always denote a sphere in n dimensions of radius 1. And then on a sphere, I can take a cap. So, how do I construct? A cap. So, how do I construct a cap? I take a point x on the sphere and I take all points within the angle phi. And I use theta here, which is a title. So the angle should be phi, and here the angle should be phi. You can write it in terms of dog product, obviously. Well, maybe not obviously, but this is how you would define the angle in high dimensions. So we have the Cxphi. This is your cap. Now, if you were. Your cap. Now, a few more things that you or I will need about these caps is that if I have a measure on Sn minus 1 and I have a probabilistic measure, or you can just say normalized, so they can just restrict from n dimensions, and I want to measure the area of that gap, the area behaves like a sine of phi to the power n times the lower order terms. And this is And this is as many things in geometry, especially when you raise a dimension, your behavior changes. So if you try to reply this formula for dimension 2 and 3, it fails dramatically. Everything is hidden in this theta. But then as n grows, it stabilizes. And then all of the caps, so if you have a sphere, you have a cap on a sphere, you can rotate that cap to the center of the dozen. Rotate that cap to be central. It does have points, so it makes sense to just have mu of phi to be a measure of any such cap, probability. And now, what I need, I need cap cover number. So there should be a joke here. It's not a cop cover number, it's not that type of story. But there is no jokes in the story. So cap cover number is minimum number of caps of given angle that I need to cover entire sphere. Angle that I need to cover entire sphere. So I have one cap, I can move it around, cover another piece, and so on. And the surprisingly good news, which doesn't happen often in high dimensions, is that if I want to cover entire sphere with caps of angle phi, I need at least one over mu of phi, just volume estimates. Each cap takes mu of phi space, so I need at least that many, and I can do it. And I can do it with not that much of excess. And the Zen log n excess in knowing that mu phi grows exponentially is it's very, you can cover in high dimensions quite efficient. So I think that's all I need for now. Well, I will throw in more preliminary. So let's obtain a bound by Ackhov or by That related this cover number with your original problem. So, the original problem was: I have a lot of balls, they pairwise intersect, I want to pierce them. So, this is related to a cover number where I can always pierce those balls by this 1 plus the cover number of 5 by 6 caps. And if you remember the formula for this mu, it was a sign. This mu, it was a sine, and sine of pi by six would be one half when you flip it, it's two. So this is a dual square. So that's your first bound. And here is the proof. So you first start with your poles. The fact that they are intersecting can be rewritten in this nice formula, that the distance between centers does not exceed the sum of radii. I can rescale everything, do it right. Rescale everything, do it translate, assume that my first pole is centered at zero, the poles have increasing radii, and the smallest radii is one over xp. And then I will show you a picture, because this is a geometric talk, and this would be illegal to not show the picture. So the picture is now something like this. I have my smallest ball of radius 1 over root 3, and I have other balls. Those other balls, they should. Balls. Those other balls, they should intersect my smallest balls, so the smallest they can be is when they are touching. If I'm fixing them, they're touching. So now I will construct my smallest ball a sphere. So this was 1 over root 3, I construct a sphere of radius 1. And I see how those other balls intersect the sphere. And what I've depicted here in the middle. I've depicted here in the middle is a cap on this blue sphere with an angle pi plus 6. So you can see that that other ball, if it's positioned like this, contains a cap of angle pi plus 6, intersection with this imaginary ball sphere. And now I will do the demonstration. If you move it around, you see that your intersection grows, then it shrinks a bit. A bit as I get closer to my initial ball, I know that the central ball is the smallest, so the radius of this ball should be at least as large. So I can still move it a bit until I reach here. And here is the boundary of my original ball. So as soon as I reach the boundary of my original ball, now my O center of coordinates would be a piercing point. Of coordinates would be a piercing point for that. So, there is this dichotomy. Either my ball is far away so that the intersection of that ball with the unit sphere gives me at least pi by six cap, or my ball is close enough to my smallest ball so that origin of coordinates pierces that ball. And you use the bottom. So, the entire proof, well, you choose your Well, you choose your balls that are close to the center, then the center pierces those balls. And if the balls are far from the center, then a cap, a certain cap of high raised pi by six, will be inside of my balls. So now I'm not piercing the balls, I am in dimension one lower and I'm piercing caps. So if I want to pierce caps of high base pi by six, how can I do it? How can I do it? I will cover the entire sphere with caps of radius pi by six. And then, because it's a covering, for any point that is far away, I can find a center of the cap that contains that point. And this relation is symmetric. If this point is inside of that cap, Point is inside of that cap, then y is inside of this cap. That means y pierces that ball. So I cover the entire sphere with this 5 by 6 caps. Centers of the covering will be my piercing set together will be here. This is entire trick. This is a beautiful relation between covering and piercing in this geometric code. You can shift your perspective. Okay, we had a picture, we had a proof. And then you should ask yourself: well, it's a talk about combinatorial geometry. And if it's a talk about combinatorial geometry, there are only two problems, essentially. There is a chromatic number of the plane, and there is a Borsk problem, so obviously it should be related to one of the two. So, how is this problem related to Borsk? To Vorsev. So, Vorso problem, yeah, it should be like a shift here. It's a different problem. Vorse problem is following. I have any body in dimension Rn, and a body that's a closed, convex, compact, and two of them imply the third. And it has a finite diameter, and I want to cover my body of finite diameter with bodies of smaller diameter. With bodies of smaller diameter. So I have some body, I want to chop it, and it decreases the diameter. So in this case, diameter is achieved at three points, so I need to chop it in at least three pieces. You can talk about this as partitioning or as about colour. It doesn't matter that much. So the Porsuk number of the space is a guaranteed amount of pieces that I could chop anyway in that space. And the problem was. And the problem was, so for example, for this triangle, I can cover it with balls. Because the problem is about the balls, I don't cover it with balls. So you can convince yourself that it's possible, and the radius of these poles would be, or the diameter of each ball is less than the side of the triangle. So Borisuk famously conjectured that the Borsuk number should be n plus one. The Porsche number should be n plus 1. So, in dimension 2, I can cover it with three balls. So, I would expect to have. And there is this triangle, so that would be an example. He proved that for a sphere, you need n plus 1, and this is equivalent version of Borstlot-Ulam theorem. So, you can derive your continuous function type of result from there. So, he conjectured that Al-Pozzani was right. Possibly was right, and it was disproved. And the way it was disproved was using the estimates on independence number in a graph that is derived from certain L-intersecting factor. And I'm not talking about it because it would be too easy in a conference like this. But the construction is fairly in the flavor of intersecting animal and limited animal. And limited animals, actually. Right, so we have this exponential in Ruthen growth for the lower bounds and exponential for the upper bounds. And then the upper bounds are obtained in two different ways, by Schröming and organostraus. So organic inerts would be the approach that I care about, and this is based on the fact that I can just restrict myself. If I need to cover my Myself. If I need to cover my body of size of diameter B by some other sets of smaller diameter, I can choose my sets of smaller diameter to be both. Because balls are easy, they're easy to analyze. And this approach, this version or variation of Pulse problem, is called, of course, Grimbauer problem because there was also a working in class. So they attributed it to another person. And this is quite common, as you can notice. So the problem is that I have a body of diameter D, and I want to cover that body with balls, and I will choose the same diameter. So I have the original body of diameter D, I'm covering it with balls of the same diameter D, and I want to know how many balls I have. And that number would be G of N. And this is a green bound number. Number and Burg and Linderstraus improved the existing bounds, which were like this, into this bounds. And now, how it's related to Borsuk? Well, if I can cover every body of diameter D with geofn balls of diameter D, I can take every ball and chop it into n plus 1 smaller balls. So this gives me the same diameter as the original set. Diameter is original set, and then x term plus one term is every ball of diameter d. I decrease the diameter of that itself. So I cover it by smaller balls. And in terms of the zero, three halves, it doesn't matter. The near terms here are eaten. So that's the Borgen in the Schrausen Warsuk problem. It's the problem that says if I have a diameter, how many balls I need to cover the set of that diameter. I need to cover the set of that diameter. So, why is it related to the problem? So, the relation is pretty simple. There is an official proof. But if I have the balls that are pairwise intersecting, I can do discretization. I can say, well, let's. I can say, well, let's consider only both that have almost the same radius. If they have almost the same radius, I have intersecting both of say, let's assume they have the same radius. If I take the centers of those poles, they will form a set. The centers of those poles form a set X. Diameter of this set would be a close to R because they are interested. Because they're intercepting. So if I have this set of diameters, it has diameter 2R, I can cover this set by this Warsaw conversion with balls of the same diameter. So there are balls of radius, the same radius, sorry, this is a ball of radius R. There are balls of radius R, the blue balls, and there are at most. Globals, there are atmos geofns I shouldmost geofn B, Y R that cover X. And you can use a symmetry. If the ball covers a center, that means the center of blue ball pierces the red ball. So covering corresponds to piercing. And everything else is discrete. And everything else is discretization. So you need to choose your parameters correctly. You take a family of balls, you split it into groups according to the radii. So in each of the groups, the radius is almost the same. The quantity is not that large. And the largest group, you deal in the same manner as the original 2 to Zan bound. You look at how the large balls in the group. How the large balls intersect. So, this corresponds to sphere of radius 2, and you show that large this balls of radius at least 10 intersects spheres of radius 2 in the cap with at least 5 by 3. So, here's a combination of covering result and Bohrson. And it works, you write your estimates, you estimate how many intervals you have, and your number t here is like m log n. n log n so you get something like twice n square log n g of so this is our first observation how we improved the upper bound we combined existing result with the problem is that it's related to wars and mainly we did it because we worked for warsack problem for the last two years per so With Borset variation, we also improve the lower bound, and this immediately gives you the matching lower bound for intersecting blocks. So if I have, or a broad set version, if I have a collection, so how did we improve this lower bound? We provide a definite collection of points that has diameter at most root of three that cannot be covered by less than. That cannot be covered by less than this amount of balls. So, if I already have this finite collection, well, I will use this finite collection at centers of my intersecting balls. And the radius would be root 3 over 2. So, the fact that the diameter of my centers is less or equal to root 3 means that those balls intersect. And again, the symmetric condition: if I have a point that pierces any of the balls, then that Any of the poles, and that point, that that center of the pole would be in the ball center, at the point y. So that means for every such y will be covering a portion of x. And I need at least that many those y's to cover entire x. So, uh long story short, there are not many problems in Not many problems when you consider high dimensions. This problem of intercepting balls is reduced in some sense to the problem of the Grimbaum problem of estimating how many balls I need to cover a set of diameter D. Both quantities grow exponentially. I know this is a very bad discrepancy in notation. Please forgive me. But both grow exponentially and lower order terms are manageable. Terms are manageable. So I still have quite a bit of time, right? Yes. Alright. Can you specify how much is quite? Okay. Thank you. So what did I have? I had some movement with a picture. Let's do some graph theory. So I want to talk about now this. I want to talk about now this Worster variable. So I just recall g of x is minimal number of balls of diameter x needed to cover x. And I will talk about the construction that we have for 2 over root 3 to the power x. You may notice that because of these caps, they behave like sine, 2 over root 3 should dictate, you will be working in by 3 angles. But what is the main What is the main tool to prove such a theorem? The main tool is this lemma. So, let me try and explain what this lemma says. So, this lemma says that if I have this angle phi, I can find a collection of points on a sphere, and this collection is x. So maybe I have a point x1, somewhere here a point x2, x3. x2, x3, and then xn. I can construct collection with many points, with as many points, that has the following two properties. The first property is that if I take any two points, their angle is between phi and pi minus phi. So one of them is remnant of like the other application, which we'll not need, but this upper. Which we will not need, but this upper bound allows me to estimate the diameter. If I know that all angles do not exceed pi minus phi, I know I can now bound the diameter of this set. It will be less than 2. So I need this to bound the diameter. And the second part tells me that if I want now to cover this set with caps. Of diameter 5, entire set. Each such set will not contain many of my points of x. So I have exponentially many points in my set x, and each cap of angle phi will not contain many points. So that means I will need many caps to cover the set, and that is how we translate it into G. How you translate it into G. So the overall proof would be something like this. You apply this lemma with the angle pi by 3. You get this collection of points on the sphere. This condition A will give you that diameter does not exceed root 3. And then assume I have my set X and I want to cover it by balls of diameter root 3. Any ball of diameter root 3. Any ball of diameter 3 will intersect a unit sphere in a certain cap. And you can again lose some movement to convince yourself that the radius of such cap would be at most 5 by 3. So if I want now to kill my set x with balls, I will see how those balls intersect my sphere. The sphere will the cap would be at most radius pi by 3, and condition t tells me how many points I can kill with such a phone. Can kill with such a ball, and you just take and divide this number by the number of points killed by every ball to get an estimate of the number of points. So not graph theory. So where is graph theory? It's hidden in the pool, over here. So this is my favorite graph theoretical model for the last year. Of course, after GFP, that's without discussion, but Without discussion, but how would you prove such a result? Well, you start with some amount of points and you take your points uniformly at random on a sphere. You drop random points on a sphere. And then you want to satisfy these two conditions. So, good news is that the second condition is satisfied or was satisfied. Or was satisfied before us. And this is a. So, this condition tells me that no matter what green cap I take, I should not have many random points in there. So, if I fix my cap, the amount of random points that hits there would be like a binomial. It will behave with a binomial distribution. And you have concentration inequalities. The only caveat is that the amount of events is continuing. So you deal with it by discretizing. So you deal with it by discretizing. You do discretization plus Chernoch, that's a normal person approach. So that takes care of B. And now for A, you consider the following probability. So I have one vertex, x1, and I want to see what is the probability that a pair, say, xi and xj fails. So maybe this is one of my x1, this is my xi. xi. So probability that xi xj fails means that xj either is in this phi cap, it's either too close to my xi, or it's too far. And measure of each such caps is just mu of phi. They're disjoint. So probability that a pair fails will be twice mu of t. That gives me this random graph, because now Random graph because now I take all pairs that fail. So if the point is too close, maybe I take a point here. If the point is too close, I join it with an edge. If it's far, that's fine. So I have this graph where points are connected when they are either too close or they are too far. And well, you do your normal things. And well, you do your normal things. You calculate the average degree. So take number of vertices, multiply, like, yeah, average degrees, number of vertices divided by number of vertices. So you get A timel again. And then you use estimates on independent state. Because this collection of points satisfies B. Satisfies B, but doesn't satisfy A. So, in order to satisfy A, I am only taking a certain independent set in this graph. And the bounds on independent set are obtained by number of vertices over degrees. That's a lazy bound. So, if you plug everything together, you will understand why I don't have this number appearing there. I have a number of vertices divided by the degree that appears to be my final answer. And again, I'm hand-validing. And again, I'm hand-waving there is concentration. Well, there is not a series concentration, I'm only using Markov here, but this is the result. So that's... You can stop here. If you want to improve this, I don't know how to improve the exponent, but I can do slightly better in the numerator. And by slightly better, I mean logarithms, which is not that impressive. Which is not that impressive. And for that, you need to do a lot. You need to count the number of triangles in this graph. The number of triangles. That's about right. The number of triangles is much less than the number of points that I have. I can kill every triangle by hand, by removing edges. And now I am triangle 3. And for triangle 3, there is a better estimate, an independence number. And get this extra look. There was this paper by Marcelo Lejandos where they did, and co-optus, many, many co-optus, where they considered the independent number of a graph given its degree and the codegree. They were able to improve the bounding, another geometric problem of packing. But it's not, I don't think you can push much further than most. But yeah, as Borset problem is open, variations of Borset problem, they have estimates that are different. I don't know how, so in terms of this estimate, which was somewhere here, this can be tightened. I believe they are different, but I'm not sure. They're different, but I'm not. Let's put it this way. I know they're different when n is equal to 2, so the ratio is not 1. I'm not sure if it's true in n equal to 3. So that's basically that should be right, but yeah. That's all. Thank you. Any questions for Andre?
