Many greetings, many happy returns. So, as usual. So, what I am going to talk is a joint work moment. Joint work with Varysk Konyansky and Nikolai Vavilov. And also, we are very thankful to Inna Kapitobovsk. She was, you know, on the early stage, she gave some glimpse, some point. Some wins, some pointers, and we are really grateful to her for the assistance. So I will start with motivation because it was, at least for me, very unusual thing that motivation came from different sides, absolutely. So the first side is all problem. So So, is it true that the commutator width of a finite simple group is one? It's a very well-known problem, very well-known answer, positive answer. For K, just for to remind, but for K is big enough. Big enough means eight. In this case, Ellison Gargev, they established this fact. They solved positively the aura countries. Can you remind what comutator reads? I will. I will. In this case, it's one. Okay. So it was... I think the question was what is... What does communator with one mean? Okay, we'll get to the original. Anyway, I should. Anyway, I should emphasize that there was some beautiful approach which is called prescribed Gauss decomposition, which gets us to the clever calculation of NGC classes, and we are getting the answer that any element of a fine simple group is a single commutator. But small field, it was a bit of mess, big trouble. big trouble. And finally, Lippet, Obrah and Shalev and Tiep, they established the same fact that any element is a single computer. They use the full force of character theory and even computer calculation, blah, blah, blah. And anyway, finally, we know that any element of any simple group is a single commuter. However, the question of Further, the question was what happens if our group is not finite. So, is it true that there exists fine-generated simple groups of infinite commutative roots? So, the answer is yes. So, as usual for big groups, we can realize all pathologies which we can imagine. And this is not the exception. So, the construction. So the construction due to Muranov was small, typical small constellation construction, which means that we are constructing groups by generators and relators in a very fancy way. And this is typically the benside type construction, which was elaborated by Lakshansky. And I think Puramoranoviski was his student, he managed to construct such a group. Oops. But even worse, or maybe even better, so there is this finitely presental simple group of finite commutator with. And this group, finally presented group to construct via birth-type approach is a big, big problem. It does not look consistent to it's it's open problem how to construct finitely presented groups in that case. But In that case. But suddenly or not suddenly, it's the comparisons which you are constructed and noticed. But if we take a catsumundi group, catsumoidi group, indeterminate, general catsumoidi group of a finite fields, and if our finite fields satisfy some it's big enough, then this group is finitely presented and moreover the commutator wisdom of this group is in The intervention of this group is easy. So it's not a surprise that Bertha theory, after the works of Mirshov, for example, that Bertha theory and Katz-Moody Brug come together to produce counterexamples. But anyway, the fact is that we can construct such a group. So it was interesting to know what happens when the F cuts. Know what happens with the eight cats Moody groups. So, what is the commutator width of eight cats moody groups? Of course, the prediction was that it should be finite because the combined width of the Chevrolet groups and of a Laurent Polyn of a ring of a coefficients of the finite field. So, it could be treatable and it's. Be treatable and it's a framework. This group is very close for the general case of cats moving affin groups. Just we need to beat the finite extension, central extension. And in this case, the feeling was that it should be fine. But we didn't know how fine it is. Okay, this was the one source. Another source comes from source comes from logic. So at the last three years appeared a bunch of papers which are devoted to the logic of menial groups. So Alex at Nier and Hen, they produced the first paper about so-called first-order rigidity and then immediately at the same time several papers have been At the same time, several papers have been published. So, the paper I'm referring to is the paper by Siegel and Tert. So, that would he should make some comments. Let GVR be a Chevrolet group of rank big enough, means bigger or equal to two, and R, the ring covering is an integral domain. Then R and G V R are being interpretable provided there are two conditions. Provided there are two conditions. Either the group is adjoint or it has finite elementary width. And we have heard a lot of applications of finite width on this conference. But one of them wishes was not eliminated. But everybody, I think, now are aware about that it That it makes many, many very essential consequences for model theory. Here, I should say a few words about the word by interpretable. I don't want as usual to define this notion in full strength. By the way, in the paper of Yerav Nikhan Miri, there is a very, very heat of definition with all peculiarities about this. Peculiarities about this, but for the plain words means that these two structures are and GPR. Structures means with the first order language and language includes, of course, the operations. These structures have the same logic. In fact, what you can prove here, you can imitate here, and vice versa. In other words, if you look at the show Look at the Chevalier de Mazu Funter, which gives us Chevalier. It functor is clever enough to keep the logic. And immediately, if you think what is written here, that R is a ring, and if it's a ring, will be. And if its ring will be good enough, it's arithmetic case, for example, then this ring is interpretable with that. This is very well-known theory. That in fact, this is, we can continue this interpretation from the ring between R and G phi R to Z. But as if you know, the logic of Z is pretty well known. And we in the area of so-called region. Area of so-called rich groups, which is elaborated by Raoukovich Nikov. We know everything about the logic of such groups, and it's not so easy. For example, in the 80s, it was a paper by Zilber, where he studied the logic of such groups of the algebraically closed field. And it was, you know, a breakthrough. A breakthrough. And now we have a very, very, you know, general case. What the second, which makes sense here, that contrary to the arithmetic lattices, arithmetic lattices, this group are more cooperative, of course. Split case, more cooperative. So in arithmetic case, there are beautiful results by By Alex and here and here. But here there is a hope. There is a hope to get better, to get some results for general community freedoms. So the group is first is much, not much, the group is more cooperative, which means that there is a hope to get results for arbitrary community feelings. I want to stress that yesterday To stress that yesterday in the talk of Hen Mary, he referred to the theorem of Andreas Leon, which is a very beautiful theorem about SL2Ks, SLNKs, but it is a theorem for general community ring, not for arithmetic reading. So there is a hope. So the idea which is behind Which is behind the relation that we can suppress a joint, we can suppress here some integral domain, and we need to study the behavior of some elementary or some other width of this group. So it was the second perturbation to think about. And in their case, they of course referred to the elementary, to the arithmetic case, they decided arithmetic. Arithmetic case, dedicate arithmetic rates, and there we have about the generation, and that's it. So we fall to the frames of this theorem. But our question was how it looks in the function case. What's going on for polynomials? So this was the beginning of whole business. And the question is the commutator weight of Chevrolet also the... And Laurent polynomials fine. So the prediction is, of course, that it should be finite. But... Yes, you mean in the first case that the rank is at least two. Yeah. Yeah, it's not written here. But what about if you localize, then you can expect even for one corner there? But it has let me see. Let me see. In the second case, or in the first, in the second case, rank one works. That's all. But, okay. So let me remind briefly the notation, Phi is a GS3 system, R is a commutative ring, GPR show group. There is a split-maximal torus. The elementary unipatron. Elementary unipotence x alpha psi, three oxi with respect to the storus, and if you are is an elementary subgroup generated by elementary unipotence. Now let G be a group and is be a set of generators, as usual symmetric one. Then we dis define the length of an element of an arbitrary length. Of an arbitrary element of G with respect to this set X is a minimum of K such that we have such presentation. And the width with respect to the set of generators X is just supremum of all lengths of elements. So we say that group is bounded to generation, has bounded generation with respect to X if the width is five. Now, the question is how to choose. The question is how to choose the set of generators. So in our case, in our case, we dwell on two variations. First of all, the set of generators are all elementary unipotents. And also, we can take the set of commutators, x, y. So x from g, we can take one from g. Take one from G, another from Y. So there is a classical theorem by Sociolin Kapika today that if rank is big enough, then indeed we have such an application C inside the EVR and they generate the elementary subgroup. So we have two generators. Now We use with notation the elementary width with W omega omega set of generators. We always look in the elementary subgroup. Not to think if the elementary subgroup coincides with the whole group, like it's in Euclidean case, it's the same. So, and we can also think that it's the same. uh think that is the smallest number R L such that E V L is just a product of L of E L times so this is the means that we consider the set of commutators like a generated set and this is the width of the respect of set of commutators. So commutator width So, commutator with this exactly what I mentioned in the beginning in the talk, and this means that if you take a finite simple group, the commutator width is one. Okay, what's known about that? I think it's worth to remind. First, if you have small-dimensional rings, fields, then we have a periodic composition. And periodical composition immediately. And periodical position immediately implies such an estimate. n is the number of positive roots. Unfortunately, if we have periodical position, our ring is a field, so we cannot go further using periodical position. By the way, the commutator width or depe or the width depends depends on the group, so On the group, so for example for a joint group it's one, it's all a problem, for simply connected group it's uh less than two. But when we were talking about the width, Paul is considering the biggest the biggest case means which means the group is simply connected. We've got the intermediate course. No, no No, no intermediate f forms, uh the length will be uh less than the separate connect. Okay, fancy uh notice that if we take a local ring, the estimate is the same. The semi-local ring is a bit And the method is so-called Gauss decomposition. So we have Gauss decomposition, just Gauss elimination process which is implemented for chevalier groups. And we have diagonal matrix, upper triangular matrix, lower triangle syndrome and upper triangular matrix. This is a kind of one of girls' decompositions and Nikolai Povilov And Nikolai Povilov and his students, they probably studied completely the case of lower dimension. And well, let me say. In fact, this is epsilon rings which are treatable from this point of view are stable rank one rings or epsilon stable rank one rings, the condition of bus and others. and others. This is interesting result that the for what is the more precise, the commutator width for different root systems. This is the result of Andrey Svalensky, former student of Akniro Valvilov, and he constructed, he estimated, in fact, Estimated, in fact, can be data with for any system, and the estimates are sharp. Apart from the case of E6, which is not the best one, I guess. It can be better for one, maybe four. So it was done using the methods of, by the way, of idea of erectarine, I mean the reduction to the rectangle. The reduction to the rank two cases, and then it works. Now, what's going on with the functional case? There are good news and bad news. Bad news, first of all, that even a cell can have infinite elementary width. Elementary width. This is the result of undercalling, and it has, in fact, some ideas of ultra products, some ideas of logic behind the proof. Anyhow, if we take the SLN3 or SL3 or the ring of polynomials C2 C O T then it has infinite elementary width. Then Dennis and Osashtain promoted the same for community interrogates. So it was not so long ago, but it was long ago, and further on, Stepanov and Pavilov showed that if you have a finite commutator width, we have a finite elementary width, and vice versa. The result, which in fact relies on the arbitrary consideration, Arbitrary consideration with an arbitrary ring. So we see that boundary generation is a rare phenomenon. And in fact, boundary generation is an arithmetic question, of course. Can I just go back to that last slide? Can I just ask a question? So that's just for SLM though, right? Not for other Chevrolet groups, the equivalents of the two? Yeah, it's not it's for Chevrolet groups. Yeah, it's SLM. Arbitrarily. Why is it split? Oh. Why the spots as well? Yeah, that's an interesting deep fact, and it's valid to that to the separate talk once upon a time by Vavilov. But it was very, very close to the ideas that yesterday we have heard about localization process and how it works. If it's locally, fine, it's globally fine, and so on. So, what was said by Nir and Hen yesterday. Yesterday. And I think, I think these are the explicit formulas which give the passage from one to another. But I think the essence is like that, that localization works in this case. Special kind. Well, this is a skip everybody knows here, so it's a really So, what is known for number case? For number case, Carter Keller published two papers, very beautiful papers, where they proved that epsilon R and is bigger than 3 are bound to generate. R is first it was a Z, just Z, then it was a delegate ring of arithmetic type. And just to notice that it was. Just to notice that it was also the paper by Maniki Adia, where they used the similar ideas, absolutely. Or just something different, but estimate is different. So the paper of Mendika Dianes was made in a couple of years afterwards. Then Aleft Tauke in 1990 did the same for Chevrolet Groups. Of random bigger than two. So, and this is what's a beautiful paper, covers all variants of Chevrolet groups, listed chevalier groups, and there were some ideas, and as I understand, Andre evolved in this project, and somehow. Somehow discussed with Tau Gin. So it's a pleasure to remind this beautiful paper today. So and finally, Carter Keller Page in 1985 published some preprint about the model theoretic approach and then was eliminated and explained afterwards by Dale Morris and he explained what was behind the. Explained what was behind the ideas of this paper. But frankly, when I was, it was many years ago, I just saw once this preparant. It was never published, as many of us know. And thanks to Daniel Morris, we know what was the ideas, and very productive ideas of Moore-theoretic group. Okay, if we have SL2 case, then we are purely inside the purely arithmetic matters. And the first was the paper by Hook and Weinberger, where they get extran vowels using the general theorem of the importance, which was mentioned yesterday. I didn't see this paper really. Really so the balance is beautiful, but I don't know the proof. So, and finally, Morgan Rapinchuk and Suri in the agenda paper has managed to obtain the bound 9, which is critical close to the best one, but it can be improved if we have some additional conditions on the ring. On a ring, and it can be eight in the paper of Jordan and Zeitman. So I don't know if it's seven, it's Morgan claimed that he has an argument, but the problem is that Morgan quit mathematics. Yeah, Morgan quit mathematics. It was an argument why. David has his manuscript. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So Morgan made it seven of all this. Anyway. Well it's it's it really not so important, but it's it's it's beautiful. I don't know. Okay. Then what we can say about function case, we consider these groups and there are some specific. It's not so different from the number case, but there is some specific things. Some specific things. For example, these groups are not finitely generated for SL2 or the polynomials. And if we go SL3, all the polynomials even not are finitely generated but not finitely presented. So there is some exclusivity of the function case. So it was the only It was the only one paper by Queen where he studies the special conditions and thank God to the Lorentz polynomials under these conditions. That gives us the great estimate that the elementary width of the Chevalier group, in fact, and not Chevalier, I say two in this case, is less. Is less than five. Oh, it's five. It can be less. Occasionally, it's five. So here Boris can explain better the whole procedure why these conditions are essential, but let me mention that in Fashion case, Riemann hypothesis is proven. So, in this sense, it isn't good news. So, we are balanced between So we got a balance between different things. And finally, to lost not finally, NICA in 2018 root bounded implemented generation for SMA. It's also the, you know, the ideas go back to Basmil-Marcer, to the famous paper by Basmil-Marcer, but here Basmi and Marcel, but he used them in a very clever way to get the better pound. And finally, in the recent years, Alexander Trost has managed, using the approach of molecules theory, which was mentioned, has managed to obtain bound. But this bound is a logical bound, depends not only on the root system, but depends on other. But depends on other parameters. Okay, so this theorem. So we have the theorem theorem that if we take a group, Chevrolet group of the polynomials, coefficients in the finite field, then the elementary width is finite. So the So this result, in fact, relies on reductions. So we need to know what's going on in small dimensions of root systems. So in fact, the root system for Frank II is the main objective. And I will say a few words about that. So, and since the So, and since uh the the most difficult case is simple is symplectic case, and symplectic case is really a challenge, as it was seen from the Bas Milner service. You know, it's fantastic ideas of Bas Milner, how to beat this. And we obtained this bound for SP4 FQT 7 general. And it's far from being sharp, of course, but it is a good one. Course, but it is a good one. So, but there is another idea to reduce everything to the rank 3 case. And then 3 case we need to the bounds for rank 3 case. They are better than for rank 2 case. So if we reduce everything to rank 3 case, then we. into rank three case, then we have such a bounds for orthogonal and seplectic cases. So I want to say a few words, just a few words about the ideas of the proof. So the idea of the proof always like that. We have five rank systems, some rank system. Then we want to make elementary calculations. So to make elementary calculations, which takes this group to elemental this group, G to the one. So, and the first thing which goes to the line is so-called K1 reduction. This is K1 factor in this case is defined as EVR model. But if you are modeled and there is a so-called stability. There is a so-called stability, that if we have delta the embedded L Road system, we have a according to bus the thermomorphism of g one factors and keep the question with it. The question with it subjective or injective, in our case, we have to go with this quantum injective, subjective and equitable subjective, which means, in simple words, that the bigger group new subjective Which means that the bigger group say GR times u plus derivative times element element is G delta R. Anyway, the question is how many elementary transformations do we need? And this is a bound, it's less than k for any Chevrolet group. So we have a bounded reduction from the bigger group to the smaller group. So you can go this further at least At least providing that look at this new such subject. And you drop you to the rank two piece. So this is known for years, for many years, just when it was customary to think about the existence of such a process, but nobody thought how many how many. How many components, this is down, up, down, up, down, up all the time, do you need? It can estimate. So it was the first thing which works for the G2 case. It works for many other cases. It was, you know, a technique. So then there were some refme. There were some arithmetic considerations. So the first one is Kermblum Artillery. It was Ethereum of 1918, where about that. So anyway, if you have A, B as relative private polynomials, then there are finitely many harmonic irreducible polynomials B on the relative B modula A. to be modular A. Moreover, we can take this B prime of arbitrary degree. So this is a kind of Dirichlet Dirichlet theorem for functional case. So it did this. Also exists the little Fermat theorem and then there are some deep work, I think it was very deep, with the power resistance. With the power reciprocity laws, other required tools to use the same ideology which was used by Tarmin and Basmiel Narcer and Arthur Ker. It was not a new invention. We followed the road which was outlined, but it was a road. So, and finally, what I want to mention is a delicate word with the vanica symbols, A, B, A, A, in this parenthesis, B, which are so-called symplectic vanika symbols. And fear, the first one is the second one because of different embeddings of A1 to C2. There are two embeddings on the short rules, on the long rules, and then. And the interplay of these embeddings gives us a result. And this is exactly what we managed to do, Basme and Mercer in their Congress paper 67. It's exactly what they did, but not using the root structure. Okay. Then we can say that the commutative width of the Chevrolet group in this case is also flat in it. Also five minutes. And what is beautiful for us that the cat's muti question falls into this situation and we have the following estimate for cats moody group. The commutator weight of a elementary and listed Katzmuti group of a finite field is then clustered out L prime. than L prime. Well L prime is as follows. 54 and A L in this case, 6 in another case and 7 in 4 E6. So more or less good estimates for community width of FN catsumuti groups and to the contrary of course of Capras and Fuchivara. Javara, the width is file. So now I want to say a few words about model theory because it's interesting for me, at least for me. About model theory. So the first question about these groups was elementary rigidity, the notion introduced in the paper by Alex Nieren Hen. And the elementary rigidity means The elementary legitimate means that you have your group and you consider the elementary theory of this group and another group which has the same elementary theory, then this group should be isomorphic. Ref ethanon. Ref ethanon. Anyway, so it's very, you know, tempting that your logic completely defines your group. It's very, very beautiful and very, very tempting. So the point is. The point is that there are two different types of groups. One is like free group. For free groups, you have decidable elementary theory. And you have a small piece, very, very small definable subgroups, just centralizers of points. So here, here, the pitches. Here, here, the pitch is opposite. The elementary theory is undecidable, and everything, whatever you want, is definable. And we guess that it's true for arbitrary commutative reading. So the same situation like I mentioned before that for lattices, it was for the case of arithmetic case. And here we have because And here we have, because the group is better, we can claim or hope that this is true for every thing which goes automatically is that these groups are homogeneous. This group of homogeneous, let me show. That's the list of the properties. These are groups. Properties. These are group algebra. It's quite important property. What is homogeneous? You take, say, group, you take f in space, f in space, say g to the n. You can see that the point, two points, a n or and b one. Or and B1, Bn. And you think these points like a solutions of a system of formulas. So you want to know all the formulas which have added on this point. And this is so-called type of the point A. The type of the point B. Suppose they have the same logic, they are equivalent. They are equivalent. They have the same logic, the same set of the same types. Are they connected algebraically? Absolutely algebraically. And the homogeneity property says that if they have the same type, there exists phi, which takes automatism. Of G, which takes one point to null. So, this property is not for free. It's very difficult. For example, for hyperbolic groups, for free groups, it was proven by Chloe Peren and there is a screeness. And there is as cleaners with the full force of the metaphoric business. It was difficult. Here it goes for free because of this biointerpreted business. And this is very impressive. At least every logician sees that it is, you know, good relation between logic, model theory, and structural numbers. Even more, you have a lot of properties. QFA, say the whole elementary theory can be. Elementary theory can be determined by one sentence and many other properties. And all of this fosters the philosophy of French groups introduced by Carlampoesko, which is purely model theoretic philosophy. But then sequences are pure algebraic. And this is so beautiful because this by interpretability gives us a bunch of properties which are. A bunch of properties which are difficult to obtain otherwise. And let me finish with two conjectures. So the conjecture one is as follows. Take a Levanter-Schauveri group of R2 commutative ring, rand B bigger than one. Then this ring, this group is B interpretable with R. So we don't need integral domain. We need nothing, just commutative ring. We don't need We don't need the usual elementary with we need nothing. So, in this, in all cases, we think that there is such a situation, and this is, you know, the best possible variant for split case. And to compare. Then, also, I should mention the result of Budina. She says that if you have two chevalier groups of the arbitrary community, the Of the arbitrary commutative ring with the same elementary theory, these groups are more or less the same. There can be some small difference. But this is an elementary theory of two Chevalier groups. And there, as you think, we have another second group after that. And I should compare with also conjecture of Amnia and Mary, which was mentioned yesterday in the talk, and first understand it's almost done, right? Almost done, right? Yes. Yeah, it's almost done. But indeed, for the arithmetic case, we have this interpretability all the time, and we have whatever we want about the logical properties, which were mentioned before that. So that was very important and very beautiful. And let me finish with the last one. We can define Define width with respect to arbitrary word. So instead of commutators, we take any word whatever we want. Any word. And then suppose these words generate the whole group. They are generators like commutators in our authors. So suppose we have any word. Denote this width by W D W of H. H is a group probably here, I don't know. A group probably here. Anyway, so now we are interested in the finiteness of this witch. With respect with this word, not commutators, not elementary commutators, not conjugate, arbitrary. So let me say that the following conjecture, it's half conjecture. Let R be our arbitrary commutative ring. Arbitrary community of ring. GB is chevalier group, rank is bigger than one. W is arbitrary word for free in a free group. And we assume that the image is the whole group with respect to this map. Then the group GFR is bounded to the elementary generated if and only if it's bounded to the level generated with respect to W. W. Which means, in fact, that in all principal questions, then we are not interested in the real estimate. If it's fine in elementary, it's fine as well. So you... In particular, if this implies that it's the fact that you're bounded is independent of W, which is. Doesn't matter. Which W is. So you mean that you. The only you need to generate a whole Right. But so you really believe that if it's true for one W, it will be true for all W's? Yeah, we believe. Including even the powers? Powers is a fast example. But nobody knows it because the powers generate everything. Yeah, and in one direction, the bounded elementary weeks which implies bounded verbal weeks. implies bounded verbal views. There is a proof by Nikolai, by Vivilov, which relies on his several papers of so-called decomposition of unipotent. No, I don't know. But one can change. Let's prove or disprove, I don't know. We believe it's can be true, proof. So. So that's all. I will not dwell on Kanji PC classes. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for the talk. Are there any further questions? I have a dumb question, so I don't know much logic, actually. So there's one theorem about lattices and semi-simple groups. And of course, if you have a lattice, you have any finite index. Lattice if any finite index subgroup is also a lattice. So, how sensitive is bi-interpretability to finite index subgroups? So, like if the elementary group is bi-interpretable, then is every finite index subgroup also by interpretable? Seems to me, for each group, this is yes. This is yes. The answer is yes. In the paper of Tala Polish Mistiko, it seems to me. In the recent paper, of course. Profinite sub-groups. So, whatever you put here also holds for finite sub-groups? I think so. We should check it for the general nonsense, but by general nonsense, I should... This is the paper of Caroline Poshimski Poe, where they studied the whole thing is they study the They studied the cases when your first-order language is equal to the weak second-order language. And if you have finite analytics subgroup by the first second-order language, you can describe whatever you want. It seems to me, and then you will have the claim it in complete generality. I don't know, but I will put it in the specific pool because I think. I think there are there are some examples for Mini Potentium groups, if I remember correctly, that a group has a first order rigidity but the finite index subgroup does not. You mean the work of a fun important groups for There are simple examples. But interportability is in general does not access the subport or actually even in the electronic case many cases where the gold is bind up at the bottom. The goal is bi-interpretable to ask whether an extension of this goal is by intervertible is equivalent to finite width. Yeah, but in this, what I said, if we have the finite width equivalent to the elementary width, so then the width will respect that vertical union will be finite. Right, but we don't know this will although I'm just saying that in general, this is that's not the general. In general, this is that's not the general thing. Some conditions, you mean the central extension. Is there a relationship between these type of questions and the type of These type of questions and the type of logic questions that come up for the groups in terms of, say, the Hilbert's tenth problem over the ring. You know, you want to talk about, say, the citability of. Yes, of course, because Z is inside. And the functional questions of Z. So of course. For example, understability of the theory, it means that you can interpret Z. Yeah, but maybe here it's you know it's not as hard at least we know that the theory is undecidable open cases of Hilbert Stein's problem, for example, like uh you know. For example, like a you know complex function field of one variable is not known, you know, so things like that may be there is a for well for polynomial rings, there is a paper by the mayor, I don't remember the name, where he solves just using the the The functions which are recursively called functions. For fall case, I don't know, of course, but for polynomials, there is. We have here results for the non-twisted African cats only use over fire fuels. And then you have the twisted ones and the quasi-sprint new schemes. But you can find generators and importance, but I don't want to go that way. So can you use the fact that these groups become split over? Over extension. Over the Galaxy tension. To conclude that you have resolved some steps? No, we didn't think about that because you know this fact in fact in fact relies on calculations of Tavgin for he did have all twisted cases. All twisted cases. Not all you're Unitarian, yeah. One unitary, yeah, almost all, yeah, except for
