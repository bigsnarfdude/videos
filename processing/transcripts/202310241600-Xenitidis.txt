Right, this talk is about, as the title says about differential difference equations and actually what is it uses to different integrability aspects, if you want, of these kind of hierarchies. One aspect is massive symmetries, and the other aspect is selective operators. And I will explain what selective operators are a little bit later. And actually, these two. Later, and actually, these two components, these two with the credibility aspects, can be used from one side to construct in a systematic way some the Lagrangian densities for the whole hierarchy. And actually, from the other side, in the cases that I have considered, I'm going to show you that you can have what I'm going to call mastered Lagrangian and just considering a communicator with. Considering commutator with in a certain way, if you can define actually in this way the whole Dalagrangians for the whole hierarchy of differential difference equations. So the plan of my talk is to... I will start by just giving some introducing my notation, then say a few things about motivation and how this works, this idea started before moving on to say a few things. Before moving on to say a few things and introduce my terminology, if you want to object about the phix differential difference equations, but then as I've said, I'm going to explain what a blade operator reads and how is this related to the notion of canonical conservation laws and what is the connection of blade operator canonical conservation laws and actually Lagrangian densities. And I will just move and And after this connection, I will say a few things about mass symmetries and how this can be used in certain cases, not always, to construct, as I've said, granted for the whole high area. All right, so let me first of all say a few things about malnutrition. So since I'm going to discuss about differential difference equations, we have discrete and continued variables. Discrete and continuous variables, the independent ones. The continuous independent variables will be denoted with t or t with an index or the Greek letter tau. So, and tau, I will reserve this letter for the mass symmetry. The discretely dependent variable, it's only one, so I'm just going to denote it with n. And in general, all the functions that we will use will depend in general on n. Will depend in general on n and the continuous variables. However, that the dependence on the continuous variable will be omitted completely, and only that I will denote the dependence on n and the shifts of n. So, and I will use this, I will indicate this dependence with indices like here u n and u n plus 1 n minus 1. For this discussion, what I'm going to need is a shift operator because I've said that I'm going to say. Because I've said that I'm going to say a few things about selected operators. So these are operators which involve S, the shift operator. And the action of the shift operator on a function is defined in this way. When it acts on a function of n, s on k, that means its shift changes n by k. And in some cases, I'm just going to use the operator, the identity operator, which I will denote with. Which I will denote with ID. All right, so this is my notation. And let me start with some few things about the motivation of this work. This motivation actually started quite back in 2011 when with Frank and Sara, we were developed this, we had this work on Lagrange formulation of multi-dimensionally consistent systems. Right in that paper, we had Right in that paper, we had also the Lagraza formulation of, well, not exactly this equation, but what I'm going to call later, it's massive symmetry. What was meeting from what we had in that paper is an N on the right-hand side. But nevertheless, this is the equation that I have here, and it's Lagrangian density given by this function L here. Right, so there were some observations for this particular. For this particular equation, it's Lagrangian. First of all, the Lagrangian depends linearly on the derivative of u n. The non-differential part of L, this logarithm of u n plus 1 and minus u n minus 1, actually it was something that was not observed at the time, is a conserved density of the equation. So that means the time derivative of the t derivative of the logarithm of u n plus 1 u n minus 1 belongs in the image of s minus. belongs in the image of S minus identity. So it can be written in the as a total difference. Moreover, the mass asymmetry, which is in observation three here, is n times this equation, the right-hand side of the equation, admits a similar Lagrangian density. And this is the Lagrangian density that we have in that paper. Oops. Yep, here it is. This one. So you see, the only difference is that n multiplies the logarithm. And multiplies the logarithm the conserved density. And moreover, the symbolic operator of this equation is local, so it is s minus to minus one. And just to a brief definition of a brief observational property of this, what of what a select operator does is that it maps a symmetry. A symmetry, so it maps this quantity to the variational derivative of this conserved density. All right, so that's why there is a connection between syntactic operators and conserved densities and equations. That was the first step when I started thinking about this equation, this connection. Then I had some discussions with I had some discussions with oops, doesn't want to change, right? With Linghu, and we were discussing that time about Voltera chain and this, the two first member of this chain, the whole hierarchy of equations, right? So this Voltera chain is not variational, but becomes when we introduce this new function w via this relation. uh w via this relation here so u n is the exponential of the of w n plus one minus w n minus one now in terms of this uh variable w and the system the equation that the first two members of this uh hierarchy of this uh chain take this form and in fact these two equations have lagrangians which are can be written in exactly this form right This form, right? So, what we can see here is that the Lagrangians are both of them linear in the time derivative of W. They have exactly the same form. The only difference is the time derivative. So, here we differentiate with effective T1 in the first Lagrangian for the first member of this chain. In the second, it is still through the time of the second member of this chain. And we have two functions which I denote here with row one and row two. With row one and row two. And these two functions actually are conserved densities of the whole hierarchy. And this is what, yeah. And moreover, the select operator now for this hierarchy in this new variable w is locally, it happens to be the same with the length operator of the previous equation. All right, so these were the motivations. So it seems that there is a connection. So, it seems that there is a connection between linear blade operators and the Lagrangian densities and conserved densities. So, this connection I was trying to explore. And let me just before trying to formulate this thing, let me just formally describe what I mean by indexable hierarchies of differential difference equations. Right, so what we are going to consider in general as hierarchies. Higher sequences of systems, if you want, of differential difference equations of increasing order, right? What does it mean? Well, here I'm going to start, I'm going to consider only higherities, which the first number of which are of order one. That means I'm going to consider a system of this from here. Bold phase U means some vectors. So here I have vectors. And the right-hand side of these equations involves only the first. Involve only the first shifts of function u and plus one and minus one only. Then the other members of the hierarchy are of the similar form. They are always symmetric in the shifts, positive and negative shifts of U. And as we move on in the hierarchy, the order increases by one. So the next step, the next member of this hierarchy depends on UN plus two, up through UN minus two minus two and so on. Through u n minus minus two, and so on, so forth. And moreover, all the members of this hierarchy commute. So for every k and l, this relation here at the end holds on solution of the hierarchy, right? So that means whenever differentiate, we take these total derivatives in T L and V K, then we have to use the hierarchy to replace the derivatives of u's, and that will become identically zero. Right? So, in that sense, in that context, we can also think every Context: We can also think of every member of these hierarchies as symmetry of the other equations in the equation. So that's why sometimes we refer to this as symmetries. All right, so now for this indexable equations, indexable hierarchies, there is a notion of canonical conservation law. So we know what conservation law is, is for a system of differential difference equations. Differential difference equations is a pair of functions here denoted with rho n and sigma n, which depend on u energy shift, which satisfy this relation here on solutions of the system. Here, rho is the density and sigma is the flux. And for a hierarchy of independent difference equation of the form that we discussed, right, there is a corresponding hierarchy of canonical. Corresponding hierarchy of canonical conservation laws. What it means, canonical conservation laws. So we have a sequence, a corresponding hierarchy of conserved density denoted with rho i n and for every high density direct corresponding flux is sigma i d which satisfy these relations for every i and d and this again holds on solutions of the chiari right and these Right, and these actually conserved densities and flux as well can be found using the notion that what we call decability actually follows from the declarability condition for differential difference equations. And the first canonical density, rho n1, follows from actually from the Jacobian metric F. F1 matrix, which involves the derivatives of F1 with effects to the forward shifts of UN, of UN plus 1. Well, not exactly, well, of course, in the case when F1 is not invertible, it's not the determinant, but some entries of this matrix which actually give us this canonical. So, in other words, if we have an indexable hierarchy, this canonical conservation loss can become Conservation laws can be constructed in a systematic way using three decadibility properties of the equation. And the first one is always a logarithm of the determinant of the Jacobian matrix, like the ones that we saw earlier. Okay, so this is what we need from inductible from higher differential difference equation, their declarability. And what else we need is the notion of syblectic operators. Right, so in general, a selective operator, an operator I, is called syblectic if it is true symmetric and the true form associated with this operator is close. And so, this is the definition of the symplectic operator. And in fact, and this probably is and this is And this is a new result here, something that I've shown that we can, for if we suppose that we have some functions A, I, be such functions, which depend on UN plus one, Un and Un minus one only, and which actually separate the forward and the backward shifts of U. So that partial derivatives of Ai will affect you UJN plus one and UK N minus one. n plus one and u k n minus one all of them are zero for all i j k right in if we have such functions then this operator i which is defined in this way right matrices a t are defined in terms of these functions i a a i right is a black right and it's it's not very difficult to show that this is uh indeed uh skew symmetric it's a joint It's a joint. It's actually just a simple exercise to show that this actually minus changes just the sign of I since matrix C is just symmetric. And then for the show that the two form which associated with this operator is close, taking into account the particular form of matrices A and C, you can show that actually in this case can be written. Can show that actually, in this case, it can be written as the sum as in this form. So here, down here, which clearly shows that this is a closed form. All right, so this is a symbolic operator. This is actually this operator that I'm going to use later. And most importantly, this is a generalization to multi-component system of the Component system of the operators that we saw earlier for the Voltero chain and the while actually the symmetry of H1. In the scalar case, what we have C is zero because of the construction of matrix C here, we can see that all the industry if we if we are scalar, so we have only when one function a1, and then in terms of this function c is identically zero, so which is uh k. So, which is k and then functions a and we have just function f a here a1 s and minus s minus 1 a1 again. So, this is a generalization of the scalar case. And right, so now we want if we want to make a connection between symplectic operators and system of equations, right, of Right, operator and operator i is selective operator of a system of differential difference equations u t with u n is equal to f if it is selective and also satisfies this relation here. Here, this index star denotes a proceed derivative. So, f with index star means a procedure derivative of f, which is nothing else but the sum, this linear operator here. Here, right, so this operator here, and it's a joint is given by this form, and the procedure derivative of the symplectic operator is nothing else but we just differentiate the entries of the functions which appear in operator i with respect to t. And this, so for an equation, for a simple equation from admit i, it's a selective operator. Admit I is a selective operator, this relation must hold. Okay, so for so using the operator that I just show you, right, if we have this operator, which as I've said is a sybaltic operator, right now this is a seblit operator of the system of differential equations of this first order system of differential equations, if these relations hold, this is nothing. This relations hold this is nothing else, but uh let me just go back for a moment. But just exploiting this relation here, and just if we you write out this equation, the left-hand side will end up, there will be a second-order operator starting from s minus two to s squared. So, if you collect coefficients of these of the different powers of s in this operator, then you end up with this system. So, in other words, if you are System. So, in other words, if you start with this operator under the system, these relations must hold. And actually, you can the idea behind this to use this to construct to find the siblative operators for a given system. And this is what I'm going to show you in a moment. Right, so the main result here is that I is a sybilctic operator, this particular I as it is. Particular i, as it is, right? It's a severe operator, and it's a subject operator for a system of differential difference equations if these equations hold, right? So, and in fact, if I just vector operator of a hierarchy subset, then it maps every member of this hierarchy to the variational derivative of the corresponding canonical self-density, which I denoted earlier with rho with index B. So, in other words, So, in other words, if I apply the symbolic operator to the right-hand side of my equation, what I will get will be the variational derivative of a conserved density of a corresponding canonical conserved density. Okay, in this observation, I think it was due to it was Drinkpink Wang who actually made this observation, this connection between siblings operators and variational derivatives of conserved densities. Right, and now we can use this connection. Actually, we can use our previous theorem, this statement here, and this connection here for this one. Suppose that this operator is a synthetic operator for the system of differential difference equation, this first order system of the first order system of differential difference equation. Let rho be Let rho be a concept density of the system such that the action of the symbolic operator on the flow or on the function f on the right-hand side, actually this is the same thing, is a variation derivative of rho. Then this function here, this L, is a Lagrangian density of the system. Right, so and actually this just follows directly if you just take the variation. Just take the variational derivative of L with respect to u n, and then just focus on the differential part of this Lagrange. And then you will see this is nothing else but minus the action of I of the select operator on F on the flow. So that is that will give you exactly that the result that you did in the Lagrange of the system. Uh, the of the system, okay. So, if we have a system which meets an associate operator of this, a linear operator of this form, and then we have a conserved density which is related to this flow, and that's with the use of the spectral phase, then we can write down the Lagrangian density in this nice form. And moreover, And moreover, if we have, if this statement holds for the first member of a hierarchy of system of differential equations, then these functions here L D, right, define Lagrangian densities of the hierarchy, where the functions rho with index D are the corresponding phenomena for set density. That means that if I react with my electrical operator on the Blazic operator on the D member of this high energy that will give the variational derivative of the canonical conservative density rho d. And here, the most interesting fact is that the differential parts of these Lagrangians are exactly the same, the only difference being the time derivative. We just change the derivative of u with affecting uh C. To this respectability variable. All right, so if you have the spectrum rate, and you satisfy these requirements about the row and the spectrum rate, or the current concern, the selected copy rate, then you can build a Lagrangian for the first member, and then after that, actually, for the whole hierarchy. Right, so now we have to say something about this hierarchy of Lagrange. Hierarchy of Lagrangian, right? We have a Lagrangian for every member, so we can consider the corresponding Lagrangian one-fourth. And in fact, if you just take this Lagrangian one-fourth, then this is closed on solution of the high-erity. What does it mean? So if I just take the time, if I differentiate, I should write it here, if I just take the D of L of this form of this one four, then this is close, this is close on solutions of the hierarchy. What this means close that actually what we will get is something which has total divergence. It will not be necessarily identical with zero, but it will be something which can be written in the image of S minus identity. So it will be a total difference. So, in that sense, this Lagrangian one form. This Lagrangian one form is closed. Again, this is by taking into account the solutions of this hierarchy. All right, so here are some examples of these instructions. But I start with two scalar equations. So here is the equation before in Yamil's classification. The first member act one particular case is a Actually, one particular case is the equation that I showed you in the first motivation example. It related to the symmetry. So, all of this, the whole hierarchy is actually related to the symmetry of the ABS equations. Here we have a polynomial Hn, which depends on UN and UN plus one, and also a parameter alpha, which I suppressed here. So it's a symmetric and by quadratic. This coefficient. By quadratic, this coefficient h i which appear in this polynomial, all of them in general depend on this in on this additional parameter alpha, which I said, I mentioned, right? So for all these equations, we know that actually they admit a symbolistic operator which is linear, and it's down here, right? With function f n is one over this polynomial eight. And for all these equations, actually we... All these equations, actually, we can write corresponding Lagrangians, all of which are of this particular form. They have the differential part plus a canonical conserve density. And to the differential part is given by this function, by this expression here, which we integrate this function fn, which appears as a coefficient in the symbolic operator. In the blades operator, and row one and row two are these two concepts, canonical concerns. Again, these two functions, these two densities follow from the ejectability concept of this equation, of this hierarchy. Right here, of course, I said that here we have a concept density. This is another example. This is the symmetries, if you want. The symmetries, if you want, of H1 when it is written on a black-white lattice, and this is from our work that they've done with Vasilis on this equation. Here, we have just wrote the first two members of this hierarchy. We have this additional, we have a parameter epsilon, which when it is zero, the whole hierarchy boils down to v4. And the function xn which appears in these equations is such is actually. Such is actually zero or one. So if we make a choice, for instance, xn when n is even is zero, then the even xn will be if it is one, then xn plus one will be zero or the other way around. So xn and xn plus one take the values only zero into one, right? And well, here what is missing, it's not what is missing from here is just the index of x, which is n plus one. So these are the two first members of this theory. The two first members of this hierarchy, so actually, we can think that as a non-autonomous equation, right? For this equation, for this hierarchy, we have a selective operator, but in this case, the selective operator, I should select and actually the other way around, is down here. It's of a similar form, but now fn, the function which appears in this selective operator, depends on this function xn, so changes with the Changes with n, even and old and all of this has the has Lagrangians, which can be written in this form. Again, same structure. We have the differential part of the Lagrangians, which are exactly the same, a function multiplied by the same derivative of unt, and then flush a conserved density, which again follow from the decarbility condition, from the decarbility properties of this equation. Equation. All right, and see this. So, this can be considered an example of an anatonous equation. So, here is another system, this is a Jelskov Ivanov system. This is a two-component system, functions U and V. Here I have just a first member of this career key, but nevertheless, we can write a Lagrangian for every member of this career. Every member of this category, and all of them will be exactly of the same form. Again, differential fault plus a conservative density. The differential fact is always the same. If these functions multiplying the derivative of u n and this function here multiplying the derivative of v n and then the first two canonical conserve density. That's a black cooperator. That was found I find. Found I find in a paper I found I found from a paper of Jing Fing and Sasha Michailov. The split cooperator was given there and actually in this particular case I knew the split cooperator so using this information I found I constructed a Lagrange density and also because I know that this is MS datable so I could find the conserved densities row one and row two. Row one and row two. Okay, so this is how this system, the Lagrange for this system, was constructed. The next two examples are some new systems for and these systems actually appeared in my work with Alan Coldy on some systems with the But we have with a given Lux pair and then construct corresponding system. And the first system is which one that favor is this one. Right in that case, what I knew for this system was that it is indictable. So I knew other conserved densities. And then using this information, I just built and I knew that something for which I'm going to talk. Something for which I'm going to talk in a moment about its master symmetries. And then, using these pieces together, I just constructed the sublate cooperator, which in this case is linear and it's of the form that we discussed earlier. And all the Lagrange and this again have exactly the same form. It's a differential fact linear with the derivatives of U and V plus a conserved density. And now, of course, here I give only the Lagrange density only for the first member, but as I've said, we can easily. We can easily construct the Lagrangian density for the other members of this characterity, and but not necessarily using the symbolic operator, but as I'm going to explain in a moment, the master symmetries. The other member, the other new component system from that to work with Alan is this system here, which depends also on this parameter A. Also, on this parameter A, there is an additional parameter appearing in the system. And this is quite important parameter because, as we will see later. Again, for this system of equations, I knew that they are integrable. I knew some densities, and using this information, again, I constructed the sybilatic operator, and then using that, I found the Lagrangian density. So, I should as I said. Density. So, I should, as I've said before, that the order should be the other way around. Select compared and don't have fashion density. So, and this is exactly again a new result in the sense that I studied it as part of this work. So, this is five examples, two scalar case and three scalar three component system, which exactly show what as application of what I've As application of what I've told you so far. Another aspect of decorability, and it is related to most of the system that I'm showing you, is the notion of master symmetry. Right, for the system again that we are going, we are discussing here again, I'm discussing, considering the higher differential difference equations, starting with the lower, the first member of which is of order one, so un plus one to un minus one. A master symmetry for this kind. A master symmetry for this kind of system is a differential difference equation of this form. The derivative with respect to this parameter tau is a function of, in general, of n and shifts of u, u n plus 1 to u n minus 1. And in fact, using this first order master symmetry, we can construct the whole hierarchy by taking commutators of the master symmetry and the first order. Symmetry and the first member, we start with the first member of this hierarchy. Their commutator will produce the right-hand side of the second, the F2 in this notation here. So it will give us a second member of this characteristic. The commutator of the master symmetry with the second member will give us a third member, and so on, so forth. So the commutator here in this case is just determined, is given by this relation. given by this relation so the procedure derivative of f acting on g minus the first derivative of g acting of f will give us the next member in the hierarchy for massive symmetry right for uh yeah uh so for the for this for the highest we've considered so far right that the example that i've shown you the master symmetry is usually of this form right is the the master symmetry is n time The massive symmetry is n times the first symmetry. And that was actually also in my example, the first example that I've shown you. In that case, if the mass symmetry is also variational and the Lagrangian density, which I denote here with L with index T, tau, it's just similar structure with the first, like with Lagrangian L1, similar, not necessarily the same. Not necessarily the same, as I will show you in a moment. So, specifically, if these are the Lagrangians of our hierarchy, then the Lagrange of the first, of the master symmetry is of this form. The same differential fact, then here we have a different, in general, a different function row within the P, quite what depends on N and shifts of U. Well, actually. And shapes of view. Well, actually, in most cases, it here for some reason I've changed the notation. These indices in row should be, it appears upper indices. Anyway, in many cases, this function rho tau is n times the first canonical conserved density. All right, so, and in fact, if we used this Lagrangian, the Lagrangian The Lagrangians of the massive symmetry and the Lagrange of the hierarchy, then we can construct the whole hierarchy of Lagrangians using commutators, by taking commutators of the Lagrangian of the mass symmetry of master Lagrangian and the Lagrangia of a member of this area. But here, when I say communicator, I mean this quantity. So I take the Lagrangian of the Take the Lagrangian of the i-th member of this hierarchy and take its total derivative with respect to tau, the master parameter. And from that, I subtract the sine, the ti derivative of that master Lagrangian. And here, of course, when we evaluate this, this evaluation solution of the hierarchy and the master symmetry, of course, that means whenever we have derivatives of ui's, then they are replaced by Then they are replaced by the equations of the hayeric of the mass symmetry. But here we have because the Lagrangians have also differential parts, right? They depend linearly on these derivatives, we have to take into account the fact that this combination here, the south derivative of the Ti flow minus the Ti derivative of the mass flow, is just that time derivative of U n would take the Of u n with respect, uh, that's the derivative of u n with respect to t i plus y. So, actually, that that in other words, it maps the uh derivative of u n with respect to ti to the derivative of u n with respect to ti plus one. Right, so let's see this using an example. So, here I'm just using the again, I'm going back to equation before, and I'm just taking the very simplest case of this. case of this hierarchy when this for that polynomial h is h n is one it's a constant and it's master symmetry for both of these equations we have lagrange and tensors which are exactly of the similar form right they have the same differential part and the lagrange the non-differential part for l1 this is a conserved density for the mass symmetry for the mass of the Lagrange and it's n times the conserved density n times the conserved density. Right now, if we take the commutator according to the formula that I've shown you, what we have to do, we have to differentiate with the sector tau, the Lagrangian L1, and from that we have to subtract that T1 derivative of L tau. If we do this computation, we get these terms and there I highlighted in red the terms which involve the second order derivative you want of U n. The derivative you want of u n. But by the definition of massive symmetry, this combination of these derivatives, this difference is nothing else that will give us the right-hand side, if you want, of the feed flow of this guy energy. So this commutator, I can replace this with just this guy here. And so the commutator will take this work. And this is exactly the Lagrangian of the second. The Lagrangian of the second member of this chariot. And this guy here, minus one over this product of differences, is the second canonical conservation law for this chariot. So this commutator, actually taking now the commutator of L3 of the master Lagrangian with this new Lagrangian, which is L4, it will give me the Lagrangian of the next member of this category. Of course, here I don't have Here, I don't have a proof, a general proof of this statement, but working through examples, I can guarantee that this is indeed the case. So, and this is how this computator of Lagrangian works. And in fact, this can be done also for the equations on the black-white lights that I'm showing you earlier. So, here I can start only with the first equation of this guy here. I can master symmetry with. This high energy and the master symmetry, which again is n times the p1 flow, right? It's exactly the same equation, but multiplied by n. Now, both of them have similar Lagrangian densities. We see the differential parts exactly of the same form. They involve the same function a n, multiplied by the corresponding derivative of u. And then what we have for L1 for the Lagrangian of the first flow is just the first. Of the first flow is just the first canonical conserved density, but for the Lagrangian for the massive symmetry is n times the canonical conserved density plus this extra term. So it's not necessarily we will have here n times the canonical concept, n times the canonical consterve density. And again, if you work out the commutator as I've shown you in the previous example, what we will get will be the L. Will get will be the L2 that we saw actually earlier. So we will get the Lagrange for the second member of this hierarchy. Now we can, the same works for the two other systems that I've shown you, the new system that I've shown you earlier. Right? Sorry. And here I just show you only the example, the fourth example, which the system which depends also on a parameter A. And here the important thing. A and here the important thing is that the master symmetry, the derivative with the sector for with the tau that I've used earlier now becomes A. So A is the independent variable of the master symmetry. All right, so in this case, we have Lagrangian dense for both Gradient density for both and the master symmetry of first sorry is n time the first flow of this Kai Argyle. So we can write the master symmetry in this way. And in this detail, I granted for both the first flow and the master symmetry have the same similar structure. So we have a differential part which is of the same form. Here, as I've said, we have the derivative of unt with respect to A and the non-differential part. And the non-differential part of the Lagrangian density is the conservative density rho one, and enzyme the same conserved density. And now, if you work out again the commutator of these Lagrangians, as we saw earlier, as we explained earlier, what we will get will be the Lagrangian of the second member of this carrier, which I omit here, but it's easy to compute and to find the second canonical conservance. Okay, so these are where what I wanted to tell you. So, what I've shown you here is a connection among linear selective operators, conserved densities, and Lagrangian densities, because these connections actually give us a systematic way to find Lagrangian density for systems of differential difference equations. Right? And moreover, this approach allows us And moreover, this approach allows to construct laggy density for every member of the hierarchy along with conserved densities. Right, as I've explained, as a blanket operator maps flow to variational derivative of conserved density, so from there we can construct the conserved densities and then we can use them to write to derive the Lagrangians along with the information which helps from the selection. Uh, the information which comes from the selection operator itself, and then this new notion notion of master Lagrangian density is interesting because it can just generate this whole hierarchy of Lagrangian. Actually, it can generate the Lagrangian one fault in an algorithmic way. Of course, another thing that we can use from here, and actually, I didn't mention it here. I didn't mention it here, but knowing that some equations do not admit a non-local selective operator, now we can use this information, this to introduce, if you want to find some transformations to change a variational equation to map it to a non-variation, to map a non-variational equation to a variation. To map a non-variational equation to a variational one, like the one that the second example that I've shown you earlier. And of course, the question is if we can use this connection to deriving a systematic way transformation so we can map any non-variational equation into a variational one. Or like the answer to this, it's no, but yeah, I can ask it. And finally, okay, these are just observations. Okay, these are just observations. At least the second part, which deals with when I discuss muscle symmetries and muscle advertising equations, are just observations at the moment.
