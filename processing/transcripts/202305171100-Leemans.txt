It is a pleasure to me introduced to Dimitri the manager of the University of Tehran. I have to have the accent because I was with Dimitri for one and a half years, but I don't have any accent. I mean any good accent in French. But thank you, Dimitri. Well, thank you, Dimitri. It's a really pleasure to me because Dimitri is a very good friend of me and an excellent mathematician. Thank you, Dimitri, to be here. Thank you, Gabby. Well, first I would like to thank Robert, Gabby, and Marian for the invitation. It's great to be here. It's not my crowd usually. I'm more like someone working in polytopes. In a previous life, I've been working in incident geometry. Sorry, Mark. Geometry, sorry, Mark Cook. Yeah, and yeah, it's a bit of a special work because indeed we did that with Gabby when she was visiting Brussels. She decided to spend a sabbatical leave in Brussels. And basically, she arrived. And then one week after, we got into lockdown. And so that was quite bizarre. We had to work basically by Zoom, even though we were in the same city. City. But then eventually we decided to include Gabby and Hector into our bubble, and so that was interesting, but very nice. And so here is what we did, well, some of the stuff that we did while Gabby was visiting. Okay, so yeah, I'll talk about edge girl figure graphs arising from biofine blades and looking groups. Books. So normally you know now what is a natural regular graph, thanks to Robert and other talks after. Maybe you don't. Well, I guess everyone knows why different planes, but I will explain them to you. And then I will finish with Suzuki groups. Don't worry. I will not go into many details. I just explain the main ideas that are there to maybe try to help you find some of these LGBTI regular graphs. Okay, so. Okay, so no, that's not the thing. Yeah, that's the solution. So just to remind you, a graph is k-regular if each of its vertices has exactly k neighbors, and it is a curve G if its most cycles have G vertices. And the number of vertices is called the order. We all know that now. We all know also this formula that Robert showed. Formula that Robert showed in his talk. So, more or slower bound. And so, I'm not going to stop here. Yes. And so we all know that the well-known cage problem consists of finding kin regular graphs of fixed curve and minimum order. And this minimum order would be denoted by n of kg. And we call them kg cages. And if you have a kg cage that is of And if you have a Kg case that is of order attaining with the more bound, then we say it's a more case. And if it's if it's a if you have a kg graph of order, say the number of vertices of the graph, the excess will be the difference between the number of vertices and the mole bound. Okay, so Robert already talked about this survey, but so there's very few graphs that attain the more bound. The mobile. The existence of such graphs is related with the existence of some specific finite geometries or general squadron groups. And so, here the idea also is to use a little bit of incidence geometry to show you how we can find some of these EGR graphs. So, the main challenge here is not only to find small graphs, but once you have the small graphs, you have to prove that they are the smallest that can exist. So, we have to try to prove that there are caches. So, the notion of edge-girth regular graphs has been introduced in this paper by Robert Georgie and I forgot the first name of the page. Stephko. Stephko. Sorry, Stephko. In a paper in 2018. So, what is an edge curve regular graph? Well, you have a certain number of vertices, you have a degree. You have a degree, and of course, it's a regular graph, so all vertices have degree k. You have curve g, and then this lambda here means that every time you take an edge, or any edge you pick, if you count the number of g cycles that contain this edge, it has to be equal to lambda. Okay, so all the edges have the same number of g cycles going through them. And so, in their paper, they did several stuff, of course. They did not just give a definition, obviously. So, basically, they analyzed the edge-girlfriend graphs of cubic graphs with commonality being between 3 and 6. They proved that, for instance, K4 is the unique. For instance, K4 is the unique edge-girth regular graph with parameters 4, 3, 3, 2, that K33 is the unique edge-girlfriend graph with parameters 6, 3, 4, 4, that the cube is the unique graph with parameters 4, 3, 4, 2. For GOV 5, they also proved that the Potassian graph and the skeleton graph of the Cahedron are the unique edge-girth regular graphs on 10 vertices, cubic girf, the 95, and with four. And with four pentagons on each edge, and so on. So they have several results there that I decided to mention here. Oops. And they also gave several constructions where they provide infinite families of edge-girth regular graphs. And they also showed some nice connections to regular embeddings of graphs in oriented. Are embeddings of graphs in orientable surfaces and so on. And so that's nice because it's also linking this to topological graph theory and so on. Okay. And then there's been the notion of extremal edge girth regular graphs that's been introduced in a more recent paper. So basically what is an extremal edge girth regular graph? Well it's an edge girlfriend graph with these It's an edge-go-figure graph with these four parameters, and it's extreme for the triple kgÎ» if v is the smallest order of any edge girl regular graph with these parameters. And then once you have the notion of extremal, you can also define the EGR excess by just computing the difference between the number of vertices that one of your graphs would have and the best case. And the best case. Okay? Right. And so they also provide lower bounds for the number of vertices that you need when you fix the degree, the conality, and the number of cycles that you want per edge. That depends on the parity of G, it's related with the moon bounds for irregular cages of curve G. Of curve G and they improved the lower bound also for bipartite graphs. So if you say, no, I want bipartite graphs that do that, then you can say a little bit more about the bounds that you get. And then they gave results for some special classes of extremal edge-girth regular graphs that are called girth-type in the paper of Potoshnik and Wilson. And they gave some constructions based on Constructions based on canonical double covers, especially in order to obtain some with fall. So you should fix fall and using canonical double covers they gave some construction. Okay, so what did we try to do with Gabi? Well, we wanted to introduce new techniques to construct infinite families of regular graphs for some specific For some specific values of k and focusing especially on grammarity five and six, and also having at least three cyclers per edges, basically because there were not many examples with these kind of things. And we wanted also to try to prove that some of these families were extreme. Okay, so for instance, you can start from the biophine plane. You can start from the biofine plane, and I'm going to recall or tell you what is the bi-affine plane. You take a projective plane over the Q, and then you pick a point and a line incident to that point. So a pair PL, which consists in the flag in incident geometry. And then what you do is you remove all the lines from the point that you've picked and all the points that are on the line that you've picked. Okay, and if you do that, well, you started with a geometry that has q squared plus q plus one points and q squared plus q plus one lines, but now when you take the line and you remove all the points on that line, you remove q plus one points, so you have q square points left, and when you remove all the lines from your point, you remove also q plus one line, so you also have q square lines left. Okay, so it's not like an affine So it's not like an affine plane. An affine plane would remove the line at infinity, but you would still have q squared plus q lines. You would remove only one line. Here you remove also a class of parallel lines, those that have the point P at infinity, okay? So that gives you a geometry with Q square points, Q square lines that are both partitioned. That are both partitioned in Q parallel classes or blocks of Q elements. So you have a parallelism on the lines, but you also have a parallelism on the points. And this is known as the bi affine plane as defined by Brough in 1967. Okay, so you can reconstruct this biophine plane by using coordinates and this is something that was And this is something that was made in a paper involving, among other people, Gabby, also Camilla. And how do you do that? Well, you take your finite field of all Q, FQ. So Q is the power of prime here. And then you will denote by capital L and capital P the product FQ times FQ. So here you have Q square elements, here you have Q square elements. And the idea is to. square elements and the idea is to make a bijection between these q square elements in the lines of your bi fine plane and these q squared elements in the points of your biofine plane okay so the elements of l and p are going to be written using brackets and parenthesis respectively and here is a way to define the q square lines so you will you will give a pair mb which consists of Which consists of elements of FQ, H, M and B, and that represents basically the line x mx plus b. And then you can do the same for the points, you don't need to do anything because it's just a couple. And then the incidence graph of this bi affine plane is going to be piparthes. Okay, so lines will not be incident to themselves. Lines will not be incident to themselves, but to other lines, they will just be incident to points, and points will just be incident to lines. So you have two parts in your incidence graph, points and the lines. And this graph is Q regular, it has order 2 times Q square, Q square lines, Q square points. It has diameter 4, curve 6, if Q is at least 3, and curve 8 if Q is equal. And the vertices mutually at distance 4 are the elements of the following. Are the elements of the following sets. So the vertices are distance four of. Yeah. Okay. And so what we managed to prove was that this actually give you edge girth regular graphs. So the number of points is, as we said before, two times q squared. The degree is q. The girth is six when q is at least The girth is six when q is at least three. And then you can count the number of hexagons through an edge of this graph. And this is q plus one squared times q minus two. Okay, so this is just a matter of carefully counting these hexagons and it's a bit of altruistic. It's a bit of algebra. Okay. And then in the process, we obtained two edgegirf regular graphs on 32 points, girf five this time, and valid C degree five, and such that every edge is on twelve pages. And this was a little bit of a funny one because Because I'll show you how one was obtained. So, one was obtained by adding some edges to the biophine plane of order four in order to create pentagons. And the other was obtained by luck. And I put quotes there, and I will explain what I'm mean by luck using my map. So the first one was used using, was constructed using this biophine pineapple before. Order four. So, what is the biofine plane of order four? Well, now you decide to take F4. Okay, and so in F4, you have these elements that are 0, 1, alpha, and alpha squared, where alpha squared is alpha plus 1. Okay, that's the usual definition. And in B4, you have 32 vertices distributed in eight sets of size 4. Sets of size fold, and so you can write them like this. And so, basically, the idea here of Gabi was to say we have hexagons, but we want to have pentagons. So, we're going to add edges. And that's the clever idea that she had, was to say, okay, for the edges, we take the edges of the bi-afline plane, but we'll add these guys. Okay? And then you add these guys. Add these guys, so this is locally what's happening. Okay, you have in black the biotine plane, and then in red, you can see some of the edges that are added. Well, actually, some edges are also from the biotine plane, but in red, you have one of the pentagons that is appearing. Okay? And so we started proving that this guy was an education. That this guy was an educator for your, but those who know me know that I like to use computers. I showed it yesterday to my colleagues. And of course, at the same time, I was like, okay, I'm going to put this into Magma and I will construct the graph. And then we were in a bit of a hurry to submit the paper. And so we submitted the paper. And basically, in the paper, we proved that the graph obtained by Gandhi was the Obtained by Gambi was the vertex transitive, so that the automorphism group was transitive of the vertices. And we also proved that the order of the automorphism group was something which was not divisible by the number of vertices. Well, actually, Magma was giving me that. And we were in a hurry, and so we submitted the paper. And then we were very lucky because the referee didn't reject our paper. So if the referee is here, So, if the referee is here, thank you very much. Because this was a big mistake. And so, I was like, what's going on? What's going on? This is impossible. And it turns out that actually, while constructing Gabby's graph, I made a mistake and I constructed another graph, which was also a girlfriend of the same parameters. And so that's why I say we found another one by luck, because Gabby found one, and me by luck. Found one and me by making a stupid mistake, I found another one. But that one was not vertex transitive. But that one is not vertex transitive. So we have two with the same parameters, but one of them, say Gabi's one, is vertex transitive, and stupid Dimitri one is non-vertex transitive. Okay? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you can see in the. Later. You can say in the question. Okay, so this was the story of these two graphs, basically. Okay, so we have two, one of them is vertex transitive, one of them is not vertex transitive, and then we manage to prove that they are extreme. Okay. Do I still have time for Suzuki groups? Yeah, I have five minutes. So, Suzuki groups. Well Gabi was interested in five and I still have something, well, you know, like a needle in my foot from my PhD thesis. I did my PhD thesis on Suzuki groups. And basically, what I had to do, because my PhD advisor was Francis Wickenaut, and he was like really, well, he's the founder of diagram geometries, and he wanted me to classify. And he wanted me to classify geometry satisfying some sets of axioms for the Suzuki groups. And in the process of doing that, I found a very nice geometry. And so basically, what's happening is you have a Suzuki over it, which if you don't know what it is, just think about a quadric. It's a special type of quadrics, but think about a quadric. And then in that quadric, Interquadric, if you take an intersecting line and if you take a circle, when circles are obtained by cutting the ovoid by planes, and they always have a special point, and then the intersecting lines, that's easy, you cut by your line. Okay, but so if you take the intersecting lines and if you take the circles, you can define a nice You can define a nice rank two geometry with that. And the nice thing with this nice rank two geometry is that it gives more structure because if you look at buildings, buildings for the Suzuki group, you just have rank one. So you have the points of the orbit, and that's it. You don't really have structure. So Tits was not very happy about that. And so at least with this geometry, you have more structure. And one conjecture that I One conjecture that I had was that in terms of the diagram of the Bukenov diagram, for those who know what the Bikenov diagram is, you have something which is a 10-5 paragraph. And the 5 here interests us because the 5 is the conality of the incidence graph. So it's half the curve of the incidence graph. But so on top of that, what you have here is a geometry which is a graph, because you have a one here. You have a one here. So every line is adjacent. No, yeah, every line is adjacent to two circles, basically. And so the circles play the role of the vertices of your graph, and the lines play the role of the edges of your graph. Okay? And so this phi here means that you have an underlying graph which is of curve phi. So that's great, because Gabby wanted curve 5. That curve five. And the nice thing also is that you can prove that this graph is edge curve regular because in the Suzuki groups, you also have a geometry of rank three, which looks like this. No, I totally speak gibberish here. But what is nice with this geometry is that basically this geometry is a truncation of that one. So here you have a geometry with three types, say points. Have a geometry with three types, say points, lines, and planes. And these guys play the role of points and lines. And then you have planes here. And the planes here mean that, yeah, yeah, you have pentagons. But on top of that, you can prove easily using a result of Arsbrasher that this geometry is going to be flag transitive. And so because it's flag transitive, you can then conclude that the edges here must have exactly Must have exactly, well, each edge must have exactly the same number of pentagons going through it. Thanks to the fact that you know this other geometry, but I also have in my PhD test. So this, by the way, is still a conjecture. So what we did in the paper with Gabby, we proved that the gonality is always five. That we did. Proving that the point diameter and the line diameter are both ten is another story. So if someone can do that, Story. So, if someone can do that, I would be very happy. But so, well, I mean, here I described a little bit more how you pick the subgroups in the Suzuki group to construct the corresponding coset geometry. So, to construct this geometry by using cosets of subgroups well chosen in the Suzuki group. But voila, that's basically, well, the details are here. So, if you want to. Details are here, so if you want to have the details, you can have them. And even better, if you read the paper, there's many more details in the paper. But all this to say that maybe incidence geometry could be a good tool to find some of these families of edge-girlfriend graphs. And yeah, so we got this theorem. We have a family of graphs that are edge-girlfriend, yes, of girlfriend. Your regular, yes, of your five. And we don't know the parameter lambda, but what we know is that for q equals eight, lambda is equal to seven. And so our conjecture is that actually the graphs we found, they have this number of vertices, then they have gradiency q, graph five, and we claim that's something that has to still be proven. That's something that has to still be proven that the number of pentagons per h is equal to q minus one, depending on q for solution. Okay, and I think I took one more minute. Thank you.
