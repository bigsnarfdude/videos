Thank you for coming to the bitter end. So I was talking about the partial data problem, which is unsolved in general. So let me recall very briefly what the problem is. So this is a general problem. So you have two domains. So you have two domains in in the boundary, so two domains in the boundary, and open subsets of the boundary, and for every F supported in one open set, you map it to the induced current flux in the other open set. And the partial data problem is that this information determines the conductivity. determining the conductivity in in the in the open set omega. We have we previously considered a case when gamma one equal to gamma two is the whole boundary, but this is also partial data problems interested not only theoretically but in applications because you don't have information everywhere. So I'm going to consider this is of course a non-linear This is, of course, a non-linear problem again because U is a solution of the divergence equation, this second-order elliptic equation, depends on gamma. And so the question is whether the linearized problem can be solved near gamma equal to one. So this is I mentioned some of these results previously. So, this will left to this here. So, this can be proven that if you linearize the problem at gamma equal to 1 in the direction h, the direction h here, you get that the integral of the products of harmonic functions, because a gamma equal to 1, the equation is. Agamma equals one, the equation is a Laplacian, so they are just harmonic functions. But the support and the boundary is contained in the open set where you have the information. Remember, I'm taking gamma one equal to gamma two equal to gamma here. So it can be shown readily that this is the linearized problem. Even this problem is not trivial. And Calderon considers this when U and B. This, when U and V are harmonic functions, but the data is in the whole boundary. That's why I said this is the analog of Calderon. And he proved the products of harmonic functions is dense. But in this case, the support of the harmonic function is contained in this open set that can be, in principle, very small. But nevertheless, we could prove that h is zero. And even you don't need to. And even you don't need to take q equal to zero, which is the case, a calderon consider, you can take any q real analytic. I am not going to give the proof of this, uses analytic myco-local analysis. I don't know a simple proof of this result. It would be nice to find. The exponentials that I took previously don't work because the exponentials don't have support in the open set. And it's very difficult. Set. And it's very difficult, and I don't know how to construct these CGO solutions that vanish in an open subset of the boundary. Okay, so I'm going to use this later on when we consider nonlinear equations. Okay, so we constructed different types of complex geometrical optic solutions. These are called as the real power. Are called as the real part in binary part, the gradient of the real part is perpendicular to the gradient of the binary part, and the amplitude satisfies some Cauchy-Riemann equation as I mentioned yesterday. We were taking the phi to be the log of x minus x0 when x0 is outside the open set. You take the convex hull of the open set and take the closure. But the assumption of uniqueness that we have. But the assumption of uniqueness that we have previously for the inverse problem and so on assume a lot of regularity in dimension three or higher. We have W1n is the best so far. And of course, there are many conductivities that are not that smooth. However, this type of complex spherical waves can be used to probe An object and determine discontinuities. So, suppose conductivity has jumps. That's called an inclusion. You want to determine where are the jumps and how much does it jump. That's the case that I was talking previously for brain imaging. You don't want to recover the whole conductivity, you want to see where there is a discontinuity, where there is a jump. Continuity, there is a jump in the conductivity. So, this type of waves, spherical waves, again there are spherical waves because you take the level sets of the real part, there are spheres centered at x0. You can use plane waves and so on. In two-dimensional, we have many more waves. Remember, in two-dimensional, you can take any harmonic function. We're going to use that later. Again, it's not working. Phi can be any harmonic function and psi is the harmonic conjugate, dimension two. So this has been done for the conductivity equation, for the Helmholtz equation, and increasingly more complicated, and of course, of a lot of interest in applications: elasticity system, and Maxwell equation by think here. So this is the idea of this method. So you take this X-series outside, you take these complex spherical waves, there is a jump in the discontinuity, and that can be detected at the boundary of the, where there is a jump. And you want also to recover how much is the difference, how much, what is the contrast. Much, what is the contrast? Because we want to detect whether it's a tumor, for instance, whether it is really a cancerous tumor or it's something else. Okay, so the method of complex geometrical optics can be used in those instances. So, let me talk very quickly about the two-dimensional case. The two-dimensional case is not really the physical problem because it's in three-dimensional. Problem because it's in three dimensions, but of course it has mathematical interest, and in some cases you can do a lot of computations in two dimensions, not higher dimensions. So the method that we use implies we have this orthonormal system of frequencies when we have taken the products of CGO solutions. So that method does not work in two dimensions. In two dimensions. Thank you. So the uniqueness result for C2 conductivities was proven by Nachmann in 1996, was improved. And the very nice result here, which is certainly not known in higher dimensions, is that for any bounded measurable conductivity, you can recover from the Dirty Kiton Eumann map. And this uses And this uses very much the two-dimensional case, uses quasi-conformal maps. So remember, this is the problem. And the Dirichlet-Neumann map, I did not mention this, but can also be defined in terms of the quadratic form, which is the energy associated to uh this equation, and this is the power that you need to maintain the potential F on the boundary. Potential F on the boundary. Now, the case of the proof that I mentioned of Astala and Pivarinta here does not use the reduction to the potential because you lose immediately two derivatives. And here the regularity is optimal. Optimal. So the case of potential was opened until Buchheim found a solution that implies the previous result for sufficiently regular conductivities. So again, if the derigator Neumann maps are associated with the potential, which is, that means you take the delta F, you take the normal derivative. Data F, you take the normal derivative, then the potentials are the same, and of course, there is also stability estimates and reconstruction, and so on. But uniqueness is always the basic result. You have a good proof of uniqueness, you can get stability and reconstruction. Okay, so we have had a very nice idea to get different classes of CGO solutions. Which is again, we know that an analytic function is a limiting column and weight, but the definition of limiting column and weight that we were using assumed that the gradient is non-zero. So, however, this also works if zero is a critical point. So, you can see square here has a critical point as Has a critical point at zero, means the gradient vanishes at zero, but is a non-degenerate critical point. So the Hessian is non-singular. So this is a Morse function. Okay, so this is the type. So any allomorphic function will work here, but this allomorphic function has a critical point at zero. And this is going to be And this is going to be crucial. So you get the same identity that we had before. We need to prove that the product of solutions is dense. So he took these solutions and actually I s I think uh one is C squared and the other is minus C conjugate squared. In any case, I want to get rid of the real part. Of the real part when I multiply the two solutions and I get the phase of the minor part. The minor part from the previous slide is x or the real part, whatever I think is x1 minus x2 squared. And yeah, that's what I put there. If you get to i, x1, x2 is the same argument. Doesn't really matter. Is the same argument, doesn't really matter, and then you have the same type of argument that we had before, but now we can apply a stationary phase. So, this is a phase function that has critical points at zero, but it's non-degenerate critical point. So, using a stationary phase, the highest order term will be q one in tau. You compute the terms in tau, will be q one minus q two at the origin. Q2 at the origin. And then we conclude that that's equal to zero. So Q1 at zero equal to Q2 at zero. It's very different from the previous proof because you get point-wise information. Before, we proved that Q1 equal to Q2, the Fourier transform of Q1 equal to the Fourier transform of Q2. Therefore, they are equal everywhere immediately. This is just at the critical point. But then you just simply change, here I'm assuming that zero is. Here I'm assuming that zero is in the domain. You can if you have another point, you just change C t in this uh to z minus z zero and then you get q 1 minus q 2 at the critical point is 0. It's a very nice argument. So with the partial data problem, it's more complicated than this, but in that case we can construct In that case, we can construct CGO solutions, complex geometric adoptic solutions that vanish in the complement of the open set. And so, in that case, we can solve the partial data problem. So, gamma is an arbitrary open subset of the boundary, and you have the information only for F supported in that open set, then we can conclude that Q1 equals Q2. And this can be. To Q2. And this can be was also generalized from domains in the Euclidean space to Riemann surfaces by Guijermu and so on. And not only that, but in two dimensions, we have many more complex geometrical optic solutions because the limit and Kalman weights, or you can have a critical point, and so on. There is much more frequency. And so on. There is much more freedom than in higher dimensions. In dimension two, one can solve general problem, partial data, for any second-order elliptic equation, modulo. There are some abstractions that I will point out. So you can take G to be any Riemannian metric, it's positive definite symmetric metrics. You can take first-order terms, which is related to the magnetic Schrodinger equation or convection terms. Schrodinger equation or convection terms, and you can take a potential. So, very general second-order equations, you can solve the problem with partial data. Because we have plenty of complex geometrical optic solutions in the two-dimensional case. Okay, so let me describe the anisotropic case because that's the most interesting problem in this is the theory of Himber's problem. This is the theory of inverse problems, in my opinion. This is unbiased that is unsolved in dimension three or higher. Dimension two, we solve even the partial data problem, as I just pointed out. We have solved, this problem has been solved even in the case of partial data, because we have many more solutions. But in higher dimensions, we don't. In dimension two, all the Riemannian metrics are essentially the same. Are essentially the Euclidean metric. There are multiple of the Euclidean metrics. You can use isothermal coordinates to reduce it to Plaplacian essentially. That's the reason why it's much easier. But this is certainly not true in higher dimensions. So let me take an anisotropic case. As I said yesterday, any muscle tissue is usually anisotropic. Rocks have anisotropic behavioral conductivity. Behavior or conductivity. Many mediums have anisotropic behavior, meaning the conductivity is different in different directions and thus modeled by a positive definite symmetric matrix. And again, the question is the same, but this is in coordinates. This is the divergence of gamma gradient U, and you measure the induced current flux at the boundary, mu i. upper i are the components of the unit outer normal to the boundary. And the Calderon problem is the same. Can we recover now it's a matrix? So it's one half n times n plus one functions from the dirty Neumann map. It's not true. This is the interesting part there is a gauge embarrassing There is a gauge invariance in this problem. This equation is invariant on the changes of coordinates. That means if I change coordinates, I get a similar equation with a different conductivity. And the conductivity is called the push forward of the conductivity by the change of variables. So if I have a change of variables, there is identity at the boundary. So the F will be unchanged. I change variables here to I change variables here to U composes the psi inverse, apply the same rule, and you will see that the Dirigaton Eumann map of the push forward of the conductivity is the same as the Dirigaton Neumann map of the conductivity, where the push forward in terms of matrices is the Jacobian transpose composed with gamma composed with the Jacobian divided by the terminal. So there is a large group. A large group of non-uniqueness here because this is infinite-dimensional. The group of transformations that leave the boundary fix is infinite-dimensional. Any rotation inside is an example. And the question is: Is this the only abstraction, even for smooth conductivities? And we don't know the answer to that, so I want to point out. As I want to point out, so we don't know how to construct CGO solutions in general in the anisotropic case, because the system that I mentioned before is a much more complicated system, and we don't have solutions for that. In fact, you cannot find solutions in general. And the question is: is this the only abstraction? Even if it is smooth, I mean, even two conductivities that have the same degree to NOMM map, is one the push forward or the other. And you can ask the question, but we just proved uniqueness. But the uniqueness was in the in the case that is isotropic. You can prove, and this is a good exercise, that you take the push forwards or The push forward of isotropic conductivity and is isotropic. So this, suppose gamma is isotropic, that means it's a scalar multiple of identity, and this is also isotropic, then it must be the identity. If it is at the boundary of identity, this is the identity. So therefore, there is no. So, therefore, there is no abstraction in that case. So, that means you know something a priori about your conductivity, you may be able to find what this change of variables is, as long as you know that this is the only abstraction. Questions? Yes? So, are you saying any aside of variables so that the constraint is identical if not structured? Any any change of variable. Any change of variables. So it's a large class, it's a large non-uniqueness. But as I said before, in practice, you know something about the conductivity. So you may be able to find what is the change of variables. For instance, in the case that is isotropic, we know the change of variables is the identity. There is no change of variables in that case. And this is a geometric inverse problem. And this is a geometric inverse problem. It's that's interesting in its own right. So you can take a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary and Laplace and G, Laplace-Vertrami operator associated to the metric. In coordinates, of course, this is a positive definite symmetric matrix. This is in coordinates. G upper J is the inverse of the metric G. You have a harmonic function and we function and with that F on the boundary and you measure the induced current flux which is in this case geometrically this is the conormal derivative with respect to the metric. And the connection with the conductivity is the conductivity here is this factor here is essentially up to this factor. Factor the inverse of the metric G. So conductivities and Riemannian metrics are related by the inverse. That's why one always writes conductivity upper ij here. So the question is, can you recover the metric inside from this Diricato-Neumann map? This is a geometric problem and also And also arises not just in the calderon problem but in holography. This is called the bulk. The question is, for instance, in CD dimension, where you can realize the bulk, which is the money for antimetric, from boundary information. This is holographic, realize the three-dimensional in two dimensions. I mean, in that in And in this terminology, this is called the boundary two-point function, the dirty-to-meyman boundary. I point out here another interesting object that you can measure, which is the distance function on the metric. But today we're just considering the Dirigoton Reyman map. So, can we recover the bulk from the boundary two-point function? This is a problem arises in the ADS-CFT correspondence, and you can see these two. And you can see these two physics papers that point out this connection. So, we can solve this problem in the case that the manifolds are real analytic. So, you take a Riemannian metric here, real analytic, compact Riemannian manifold with boundary. You take an open subset of this, and even the partial data problem, it can be. Problem can be solved for F supported in gamma. Then there exists a diffimor field, which is actually real analytic, which is identity in the set where you have the information, so that one metric is the pullback of the other. By the way, conductivities push forward, metrics pull back. So this is the, you can just consider this as the push forward, it's the same. In fact, you don't need to know the In fact, you don't need to know the M itself, you just need to know the boundary. You can recover the manifold itself and the derivative of M1. This is just complete boundary information, so you can recover, for instance, the topology of this manifold. But the the main assumption here is that this is uh real analytic. I do want to jump over this. I want to jump over this because I have limited time. So the uh the open problem thing asked me to pause open problem. So here is the unfortunately I don't have a million dollars like the Clay Institute. Yesterday somebody was talking about one of the clay problems. So I have offered $1,000. I should increase it because of inflation, but $1,000. But $1,000, you can solve this problem. And somebody asked me $1,000 for every dimension. I said, for all dimensions. I will run out of money very quickly. Can solve in dimensions 3, 4, 5. So this is a very simple problem to state. So suppose you take two smooth anisotropic conductivities or metrics. Depends on the version that you like. Depends on the version that you like. Assume that you have the same dedicated on MMA, does there exist a diffeomorphism, which is the identity of the boundary, so one metric is a, here I wrote pullback of the other one. It can be pulled back or pushed forward. For even a smooth metric, at this point, we don't know this result for a smooth matrix. We know it for analytic, but this is a very big assumption. Big assumption because for real analytics we can go inside. For smooth metrics, we cannot. So, this is homework for the next time I see you. Yes, somebody with a new idea can come up with a solution here. Why not? The problems are difficult only until you don't solve them. When you solve them, they are tricky. When you solve them, they are trivial limits. Okay, so this is bad news in some sense that there is this large group that or non-uniqueness. However, we have used that for invisibility. I will talk very briefly about this. And the physicists have called these transformation optics. It's a fancy name for something very simple. Something very simple. So the problems in mathematical physics usually are invariant on the changes of coordinates. This is what we just saw a moment ago. So I want to make this object invisible. This blue fish here, assume this Harry Potter here. So how do I make it invisible? I want to have the rays of light. The light goes around. Goes around so that this becomes invisible. The way you see it is because of reflection of the light in your eyes. If there is no reflection, no scattering, nothing, then it's invisible. Of course, this is there, but it's invisible. So you want your waves to go around. To not penetrate this. Okay, how are we going to do this? So, again, I'm going to use a transformation. I'm going to blow up this point to this ball here. So, I blow up the point. The other way around, I can contract that ball to a point. I can do this. Take the ball and contract. You take the ball and contract it to a point, or I can blow up the point to this ball. And what happens when I blow up these lines, which is like a Cartesian system, this is propagation of light in vacuum along straight lines, it will be deflected this way, exactly this way. And so, why is this invisible? Because this corresponds, you cannot make a Correspo you cannot make a you cannot distinguish between the picture in the r left and the picture in the right because there is a transformation that is identity will be identity at the boundary here and so this corresponds to a point but the point is invisible you cannot see a point so therefore you cannot see this not only you can take a point you can take other in three dimensions you can take any In three dimensions, you can take any set of Hausdorff dimensions less than one. You cannot see a line, for instance, in three dimensions, a curve, and so on. Well, the point in particular is case. So that's the idea. It's called transformation optics. Oops, there is a movie. And this is the transformation. So this goes, the domain is the ball of radius 2. The where Harry Potter is is the ball radius one. That's what you want to make any object object inside invisible. And this is the map sending this to this. So the point is going to go to this ball. Of course, it's singular at the origin. It's a diffeomorphism away from the origin, singular here. And this is the explicit transformation. So it's So it's a diffimorphis from here to here. And this is the coat of Harry Potter. It's a section of the coat. You want to find what material you need to put here, what conductivity you need to put here to make this invisible to electrical measurements or light or sound waves or whatever waves you want. So this is, you push the identity on the side. Identity on the ball, you push it forward, and that's the sorry, that's the conductivity here, that's the conductivity of Harry Potter's clock. And you can write it in spherical coordinates, exactly this. r equal to 1 is a singular, this is singular as r equal to 1 because the transformation is singular. Because the transformation is singular, we are in the points where sine is non-zero. So this is anisotropic, it's anisotropic conductivity. So you take this conductivity on the clock here, and inside here, you take an arrow. You take an arbitrary positive definite symmetric matrix. Anything you like, because we want to make invisible any conductivity here. So, arbitrary positive definitive on the bolar radius one. Then we prove, this is what I explained physically, that you take this new conductivity. Conductivity is the same as the one from the identity. You cannot distinguish the identity from this new conductivity, meaning the conductivity, you cannot distinguish the conductivity that you put here from one. So this, anything you put here will be invisible. So this is the same as this, but of course that shows Uh that that that shows that the anything that you put here is invisible to electrical currents. And you can use this for Maxwell equations. The thing has worked in the case of Maxwell equations for that propagation of light, sound waves, elastic waves, many types, different waves, as long as you have this invariance and the transformation. The only thing that you need is invariance of the transformation. Is invariance of the equation under transformations. So, this and then these are the currents. The currents in the case of the conductivity we construct go around the object that you want to make invisible, and when you measure outside, it's the same as the current went straight through as the conductivity one. So, anything that you put inside here. So anything that you put inside here is invisible to electrical currents, and so on. So we have used the invariance, the invariance of the equation and the transformations seems to be bad news. However, it gives this way to make objects invisible, not to find something inside. It's the opposite of what we want to do in inverse problem. In inverse problem, we want to find what is inside, but reverse. Inside, but reversing the coin, we can construct conductivities that, but these conductivities are singular at the boundary of the clock so that the currents don't penetrate. So it's it's it's useful for invisibility. Okay, so let me let talk about talk about yes about I mentioned yesterday and also already I I cannot never pronounce his name correctly Tian Sai just talk about this nonlinear he was talking about nonlinear wave propagation I want to talk about nonlinear elliptic equations and the fact is that uh The fact is that I need to, how do I okay the fact is the non-linearity helps, that's the main point, and then we're going to see also that for non-local operators, the DDK-1 map is an example of a non-local operator, is an infinitesimal generator of a Levy process on the boundary. It's non-local. In the case of upper half plane or the ball is the square root of the Laplacian. Anyway, the nonlinearity, uh, what happened? Can can you make it uh yes the interaction of waves. The interaction of waves, as I told you before that in the case of the wave equation, it's very clear interaction of waves. In the elliptic case, we're also going to use interaction of waves, so the waves are different in the elliptic case. Complex geometrical optics is one type of waves. We're going to see w what else can we do in the elliptic case. Okay, so for the conductivity equation, For the conductivity equation, Sun already considered the case when gamma depends on X and U. So these are there are conductivities, especially in superconductivity, that the conductivity depends on the voltage itself and also on the current. Some consider the linearization for isotropic gas. Isotropic gamma x u, but isotropic, we consider the anisotropic case. And Herubus and Sam consider the case with depends on X and gradient U. And this is the case when gamma is anisotropic and depends on U and gradient U analytically in U and gradient U. So you have a power series in U and gradient U. So these are other results. I'm not going to So these are other results, I'm not going to talk about those. But let me explain the idea in a very simple non-linear, semi-linear elliptic equation. So I mentioned this briefly yesterday. You have Laplacian plus Q times U to the M. This is the old equation that we consider in the case m equal to 1. So we're going to consider m bigger or equal than 2. So you have nonlinearity here always, quadratic or higher. Or higher. And then, of course, there is for nonlinear equations in general, you need to assume the data is small in order to have global solutions. So, if the data is sufficiently small, then there is a unique solution of this equation and there is the stability estimate. That's a direct problem. And we can also look at the partial data problem, and we can solve it in this case in the non-linear. It in this case, in the non-linear case. So it's the same problem that we had before. You take this support of F in an open set, arbitrary open set, and the current is measured in the other open set. And the theorem is that in this case, you can recover the potential uniquely. And there is some work also on stability. Some work also on stability estimates and so on. Again, the basic problem is uniqueness. Hopefully, a good uniqueness proof will lead to stability and reconstruction. And also, you can consider more general semilinear equation, not just a potential, as long as this map is holomorphic in C. So you have power series expansion, the nonlinearity is a power series. Power series, u square, u cube, and so on and so forth. So it starts with u squared at least. Because at zero, we're going to linearize at zero. So that zero is the solution of this equation. So, and the theorem in this case is that for the partial data problem, for arbitrary open sets, you have that the potentials are the same. And I'm going to explain the idea in the simplest case, which is the quadratic nonlinearity. The same idea works in general. I'm going to do what Jan was explaining today. It's a second-order linearization. So you can see the two data, the parameters epsilon one and epsilon two. I'm t going to take the derivative with respect to epsilon one and epsilon two at zero. 1 and epsilon 2 at 0. Second-order linearization, because this is a quadratic nonlinearity. So you want to recover the coefficients of the power series, you need to take higher and higher order linearization. And then you do this computation, you have something familiar, the difference of the potential, but now there are three. And then remember, while linearizing. And then remember, we are linearizing around zero. Because zero is a solution of the equation, because of our assumptions, for this case is clear that zero is a solution. For the general potential, we assume that there are non-linear terms. So these are harmonic functions. And there are three harmonic functions. And there are three harmonic functions. And I showed you the partial data result that we have before. You can always take a function B3 so that the support is contained in an open subset of the boundary so that this is non-zero. It's not a problem exercise. But we saw earlier this is the partial data problem. This is the partial data problem that I mentioned: that the products of two harmonic functions is dense. These are harmonic functions. These are not solutions of different equations as long as they are supported in an open set, in gamma one. This is a result that I mentioned here again, the span of the product of harmonic functions, which vanish in the complement of this. vanish in the complement of this open set is dense. So therefore we get q1 minus q2 times v3 is equal to 0, v3 is non-zero, q1 equal to q2. So that's the reason why linearization, second order linearization helps. And again, you take higher order linearization and you have more general potential. This can be done for more general conductivities, quasi-linear conductivities. But these are isotropic. A case that has not been done yet, an open problem is the case that this is anisotropic. So this is a general conductivity now that depends on x, u, and gradient u. And again, And again, this is a smooth function. Again, for gamma, we know that u equal to constant is a solution of this equation at zero. And we assume that this map is holomorphic. Again, that means that the type of nonlinearities are power. Power series can be square, cubic, and so on. Square, cubed, and so on in the gradient on u. These are a lot of functions that you want to recover. You have n variables here, you have one variable here, suppose it's real value, and you have the gradient u, which are n functions here. So it's however, because of this non-linearity, and again as uh doing uh higher order linearization here, we need to do linearization of whole order. Go do linearization of all orders, we can prove that the conductivities are the same. So, this is the quasi-linear case. So, there is essentially one new idea, which is just to take higher-order linearization, because that involves the interaction of more waves. Okay, so the last topic that I want to talk is about non-local operators. How much? Ten minutes? Okay. Ten minutes? Okay. Huh? Seven minutes. Ten more minutes. Okay. Which is the fractional Laplacian. Inverse problem related to the fractional Laplacian. I mentioned before that the Degree Torum map itself is a non-local operator on the boundary. For instance, in the case of the upper half plane, it's exactly the square root of the Laplacian, minus the Laplacian. So this is no local operator that means No knocal operator, that means that, as is indicated here, this involves values of u far away from the point x. It's non-local. This is for every s between 0 and 1 is non-local. At s equal to 1 is the Laplacian, at s equal to 0 is the identity. And so this we're going to show that non-locality helps also because you get information every day. You get information everywhere. It's like the Diricotor Reimal map in some sense on the boundary, but it's hard to recover it. So the way to define the fractional Laplacian is via the Fourier transform. There are several ways to define it. We're going to see another way in a moment. Via the Fourier transform. Take the inverse Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of this is modulus C to the 2s times the Fourier transform. C to the 2s times the Fourier transfer and take Fourier inverse and that defines this operator. It's a convolution, it's a singular integral, and so on. Okay, the fractional applaution arises in very indifferent diffusion, and that's the case. I mean, this is the steady state that we have been considering. The Laplace and of course is normal diffusion related to Berlinian motion, and this is the case we're going to consider. And this is the case we're going to consider, which is super diffusion and levy flight in probability, it's called levy flight. I'm not going to talk about the fractional in time, which is another subject in itself. So this fractional Laplacian arises in anomalous diffusion, involving long-range interaction, turbulent media, population dynamics, of course, Levy processes in probability. Levy processes in probability theory. I mentioned this financial modeling with JAMP process. For the time fractional, you can take a look. There is a whole book of Kaltenbaker and Randel dealing with this case. Inverse problems for that case. Of course, in the case of the fractional Laplacian, we cannot look at boundary values because the solution of this equation. Because the solution of this equation blows up at the boundary in terms of the distance to the boundary. So I'm going to consider the exterior problem. So I'm going to consider exterior data. Suppose you take F, solution equal to F in the exterior. So this is the exterior domain. And given F in H S can be proven that this is a direct problem. We have Direct problem, we have a solution U in the same HS. So S is the same order of the fractional Laplacian here. And this corresponds to the measurements in the exterior. You look at the whole, of course, we are going to restrict to an open set. This is too much information, the whole exterior here. We're going to take measurements in an open set of the exterior. The reason why this The reason why this is the analog of the normal derivative is because as you approach s going to 1 and you go to the boundary, this approaches the normal derivative that we have been discussing before. So, this is the natural Detonoim map. So, in terms of processes, you have a you measure the process outside the domain in an open set, and you want to determine where And you want to determine where it came from. You want to recover the potential here or any other information. So, this is the inverse problem. Does this determine the potential here? And the first result was the following. It was in 2016, but in math, as you well know, it takes a long time to get anything published. This is four years. Took four years. Took four years. And you take, and there were other results about the same subject using the method I'm going to explain earlier. So S is between 0 and 1 and Q1 and Q2 are bounded potentials. So here the regularity is quite good. And you take an arbitrary open subset of the exterior. It can be arbitrarily close to the boundary and you have the the And you have that the Dirty Guinema map is the same for functions supported in one of the open sets, then the potentials is the same. So, this is the partial data result for this case, the analog of the partial results in that case. And in fact, you don't need as much information. 1f non-zero is enough to recover the potential. So this is the partial data result here is the analog of the partial result for any open subset of the stereon. And there is no difference in between the two-dimensional case and the higher dimensional case. And this gives you a new mechanism, a new method for solving non-local inverse problems that I will mention several. Problem that I will mention several results that have been obtained using these ideas. The ideas I'm going to explain now. So, by using Fourier transform here, it's not integration by parts, but the same, you get exactly the same identity that we had before. This is our famous identity, but now there are solutions of the fraction of Laplacia. But I don't know how to construct How to construct CGO solution that will be interesting. But instead of doing that, I'm going to use the Rung approximation, which is valid for non-local operators, but not for local operators. There's a difference between non-local operators and local operators that I want to point out in a minute. I'm out of time. So let me explain very quickly. The Rung approximation comes from Approximation comes from analytic functions. Any analytic function can be approximated by complex polynomial. For elliptic PDE, any solutions in an open set can be approximated using solutions in the bigger open set. And this is dual to the unique continuation principle. Unique continuation means u vanishes in an open set then and you have an elliptic equation, then it's identically zero. Is identically zero. This connection was done by Lux and Margrange independently. Okay, and boundary running approximation has been used in inverse problem in different settings. Since I'm running out of time, let me rejump to the main point. And this is the main result that's used using the Runge approximations. So you can be quite singular. Singular in some sovereign spaces. And u in an open set, and the fraction of Laplacian vanishes in the same open set, then it has to be non-empty, of course, then u is identically zero. This is certainly not valid for local operators because you know you can have a compact supported function use under Laplace and use. U is and the Laplace and U is zero in the away from the support and it's not zero. So this is only true for because of the non-locality of this operator. And this is proved you see in the very nice Caffarelli-Silvers extension. In fact, this is the most cited paper of Caffarelli, the Caffarelli-Silvers extension. the caferic inverse extension that you add one variable and this fractional Laplacian is uh is in fact is obtained from the local equation this is divergence so you add one variable y with boundary value of the function u that you you have so this is the the way to obtain the fractional Laplacian so for s equal to one half I was mentioning before this is exactly I was mentioning before, this is exactly the standard derivative. The Decatur Neumann map is the normal derivative. The only difference is that this can be degenerate if S is not one-half. And Rulan has proven an important result of unique continuation for this type of degenerate elliptic equation. This is called a two-weight. In the case of S equal to one-half, In the case of S equal to one-half, you don't need that. This is a standard unique continuation result from the boundary. But this is a very important tool because this implies the café silver extension can be easily seen in the case of the Laplacian. The the the Dirigatoni Ma map is just yes a trivial computation, is the fractional Laplacian on the boundary with y equal to zero. On the boundary, with y equals zero. You look at the upper half plane. And for the different s, you get a different equation, of course. It's a very simple idea. And then the main tool is that this implies that any function in L2 can be approximated by solutions of the fractional equation, which is certainly not true for Laplace. not true for Laplace m plus q, not even for q equal to zero. They are not dense. Any function can be approximated by solutions of the local, the non-local equation. And so when you have this identity here, you can approximate this. You can take u2 to be anything that you like, non-zero. And u1, you can take to approximate the function one, and then you will conclude that you will. And then you will conclude that q1 equals q2. It's very simple. You don't need CGO solutions nothing. It's the fact that any function can be approximated by solutions of the fractional equation. So this is method that, for instance, you can do the anisotropic case using this idea. So non-locality helps with this result with. This result, we don't know it for the local problem in dimension three, as I mentioned before. But it was proven that you can recover uniquely the potential from the Dirichotonyma map. And there are many other results I cannot explain now, but you can define the fractional Laplacian using the heat equation by the spectral CRM and then use the heat equation because Uh use the heat equation because here is variable coefficient. You cannot use the Fourier transform to define this operator. Anyway, there has been many results. I was talking to talk about several other results, but let me have time. And so let me give you some further references. A lot of pages. You can read them in your spare time. I will leave the slides for anyone who is interested. Well, a lot of pages. And here are further results. Stability, reconstruction, perturbations, local perturbations, non-local perturbations, magnetic operators, parabolic. I'm sure I'm missing. I'm sure I'm missing fractional elasticity Lee here, who's here, this, this, several other results, fractional applause, but Tam already mentioned one result, but there are many others, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, many results using these ideas. Okay, thank you for your attention.
