inviting me here um i'm going to talk about um things that were in my phd thesis which i uh did with uh peter olber in 2017 i believe um where we were well i was interested in finding a pseudo group analog for this result so So for Lie groups, the theorem that underpins the moving frame is this one. So two sub-manifolds in a Lie group are congruent if and only if there's a map psi between them that preserves the Muratkartan forms of the Lie group. Lie group. And so an equivariant moving frame then translates a congruence problem in a manifold under a group action into a co-frame equivalence problem using this theorem. And there is a pseudo-group. A pseudo group analog of this result. And the co-frame equivalence problem in finite dimensions becomes an equivalence problem for T structures when applied in the same way. And so just to set notation, Let H be a Lie pseudo group on some manifold E and we denote the p-jets of the pseudo group element, the set of p-jets by hp. And so a typical coordinate is written in this way. With capital A is a multi-index. And I collect all of the jets, all of the individual coordinates in a vector I denote by Z set to the power of P. Anyway, so these groupoids have a topple vibration with a Double fibration with a so-called source map, the target map, sigma and tau, which yeah, so the source just gives you the source of your jet, and tau is the image point of the pseudo-group element. And the final notation. And the final notation we need to fix is for two, so there's a group point operation where we compose two jets just by composing Taylor polynomials in this way. And so this is a left action, actually, but we write it with capital R anyway, because sort of Sort of acting on the right, and while the inverse goes to the right, anyway, so this is the notation setup. Okay, so I'm not quite finished with the notation because these Lisur groups have more cartan forms also, which are contact forms in these jet spaces. They're special contact forms that. Special contact forms that Peter and Joha constructed originally. And now two sections of a groupoid are congruent. I write congruent in quotations because this is what I mean by congruent. There exists a pseudo group element that maps one section to the other using the group point operation. Point operation if and only if there's a pseudo group element that preserves all the pulled back Markathan forms and so this is very analog analogous to the finite dimensional case and we can yeah and so this is the We can, yeah, and so this is the starting point of this research of which I called in moving frames. Are there questions at this point? This is sort of an important point. So you have to interrupt me. I'm not savvy enough on Zoom to notice if there's a question. A question, okay. Anyway, so you'll interrupt. Um, actually, you will notice that, well, if you're familiar with the aquivarient moving frame for pseudo groups, you will notice that the group point operation, capital R, JP, phi, leaves the target coordinates invariant. Invariant. And so we restrict the two sections S and S bar to have constant and equal target coordinates. So this is a necessary condition. Also, for the theorem to be true, P, remember we were working in HP, which was the set of HP, which was the set of p jets of pseudo group elements, it needs to be at least as large as the order of the Lee pseudo group. And this is a very simple definition. The order of a Lee pseudo group is just the smallest number such that the defining all of the defining equations of order p is formally integrable. formally integrable and hence locally solvable in the real analytic category this is just yeah so it's a technical condition which is necessary I'll give you an example of an order so here we have a very simple action Uh, which is a and actually a Lie group action, and the defining equations for this very simple action are this, these at first order, and then there's this guy, third order one. And so, you need to go up to order three to describe this as a Lee pseudo group completely. And so, uh, yeah, you go up to the so the order of the Lee pseudo group is the order. The order of the least of the group is the order at which you can solve the defining equations and be sure that each solution is an element of your pseudo group. Okay, can you see the entire slide? Because I can't. Because I can't. Sorry. Okay. Okay. So the thing is, the base manifold on which the Lee Supergroup is acting is going to be a five. A fiber bundle, and we are interested in the congruence of sections of that fiber bundle, well, local congruence. And so, as before, we let H be a least pseudo-group on the space E, but we write E as a fiber bundle with fibers U. And we have capital S and capital Bar sections of E. And we are interested in the And we are interested in the congruence of this capital S and capital S bar under H. And since this is all local, we can assume X and U are open subset of Euclidean space. And so a little bit of notation, the standard, well, Peter Oliver notation at least. The Lee pseudo group acts by Lee pseudo group acts by prolongation, and we write the target coordinates of the prolongation with these hatted capitalized variables. Okay, and so now for two sections in E, we take sections lowercase s and lowercase s bar of the group points above. The group points above the two sub-manifolds we are interested in, S and S bar, capital S and capital S bar. And the main result is that there's a section of this space. Space that maps lowercase s and lowercase s bar, well, lowercase s to lowercase s bar under this group point action. And this section annihilates all of the contact forms on HP. If and only if at the zero at zero level, well, if we take the target coordinate of Fp, this map actually preserves the Moore-Cartan forms, pulled back Mohr-Cartan forms. And so this is slightly different than the result above. Result above because lowercase s and lowercase s bar are no longer proper sections of the group point. And so we don't get necessarily a pseudo-group element like before, but we get these things FP. And so the good news is that Fp And so the good news is that FP annihilates all of the contact forms. So maybe we can integrate FP to an actual pseudo-group element. And so set differently, this is the theorem here. Yeah. So said differently, there's a section F. So, said differently, there's a section FP above our first submanifold, capital S, that satisfies this contact condition and is such that its, well, the function it produces by taking its target maps capital S to capital S bar. If and only if. Bar. If and only if we can find sections lowercase s and lowercase s bar such that this the map F preserves the Moriothan forms. Okay, so this is the theorem we will be using throughout this talk. And it is in solving this problem here that we actually so solving for f done here. Done here is essentially solving an equivalence problem for G structures. Okay, I'm having trouble getting full screen mode here. Sorry. View okay, it's better. Okay, so the question becomes. becomes this theorem gives us this section Fp and the question is does FP integrate to an actual pseudo group element and for this to be true we need some very simple although they are Although they are technical conditions. And so the definition that sort of guarantees that it can be uniquely integrated to a pseudo-group element is this. So H has order T. And if every jet coordinate of order T that involves a U derivative, which is the fiber coordinates. If it can be taken as a principal derivative in the defining equation for h, we say h is quasi-horizontal. And it is very easy to show that in this case, these fps guaranteed by the theorem can be integrated to pseudo group elements. And so for quasi-horizontal H, the FP from theorem, from our main theorem, uniquely determines a suitable group element. And so, yeah, so another interesting point is that these pseudo groups that are eventually Least pseudo groups that are eventually free are necessarily quasi-horizontal. So, this is a weaker condition than eventual freedoms for those who know what that is. Yeah, questions at this point? Yeah. What's that? I didn't catch that. Are there counterexamples if it's not quasi-horizontal? Yes, so oh yes, there are probably many which I'll be having problem. Having problem figuring out right now. I mean, so all, I mean, just the Lee pseudo group of all diffeomorphisms is certainly not quasi-horizontal. There's no special direction that's, you know. So that's certainly a trivial example of a something that's non-quasi-horizontal. Yeah okay, so let's do an example a an example many of you will recognize. So let's take the pseudo group of transformations on four variables. On four variables with defining equations such that these are the prolongations of point transformations in X and U. And we consider equivalence of sections, which are going to represent second-order ODs. So the equivalence of sections in this case is just point equivalence. Point equivalents of second-order ODs. And so the fiber coordinate in E, in this case, is just Q. And looking at these defining equations, we can already tell that any Q derivative is going to be a principal derivative, or it can be. Derivative, or it can be used as a principal derivative. The x, u, and p don't depend on q, and q sub q is going to be, you know, can be taken as a principle. And so, in this case, this is a very typical case of something being quasi-horizontal. And so, if I And so if I so any section on so any section of H1 above the a second order rho E capital S, which annihilates contact forms, will uniquely determine the pseudo-covelement. And so in this case, because if I give you a map of XUP, which satisfies all the blue equations, All the blue equations, you will automatically get a unique solution to the red, to the red equations. And so, this is a trivial example of something being quasi-horizontal. Okay, so. Okay, so okay, in the quasi-horizontal case, this theorem, the main theorem, where we want to solve this equation for f will actually be a g structure equivalence problem. And so I've put all the references to the specific theorems I'm using, and the slides are on the conference webpage, so you can check the references. I'll give you an example of how the G structure arises. If we continue our ODE example, so the pseudo group is order one, which is easy to check. To check, we choose lowercase s and lowercase s bar to have constant target coordinates. And so we are in a better spot than Cartan was because we have recurrence formulas which tell us what happens here. So the The mu sup q becomes a linear combination of omega x, u and p with coefficients that are these lift invariants. And so by our theorem, this equivalence problem will be determined by the omegas, omega x, omega u and omega p. U and omega p and these first-order invariants. And now, here's what Cartan and the equivariant moving frame are both doing. They choose lowercase s and lowercase s bar such that these lifted invariants are constant. And so that you will recognize both in Cartan's method and the equivalent going frame method. And so And so, equivalently, we are constructing an equivariant one frame. The G structure, just so you can see how it comes out of this, is so you write down these equations and we use all the all the conditions we have. All the conditions we have imposed. And so this one is just a defining, it's an integrability condition in the defining equations. And we can write the omegas in terms of a certain well, horizontal co-frame, dx of the, and then the. Dx of the and then the submanifold contact forms and the matrix is always going to be a group a matrix that pops out of it and the the horizontal coframe dx du minus this guy is well it's it's it's determined by the by the The omegas. So there's no. So, what am I trying to say here? Yeah, no. So there's a process for getting the G structure. There's a specific process, which is, you can see in the reference up here. Yeah, okay. And so choosing lowercase s and lowercase s bar in theorem three is the same as choosing these Cartan parametrization to eliminate certain lifted invariants. Lifted invariants. And so here's the theorem again to refresh. So we get to choose these lowercase s bar and lowercase s to lie in a certain partial moving frame. Okay, and so, okay, yeah, so questions at this point, because now I'm going to check. Point because now I'm going to change tune a little bit. Okay. So the question becomes: how do we solve this equation for F? Um oh sorry the well we go through the structure equations of these uh more Cartan forms and again we are in a slightly better spot in Cartan because we have a formula or a symbolic formula for these for these equations and combined with the recurrence formula. Combined with the recurrence formula, we can simply plug into these structure, so the general structure equations, we plug in our normalizations from the recurrence formula. And so symbolically, we just get for free essentially the structure equations. And so I've yeah, so now I've used the recurrence formula and the equivariant moving frame to write down. No, with no effort, almost just linear algebra, the symbolic form of the structure equations. And so symbolically, we can easily solve equivalence problems. If we are not interested in specific formulas for the invariants, we can run through these. invariants, we can run through these equivalence problems very quickly using only the recurrence formula. Okay, and so the only non-constant invariants appearing for the essential torsion coefficients in Cartan's language are these first order lifted invariants and so we are And so we apply the recurrence formula to them, and we realize when looking at the recurrence formula, we can solve for pxx, pux, and xx. Okay, very good. After this is over, these are the structure equations. And so just like in Cartan, we check for involutivity of this. And so we count all the second order pseudo-group parameters not yet normal. Parameters not yet normalized, which this number is called the sometimes the order of indeterminacy of the structure. And then we maximize the rank of a certain collection of one forms. Of one forms and so on. So we go through the same process as in Cartan's method to determine involutivity via the structure equations. Okay, and so in this case, this is not involutive, and we move from H1 to H2 and include as the next. And include at the next order all the first order Moore Kartan forms. Compute their structure equations, normalize lifted invariants appearing there, and so on. And so this process is equivalent to constructing an equivariant moving frame or a partial equivalent moving frame rather. And you know, we get brand. And we get branches at, usually, there are lots and lots of branches where we find a relative invariant and we say, okay, either it vanishes or it doesn't, and all that good stuff. I will say one thing about this process is that we Is that we so solving? So, I'm only doing this symbolically. I'm not computing formulas for invariants, I'm just doing this completely symbolically. I only normalize invariants that appear in the structure equations at each step. So, in the original equivariant moving frame, the action of the Lisoul group is prolonged to Prolonged to a fixed order jet space. And at that point, you try to normalize as many lifted invariants as you can. I only focus on the ones that appear in the structure functions, which are they're many times fewer. And so, yeah, references. So yeah, references. Okay, so yeah, so questions here maybe? Anything? Okay, so this is the main theorem. And using it, we can prove we can get an upper bound on the number of On the number of differential invariants that generate the invariant algebra. And so, this is the theorem. This is only for Casi horizontal L pseudo groups. If we manage to normalize all of the pseudo group parameters of order, well, up to order t so and um So, we have an actual equivariant moving frame with some domain of definition after branching. We managed to normalize all of these guys and we pull back the more cartridge forms by our moving frame, and we get these invariants. Those invariants are going to generate the algebra of the differential invariant algebra. And so the proof of this theorem uses the finite dimensional case explicitly. So, yeah, so this is the Yeah, so this is the lead-tress theorem with well, an explicit lead-tress theorem. And these guys are actually easy to count. So if we so we get like trivial upper bounds on the size of the generating set, this is the absolute worst upper bound possible. This is just upper bound possible. This is just the worst estimate. But if the Lee pseudo group acts transitively on a certain order, then we have better upper bounds. And this all drops straight out of the recurrence formulas. And if H is a Lie group which acts Lie group which acts transitively on the base space, then this dimension of the group point is equal to the yeah, okay, sorry. I've switched h and g here. The dimension of g is equal to yeah, okay, sorry. The dimension of g is the dimension of h. The dimension of G is the dimension of H minus the dimension of the phase space. Okay, so we get like, you know, upper bounds. Of course, usually we are interested in proving that there's a single or a we want to find a minimal generating set. Okay, so not everything fits this setup. For example, the famous example by in the five variables paper, Cartan, if we are trying to find internal symmetries of some system, maybe this one, this is not a This is not a concurrence problem of sections under an ambient Lisa group. So I don't know of a decent way of setting up an equivariant moving frame in this case. So keep in mind, this is we have an ambient Lie pseudo group and are looking at the congruence problem of certain manifolds. It is an interesting project, though, to study these internal symmetries using moving frame methods. Okay, so one last thing. I've been telling you that the equivariant moving frame and Cartan's equivalence method are the sort of the same thing in many cases. However, However, Cartan's method solves constant coefficient linear equations when he's normalizing structure functions and well, what he called essential torsion coefficients. However, and Cartan's method provided explicit formulas for the invariants. So those are the So these are the pros of Cartan's equivalence method. The pros for the equivariant moving frame is we can very easily, like I mentioned, provide symbolically the structure of the invariant algebra using recurrence formulas. However, finding the formulas, anyone who has tried to do like these equivariant These equivariant pseudo group computations will have found that the standard pseudo group jet coordinates are much less convenient than what Cartan was doing. For example, just in the running example, while the recurrence formula tells us, so this is the recurrence formula, modulo horizontal forms. So this takes no work. So, this takes no work to find. And this tells us immediately: oh, I can solve for pxx from this lifted invariant. Doing it, however, and so I can normalize symbolically the Murka time form by setting qx to zero. Well, this is the formula. And okay, as promised. As promised, we can solve for pxx, but the formula is going to be pretty nasty. And it's not constant coefficient like in Cartan's method. It's even in this small equivalence problem. And once the order gets a little bit higher, like Qxx is going to be just awful. Just awful. However, the so hiding and the formulas for the pseudo group worker-transforms are expressions that put these unwieldy expressions into constant coefficient equations. Equations or constant coefficients at top order. And so I'm just going to show you the you will recognize these if you're familiar with the who are in MoinFrame. And so the what we call the horizontal forms are these guys. And I'm using Einstein summation convention here. And the first order Marketan forms. And the first-order Mercatan forms have this factor, and then its horizontal component is going to involve these things, which I've highlighted in red. Now, what I've highlighted in red, I call Cartan coordinates. Cartan coordinates. And so, just like in Cartan's method, let's define this matrix of forms alpha and define these guys as Cartan coordinates. So that the first-order Moore-Cartan form has this. Has this simple expression. And so if and so if we use these Rs, R A B C instead of the standard jet coordinates, these equations are going to be much, much simpler. Well, this expression. And so there are higher-order Cartan coordinates, also just defined analogously. And these guys they parametrize the group on spaces. And in general, for And in general, for any Moore-Cartan form, it will have the expression D of a Cartan coordinate minus the next order Cartan coordinates times the horizontal form. And then there's a bunch of other stuff. But importantly, so this is the recurrence formula. And so, copying Cartan, we can compute these matrices explicitly and then compare coefficients in this equation, like compare horizontal coefficients. And in red, I say, we can already see that this will be constant coefficient in the R's. Indeed, this is the equation in the standard jet coordinates. And the Cartan coordinate sort of mops everything up, combines it into a single constant coefficient thing. Yeah, yeah, so this is my last slide. So I'll take questions. So these are the references. Thank you. Are there any questions for or go ahead, Robert? Hello, thanks for the talk. Can you hear me, first of all? Yes. All yes, yeah. Rob Wilson here. Um, so you looked at the equivalence problem for second-order ODEs. So I don't know if you came across this idea of carton duality for second-order ODEs. It actually, it's something that comes up naturally in the branching of the problem. But it's funny, formally, like if you look at cartan duality, it has At Tartan duality, it has like some strange resemblance to the setup for the Aquirian moving frames in the sense that you have this total space with a double vibration and you do the duality via this total space. And I always wondered if this notion of duality that exists for second-order ease is some more general phenomenon. So I don't know, like, did you have a Did you have a chance to look at that? Or do you have you? Is that something that you think might actually occur? Like, can Cartan duality for second order release be generalized somehow? Right. So I remember a couple of years ago reading about Cartan duality. Is it like finding like, right, so there's an. Right, so there's an so yeah, so I don't remember it too clearly, but um so I can't really comment on whether it's uh useful or not. But I did, I know that I looked at Cartan to LT at some point, but I didn't make any connection at that time, though. But I should probably check that's an interesting idea. I always felt like it was something that that should be explored further. Yeah, so uh, that's a So that's of course general such things like this in Barbara George. This particular piece, of course, is show very auto-automatism of A2. You just switch the Lincoln diagram. That's a cartoon duality. So anytime you see symmetric sink in the Inkin diagram, the gluten process, that's the sense. You get some kind of a cartoon duality. So it comes up for Rojavi context, right? I mean, second-order weights is a small significant place. But yeah, whenever you have extra symmetry, the manifests potential geometric. Okay, so potential for the D4 cases that can't start to try colour. You have to be careful, colour. If you look at the Lincoln diagram for COR, it's symmetric. However, there's no duality because you actually cannot warm it any of the process. So the two metal environments, they are united into one complex environment, actually. Complex environment, actually. It's actually one environment. But that's kind of the same, bringing past the same complex topic. Thank you. So I had one question about your theorem number five on page 20, I believe. So it's written that if you manage to normalize all deep pseudo groups of order t, you can have the result holds. Kind of the result holds, but then in the slides before, you mentioned that your approach does not require maybe not that one, but you mentioned that your method does not require you to have to normalize all the pseudo-group parameters. So how do you merge these two results together? Yeah, so the equivalence method has three options. Options. Either it stops at involution, which usually doesn't have any invariants, although there are exceptions. Then there's the complete normalization where you normalize all of the pseudo group parameters of a fixed order, and the structure equations are all well, and all the structure functions are constant. Well and all the structure functions are constant and so you have a very symmetric space and then this is the this is the this is the third option so um i'm only looking at yeah this eventual free case um i guess there are invariant i mean i guess there is um an invariant algebra in other cases Variant algebra in other cases, but I don't, I haven't studied like any general theorem for those for that case. But maybe there is one. You're thinking of like the partially normalized invariants? No, I was just more thinking that in his approach, he does not normalize all the invariants to come up with a moving frame, but yet this result still requires the normalization of all the parameters. Of all the parameters. So, somehow they're still all, while he does not normalize all of them, they're still normalized in the background. Yeah, I don't know. I guess, yeah, so this is the simplest end result. Resolved for the or the nicest end result for the equivalence method, but there are like intermediates, like there are other cases, and some of them probably have invariant algebras, but I don't have any. I haven't thought about them at all, actually. Well, thank you very much, Arne. We will not take a fit. We will now take a 15-minute break before our next talk at 11 a.m.
