For giving me the opportunity to attend this amazing conference, where in the same day you can attend a conference in mass and doing a trail of twenty five kilometers thanks to this guy Bruno. So it's amazing. It's a very good. It has been a pleasure to be a pleasure to be here. So my title does not sound very mathematics. It's an ongoing project with two big shots in economics, Buenobier and Georgia Och. And Georges Rocher. Unfortunately, I did not respect the convention. I do not put a picture of these two guys, but you can find it anywhere in the book. Unlike the paper, because there is no draft of this paper, you cannot look after any draft, because maybe the dark web, but Gueno is currently writing the draft. So it's a very ongoing project. So I guess we have the solution, but we have a lot of stuff to check from a mathematical. From a mathematical viewpoint, so I'm not sure that it's totally clear, but I almost should. I have a theorem. When John Schau says this is the solution, we have to check that he's right and we have to check how to find the guy is right. Okay, so the story is very simple. I would like to give you a setting, it's just an example. You have a setting, just an example, where we will analyze the dynamic contracting problem in a midfield economy, as was done for the first time as I know, by a paper with Eli, Omuel, Thibault and Dylan, the more, I think, mathematics of operational research. But unlike them, we are considering um a setting where we have many adjusts, okay? Many agitators, okay? There are risk covers, low utility, and but they operate independent IID projects. So, okay, we benefit from this beautiful picture. So, you consider an archipelago, okay? You have several islands. On each island, you have some guy that is producing something, and the weather is independent, so okay, so you grow apples. So you grow apples, so space of dedication to my friend Ron√©. So we are considering a good, so apples, and that guy will suffer from a risk, but he's independent from that guy. But the interaction comes from this bullet point. In fact, you need seeds to plant. To grow apples, you need to plant apples. And there is a kind of big social planner that is in. That is in charge of distributing allocating resources between agents. Okay, it's very standard. So there is a big guy called Papa Smurf. And the guy says, okay, Bruno, you can plant this. George, you can paint it. Inquire, you can paint it. It's island. And you can consume. Okay? But Papa Snurf is deciding everything. So what we know in first base, when everything is observable, you have perfect insurance. You have perfect insurance. Why? Because the agents are pretty much the same. So you share equally. You distribute the same quantity of atoms to everyone. And the resharing, sometimes you produce more, so you share. And when you produce less, you benefit from the other. Okay? It's perfect insurance. But in our setting, we will study the asymmetric information case, where you can lie. Can lie. You privately observe your production. So, for instance, you have 110 apples. And you can say, okay, to papas, I have only 100 apples and secretly consume 10 apples. And why it's optimal, at least if you are a greedy guy, why it is optimal to doing so? Because you will benefit from your insurance. You will say, oh, I am a poor guy and I have been unlucky. I have only one. Lucky, I have only 100 apples to bring to the community. So, can I benefit from the social insurance? So, you secretly consume and you benefit from the social insurance. Frenchmen know this very well. So, to be more specific. So, to be more specific, I will explain what is the model. We consider N guy, N would be big. Would be big and so big that at the end it will be plus infinity. If not, I am unable to say the same thing. So, ex-ante, and it is very important: ex-ante, all agents, our machines. They are the same. So, different islands, but same type of agents. So, there is only one good, and as usual in my talk, apples. And what do the social planner That the social planner signed, he signed a bilateral contract. He says, Okay, Costas, you have to cleanse this and consume this, initialis, you have to consume this and cleanse this and so on. So it's a big work because you have n contracts, sign. Okay? And what is a contract? It's a pair. So it's a pair. The number of seeds you have to plant for the next consumption. For the next consumption and the consumption, the two-day consumption, because you have to do a trade, so you have to consume apples today. So, once you have planted this amount of apples, the output is very easy, and as you observed, the Brown motion is independent. Okay? So for sure there is a for sure there is a possible extension to have a common noise here. Okay? Noise here. Okay? But I let this for future research. I will present the simplest one. So here, two stuff are very important to remember. Mu is common. So it's a common return. So all the economy are pretty much the same. And the risk is independent. And the agent can't consume. The agent can't consume, so report something that is less at the production. So, delta is positive because you cannot make apples coming from nowhere. So, you can steal apples, but you cannot pretend having produced more than you have produced. Sorry? Yeah, yeah, sure. Delta depends on I, yeah. What can the contract depend on? The contract here. The contract here depends on the total position. Yeah, yeah, something that I will specify later on. But you're right. The contract is in the end of the social planner, and the social planner observes the total production of the wire, the filter exchange generated by the wall. Okay? So I want to talk about Monet, so I have to speed up what we know. So what we know is that for a given concept. So, what we know is that for a given contract, we compute the expected utility of the guy. So, if you give me a contract K and C as an agent, I have to choose my best diversion to this contract. And in general, the principal objective is to offer a contract that prevents the firm from stealing apples. So, I want delta equals zero being a maximizer of that problem, and now I follow the And now I follow the idea by Timazo Sanikov-Sanikov and this paper that I recommend a lot for the students because this is the paper where I understood everything. The social planner controls the agent's utility. So it's a process like this. You can see this as the representation mark angel of this problem, and you can directly consider this control process, where now you have to control C, beta, the sensitivity, and kappa. And kappa. And it is well known that if beta is greater than a certain amount, that depends on the contract characteristic, it is optimal for the agent to report trustfully. So this is a very well-known sign, so I skip this. But, okay, I skip it, but we have to remember that beta is a ship, not discards. So beta equals, I will choose beta equals this. choose beta equals this quantity and and this quantity this ratio will be a small y in the rest of the flow. So now I come back to your point. What I observed as a principle I observed the total production the total output because I have to feed my public workers I ask having anyone to pay me a tax CP so I collect N times CP so it's a kind of a concept So it's a kind of the consumption for the principal. And this defines the quantity available for next investment. Why? Because I have production, so this term plus this term, the total output, minus the consumption for the agent's consumption, and minus the principal consumption. And why there are interactions in this paper, because at the beginning we have the archipelago of independent Thailand, through the budget constraint. Through the budget constraint. Because when I collect, as a principal, when I collect apples, I have to share apples. So I have to say, you have to consume this and this. So this gives me A, and now I have to reallocate the production for the next period. And to do this, I so in continuous time, it's tricky, but assume that you have T and T plus D T here, you have to use You have to use the next allocation, depends on the available capital. And this is the budget construct. And therefore, the social planner is a control problem like this, where you have to control C is the number, K is a vector, C is a vector, beta is a vector. It's quite of standard control problem, except that you have this budget constraint that links the characteristics. Links the characteristic and the state variable. So, this V, so thanks to Mete, we can understand very well the state variable of a control problem of that type. This V depends on this A and on the vector W. So it's a control problem in R and power n plus 1. Okay, to be honest, I'm not able to. I cannot write the IGB for this thing. I cannot write the IGB for this guy, but that's it. What's K I K what K I so you were sleeping KI is part of the conversation sorry Stefano is this social planner is consuming himself or yeah get it because uh this so I've Because this, so I forgot the N, because okay, log of a product is some, so you can forget about the number N, but you consume, you ask the producer to pay tax CP in order to consume or to pay your social selling. So is there a utility for the social planner? Yes, you do. This is a social planner problem. So he doesn't consume, that we distribute to people what he collects. Or does he consider? No, no, no, no, sorry, sorry. Sorry, sorry. I wasn't clear. Sorry. Here there is a consumption for the principal. This one is for agent. This one is for, if I am the principal, I consume. And I want to optimize my consumption, taking into account that I have to distribute seeds. Can you guarantee that AN is positive? Ah, at that point, no. At that point, no. But uh later on. Exactly. That yeah, exactly. Good observation. And this is part of my verification. I will show you a contract that John Sharp knows it is optimal. But I have to check everything like this. Because from here I don't know if the production is positive. Right. So H N is what? A N is okay. Assume that you are my island. I ask people, give me your apple, give me your apple, give me your apple, give me your apple. Okay, you are, you give me apples. I say, you can consume this, you can consume this, you can consume this, you can consume this. This is that total. This is the total production, the number of apples. Of apples. This one is, you can consume this, you can consume this. This one, you have to pay me this, you have to pay me this, you have to pay me this. So I still have apples after this process. And I share this number of apples. You can trend this, you can trend this, you can trend this, you can trend this. You get? You are sleeping too much. You were sleeping too much. A is the total number of up. This is the total number of apples. I collect I got the total number of apples. I got the total number of apples. Because you bring me your apples. The only way to... Where is the total number of apples? Good, thanks. Because costas must not sleep in. Good. You're right. It's not clear. So I collect apples. I give you back apple for... Give you back apples for consumption. I consume myself and I give you back, okay, not apples, I cut the apple, I give you the seeds and you plant the seeds. You use apple in two ways, consumption and investment. You smooth consumption, you want to consume tomorrow. This is why money will matter because you want to consume tomorrow. Because you want to consume tomorrow. If you have on one only one period, it's over. You have to consume today and you have to not rent anymore. Does the social planner get YI or the Y headline? No, the social planner collects Y but distributes the seeds. Yeah, but the agent can secrete the Yes, yes, sir. But we are here we are assuming that we have signed a contract that ensures that the the the agent report trustfully The attentive report was fully. So when you say I have 100 apple because I signed the contract with you, the good contract with you, I know that you are not lying. There are some others where you should actually let me just shirk. I am sure. You agree? So this is some. I agree. This is something that I maybe don't specify very well here. Yes. Here? Yes. I this is not maybe not optimal. Yeah, I agreed. So it's uh something that I often read in the economics paper. Five minutes, so I want to talk about money. So sorry, I stopped operation. So now the idea is this problem is uh the principal doesn't care about W i. Yeah, she yeah, it cares because this value depends on on the vector W. Depends on the vector W. And if n is one, it's a standard problem. It's Timado Center. Because you do not care about budget constraints. If N is one, it's a standard problem. So what you do, you have arrange everything, you consider the empirical measure, and here, I'm sorry, I don't know if it's optimal, but I am unable to do it. Unable to do. I respect the Markov control. Okay? When I do this, I rewrite everything more in a mean field way. Why? Because I would like to let n going to plus infinity, use a mean field approximation. And I transform this problem in that one. This is my problem. So, thanks to Mete, we all know that V is a function of the law, but not only, we are all The law, but not only we have also k. Because through the interaction, k matters. The total output the average capital matters. So we have a function of k and the law. And the dynamic, this one is deterministic, and it's easy to have this, this part will go disappear. Okay, so this is my problem. And why it is uh maybe non-trivial, but uh eventify. Be non-trivial, but even if I think that it's possible to solve. So it is the social planner problem, it's a mean field control problem. This is the state variable. But you see there is a constraint. You must check that at any time k is related to the law according to this equality, the general strength. So what we are doing, so now we are playing GMAS. Yes, the solution. Yes, the solution. So we consider the related unconstrained social planner problem. We introduce a kind of flag multiplier. So this one is quite natural. So you introduce, maybe it's not the best, okay, but we introduce the related unconstrained control problem. And okay, it's clear that for any lambda you can solve this, you have a control in A. If you find a In A, if you find a lambda node for which the optimal control is in K, then B is being the lambda node. So it's not surprising. And what we do, we solve it. And we benefit from many papers of people in this room to write down the IGP equation. So we have an equation, so we introduce this linear derivative. We have Ito formula and dynamic programming. Everything is justified on paper by V N V. By an VN, VSA, and so on. I will forget that that is why I have been careful. I did not put it an iterative. And now this is nice because V is a function of a measure. And what we get that this value is in fact a value of K, but it depends on the Low Square characteristic. It's an exponential moment. And why I'm happy when I use it? I'm happy when I use it because it's very easy to compute linear derivative for that kind of function. Because, in general, I forget about it. I'm not very good to compute linear derivative. But for that kind of function, it's very easy. And if I do this change of variable, I plug the gas I plug the guess and what is good, you can put this exponential in factor, you get this term between brackets, first-order cognition, you see that the controls are independent of W. You can do the optimization inside the integral. You bind the budget constraint, and the key intuition is to be along the optimal control, this ratio should be constant. So we are solving in two dimensions, but across along the characteristic. along the characteristic it's called along the characteristic z k constant we can solve it like this way so we can solve it line by line okay so this is maybe a sound so this is the theorem so the optimal contract is very easy you consume proportionally to the capital the agent consumes proportionally to the certainty equivalence okay so x and theta are the same but there are They are the same, but there are guys that have been lucky, there are guys that have been unlucky. So it's a very right paper of the right because you give more money to people that have been lucky. So the worst there is a variance in the worth. So more you have been lucky in the past, the richer you get. And so now why it... I would like just to talk about one minute, two slides, sorry, one minute for I pro this is. This is, I presented a direct mechanism. So you have to imagine Papa Smurf, really a village Papa Smurf, and this. And this guy saying, okay, you have to come to this, you have to do this, and everyone sign a commitment, a full commitment contract, but there is a direct mechanism. You have to represent someone that is in this. Now I would like to implement an indirect mechanism through a market. And the difference is that. And the difference is that now the principal is a kind of institution. You can imagine the central bank, right? So, what is doing this institution? It handles agents with money. Fiat money. A sheet of something, a paper, right? A token, if you want to share, I don't care. But something that you know it has value in the future. So there is also a commitment. I commit that the value of money today, if it's one, Today, if it's one, it's I see a copy. What happened? You will you know that you will if you are able to buy one unit of good with one unit of money at time zero, you will buy pi unit of good tomorrow with one unit of money. And when you do this, and when and if you are also tax, what we can prove is that everyone solves. Everyone solves his own control problem, which is a master-level control problem, that one. It's really a master-level control problem. You solve it, you get it's homogeneous, you do Bellman plus first-order cognition, you see that the optimal control are proportional to the equity. And what is equity? It's the evolution of production minus the tax minus consumption minus the evolution of the value of money. And now, what you do, you And now, what you do, you ident you U of E T is the continuation value of the C agents, you identify dynamics of U T with dynamic of W T along the optimal contract and everything works in the sense that with constant inflation and constant tax rate it implements the same utility. So there is a mechanism that gives you the same utility. This is why money exists. And the final one is thinking. So let's take a break and let's start at 10.35. So we're shorter than planned.
