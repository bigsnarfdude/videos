Yeah, have you seen this in your own statements? Is it on board house? Yes, no, it's not on board house now. No, she'll check it for Mane. She saw so many footage. Excellent. So, good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our afternoon session today. Session today. A speaker, a first speaker of the afternoon session challenge, will tell us about the topological insulators, curved surfaces. Yeah, so thank you for the invitation and for my deal with this. So what I wanted to talk about was some spectral properties related to topological insulators. So I'll start with the insulators. So I think yesterday Jacob already gave a definition. So I'm actually So, I'm actually considering a narrow class. It's just in this definition, the 2A situation. But anyway, in my setting, so our understanding of condensed matter physics, when they talk about an alterator H, its insulator and energy. At energy E if and only if E doesn't belongs to the spectral gap. Oh, sorry, it doesn't belong to the spectral gap. So E belongs to a spectral gap. And then a topological insulator for us. Physically, it corresponds to a novel material with the following three properties. Properties. First of all, the bulk operator is isolator. So, my case. Excuse me. So, I mean, the material could still be an insulator, but the energy belongs to the spectrum, but to the localized part. Yeah, the mobility gap situation, right? Yeah. The one that you was mentioning, actually I'm gonna put it in the open problem. I'm gonna put it in the open problem part. I believe it's still true. Yeah, I think it should be still true. Yes. So, yeah, thank you for. Okay, so the bulk is insulator. In my case, I'll just take the bulk to be V2. So I have operator H, L two C two. 32. Okay, so that is my bulk operator. And then the second property is that it becomes, this becomes an insulator, sorry, becomes a conductor if you restrict to upper half plane set. Okay, so originally it is an insulator. Now, if I restrict it to the upper half plane, and then the lower half plane was just empty, so I have a this is a page. Then it becomes a conductor. And this kind of thing. And this kind of development can happen in many situations because you can think of the operator being perturbed. So, what's the definition of conductor? Not being an insulator? Not being an insulator, yeah. So, you're saying before you restricted the half-space, you are in the resolving set, and what's your restriction on the spectrum? Yeah, now I'm in the spectrum, yes, precisely. So, and this can happen in general, but the topological insulator requires that this phenomenon happens due to a non-trivial topological insulation. And now trivial topological immersion. So sometimes I may call it bulk numeric, sometimes I call it topological numerics. So anyway, it is something like this. Rel equals to zero. I denoted using this notation. I'll go more into these into details later. So this is a So this is the properties that I require for physics from physics perspective that are required for topological insulators. Originally, in the whole space is an insulator, so mathematically speaking, precisely as what Dominic was asking, for operator H, I had a spectral gap. So this is a gap. The rest is my spectrum. And now, after I restricted to the upper half planet. Restricted to the upper half plane, and I get well outside of it where there was a gap, where there was spectrum, I'm not sure. But now, inside where there was a gap, now it is full filled, fully filled. It is now belongs to the spectrum of, if I denote this operator by hd, which is h restricted to z times 10. The original spectral gap, now we say it closes. It now becomes spectrum. Or we also say this phenomenon is emergence of H spectrum, just as the name suggests. So I understand it, so it's not specific. So initially, it's a property at E, and now you phrase something that doesn't have an E or a gap. In the picture, you specify a gap. Good point, good point. Good point, good point. Yeah, so I'm just re-invasing and omitting the fact that E was some points inside here. But in your picture, you're saying it was an insulator at all energies in the gap? And no, it's a conductor at all energies in the gap. So if I add the energy in the gap. So since you can consider one E here, now it becomes in the gap, and you can use the same argument, argue that other points, which was in the spectral gap, now they all belong to the gap. Spectral gap, no, they all belong to the spectral. The same argument works because this programme rise actually is a constant in a spectral gap. Does that make sense? Yeah, it does make sense. I'm just surprised that you really want to fill the entire gap with spectrum for the half space operator, but maybe it's possible. Maybe it is possible. No, no, it's the striker understanding problem. Ah, okay. Yeah. I mean, this is a property of two dimensions in 1D, for example. In 1D, for example. Yeah, exactly. That's right. It looks like it's examples or patterns. Yeah, so anyway, this is the physical settings. So the mathematical setting is precisely this one that we were describing here. So originally, there was a spectral gap for my bulk operator. After I restrict it, then it becomes a spectrum. So I'll call this emergence. Of H spectrum if this interval, I call it T is contained in the spectrum of H. Okay, so well now mathematical setting. We're working a little bit more general in the setting. General in the sense that here I have h and zero, empty space. In general, I can consider h plus and h minus, just in that sense, my zero. So, mass setting one, I have a h plus minus, so both of them are defined on L2Z2C. C D itself. Okay, so I call them bulk operators and then they have they need to satisfy some conditions I'll specify more clearly later. They have a common spectral gamma capital D and the And the insulator, the topological numerized, previously I say it's non-trivial, then equals to zero. Now if I have a H plus, H minus, I require to have different topological numerators. I will write lambda, but actually it's a constant in the gap. So you can also just write the gap G. Or then the other two is common spectral gap. So that is my setting of the bulk operator. And then I have an age operator, which is a bulk operator with, okay, kind of, this is a rough definition. I'll give a more precise definition later. It's going to be H plus on omega and H minus on. On omega and H minus on omega complement. And then what we care about is whether emergence of H spectrum will happen. If it happens, I got a top one years or later. If it doesn't, I don't. So is it important to specify the conditions? Specify what? Yeah, uh so I'll specify when I give a So, I will specify when I give a precise definition, but you will see that actually it doesn't matter that much, the boundary condition. It's very robust with respect to that. Okay, so the question is emergence of age spectrum. Okay, so in particular, what we focus on, this is based on our joint work with Alexei Newo. So, in particular, what we So, in particular, what we really care about is under which condition of omega does this hold. So, what is already known is that if omega is, say, half space, then there is a very well-known result of Bulk H column. Very well-known result of clock-H correspondence. I will not go into detail what it is, but the fact is that the emergence of H spectrum is a natural corollary. A very simple corollary of this implies the result. So the you need to assume something about the operator. So In something about the operator. So, what does the theorem actually say? So, I think the voltage age correspondence, the best that they can do is probably for the traditional operator, it's probably 2005 for graph, algorithm graph and the Shanker. They have a general short range operator for H plus minus, general short range. And they allow mobility gaps, so like localize the eigenvalues inside the The eigenvalues inside the gap. And then their H operator is, yeah, I think their age operator is also just H plus on top and H minus on the bottom. Them H minus is nothing. Their H minus is nothing, yeah. They're just a restrictive, their H minus is zero, but that's not something intrinsic. Yeah. So as far as I know, that is uh most uh general. Most general. What more general would you like? For operators, I think, yeah, that's most general. So what we care about is what about more general omega? Under which condition of omega is this still true? So why do we care about this? Because actually, this is expected to be one of the most important properties of topological insulators. That is, they expect this emergence of They expect this emergence of image spectrum to be very robust with respect to the shape of omega or random calibration. So, more general. Robust shape of or random television, like the situation with mobility gap that he also mentioned. Okay. So, however, the mathematical results is the reverse mathematical results is relatively rare. So, yeah, what's the In 2000, I think Graf and other authors, they have did some analysis method. They proposed, I need to read this part. So they propose. So they proposed, they focused only on the truncated quantum Hawk Hamiltonian. So H plus minus is only quantum Hawk Hamiltonian. And they derived a global analytic conditional omega, which involves global estimates of the expansion of the boundary arguments function. So the point is it is very hard to literally verify what kind of omega you need. So analysis method. It's a global condition, so it's hard to verify. Why do you say quantum hole? I mean everything is quantum hole, no? Huh? Everything is quantum hole. Also, your system is quantum hole. I think this was for the Landau. Right, that was for Landau. This was for Landau. You mean this redoubt? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Landau have me told me. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that haven't told me. Ah, I see what you mean. You're saying, like, if I just say quantum hot. It's too general. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, when I say quantum hot, I was actually thinking about long hot, right? And another question in that paper, the result was that the edge, the emergent edge spectrum is AC. Do you actually know that in your setting? That's also an open problem. So I highly doubt it's true in general. Oh, really? Okay. Yeah. Oh okay. Yeah. Uh even if H is uh periodic, I highly doubt it's true. But yeah, it's a open problem. So that's one thing. Second, so the closest, the deepest improvement in the best results we get so far was by Ludwig and Bjong in 2022. There was also some work by Ojito in 2022. By Ojito in 2022. So they were using the algebraic and geometry methods to approach it. So they were using the coerced geometry. So they got some condition that is as long as omega is coercively equivalent to upper half plane, then you can actually show The emergence of H spectrum. So, this coarsely equivalent to upper half plan was also a global metric condition that can also be hard. It's easier than this one to visualize. It also gives you some nice regions. And however, it's still like it's a global condition and it's hard to also use the algebraic method. Yeah, so what we did is we provide a very simple, very simple sufficient condition. Very simple sufficient condition through analysis methods, through a quite easy analysis method on omega such that the verticals of H spectrum appears. So in order to talk about that, I need to give some preparations for my assumption. So first of all, everything here is short range. So when I talk about short range, H is short range. H is short range. I mean, the same as the local condition that Jeffov was having. Hxy, the kernel, decays exponentially in x minus y. So point only talks to the next ones, for example, the squared Laplacian or magnetic Laplacian. Something like that. Okay, so. Okay, so and then some notations. P lambda eight denotes the spectral projection and then lambda one denotes the upper half plane lambda two denotes the right half plane. Okay, so Okay, so with this I can give the preverse definition of the volume rise. If H is self-adjoint, short range, and the lambda doesn't belong to the spectrum of H. form of H, then this bulk E variant sigma H lambda is well defined. Trace P lambda H commutator P lambda H lambda one P lambda H lambda two that's it. Here, H. That's it. So, this formula, and for those who know such a number, they may see some similarities because if H is periodic, if H is the translation URL, this constant actually coincides with the chain number. So, it's just the chain number was defined after you do the flow quid decomposition. So, it's defined through the frequency space, through the operator in the frequency space. You pull them back to the positions. You pull them back to the position space derived this for me. So showing they're equal to each other is also not that part. Yeah. So as long as H is short range, even if it is not periodic, this is already well defined, it is already an integer. So this fact is noticed first by, I think, last time someone told me, not by graph, but by the lizard and even earlier. Yeah, even earlier. So, right. So, that's the first dilemma. Now, with this, I can use the first assumption on the bulk operator. My H plus or minus are self-adjoint, short-range, and G is a common spectral gap. And this, now it is well defined. So sigma h plus lambda better than equals to sigma. Sorry, I don't think. I think I missed. So lambda one, the claim is that the two sides are equal, right? Lambda y is the claim that if H is self-adjoint, short range, lambda doesn't belong to a spectrum, then it's well defined. So this is a definition there. Definition there. So, this equality there is a definition. It's a definition. And you need to show something like this is a trace class, and some reports you say is well defined. So, yeah. Okay. Since it's well defined, then I can maybe define this too. So, two say that are different. Also, you can see that it's a constant in a spectral gap because it depends only on the spectral projection. Why do you write that this invariant is a function of lambda? That this value is a function of lambda. It's really a function of the gap. Can you say it again? Yeah, that's what I was saying. You can see it's actually a constant in the gap. So you can also write G here. I think it's fine. Right, either way. Okay, yeah, anyway, this is the assumption for the bulk operator. Now, age operator. So I need to deal with the boundary condition. Boundary condition. Function two. So HE, I want it to be H plus in omega, H minus in omega complement. So I define it to be the following. HE is a short range, self-adjoint, short-range operator such that this one I didn't. I did find it to be He minus the operator that I really want. Okay, so this is the operator that is H plus in omega, H minus in omega complement. So I, this E basically denotes the difference of my H operator with this one. So it includes the information about the boundary conditions. About the boundary conditions. So I require this to be decaying exponentially away from the age. It's already short range, so you can also add. It doesn't really matter. Okay, so for example, this includes So for example, this includes Dirichlet boundary condition, Newman boundary condition, or other kind of like short-range boundary conditions. So I think it's a natural way to define it. Now, the function of omega. So So we say if omega is a subset of Z2, we say the filling radius of omega to be the radius of the largest ball inside omega, as expected. VRX inside omega for some X. In practice, In practice, we're using squares, but it doesn't really matter. So, for example, if this is my omega, if it's a parabolic mine, parabolic side, then you can feel off any balls of any size. Then the fielding radius is infinity. So, if it is something like a finite script, parallel is to line, then you can only fill up at slope. Then you can only fill up at most both of the radius R. Then it's a finite filling radius for this kind of only. Okay, so my assumption is if H plus minus and H E satisfy assumption one and two if If the filling radius of omega and omega complement are both infinity, then you have emergence of H spectral. So it's very easy to verify. So for example, the parabolic one we just draw, or like sectors. At some point, we're not sure whether having this. Point, we're not sure whether having this kind of shape will influence the emergence of H spectrum, but it doesn't. So, this shape, or even if you have more than one connected component and so on and forth, it doesn't matter. As long as both of them can really feel arbitrarily large balls inside both regions, then you're good. You have the emergence of age spectrum. Counter-examples include this one. If you have finite strip, If you have finite strip, finite fitting radius for omega, then you don't really know anything from this theorem. Okay, so that's a personal result. And then the natural question is precisely this case. If I have a finite filling radius, whether it is going to be true. So, because in practice, if an experimental physicist had experimental physicists, you already found the topological insulator, like the Insulator, like the actual material, so they only have finite samplings. They definitely have only finite fielding radius, not infinity. So the question is that if they have finite fielding radius, is the result still true? So first of all, you can notice that if they really have a real finite fielding radius, so say originally I have a H plus in the whole space. Now I'm changing, I have a material. Changing, I have a material in a finite size. Since I'm considering only the discrete regime, I'm actually just adding my He, which is H plus in omega, H minus in omega complement, even considering the boundary condition, is still only a finite rank perturbation of my H plus. So if H plus had a spectral. So if H plus had a spectral gap, HE, after a finite range perturbation, you can only add eigenvalues. You can never fully fill out the gap. So this is a trivial example saying that if you have a finite sampling, a finite material, then you definitely cannot fully fill out the gap by terms of age spectrum. It's impossible. However, we're still curious that even not considering Still curious that, even not considering this case, in this case, if you have a finite feeling radius case, but use an infinite region, we're still curious whether you have this phenomenon or is actually fulfilling this spectral gap. Okay, so yeah. Uh at some point I thought I had a proof and then like uh I actually found a mistake in it and uh then it results in the second result, second theorem. The second result, second theorem. It says the following. There exists a sum alpha mu R. This is the short range parameter. So it's not very intrinsically important. There exists this, such that for any radius greater than this, if the feeling radius of all we got. Feeling radius of omega and omega complement are greater than R, then this common spectral gap intersect sigma HE is alpha nu times log R over R depth inside T. Okay, so what does it what do I mean by Okay, so uh what does it what do I mean by delta dense in your set? Well, delta dense in a set is precisely as what you would imagine. If I have a set S inside a set G, I say it is delta dense if a boss of radius delta centered at S can cover G. Alright, so kind of this is my set of G, the S kind of quite well distributed and filled up the gap. So anyway, so the second theorem, mathematically, it is saying that if I have a finite field radius case, this case, although I cannot guarantee the spectral gap was fully filled, but I can guarantee that it is densely filled. But I can guarantee that it is densely another way of density, not the traditional mathematical density. Relatively densely filled. Okay, depending on R. The larger your fading radius is, the more it is really filled. So if your fainting radius is getting to infinity, you can expect that it actually fulfills the spectral gap, the original spectral gap. Yes, please. This example you just showed makes it curious what happens in the continuum where this. What happens in the continuum where this uh ball is not finite length? Yeah, so continuous and uh the ball is not finite. No, if you are working in uh L2 of R2, that perturbation is not finite length anymore. Yes, yes, precisely. Yeah, I don't know yet. So at some point we wanted to continue doing the continuous model and then halfway we decided to do bulk age correspondence. So yeah, we didn't proceed on continuous case. We didn't post it on continuous case, but yeah, I don't know the answer. But yeah, it's an interesting question. Yeah, so maybe under the continuous regime, they will still correct to fully fill the spectral gap. Yeah. So yeah, mathematically, this is just the same, right? In this case, you expect relatively dense field of your spectral gap. Of your spectrogap. So, physically, we also give it an explanation. So, this is saying that because in practice, the experimental physicists, they detect closure of spectral gap, or they detect the spectral spectrum by detecting the density of state mirror. So, they have certain kind of equipment that they can use to measure the density of state mirror. They use that to say, okay, the the spectrum is here. The spectrum is here. So, if their device of mirroring have an arrow, so up to a certain precision, as long as my R is large enough such that this is smaller than the arrow of the device, then they cannot tell. Then they will think that the spectral gap is actually already fulfilled. But in practice, it may not be. That's the physical interpretation. That's a physical interpretation. And however, this result is not really saying that it's definitely not going to be fully filled. Because fully filled is also delta dense. So then the next natural step is to ask ourselves, like, okay, so in a finite filling radius case, is it really fully filled or are there counterexamples? So it turns out that there are counterexamples. So it's not always fully filled. Always will be true. So third thing would be if R is large enough for any omega inside those kind of finite strips. There in this H plus minus and H E satisfies the function one and two such that zero the belongs to the spectrum of H. Belows to the spectrum of H plus minus, and it's still not closed yet. So, yeah, it's a little bit vague if I wrote it this way. Actually, the H plus minus that we found. Yeah, please. Okay, yes, the H plus and minus that we found have a spectral gap at zero. Have a spectral gap at zero, common spectral gap at zero, and H plus minus have different turn numbers there. So if it's gonna be fully filled, then zero should belong to the spectrum of H, but it doesn't. So this is a kind of example showing that finite fitting radius tastes. You may actually have the spectral gap still stays there, not going to be close. So the terminal Coast. So the term example that we're using actually is a super famous one. This is the so-called Haudeneg model. So I will not write the explicit formula, but just explain to you what it was. So the honeycomb lattice can be viewed as This kind of unicell, one red dot and one blue dot. If you like, you can bring the age, but I'm really talking about the lattice point, so you think about it as one red dot, one blue dot, shifting with respect to A1 and A2. So if you keep shifting with So if you keep shifting with respect to A1Z plus A2Z, you actually get the full honeycomb lattice. So eventually you end up with some lattice points are blue, some lattice points are red. So H0 here is the traditional Connecticut lattice model. You allow the nearest hobby. The nearest hopping. So I allow each particle on this lattice point hopping to the nearest three lattice points. The same for the red spots. If my particle was here, I allow them to hop to the nearest three. That one is denoted by H0. Okay, so I will not give the formula, but that's what it was talking about. And then S. What is S? S is the hopping to the second nearest point. Nearest the point. So let's look at the blue spot. Nearest three are red. The second nearest are this one, this one, this one, this one, this one, and this one. So there are six points. So S denotes the following operator. I allow hopping in this way, from this one to this one. It's a directed directional hopping. Oh, this one hop back. And then this one. This one I'll just draw this one this one hop back this one hop hop out inwards So S denotes this kind of operator plus and minus just denotes a different direction Okay, so if you have this kind of H plus and minus it's easy to check because it's actually a periodic operator It's easy to check zero doesn't belong to the spectrum And the trend number can be computed. Actually, that's the point of developing Hauden model. The trend number will be different. And yeah, then by a scattering theory argument, we can also show that zero doesn't belong to the spectrum of HE. So it really makes it a counter example. So I guess I'm out of time to talk about the uh sketch of rules. So yeah, that will be it. So yeah, I love it. Questions for Shawin? In your counter example, can you draw a picture of this omega page? My final example of omega? Yeah, so this is a finite strip, any omega inside. Yeah, so uh for example if you have finite and then you're just adding some eigenvalues. It's definitely not interesting. It's definitely not interesting. So, for example, you can consider this kind of omega. Right. It's saying that zero is still not H for any kind of omega that sits inside the screen. It's a kind of uncertainty. Actually, both of the proof, the first two results and the third one, are very intuitive. But I run out of time to talk about it. Sorry, Maul. Sorry, Mal. If you take omega to be the uncertainty principle, I think. Yeah. Take omega to be the entire strip that your result also holds. Yeah, yeah, the result also holds. Then you somehow expect that the edge currents are turning in opposite directions. So why is the edge current actually empty? So I think like originally Alexi also told me that intuition. It's like you have one edge state propagating this way, the other one propagating this way, they cancel each other. They are the one propagating this way, they cancel each other, right? So, what we showed is that, okay, now there's just a no-H-spectrum. So, mathematically, there's no point talking about H states. So, right, like then, yeah, there's no point of talking about that kind of intuition canceled it out, or it is a result of that intuition that it cancels out. Cancels out means that the child. Cancels out means that the chill number inside is zero. I follow those arguments as well. I cannot mathematically, rigorously understand that kind of statement that plus one and minus one cancels out. Say something then about this scattering theory. Oh yeah, the reason why? Yeah, so basically I think of HE as the following. So I started with H plus, now I added something here. Here. So I have H plus outside, H minus inside. And H plus and H minus only differ by S. Right? Because Y is H0 plus S, Y is H0 minus S. So my HE, if I want it to be like this, I can just think of it as H plus or the minus 2S inside here. Right, if I actually if I define it this way, you can check the boundary condition that operator decays exponentially away from the boundary, so it satisfies the condition. The assumption. So this is my H operator. Now what I wanted to show, I wanted to show that zero doesn't belong to the spectrum of this one. So I wanted to show it's invertible. H plus it already has spectral gap here, so it's already invertible. Now I wanted to say that this is a small perturbation. Say that this is a small perturbation. This operator s acting on one omega, then acting on u. So basically, s was acting on some function that is only supported inside omega. So if u is supported inside omega, then it's in the position space vertically. It is localized. It's only supported here, not outside. So it's localized. If it's localized in the position space, If it's localized in the position space, that means if you do a Fourier transform, it is quite sparse, not really localized in the frequency space. However, in order to make this H plus, you can write out the Fourier transform, try to figure out where the eigenvalue may vanish. And it only vanishes if the frequency is very close to two specific points. This localized in This localized the in position space prohibits it from localizing in the frequency space as well, so that it will not really be a large perturbation. That's a rough idea. So, actually, there are many kind of examples. If I got one more minute, can I say the bottom problem? Yeah, because there was a problem. Yeah, because there was a lot of... Obviously, there will be a session, open-code session. And then it will be. Yeah, yeah, okay. So in that case, let's thank Shaw and again.
