I should follow the question. Okay. Hi then. The stage is all yours. So whenever, whenever. Okay, thank you very much for the nice introduction earlier this morning or afternoon, depending where you are. I'm going to talk about the interior of a black hole, the interior of a black hole. Of a black hole, the interior of a black hole that has newly formed as a result of the merger of two smaller black holes. And in particular, I'm going to talk about the parent horizons, dynamical horizons, and other horizon-like structures that we found in this interior region in this highly non-linear dynamical regime. I will first of all make a very few remarks why it is interesting to look at. Remarks why it is interesting to look at this interior at all, in addition to analyzing the horizons, which is interesting in itself, I think. But also, one point is that if the R is a suitable description of black holes, not only in the outer region, but also in some interior region, some part of the interior region, then this kind of structure exists in reality. This happens all the time at the cold scenario. So it's in itself interesting to find out what happens there. To find out what happens there, at least from the numerical perspective, here. The other thing is that we found quite a few of interesting properties that these objects have, these horizons in the interior, which were not really taken into account in the past from the mathematical side. So they have been proofs for certain kinds of properties which do not work for our case because we don't satisfy the assumptions. So I think it's interesting to So, I think it's interesting to give the mathematical side some insight into what kind of objects to expect and what properties they have. And the third point is, well, the gravitational waves that get generated in the vicinity of the source of the larger, etc., they travel to infinity for us to measure, but they also travel to the inside. So, there's supposed to be some correlation that we may be able to determine or find out some kind of imprint of this gravitational. Kind of imprint of this gravitational wave source on this interior structure. So that's also another point why we look at the interior here. Okay, now I will not talk too much about these philosophical topics in the remainder of the talk, but more on our numerical results. So this talk will be a little bit different than some of the other or many of the other talks in that we will look at many results that we have, not so much on the mathematical side. On the mathematical side, but as I said, this may have an effect on the mathematical side. Okay, now I will present just the basic introduction to what kind of objects I'm talking about. And the basic object that all this machinery is built on is the marginally outer track surface or mods. You will hear, we often say that I mods. In this talk, this is just a smooth, closed, space-like two-surface. A smooth closed space-like two-surface which has vanishing outward expansion, and this expansion can be interpreted intuitively, like if you shoot light rays to the outside in normal direction, then if the expansion is positive, the light rays diverge. That's the usual thing for a sphere in flat space. If the expansion is negative, then the light rays converge. And if it's zero, then they just say parallel integers are nothing. And traditionally, in the numerical relativity community, we call the outermost parts that we find. So we have several of these that may be contained, one within another. The outermost one we just call the current horizon. And this is in relatively good agreement, not perfect agreement, but it's relatively closely related to the notion of a parent horizon as originally defined. Horizon as originally defined by Bawking, who says the parent horizon is the outer boundary of the trapped region of some Cauchy spice, and the trapped region is just the region of points through which trapped surfaces go. Here, I hope you can see the mouse cursor. Here on this slide, we see two of these masses. These are two spheres. So, this means we have two black holes here in this case. Codes here in this case, and what I would do on these slides is just that I cut these open and draw just a cross-section. This way, we get another dimension which we can use to represent time. And we can see that this is already a numerical simulation of two black holes merging. We have two black holes approaching each other. And whenever you have a mods that traces out some world cube in time, and then this is actually a three-surface that is fully. This is actually a three surface that is foliated by MOSIS, and this is called a marginally outer trap tube. And this marginally outer trap tube is the basic building block of the various kinds of horizons that you may look at. For instance, they are the essential object in the quasi-local horizon framework when they are space-like and have also boxes that are future, so they have negative ingoing expansion. So, they have negative ingoing expansion, then that's dynamical horizon. But we will see many other examples of these marginally auto-tracked tubes that have other properties. Okay, now, okay, that works. One thing in this simulation here is many numerical people know this, and also many of the others, but just to make it obvious here. Obvious here, we have a jump in the definition of what the apparent horizon is. If you just call the outermost marks the apparent horizon, so we have the individual apparent horizons at the beginning, and then at some point, a common horizon forms around these. And this common horizon is then called the apparent horizon of the remnant black hole. And this settles down to a curve or a Schwarzschild horizon, depending on whether you have spin and angular momentum. However, this outer horizon. However, this outer horizon also has an inner branch. So it forms in kind of bifurcation of two horizons, one traveling to the outside, one traveling to the inside. And there has been a question mark here or a question, what happens in the interior? This was not really resolved for purely numerical reasons. And in the past, we have answered part of this question, namely, whether the two individual Whether the two individual horizons connect with the random horizon in some way without having to jump. And this was accomplished in, I think, 2018, yes. And afterwards, the second half of this question mark, I think, has been answered, and I will show the results of this talk. By the way, I've looked at these plots that I'm going to show so often that if anything is unclear, I may miss it. So please interrupt me and just. So, please interrupt me and just ask, and we can discuss everything that I'm showing here. Okay, now to continue this basic picture, I will show a little animation or not an animation, it's actually a visualization of the simulation of two black holes merging. And this will just show the first half of this question arc. So, we see the world shifts here forming, and we also see at this point, or shortly before that. Point or shortly before that, the two horizons have formed in this bifurcation here. And we can continue this simulation and see that this inner horizon closely hugs the two other horizons. And at this point here, the individual horizons touch. They have one common point, and the inner common mods coincide with these. So that's the picture that we have. So that's the picture that we have: that the two individual marginally autotroph tubes of the two individual black holes connect non-smoothly, but still continuously with a remnant horizon in this way. But interestingly enough, we can continue this simulation and we found that these surfaces don't vanish at that point, they continue to exist and develop very interesting properties. Interesting properties. So, this has shown that there is a continuous sequence, and this has also shown that there are MOSSE with shelf intersections, which is an interesting thing in itself. Now, when we want to find out what happens to the remainder, what happens in the next step here, how can we resolve the fate of these horizons? It turned out that it was necessary to get rid of one numerical. To get rid of one numerical aspect that made this very difficult to resolve, namely that we need initial guesses for resolving the surfaces. Because when you need an initial guess to resolve the surface, then you are limited by your imagination to the surfaces that you can imagine that exist in these space-times. So, what we did was we started developing a method that, or actually two methods with which we Two methods with which we can find mods that we did not anticipate to find in these simulations. And the first is based on an idea that is already around quite some time, but this has been formulated in this case here in a very interesting way, which we can numerically explore very easily. Namely, it is a shooting method that is based on the following ideas. If you have a The following idea: if you have a mods that is axisymmetric, then you can represent the whole information of this mods just by some curve, the surface of revolution, the mods then. And the condition that the surface of revolution is a mods is then translated to a condition on this curve. And this condition can be formulated as two coupled second-order ordinary differential equations for this curve. Curve and these differential equations we call a modzodesic equation, and the curves that satisfy these equations are oxides. Now, what you can do is just start at some point and integrate this Mozodisic equation to find a curve that satisfies this equation. And if you look at this first picture here, you see there is some starting point on the symmetry axis. We have two punctures here. We have two punctures here. These are again Berlinquist configurations. So we have two black holes. And we see that this curve curves around in this slice here, but then ultimately goes off to infinity. So this is not a MOX because it's not a closed surface. Instead, it's a marginally outer trapped open surface, no toss. And when we wiggle the starting point a little bit, we can make this curve close. We can make this curve close on the symmetry axis. And in that case, we have fountain mods because the surface of revolution will be a smooth surface with zero expansion. And this idea basically has changed our problem, which was infinite dimensional, the space of all possible initial guesses of surfaces in this slice, to a one-dimensional problem. We just have to scan the symmetry axis and shoot off rays. Symmetry axis and shoot of rays to find all the possible mods. And this is computationally feasible. We can just go to this one axis and find all the mods here. And then we also have a second method. The second method to resolve mods is based on quite a different idea. This is based on, or I will explain it with an example here. Let's say we have one mods here, S2. Then, what we can do is construct surfaces of constant expansion. So, recall a mod status expansion zero, but we can also create surfaces that have a non-zero expansion, but constant expansion. And starting with S2 as initial guess for these surfaces, we can find close by surfaces. And this way, we can construct a whole family of surfaces with constant expansion. And what we can then do is try to. Is try to resolve the whole family, or at least as far as we can get. And this shows the result when starting from S2, the smaller, the larger individual horizon. We see that the expansion goes up and up until we reach some maximum. And if we can get across this maximum, then it may get down again. And here we end up with a surface of zero expansion. So this is another MOS, which we call. mods which we call s2 star because it's connected with s2 via these um this family of surfaces of concept expansion but but was s2 also a mod or it was just a guess what was s2 s2 is also a mods so we can start we can we can do this for any mods that we find we can try to construct this family of surfaces of constant expansion which naturally will depend upon the choice of line model which a mods does not depend upon MOTS does not depend on the scaling of that one. But this, from the numerical perspective, this is just one way to try to resolve more mods. This seemed to be very successful in this case here. So the method two does not require any Brillinquish data. This is much more general than method one. Is that right? Method two does not require actually method one also works in any general data. You just need to have You just need to have access to the tree. And method two works in fully generic cases, even without any. We have actually not yet used method two to resolve MOX's without axisymmetry, but in principle, this should work just fine. And yeah, continue. Basically, based on that command, we can continue with S2 star. With S2 star and try to resolve another MOS. And this was successful in this case. So, what we get in the end is the family of surfaces of constant expansion shown here in this plot in the lower right corner. And this family is shown here as a parametric plot on the area versus expansion plane. And this curve here, whenever this goes through zero, through zero expansion, you're found another. Through zero expansion, you have found another MOX. So we were not numerically able to continue this curve much further than these dotted points here, but at least we found three new MOXs that we did not anticipate. So this is the other method I was talking about. Now, whenever you have found the MOS at some point during the simulation, what you can then do is simply take that MOS and try to track it in the simulation by taking the MOX itself. By taking the mods itself as initial guess for the next time step. So, this way we can resolve from we can start with the mods that is easy to resolve, like this one, and get all the way down to something that is extremely hard to resolve numerically. But basically, the mods carries its own initial guess with it, which makes it very easy to resolve. Okay, now let's try to apply this method to our simulation of two merging. Simulation of two merging black holes head-on, and what we found initially is just the four MOSSE that we expected. That's all quite nice. This is two different times of the same simulation. And when we applied our method, we saw this. So, this is really an interesting picture of many, many MOPSs, and immediately you have to ask questions. And immediately, you have to ask questions what this all means. So, first of all, maybe the first question is: what do these models have to do with the title of this talk, Resolving the Ultimate Fate of an Occurrence Horizon? And spoiler alert, they do help resolving the fate. They will be the main component. But the other question is, maybe more importantly, what do all these surfaces mean? What role do they play in with merger, and how can we interpret them? And also, Interpret them and also, um, I mean, we have the surfaces S1, S2, and S outer, which clearly have some physical interpretation as the horizons of the black holes that merge the random horizon. How can we differentiate between mods like these new ones and these original mods? And that will be the second question that I will address after the first. So, first of all, let me resolve the fate of Me resolve the fate of one of the individual parameterizers of the individual black holes. And to do this, I have another movie, which hopefully plays on Zoom. On the left side, we will see the area of the curves, then of the mods that we have plotted on the right side. So this will be clear when I play the video. And here we see that we have the bifurcation of other models. The bifurcation of other monsters. These monsters will play a role in resolving fate of S2. And indeed, we were surprised but happy when we saw that S2 is actually annihilated by some other horizon-like world tube of a MOS. And this And this, let me go back to this point here. Yeah, here we see the annihilation that S2 actually gets annihilated in the interior. This is well after the common horizon has formed. So there is a common horizon outside all of everything that happens here in the inside, which I'm not showing here to not confuse too many curves here. One thing I should note at this point is, if we go to this point, Go to this point, and there's one of the curves that fades out and is not continued here. This curve here, and this is for very well understood numerical reasons, because if you look at the plot here of this curve, then you see that it gets really, really close to the puncture region of our simulation. And this, so it coordinates close to the puncture, and this is numerically unresolved, so we cannot hope to get to. Hope to get too close to it in our numerical coordinates. So that's a clear numerical reason, but we don't expect that the curve ends here, the area curve should continue. And we have reasons to believe that it may continue weaving back and forth indefinitely. And that's actually also the second point I want to mention here. This inhalation here is so smooth that you can interpret the whole red curve. The whole red curve is one continuous and even smooth world tube of a MOS that weaves back and forth in time. And we try to visualize this weaving in time in another video where we see this world cube cut open for better visualization, but we see that it moves forwards in time and then turns around in time and develops very weird shapes during. Time and develops very weird shapes during the merger. And yeah, that's the final state we could confidently resolve the mods in the merger. So now I guess the most pressing question is what does it all mean? How can we interpret the mods and do they all represent some kind of backhole boundary or not? And to address this question, we will take a look at the property that we called. Property that we called or that is called the barrier property of a MOS. And here again, I will show a few surfaces of constant expansion around a MOS. And in this case, you see that there is surfaces that have negative expansion that lie on the inside, surfaces with positive expansion that lie on the outside. And the mod seems to be some kind of demarcation between these two. Between these two regions. And mathematically, if you can show that there is a neighborhood of a MOS such that every untrapped surface files on the outside and every trapped surface lies on the inside when it is contained in this neighborhood. Then this MOSFE has what is called the barrier property. And I interpret this barrier property as some kind of local version of the notion of hawking that Motz is. Notion of hawking that mods is somehow the boundary of the trapped region because, in a sense, this is showing a local trapped region in a local sense, and we have a boundary. However, if we now take a look at one of these more weird pots, of which we hope that it's out of a hole boundary or something, and we look at this highly deformed upper part, then we can also draw these surfaces of constant expansion, and indeed they. Expansion and indeed they intersect the mods multiple times. And these intersections show that there is no way in which we can define some even local trapped region of which this mods is a boundary. So I would say that this is some kind of way to demarcate the physically meaningful mods from the physically perhaps also meaningful mods, but not in the sense that they are they hold boundaries. I don't know what they would represent here. So What they would represent here. So, in this case, the barrier property is not satisfied. Now, from a numerical perspective, it's not very satisfactory to just say that a mods should have the barrier property because it's not easy to test that in itself numerically. But fortunately, there's a very close connection of this barrier property with a mod stability. And the stability operator, I will now introduce here, just to the extent that we need it here, the stability operator has many. We need it here. The stability operator has many other uses and can show smoothness of the evolution of the mods and other things. But I will now focus here on this connection between the stability and the barrier property. So the stability operator is a linear second-order elliptic operator that is usually not self-adjoint. So this makes the problem of finding the spectrum difficult and you need to spectrum analysis. To spectrum analysis, etc. That's one thing you can do. However, in our case, we don't have any spin and angular momentum, so this operator becomes much more simple to evaluate numerically and becomes self-adjoint. So just for the interpretation, what it does, it's basically the variation of the expansion of the surface under some deformation in some outward direction. And the deformation itself is controlled by some state. Controlled by some scalar function on box. The factor of two is here just because of our choice of my normal scaling. This doesn't change anything about the spectrum. It's just here for consistency with our papers. But don't worry about the factor here. You can show that this variation here can be computed quite easily with just terms that you know on the mods, the Ritchie scalar, the shear square. The Ritchie scalar, the shear squared, and what in our case becomes the Laplacian of the knots. And then you can formulate the eigenvalue problem and try to find the spectrum of this operator here. The interesting point now is that if the principal eigenvalue of the spectrum, which is the eigenvalue with the smallest real part and is guaranteed to be real even in the mountain size adjoint case, if this principal eigenvalue is positive. this principal eigenvalue is positive then the MOX is called strictly stable by definition and it then has the barrier property and on the other hand a MOS that has the barrier property and also has a non-negative principal eigenvalue so for us in the numerical world we can just compute the spectrum of the stability operator and if the principal eigenvalue is positive then we know that it's a black hole boundary in that sense that it is a local That it is a local boundary of the tribe region. Okay, now let's return to this picture here that we had of the merger, or at least of the fate of S2. We see here that initially S2 has a positive principal eigenvalue, that the eigenvalue becomes zero precisely at the point where it is annihilated, and that this world tube of S2 star has a principal eigenvalue that is negative. As a principal eigenvalue that is negative. And similarly, at the point where S2 star bifurcates with S2 star star, these are actually all the mods that were connected via this family of constant expansion surfaces. And here at this bifurcation, it's the next higher eigenvalue that drops below zero. So the general picture that we find is that when you have such a curve that weaves its way back and forth in time, and anytime it turns out, And anytime it turns around in time, it gets another negative eigenvalue of the stability operator. Oh, by the way, you may wonder what S1 is doing down here. It doesn't seem to be connecting to anything up here, but that's just a numerical thing. We suppose that S1 will merge much, much later in the simulation, which is very hard to resolve because it's smaller and closer to the puncture region again. Puncture region again coordinates. So we have some numerical indication. I would say good numerical indication that it does the same thing. But if anyone is interested, we can take a look at the plots later on. They don't look as nice as these ones, but still we take them as numerical evidence of these things. Could I ask a quick question here? You mentioned your result of 2018, in which you saw that S1 and S2, how there's a continuous one-path. There's a continuous one-parallel family of marginal trapped surfaces which join on to the outer one. So, this stars that you have here, S2 star, S2 double star, and so on, they never join on to the outer one. Is that right? That's right. That's right. Later on, they don't join. You can, of course, go from S2 star star backwards, this curve, up to the point where it meets. Up to the point where it meets with as inner with the inner common mods, and so you can this one will not at some later time work. More and more complicated shapes, as we will see on the next few slides. Okay, now I've only shown the plate of one of these, but we found a few more ounces. So let's take a look at the full. So let's take a look at the full picture that we find. And we will do this again in terms of the area first. We have here plotted what we knew before. So we have the two individual mods, how their area behaves, and we have the common mods as it bifurcates with this outer and inner branch. And what we find now is that we can complete these curves, but we also found a few more curves of the area of other horizon-like objects. Of other horizon-like objects that appear and bifurcate all. I have to say, these bifurcations of the new surfaces all appear after the common horizon is formed. And this is all in the inside in the interior. Even though the areas appear to be larger, they are larger. They're still in the inside. That's perfectly possible if it moves around in complicated shapes. And here's our analysis of the Here's our analysis of the lowest eigenvalues of the stability operator, the lowest Q that explained what happens here. So, here this upper part shows the various bifocations that we were able to resolve in this lower part the angulations that we resolved. One thing that is interesting perhaps is that from the mathematical side, I think the proof was that the bifurcations and elations of state. Bifurcations and annihilations of stable MOTS, it is the principal eigenvalue that goes to zero. But what we find is that in the various bifurcations and annihilations of the already unstable MOTS, it is some of the higher eigenvalues that go through zero. So this is again the same thing I mentioned previously, that whenever this curve turns around, you get another negative eigenvalue. And so there is no reason to believe these don't continue to read back. Believe these don't continue to read back and forth. But still, after some finite time, there is no what's left here except for the outer horizon. Okay, now we can take another look at this plot that I had at the beginning, this time augmented with the stability information. So, this plot shows again all the MOTS that we did find. That we did find at two different times of our simulation. And the number of negative eigenvalues of the stability operator is now encoded in the lighter colors. So the lighter the curve is and thinner, the higher the number of negative eigenvalues. So the more unstable we call these monsters. And the only ones that are really stable and have a positive principal eigenvalue are S1, S2, and S alta. S1, S2, and S outer, the previously known MOTSES, and they are the important ones. And SINNA, the inner common branch of the outer horizon, turned out to belong to this other family of MOTS that is unstable and of which we have our large class. Okay, now could you just put your cursor on S inner here in one of the figures? Where is the S in? Figures. Where is A Sina? Yeah. Acina is this one here that starts here and traces this path. It is close to many of the other MOXs that we have here. This way and down here. So it is still on the outside of S1, S2, but inside S out. And thank you. Okay. And that's actually already. And that's actually already an interesting point in itself. Namely, we found that there are several cases in which MOTS touch at one point and then start to intersect. And each time this happens, we find that at the point where the MOTS is touched, they coincide with one of the other MOTS, which develops a cusp at that point. And when these go through each other, it develops another self-intersection. So let's take a look at an example here. Here we have at different times. Have at different times just four modzes, four of the many that we found as one, has two, the two individual ones, and then one in the interior here. And the first thing that we found already in 2018 was that when S1 and S2 meet close to this time here, then they coincide with the inner branch of the outer horizon, but shortly afterwards, S2 meets with these interior mouths. With this interior mouse at one point, and here we have the two examples: so s1 and s2 meet, and we have s inner having cusp. This is very close to the point where the cusp forms. We cannot really resolve it numerically at that point. We can just go very close to this point and we can find the mods again afterwards and see that it has self-intersection. And the second example is this interior mods. This interior mods, this is a slightly later time, whereas two S1 C, we called it, because it's the third hots in the interior that we found. And here it coincides at the point where these two touch with what we call as inner star star, which is basically the outer horizon after it has turned around once, twice, thrice, I think, yes, three times. And it has a cusp that. And it has a cusp at this point and another self-intersection afterwards. And this is sort of, I would say, compatible with the results of Ivan Ruth and collaborators in earlier papers, where they found actually MOSS with many self-intersections in the interior of a slice of a Schwarzschild horizon. So, this may be a way to dynamically generate these kinds of surfaces with many. Generate these kinds of surfaces with many self-intersections. When it reaches back and forth in time, we expect to find more and more self-intersections in these surfaces. From the point of view of the stability analysis, we empirically, so not yet from a mathematical perspective, explain, but just what we find in the simulations is that when you have two MOXAs, S prime and S prime prime, with prime and s prime prime with n prime and n prime prime being the number of negative eigenvalues of the stability operator and then the common mods that coincides with these as one more negative eigenvalue than the sum of these two that happens in all the cases in our case i don't know if that's a rule um but this is just one of the results that we found interesting wanted to state um okay Okay, then another curiosity that we were able to find is this. This is a MOS in the interior of S2 here, which does not have spherical topology, but torohidal topology. This was not so easy to find because actually you cannot scan the one-dimensional symmetry axis to find this one, but have to assume somehow based on Somehow, based on the shapes of the other monsters that we had, we sort of figured out there may be something in that region here, and we tried to locate it and actually found it and could track it through the evolution. And this MOS has multiple negative eigenvalues of the stability operator, so it's again not something physically interpretable, or at least not easy to interpret. But still, it's, I think, an interesting example. I think an interesting example of things you can find in the interior here. Doesn't this one arise over this floor of a block? This is actually something quite different. So we find a few masses that appear in the interior of the two individual black holes even before the common horizon appears. The common horizon appears, and we find these even in simulations of Schwarzschild. So, this is something in the interior region which might be connected to this other research where you have in Schwarzschild space-time slices with many interior masses. But they still play a role in this whole merger thing because of this what I said, that when two touch, they develop, they coincide with a common. Coincides with the common lots at that point. And it appears to not turn around in time. We could not resolve any reading here. But actually, one thing that I did not plot here is the marginally inner-trapped surface. So this is like a mods, just that the ingoing expansion vanishes. And this one here is the mids. The marginally innot surface is here in the interior of all these. And since our Berlinqueus data has these asymptotically flat ends at the punctures, you can interpret these marginally innot surfaces as the apparent horizons for observers living in these asymptotically flat regions. And they see a perturbed rustial black hole that settles down from their perspective. Okay. Okay, now onto some other properties that we've found on these surfaces. This is the outer horizon and the inner horizon, which connect at the bottom here. This is the bifurcation, but I'm showing these individually. And we see here in colors, blue, the fact that the ingoing expansion, so the expansion of the ingoing non-normals, is negative, and in red, the Negative, and in red, the areas where the ingoing expansion is positive. And for the outer common mods, we see that there is a tiny little patch here, which is sort of a ring around the equator of the opparent horizon, where it briefly has positive ingoing expansion. And this region here connects smoothly with the same region of S ina here. And in terms of ingoing expansion of S inner and S inner star, these two connect at the top here. And here, it's again, it's impossible to plot this meaningfully so that you can really understand how the geometry looks because it's just too complicated for us in a star. But maybe you can make out that there is a few more areas here where the ingoing expansion becomes positive. That's one of the properties of these unstable MOXs that seems to develop. That seems to develop generically here. The other thing is the signature of these horizons. And for the stable ones, S1, S2, and S outer, the signature is space-like throughout. There is no tiny patch or anything. These are space-like horizons. For the unstable ones, the signature seems to flip around in interesting ways. It is always space-like at the point where they turn around in time. Like at the point where they turn around in time, because the interpretation is they are tangent to the Cauchy slice at that point, so they need to be space-like. But this region here is very small for S-inner here at the top, but they have signature changes throughout and also here as inner for signature changes. And maybe the interesting thing from a mathematical perspective is that these signature changes are due to. Signature changes are due to properties of these horizons which were assumed to not be possible. So if you assume a few non-restrictive properties of these horizons, then not every kind of signature change is possible. I'm not going into the technical details here. That's a topic for another talk, but this is an interesting fact, and I think this is something that would. This is something that would be interesting for the mathematical side to know which kind of objects they are working with when they want to go into this interior region. For the outer ones, it's all fine. They are purely space-like, but here we have more complicated structure in this interior. Okay, I think I should summarize at this point. We have new methods to resolve MOTS with very unexpected features, unexpected shapes. We found antihalations and bifurcations. Anyhow, bifurcations. We've resolved the fate of the individual horizons. And I think, most importantly, we found that it's actually quite rare for a MOTS to be stable, to be strictly stable, and that only three of the MOTS in this whole space-time, or at least with respect to this volation of space-time. So in our simulation, only three mods can be thought of as black hole boundaries. And well, generically, we know which kinds of objects can appear, so we know what to look for when we go to fully generic cases without any symmetries. But that will be an interesting topic anytime. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Daniel. So, do we have any questions for Daniel? We have plenty of time. I have just a quick technical question. Maybe just have an idea.
