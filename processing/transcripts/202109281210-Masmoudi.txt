To thank the organizers for inviting me. It's a really pleasure and an honor to give this talk. So I'll be talking a little bit about invisib dumping. I'll be recalling a result now, maybe six years ago with Jacob and And two more recent results with UDANC and Verenza. I try to go a little bit fast on some of the introduction. I mean, usually like in fluids these days, I mean, these are kind of problems we are usually interested in, stability, long-time behavior, transition between amino and turbulent, singularity. Singularity, formation of singularity, and so on. I mean, there is an interplay between analysis, numerics, experiments. I mean, this is kind of pictures we see about stability of vortex. This is a red spot of Jupiter, the transition between laminar and turbulent flows and boundary layer separation. I will not be talking about boundary layer today. Be talking about boundary layer today. This is like a plan of the talk. I go a little bit fast on the beginning, but then I'll spend more time on this work with Veyran. I mean, this is like a classical experiment, maybe one of the most famous experiments in fluid mechanics, the Reynolds experiment. So the idea about this. So, the idea about this experiment is to study the transition between laminar and turbulent flow. And it comes with a lot of with an important paradox in fluids. And again, I'm not going to talk too much about this experiment, but I like always to recall this because I think it's an important. Because I think it's an important thing that maybe sometimes we don't realize. Like when we take, for instance, Navier strokes with a small viscosity, what we expect, we should expect that if the initial data is small compared to the viscosity to some power, we get stability. But if it is larger, then that same value may have some sort of instability. May have some sort of instability. And this gamma is what we call like the stability threshold. And I mean, nowadays, this is really a very active area of research for different kind of flows, different kind of spaces. So it's very exciting. I mean, there are also there is experiment, there are numerics. Experiment, there are numerics, applied mathematicians also trying to guess these values of gamma. I'll go fast on this, maybe. I mean, these are, I mean, I have several contributions in this area about trying to evaluate what is the value of the right value of gamma for different kind of flows. Different kinds of flows. Today, what I'll be talking about is related to the inviscid dumping. Inviscid dumping, meaning is the case where I'm taking the viscosity to be zero. Okay, so I'm not going to talk about the viscosity, so that corresponds to this first result with Jacob. And then the last result is a result with Vehran about extending the inviscid dumping from Quet to general monotone flows. Similar result. I mean, like we heard the talk of GIA on a similar result. Okay. Again, Again, I mean, this area about stability and stability of influid mechanics is very prosperous area with result about not only inviscid dumping but also linearization around vortex. Also, I should add the recent work of UNESCO and GIA. UNESCO and GIA. Also, important result of Wei Zank and Zao on vorticity depletion. Maybe I'll go fast on this. And of course, inviscid dumping has a brother, I would say, in plasma physics, which is Landau dumping. And maybe like And maybe, like the start of invisit dumping was, I think, motivated by the work of Moho and Vilani on Lando dumping, maybe now 10 years ago. Okay, now let me start talking about Euler, like the implicit case. So this is the Euler equation. The Euler equation in vorticity, we get you just take the curve, you get rid of the pressure, so you get the fact that the vorticity is just transported. And if now look at Euler in 2D, we have a family of stationary solutions, which are shear flows. Shear flows means that the first component. Flows means that the first component is just a function of y. The first component is just a function of y. And then, if one takes looks at the vorticity, it will be minus u prime of y. And the particular case, u of y equal y, you get omega equal minus one. This is the so-called wet flow. An important question, very natural question is. Very natural question: Is these solutions stable? I mean, it's a very natural question. Are these solutions stable? So, meaning that if you perturb one of these stationary solutions, do you stay close to it, or something else happen? Something else happens. So, and then the next question is: do we have asymptotic? Do we have asymptotic stability? Do we converge back to this stationary solution? Okay. Now, if one looks at the perturbation, so okay if one looks at the perturbation, so if One looks at the perturbation. So, if I perturb around one of these shear flows, this is, yeah, sorry. So, if I perturb around the quet flow, I'm going to perturb around quet flow. So, if one perturbs around the quad flow, this is the equation one will get. You will get the fact that your omega is being transported by the quet, and this is the non-linear term now. This equation is linearly stable. This equation is linearly stable, we don't have growing modes. However, even if it is, let's say, stable, but the non-linear term will have very important effect, meaning that we cannot say that solutions are decaying exponentially. So, it's in a sense, it is really at the boundary between stability and instability. Instability. Now, to state the result with Jacob, we introduce Jouvre spaces. These are the natural spaces to study the nonlinear problem. So, Jouver spaces are you can think about them as spaces. You can think about the mass spaces between C infinity and analytic. Usually, analytic regularity means that the Fourier transform decays exponentially. Jouvre regularity means that the Fourier transform decays like exponential minus a constant times the Fourier variable to the power s. S will be between zero and one. I mean, this is a definition. I mean, this is a definition on the Fourier side. There is also a similar definition on the physical side. Okay, now the result with Jacob says that if one takes an initial data, which is small in this Joufre space, then we can solve. Then we can solve for all times. Not only can we solve for all times, but omega will stay small in a Jouvre space where the lambda becomes smaller. So the lambda is the value you put here. So it means that there may be a little bit of growth. Bit of growth, there is a little bit of growth, but controlled growth, which is allowed. Here, to stay in this jouvre space, I mean, it's necessary to filter the transport. I mean, as we saw also in the talk of GIA, is that I mean, clearly, a term like this, a term like this, one has to filter the effect of this term. Turns out that not only you will filter the effect of this transport, but you will take also part of this non-linear term. And that's the reason behind this sort of change of coordinates. So you have to be You have to be in the right coordinate system so that you stay bounded in this space. So this psi of y is y plus something coming from the non-linear effect. Okay, so this is first part of the result. The first part of the result. The second part of the result is what we call asymptotic stability, the fact that this omega, again, written in the right coordinate system, will converge back to a final profile. And it comes with the epsilon square here. I mean, just to remember it, the epsilon square here means that the Means that one can think about omega as this final thing plus terms which are more like non-linear terms. Now, the proof of this result has many features in it. The main feature is to use a well-adapted norm. Norm that we say mimics some of the growth that can happen in the system. So I will say that there will be two main ingredients. One ingredient which is understanding the right change of coordinate, making the right change of coordinate, like Change of coordinate, like which is this idea of profile. So you have to be in the right coordinate system so that you stay in the Jovre space. That's the first idea. And the second main idea is this norm that allows growth at particular times, which are the Particular times, which are these critical times. So these are the main ingredients in the group. So remember these two main ingredients, because when I go to the case of general shear flows, these are the two ingredients that we want to keep when we move to the general share flow. Okay, now one natural question always that we receive is: is this Jouvere regularity necessary? I mean, can one prove this in flobile F space, for instance, or energy space? So now the We have a result with you, Deng, that more or less says that the chouvre regularity is necessary. I mean, is necessary at least as the result is stated. I mean, the result with you then says that if you take s less than one half. If you take s less than one half, so if you take Jouvre with s less than one half, here in the previous result, I'm requiring that s is bigger than one half. Remember, s equal one, that corresponds to analytic regularity. So with you, Deng, we prove that if s is less than one half, If s is less than one-half, it's possible to take a data which is very small and at later time in some high sobolev space it is large. So this is this is completely it contradicts the previous result with the I mean it it's incompatible with the previous result of Jacob. Result of Jacob. And actually, we can add, we can make this initial data satisfy all kind of assumptions that I had in the paper with Jacob. I mean, if one push it more, like one even can put the Jouver Lambda one half, if you want, like really the Jouver Lambda one half is the critical space. Lambda one half is the critical space. Okay. There are other results in the direction of in the direction of in the direction of non-inviscid dumping by Lin and Tsang, who proved that in regularity H3 halves minus for the vorticity. For the vorticity, it's possible that you don't have inviscid dumping. Also, results: there are results for the Vlazov case and the recent result of Jacob also on a similar thing for Lando dumping. Okay, now let me give Let me give a little bit of ideas of again of the proof of this result with Jacob. Just remember, like at the linear level, this is your linear equation. I mean, it's a simple transport equation. So then the solution is this one. And what we call the profile is really the fact that you stream. You straighten the characteristics basically. So you look at this f of tzy, which is omega of tz t plus y. Now at the linear level, it means that f is independent of time. Okay, now this is the so this equation on omega means that f is independent of time. Now at the nonlinear level, Now at the nonlinear level, you will keep the nonlinear term only. But now the velocity u, you recover it by inverting the Laplacian. But now the Laplacian in this new coordinate becomes this Laplacian t. Okay, now this, I mean, this is really like I mean, this is really like calculus level. I mean, just a student who knows how to do change of coordinates can get this formula. And this already has part of what's going on. At the linear level, f is just transported. Now, this Laplacian t minus one will gain you, when t goes to infinity, can gain you a decay like one over t squared. Like one over t square, and that's really the beginning of the inviscid dumping and the inviscid dumping at the linear level. The fact that one component of the velocity actually will decay like one over t square, another component will decay like one over t. This is exactly what I was talking about: the fact that when you apply this Laplacian t minus one, you get this decay. This decay. Okay, now I always like this picture because this picture shows an important feature of this invisible dumping, which is, let's say, if you start with your initial data like this, as time goes, it will become like this, but then there is a time where it comes like that, then it starts to. Then it starts to, so your data can start like that. Then, so what this picture shows is that there may be a phase of what we call unmixing, then mixing again. Now, this unmixing is dangerous. Why it's dangerous? Because the unmixing, there is growth. Here, your solution can grow. And this phenomenon was already noticed by Orr in 1907. And I mean, there was a lot of discussion about should we talk about stability or not because of that transient growth. So again, here you can see. Again, here you can see that transient growth in this formula, because let's say at time zero, you can have one of xc square plus k square. But imagine that xc is large. So if you look at time t, which is xi divided by k, then this term becomes zero, and that will come with growth. And that will come with growth, then you will get the decay again. But somehow, the picture is that you can have something that grows and then decays back. So, that is really what is behind these so-called critical times. Right, and in a sense, also the work of Yudang is based on this critical time, is really to. This critical time is really to try to find a way of following the critical time, allowing energy to be amplified at these critical times. There are pictures to try to explain it. I mean, it's difficult to explain what's happening in this picture, but there are experiments also trying to capture these critical times, to capture this growth at critical times. Capture this growth at critical times. Okay, now let me move to the result with Veyran, which is about extending the non-linear MVC dumping to the case of a stable shear flow. So, um So here I'm taking u of y. Instead of just taking wet, we will take a flow between 0, 1 actually. I'm not taking y in the whole space anymore. I mean, there are technical difficulties in trying to do that, but and the result should work also. Should work also. So, so it take a flow which is monotone compactly, UW prime is compactly supported. And we assume that this Rayleigh operator has no eigenvalues and we have some Jouver irregularity. Some Jouvere regularity. Okay, so now the right, if I write an equation on the perturbation, this is the equation I will get. Okay, this is the equation I will get on the perturbation. Notice now, the linear part is not just transport. It has a transport, but it has also some non-local term. This is This is because u double prime is not zero. In the case of wet, this term didn't appear because if you take y, the second derivative of y is zero, right? So this comes with some extra difficulty because of this non-local term. So in a sense, there are two small, there are two difficulties at the linear level is the fact that this is u of y, not y. This is u of y, not y, but you have this non-local term. Okay, now the result with Vehran more or less states that we have the same conclusion as in the result with Jacob, meaning that we can prove global existence and the solution stays. And the solution stays bounded in the Jouvre space and converges to a final profile. When I mentioned the result with Jacob, I mentioned that here this is an epsilon square. Here, this is epsilon. Now, the reason this is epsilon, not epsilon square, one can understand it from the fact that omega is not the right quantity. Not the right quantity to be looking at. So it's not omega which is transported. Omega is not transported only, but there is something else happening to it. So and actually this is really related also to our proof, to the method of our proof. The method of our proof is to introduce the so-called wave operator. The wave operator Operator. The wave operator will allow you to somehow conjugate this linear part to just transport. So meaning that instead of trying to look at omega, one can look at du omega. Du is the so-called wave operator. What it does, it removes the non-local removes the non-local part right so now du omega is just transported okay so then for du omega we can prove a similar result to the result with jacob meaning that one can find the right change of coordinate i mean my notation is slightly different I mean, my notation is slightly different than in the previous paper, but this is what I used. The sum of these two, I used to call it psi, and it's now d omega, this is the one that will converge to this F infinity. And here I recover the epsilon square. Okay, so here already in this statement, one can see a lot of features of One can see a lot of features of the proof. The construction of the wave operator, this is the linear analysis. This is linear analysis. Okay, so that is a part of our paper is to construct it, but not only construct it, but construct it with good bounds into every space, right? In Jouvre space, right? Because it's not enough to have bounds in Swauble space, we need bounds in Jouvret space. The change of coordinate, this is the non-linear part of the analysis, it's quite similar to the previous paper with Jacob. I mean, one has to be a little bit careful about the definition and About the definition, and I mean, there are a little bit of tricky things because of when you apply the wave operator, there are many commutators. One has to understand the meaning of the different terms. Okay. Okay, now, okay, maybe I have like five minutes, five, slightly more. Yes. More, yeah, yeah. You have more six minutes, yeah. Okay, good, right. Now, let me explain a little bit the wave operator first. Now, this is your linear equation, okay, written here in terms of the for T C T. You can write it in terms of the stream function if you invert the Laplacian. Here I did Fourier in X. Fourier in X. Okay, did Fourier in X. So then one end up with the following classical equation with the Rayleigh operator. So R alpha is what usually called the is related to the Rayleigh operator, which is this one. They are just related by some conjugation. Okay, so this part is classical, like understanding what is the spectrum. However, the new thing we have to do is to construct the wave operator. Now, let me go to that. How are we going to make this construction? Make this construction. This is again the equation for psi. One can use the resolvent and contour integral to express psi in terms of this contour integral. So, here I'm recalling a little bit this kind of contour integrals, how these contour integrals work. How these control integrals work. Also, to understand the resolvent, one has to solve this kind of ODEs. I'll go a little bit faster on these things. I mean, we follow a little bit. I mean, there are a lot of interesting estimates that we use from the work of Weizen and Zhao. So, I mean, in a sense, this paper combines a lot of very important ideas from these papers at the linear level. So, in a sense, the decay, the optimal decay that one gets in the case of QET, we can get also here modulo understanding. A modulo understanding this kind of regularity of this psi minus and psi plus in Cy. Okay, now one has a representation formula of the solution. I mean, it's a complicated representation formula, but okay, after some work, I mean, that I cannot now detail, one can Find some formula. Maybe I'll go a little bit. Yeah, one can find a formula for this wave operator. Let me not, let me, I cannot explain it. But at the end, the wave operator has these steps. It combines like linearization, some function analysis, resolvent, the limiting absorption. The limiting absorption lemma, some harmonic analysis, and that's how we construct the wave operator. Okay, now the next thing is to understand the non-linear problem. As I said, after you apply the wave operator, okay, now the wave operator, what it does, in a sense, it will replace your complicated operator. Operator by just u. Okay, so it will look more or less like thwat. Of course, for the nonlinear analysis, we need this Jouvre irregularity of the wave operator. Not only is the wave operator bounded from L2 to L2, but you need it also to have an estimate in Juvre. Now, what I was saying for the non-linear, for the non-linear problem, what we need, we need the non-linear change of coordinate and the well-designed norm that treat well the resonant time. And actually, we need in a sense to understand the wave operator in this coordinate, TZV. I mean, these are the coordinates used also in the paper with Jacob, like in the paper of Jacob, the so-called critical times that I mentioned earlier are understood in these variables. In these variables. So that's why also this wave operator, we have to rewrite it in these variables. That takes a little bit of difficulties, but it is doable. Yeah, so these are some of the main difficulties that we encounter in this proof, basically. Yeah. So this is really the wave operator, but written in. wave operator but written in this new variable tzv and these are like the kind of estimate on the wave operator in jouvre regularity commutator estimates also yeah so the the final part of the proof is just to use a norm very similar to the norm uh that we used to That we used with Jacob basically. Okay, maybe I'll stop here. I mean, these are again like trying to put all steps, like there are maybe four steps for constructing the wave operator. Then there is the change of coordinate, modifying the wave operator in that new coordinate system to adapt it to the critical times. Okay, thank you very much for your attention. Thank you, Nada, for the very interesting talk. Are there any questions for Nada? Please unmute yourself if you have a question. Can I have a quick question? Yeah, yeah. Wonderful talk. Thanks, Neda. So, can I ask like the definition? Can I ask like the definition of a web or do you think there's any conceptual difficulty if there's like a degeneracy involving this vortex? What is the depletion phenomenon? Yes, I think there are difficulties if one. I mean, we tried that a little bit, but we're not successful. So, right. So, if you take something like Like Puzu, or like Kolmogorov, or I think we have slightly difficulties in doing it. I mean, it seems, I mean, I don't have really like an intuitive reason for it, to be honest. Maybe it's something I'm not understanding very well, but it seems that if you have. But it seems that if you have something like this, and you think that this is, let's say, a compact perturbation or something less important, so it seems that you should be able to find the change of... Yeah, when you look at it, it's not clear why you need, why you don't want to have critical points here. It's not clear. But yeah, it is needed. Yeah, it is needed. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. Any more questions? I do have a question, sorry. Thank you for your last talk. So in Judge's talk, there was a condition on the C part of the perturbation to be away from the boundary. Do you have it here or not? Yeah, yeah, yeah. We have the same thing. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. The same. I mean, it's somewhere hidden. Maybe I didn't say it. Yeah, for so, so, so two things: like you need, you need your u of y here to u w prime to be supported here. So it means like when you are very close to the boundary, you would look really like quad and also in the initial data of the Initial data of the perturbation, you assume something similar. I mean, like, so it's really the same thing. Like, you want to avoid you want to avoid the boundary. Thank you. And I think it is expected that if you touch the boundary, something else may happen. Like there are some other phenomenon to be understood. There are some other phenomena to be understood. I think that's what also Gia was also saying. I mean, the two proofs are, I think, I mean, there are many, many things which are, I mean, are written very, very differently, but I mean, I think in terms of concepts, there are there should be. There are there should be a lot of similarities. I didn't really do the homework of trying to see that the proofs are, but like the hypothesis are more or less similar. Thank you. Okay, thank you, Anita, for the very nice talk. And so let's go to the next.
