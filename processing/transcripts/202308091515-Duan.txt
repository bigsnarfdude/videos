So, first of all, I'd like to thank the organizers, particularly Professor Liao Chuan, for inviting me to attend this conference and also give a talk here. And so this is the joint work with Jong Chen Yang, currently is the postal with me, and Hong Jing Yu from Guangzhou. So, let me first actually talk about the goal of this talk. And so, we consider kinetic equation, which I call Velasov Maxwell-Boltzmann. Maxwell-Boltzmann and the ONA scaling in the compressible second. So, here this epsilon is a long-dimensional parameter, which is strictly positive, assumed to be very small. And the physical meaning of this epsilon is proportional to the mean free pass. So, our goal to look at the Cauchy problem to construct almost the global in-time smooth solution. Smooth solution, for instance, up to the capital T here, depending on the parameter epsilon, which actually can be quantified in terms of the epsilon in this way with parameter A actually non-negative up to one half. So we can think about the optimal choice for A in our setting. This A is just one quarter, and then this T epsilon is one over epsilon to Over epsilon to one quarter. So the solution construct around up to capital T around the local maximum is capital F in the Gaussian form. The Fourier quantity U bar T ball actually is the global in time small amplitude solution to the compatible O in a max way near the constant states. For instance, the density For instance, the density is chosen to be one and the velocity is zero, temperature is three half, and the electric and the magnetic field are trivial, zero. And this solution construct for initial data actually, which is small, but independent of the choice of the small parameter epsilon. And this convergence establishes up to t epsilon with the convergence rate. with the convergence rate is epsilon to the power one minus a. So basically, this is a rough statement of the result. So let me first give you a few remarks, which actually for us is very important in the literature. And so first we can think about how to construct a solution user very Use the very robust approach, L2 intersection, L infinity approach in the very low regularity function space, which developed by Yang Guo. But seems that in the current setting, particularly, this equation is long relativistic. And this approach seems not applicable. So later on, we will give you making it more precise. And second thing is in our approach. thing is in our approach, the key steps is to find out energy functional E and also dissipation functional D, which depends on epsilon and to close a primary estimates like this up to tau that capital T I given before. And because we cannot work on very low regularity function space and this L infinity bound which of course is that's Bound, which of course is necessary to control the loneliness, which actually is a consequence of the sublife embedding. And so here we emphasize the singularity in this E and D with respect to this small parameter epsilon, which actually only occurs to the highest order derivative. So let me start from the Boltzmann. So the unknown, the main So, the unknown, the main unknown function is the long magnificative distribution function, depends on time space variable velocity. And so, this Boltzmann, we're starting with this balance between free transport and binary collision. So, this Boltzmann collision operator is inequal, acting only on the velocity variable. So, it's local in time and space variable. So, let me ignore the difficulty here related to the positive. Related to the positive part, lack part, and also collision colour, etc., and the locations u prime and v prime, etc. I just mentioned that the key difficulties actually comes from the collision kernel. So, usually, mathematically, people assume this cannot be in the form of this relative velocity to the power gamma. To the power gamma times some actually angular part depending on the derivation angle. And if this derivation is there is angular part, it's not integrable, we call Lankarov. If it is integrable under polar coordinates, and this is proposed by Harold Grab, which we call the Kutoff case. So in order to start So, in order to start considering through the dynamic, so let us see actually the basic property of this Q. If you multiply these five velocity moments and then take an integration, and then it gives zero, we call this actually collision invariant. And if you only look at the dynamics governed by the Boltzmann, look at the time change rate of the entropy, and then we have this inequality. So, this becomes. So, this becomes equality if and only if this M is a local maximum. So, in terms of East, if you look at the long time dynamics governed by the Boltzmann, in terms of conservation laws, suppose long time is F governed by the local maximum, and then we can get a classical OINA compatible OINA system. And also, we can get an entropy in quantity like this. Like this. So, of course, now is in kinetic theory, it's a fundamental problem, challenging problem to give rigorous justification in a general functional framework. So, then I see a very classical result in direction to judge the free limit compared to the compassible EU system. Einar system from the Boltzmann. In the Kardov case, for analytical solution, the first result was obtained by Lishida and using the Kushikolevsky theorem, the spectral analysis for the linearized Boltzmann equation. And Ukai Azano afterwards introduced a refined functional norm, even including Jeffrey class, consider Jeffrey class and also include Every class and also include the initial layer and prove the existence of analytical solution which is local in time. And another robust approach proposed by Kevlish. And for instance, let us look at the Bolshevik equation in the colour of case hard potential. So this is we call compatible Eunar scaling. So this is one of ethron in front of the Q. And we Front of the Q. And we formally do the expansion in this small parameter epsilon. So epsilon goes to zero, time and the space derivative actually bounded, q goes to zero, q goes to zero, f0 will be the max value. And the conservation law tells us this row value ball, t ball, we govern by the solution of the compressible Euler. So now, technically, we have to introduce some finite order. Order iteration up to six by Kevlarish. And the problem is how to control this remainder, which in some functions of space. So basically, we do linearization around the EU flow here. So this linearized operator. And then the coverage can obtain the following result. Actually, he worked on the superleaver space by superleaving embedding the solution. Suppose embedding the solution actually were converged to the compressible Eulon solution in such a form up to the time tau, which actually, well, the solution is smooth, has no welcome. So the convergence rate is the epsilon. And I have to mention the technical proof because this is related to the motivation of the development of this kind of approach. Of this kind of approach. For instance, the zeroth-order actually is the EU, which actually is variable in space. So this transfer acting on the EUNA actually produce the third order actual cubicle growth in LGBT velocity. So this is really a difficulty that has been already mentioned by Professor Hui Jiang Zhang. And the carefully should propose, and the couple of us. Propose under the kind of assumption, a kind of splitting of the solution in order to take care of this kind of cubic velocity growth phenomenon. Actually, but unfortunately, for his initial data, he just artificially choose initial data for G and H here is zero. So due to this choice, actually the solution he constructs actually is not. Construct actually is not could may not be long negative. So for this kind of issue, was reserved by Yenbo, Jiang and Zhang. Afterwards in 2010, they used so-called L2 intersection L infinity approach. So if we do this kind of linearization around OINA, so this transport acting on the OINA and then Acting on the oena, and then times f is the behaves looks like a time space derivative acting on u bar times v cubic f epsilon. So if you multiply f epsilon, this is if you take away L infinity, this gives you trouble. And then their idea is take away L2 of this variation, time and space derivative of the flow in L2. Derivative of the flow in L2, and then take L2 of F, but put this high-order velocity moments on F and define to be the H and take away L infinity. So as long as this L infinity can be controlled in a suitable way, then the estimates can be done. So indeed, the YNGO has a very robust approach. To approach the bubble-Dorman principle to look at the dynamics of the transport equation with relaxation along the characteristics. In the end, they can close with this singularity epsilon, L infinity in the section L2 at the linearized level at least, and then apply these estimates to the nonlinear case and then to the convergence. And further, Professor Guo and John and also they apply the approach to consider. Applied approach to consider global dynamics of the Villansoft Poisson Boltzmann to the Euler Poisson system. So the result is they can construct a smooth solution to the VPB system around this local maximum with the fluid quantity, satisfying the values oil and poisson system. And as long as this oil poisson solution has around the Around they is constructed around the actually constant equilibrium states in the isentropic case. So the entropy actually is constant because it's the classical solution. And the convergence, the time is up to epsilon to some negative power convergence in epsilon is the first order. Just very roughly, I actually say here. And now the problem that could be left for us is we may ask the signal. Is we may ask the similar theory what happens to Moncado-Boltzmann and also NANDA because the linearized operator is not really relaxation, actually present actually a kind of diffusion or fractional diffusion. So in case this kind of technical cannot be used, and then how to treat the L infinity estimates, for in this case, of course, we can think about the Georgia argument that so recently really has quite a Recently, really has quite a lot of progress, but how to apply this the Georgia argument to consider Bruin limit in this setting is not known. And the second kind of question is how to extend Gu-En-Jang's work to the case actually this Poisson force is replaced by Lorentz force satisfied the Maxwell equation that we are asking in this talk. Actually, in the relativistic case, Actually, in the relativistic case, Professor Yangu and the Xiao actually have a publication to say it can be done. But in the head case, it's L2 intersection L infinity, this approach can be used. But back to the non-relativistic case, this approach, later on we will see with one key difficulties, this approach cannot be used. So, our strategy, as I mentioned at the beginning, we try to introduce the energy. Try to introduce the energy, the classical energy approach involving this scenario, this small parameter Ipslo, which I recall is macro-micro decomposition initially found by Niu and Yu, and also later by Niu-Yang-Yu. And so, this is the system we are considering about. This is a Boltzmann coupled with a self-consistent force. It's Lorentz force satisfy the Maxwell equation and with this kind of. Maxwell equation and with this kind of restriction. So, this is dynamics of electrons. And let us assume this background for ions positive charge the particle is identical to one in the whole space. And we simply consider Boltzmann for Hausfield for simplicity. And for this kind of a system, we know that we can construct a classical. We can construct a classical smooth solution around the constant space. So, this was first proof in Torres' case by Professor Yangu and in whole space by Robert String and also joined strength. And we know that the conservation laws, we give the formally ONM X-ray system. In the isentropical case, if entropy is constant, and can we reduce the And can we reduce the pressure is the power law, gamma is given by 543. So now the question is, we know that for this kind of isentropic ordinane X, we are known to constant states because it's quite dispersive equation. And we have a global in-time solution actually constructed also recently by German Masmoti in NASCO Pasada, first of all, dynamics of electrons. Dynamics of electrons. So, later on, actually, in Go Ina School, Pasada, they extended to the three-dimensional case, the four, two, three, the model for the electrons and also can be relativistic and also many others. They have very great progress. And we just make use of one result: this OIM X-ray has a global in-time solution in high solution. In high sobriety space, and also in L infinity long, actually decay in time at least after one plus to the background constant solution. And then we try to introduce a macro-micro decomposition. So it means that suppose we have distribution F, and then we try to introduce moments, and then we get the free quantity rho u and also the internal energy. And also the internal energy E. And also, then we can define the difference, we get G. So this is the decomposition. And then use the conservation laws, we can get this kind of compressible Euler, but couple, this is no real fluid equation because it's compared to gene, which is unknown, determined by the fluid kinetic equation. So, and further, using the balance between linearized the operator around Linearize the operator around G and those are balance with the transport acting on ONA flow. We can solve informally get this G, the lowest order is the first order. This actually chapter eyespoke solution here. If we plot back to the previous ONA system, and then we can get the diffusion and also heat conductivity, and also couple with this theta, which is high order given by this four. So, this is we can regard this compass. So, this is what we can regard as compatible Lewis-Dox Mathway equations. And then we do micro perturbation. So, this is the difference of the solution to the both macro topical quantity rho E and B with the solution to the ONMAX wave. And also introduce the micro decomposition. So, this difference G minus G bar. So, G bar actually is chapter X quote apart. Actually, it's chapter I scored a part. You do minimization of the RNM X-ray solution around this U and the theta. So you take this greater than C bar and define G bar. And we define the difference and then we introduce a technical weight. It is a square root of mu. And this F is the, we want to study the energy estimates. So the energy functional and also And also the energy functional energy dissipation function will be defined in such a form. You just think about actually if epsilon equals to one, this will be quite standard. So now epsilon goes to zero, how to actually put epsilon, this small parameter in this actually standard dissipation functional. So here we only put the epsilon square in front. Ibsen square in front of the highest space derivative, for instance, up to capital N. I mean, this is the highest or the derivative actually is acting on the perturbation of the macro copical perturbation and also the little F here we introduced before. So once we define this temporal energy functional involving epsilon, it is natural to introduce Is natural to introduce if we want to obtain the uniform in time up to some finite time defined in terms of epsilon. And then this is D dissipation functional with the natural comes out. So I will explain later. And this is the statement of the theorem. So just to make it more precise, and we have a smooth classical small amplitude solution to the compressor. The solution to the compressible EUNA in an isentropic case. So the gamma is three-half, three-thirds. And then we try to construct a local max median here in terms of this background solution from the fluid equation. And then there exists a small constant epsilon zero, strictly positive, such that for any actually epsilon strictly positive, but less than or equal to epsilon zero, the Cauchy problem and the V. The cushion problem and the VMB system with well-prepared initial data. So, let me explore how this kind of initial data will prepare in certain kinds of function space. And then this system touch problem admits a smooth solution. Of course, depends on the small parameter epsilon and R2 capital T, which can be quantified in this way, is actually a generic constant times this one over this. One over this epsilon to the power, I mean, meets the choice of some parameter A between zero and a half. And we have using the previous actually energy functional and the energy dissipation functional, we have list uniform impact up to t from this approved lease estimates. And using the sublife embedding and in L2 in space variable, L2 in space variable and L infinity x in the act in the intersection, but of a velocity in L2, and then this difference divided by square root of global maximum mu have to change so uniform in time, we have a convergence rate epsilon to the one minus a. So you see that because a is between zero and half, and then this is the want to consider optimal choice, and then we can take a equals one quarter. Take A equals one quarter, and the T epsilon is similar to the epsilon minus one quarter. And then this convergence actually rate is epsilon to the three quarter. So it's one remark I'd like to emphasize. So here we may expect to work on L2, L in the infinity framework for this VSOFU maxway Boltzmann in the non-relative inner classic. The non-relative in a classical case. However, in the classical case, and the spectrum is continuous up to zero, and we don't have a very good actual presentation of the in actual field using the so-called glassy strauss presentation in case we consider relativistic case. So, in this case, actually, characteristic approach can be used, and then we can work on L2 in the infinity. But actually, relativistic. But actually, relativistic case is actually, we don't have this kind of presentation for the user. So that's actually one difficulty in the relative long relativistic case. We may tend to the high-order SOPLF space using the SOPLEF embedding to consider L-infinity estimates. So there is one key point we have to mention. We start from the primary assumption here for this energy functional we defined before with the parameter A here. Defined before with the parameter eight here. And finally, we want to find with close to this private estimates. So basically, because the background solution is an OER max-ray solution, there's a lot of source terms. Here we have to consider whether those source terms actually not only the least part, we have to make sure the coefficient will be small. In terms of the background solution around the constant space, Round the constant space, but also in terms of the cruise number epsilon. And the data source term, we have to consider up to t epsilon, we have to get some better convergence rate with respect to the epsilon. So in the end, we can get what we need. And so the key, as I already mentioned, that we can do usually the energy estimates up to. In estimates up to n minus one, but up to the last order, highest order, we cannot do as in the usual way, otherwise, the estimates may not be close and we have to tune to the much higher order. So, in order to end with the highest order, and then we have to multiply epsilon square so that those actually terms, particularly the source terms, actually after we take an integration and then this kind of thing. And then this kind of thing and be consistent with the balance in the primary assumption. This is not easy to do. This is because to estimate how is the order, we have to treat the transport. So we cannot directly work on the little f. We have to work on the original equation so that this is a transport may not produce one additional derivative there. But in order to work on original, Regional function capital F. So, but in the end, we have to get this f. So, we have to do the plot inside this kind decomposition and do a lot of, do some other estimates to make sure those things can be put into the either the coefficient in front of the dissipation and also the system here. I think that's all I want to present. Thank you.
