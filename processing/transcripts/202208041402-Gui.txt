For inviting me and for organizing such a precious conference during the event. So I'm going to talk about some recent results on the sort of four end solutions for overdetermined funding problem. And this journal work is Zhou Len Du from Hunan University and Kelly Wang from Wuhan University in China. Okay, so let me first explain the problem. It's actually very simple to explain the problem. So we have this Laplace equation in certain domain, omega in general Rn, and has boundary condition to be either plus one or minus one. And now we And now we have an over-determined boundary condition, the gradient of U plus U1. So this is the problem. We have a solution in a certain domain. And both the domain and the solution are unknown. Well, in this problem, we basically consider the domain to be smooth, say CQ at least. The C2 at least, and the solution, this small solution inside the domain. Well, this domain is usually the host, I mean, non-computing. For body domain, actually, there's no such solution. Well, we can find a very simple solution which is on the strip. So the function is just a physical omega. So xy are on the street. And the solution is just u xy equals x. And so this is from 0 to 1. This is the y-axis. So this is a simple solution, which is dependent on one variable. Only one. So we also call this one dimensional solution. The solution is one and you add minus one to one. Oh yeah, sure, yeah. Then you please do it from from So sometimes we use zero to one, but now we use minus one. Okay, such solution we know is unique after translation, no rotation. Well, the problem have actually a variation of formulation. You can actually consider this functional well with the usual duration integral by With the usual duration integral, but the potential term is just a characteristic function for doing this range minus one to one. And of course, you can also do some scanning of this energy function work, particularly when you talk about phase transition. It's usually better to have a simple parameter, epsilon. And so in the phase. So, in the phase transition setting, you have a minimizer or kind of quick point of such functional with certain boundary conditions and certain domain. There you will have kind of an interface for me. Basically, well, here is just a simple shape. In one region, it's close to one, the other region is close to minus one. Close menace one, if you twin, you have this translation. And this translation in this setting is likely to be modeled by this one-diminution. So you can see this is very much problem we have been studied in many years. For example, this problem is similar on one hand to the so-called one-phase problem. To the solar one-phase problem. The one-phase problem is also determined by the value problem, but the phase is just u bigger than 0. And of course, you can zero on the boundary. And this case, you have an over-determined over-determined boundary condition. And this is a very well-studied problem, which associated with the functional Associated with the functional necklace. And there are lots of studies, for example, on the regularity of the interface or the free boundary, and also the existence of spatial solutions. And particularly in two dimensions, there is a complete classification of solutions to the one-phase hub. So this Problem we are considering is, in certain sense, similar to this one-phase problem, but now we can say you have two phases. On the other hand, this problem is also very similar to the Anink equation. For Anikine equation, we have this double-wheel potential F and the equation have this equation have this non-linearity f prime usually f u is this sort of double whale potential typically you can say like given by this function and for this ankai equation we know there is an associated functional sometimes called the ancam functional and in general you can also put the data here Also, put the data here instead of two. The data is between zero. Well, this unconnectivation has been studied very intensively in the last 30 years. And for example, the problem like DeGeorge conjecture, existence special solutions, classification problems. And Jun Cheng gave a very nice introduction. Very nice introduction. I want to follow to his talk. So, I'm not going to give all this related study or one phase problem. I will just focus on one type of question. By the way, so here in delta equals zero, in the In the general formulation of Anacan equation, we get exactly the two-phase free boundary problem. This characteristic function from minus one to one. Okay, so the focus here is on the four complicated solutions rather than minimizer or monitor. Minimizer or monoton solutions. Here, because usually monotonous solution in this setting is also minimized. So we can focus on monotone or sometimes more general unstable solutions. And those solutions do exist for particular unit equations. In general, we can also talk about some. In general, we can also talk about sort of a MOS index bigger than one by finite solutions. So both syntax, let's recall. If you have a functional, then we can just take the time equation as an example. If you take a second variation, if it's for all direction, means for all functions which has the compact support. Support the symbol's function, the second vibration of the function is positive, then we say the solution is stable. Otherwise, if this direction of negative segment variation is finite dimensional, and the dimension we call it the loss index of this function, which gives also a lot of information about the solution. Solution. Well, for any kind of equations, we have the existence of whole in solution, which is unstable. So such solution first was observed by Dan Feif and Poitier. Later, the Pindo, Kavasik, Parkard, and Twin Shen. And they show many general General voice solutions. Then Kawaska, Parkard, and Yu, they actually construct a family of such solutions with spatial parameters. And we work with Yong Yu and Chun Cheng, we showed a very important characterization of the existence of certain Of certain forward solutions, which has exactly most index one. So, in this unkind equation, one question is to classify all such finite most index solutions. Well, sometimes we can also solve the most index solutions with finite end solutions. The finite ends, you can basically think that. Final ends, you can basically think that outside the bigger domain, the level site has a finite pieces, particularly maybe constrained in certain sectors. For the QN solution for anka equations, this actually very nice symmetry. So, the solution after rotation and translation is actually. is actually even is a measure about the both axis, x and seasonal y-axis, and that has monotonicity in the red region. And also there is a kind of quantization phenomena, which if you use this kind of functional pointed domain, say PR, after you normalize it, divide by the rate Divided by the radius, then you can be sure that this quantity is either constant times a positive integer, or it could be infinity. Well, of course, whether the first happened or not, it was not known before. But for this second case, we know that. We know that the each end represents one direction in R2, and this direction anti-technical has to be cancelled to each other. So we call it the balance following. And so basically, in the paper 2008, I showed this balance formula by using so-called Hamiltonian identity, which you Entity, which is, you can think of an electric version of conservation law. So the integral is on only one direction, see, and the energy, well, it's not really energy, we can actually call it Hamiltonian, which is differs from energy, but that is just the sine, the negative sine k. So this quantity is conserved. So this quantity is conserved and also there's a kind of momentum conservation. This quantity is conserved as long as that makes sense. No convergence. When I say conserved, it means that this quantity does not depend on x. No, when x changes just constant, which minimizes the wave equation case. Wave equation case, the time variable. Yeah, energy is conserved. Okay, anyway, of course, the final resolution of this classification for two-dimensional uncomproblem is done by Kelly Wang and Jun Chen. They showed a very strong result, which basically says that this quantity is valid. So that's completely settled this problem. And this estimate is. And this estimate is very deep and play important role in the curvature estimate and related to eventually geometric problem of being a surface, geodesics, general management. Okay, so that's about the ankle equations. Our focus today is on the The overdetermined problem or this free boundary problem. So we first consider the second variation, consider the Nino-Raising equation for the problem. The equation, of course, in the interior is just a Laplace equation, but the boundary term we have this H, which is the curvature of the quantity. Come see. So, this is the Lineman's equation for the aerobic the problem, and then we can talk about the stability of the solution. Basically, consider the associated egg function and egg values. So, if the egg value are all positive, we say this problem is stable. Otherwise, we say it's unstable. If the unstable The unstable direction is finite dimension, then we say it's finite mass index solution. So very similar in the setting of Ankan equation. And this problem actually first studied by Kelly Wang in the structure of the finite MOS index solutions, particularly in R2. And he shows some very interesting results. For example, For example, a stable solution must be one dimension. So in certain direction as DeGeorge conjecture in the Ankai equation case, another two-end solution must be in one in two. And another interesting result is that if the solution is not connected, if you have It's not connected. If you have two pieces, then the solution might be one image. You could just put two of such solutions, put them together with some distance. That's the example. And that's the only example, too. Anyway, so in joint work with Johan Lu and Kelly Wan, we Can you one, we try to study more careerly what are the four in the solutions for this over different problems. And the four-inch solutions also, if exist, really represent the similarity of two interface crossing at one point. So the local structure, just as any kind. An creature case mentioned by Jun Shen in his talk. So, first, we want to know if such solutions exist or not. Secondly, what property can we have? And then, like uniqueness, the symmetry, and classification. The existence, we show the existence. Existence, we show the existence and the symmetry, unique symmetry of such solution. And we also show that the domain has some nice geometric property. So if we took a picture here, that's great. The solution, basically I have I have a bit look like this. Oh, the picture is not very good, but in this way, it's plus one, this is minus one, plus one, minus one. And in between, you will minus one and one. Okay, and of course, this at the infinity, this will be asymptotic. Asymptotically like this one-dimensional solution with some notation. And the nice geometric problem is that we have exactly two pieces for each of the phrase plus one or minus one. And the omega is simply connected. And also the main set. The main set of each of the phase, plus one and minus one, they are complex. And they have curvature to be positive, quite depending on which direction you look at. So the existence is the following. Actually, we have a fermion of Have a family of solutions depends on a parameter. This parameter we can call it the angle of the interface. So in this direction, which you can say roughly the level side, zero level side of the solution U. And at infinity, it would be like a straight. And at infinity, it would be like a straight line. And then the straight line will form an angle alpha, which is the x-axis. So we show that for each alpha between 0 and 2 pi, there is such a void solution. And if alpha is fixed, we have a unique solution with such a penguin. After, of course, rotation and the translation. And moreover, we have a very clear understanding of the MOS syntax of such solutions. MOSINTEX is possible. For any kind of equations, for some special case, like sine-coding, as June Chen mentioned, it's clear that most index is one for any solutions. In general, The solutions. But in general, it's not completely decided. Okay, so the idea of the proof of this result, well, of course, it depends on the basic properties, which more or less similar to the Anakine equation situation, but of course with some variety. So, first is the convexity, which we show that the omega C, the complement of omega is convex. And also the curve to is positive. And second, we have this monotonicity formula. Integrate this function, have this functional in R. You have this functional in all, but normalize it, and we are getting bigger, the quantity is increasing. And then we have the quantization property. So the limit, after we normalize it, is integer times 4. I mean, here's here 4, basically just 4a. I mean, yeah, if you have. Yeah, if you have 2k n, you have 4k n. So you have 2k n, you have the total energy is 4k, and the other two is coming from the n of the stream. But if you have k equals 1, But if you have k equals one, k equals two, you have the quantity to be just eight. Anyway, so we have this energy condensation, just like a Ankhan equation situation. Also, this balance condition. For the but infinity, you change this represented by one vector, one direction. Vector, one direction. They added together to be zero. Well, these are properties very much like the Anakine equations, but of course there is some necessary changes. But for the existence, it's actually more evolved. Here, we eventually. Here, we eventually use cost map or complex analysis method to show the existence. So, but observing the following. Firstly, if we have a solution, for each solution, say in this omega, then we can, you know, we know the UX, UY, they have red sign in the red domain, and we make the such company. And we make the such complex function from the sorting u. And then we know that g must be holomorphic because of Laplace equation. Then we can actually show it's a biohomomorphism, bihomomorphism, P10, omega, and then U1, because we can show that the image of G is a That the image of G is U1 because of the overdetermined boundary conditions, basically. Okay, so if we make this composition, if I have this solution u, then we have this G and make F to be the inverse of G, we get this harmonic function V with pre square on the condition. So, anyway, so eventually we show the existence. So eventually we show the existence by showing that this F alpha is injective. We have such F alpha in terms of alpha can be decided, can be proved to exist and is injective. And this injectivity will correspond to the existence of solution. Okay, then the injectivity is The injectivity is used to show the continuation of the solution through the continuation of F alpha. So the mechanism eventually is that we show the existence of a solution for particular alpha type of fault, then we get this alpha alpha. So the existence of such solution is shown first. We get F alpha. Then we use a unique continuation method to get F alpha for geno alpha. Then we go back to new alpha. So that should be existence. And also in the same time, it also should be predicted. The other properties, you know, we can use moving play method and Hamiltonian identity for this setting. And for the existence of such solution in IO4, we actually use minimizing our method, solve the problem in a finite domain, and let the domain goes to infinity, and use the symmetry to control the interface which Which will have convergence will not go away. So that's the both of existence and the remains. There are still many questions in the general direction. Some problems are pretty simple, probably well not simple but similar to time equations. But there are some problems which are different and So, in general, we have many questions. Let me stop here. Thank you. So, thank you very much for your nice talk. So, are there any questions or comments? So, the you wasn't in the profile of this one. Yeah, yeah. Is the multitude of a follow from the injectivity? Yeah, they're together. Prove together. And one important thing of course is the symmetry of the solution and the monotonicity of the solution in this different region. And those are the key monotony. That's the most diff that's the difficult part. You cannot prove. The difficult part, you cannot profonize each other. Exactly. Yeah, so okay, okay. So, in some aspect, this model is simpler than the Ankari equations, but some other type of problem is more complicated. For example, the existence of foreign solution. For example, I'm kind of questioning to prove this energy is limited finite. It's a lot of this analysis clean, but for this problem, it's much easier. Time for one more question, so comments. How do you take care about the constraint gradient of u is equal to one at the border of u? How do you take care of the constraint gradient? Take care of the constraints gradient of u is equal to 100. Oh, yeah, that's a very good question. Yeah, very good question. I didn't mention it. So, indeed, for the over-determining condition, it comes naturally from the minimizing of the function. So, that's that's a very very question. Okay, so So now we have a coffee break and we resume at uh 3:30.
