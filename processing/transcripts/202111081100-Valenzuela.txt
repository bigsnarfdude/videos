Okay, thank you very much for the invitation to give a talk here and thank you so much for the very nice introduction. It's really I don't know. Yeah, so I'm going to talk about some ideas of how to argue for the song and conjecture from black for physics and finance. Physics and finance, which is mainly based on this recent work with Jutta Hamala, Miguel Montero, and Coronbap. And also, since I think the people here that do not necessarily know or know what these conjectures are about, I'm planning to spend some time, even maybe half of the talk, slowly what are Slowly, what are all some of these ideas that I will use? And in the second half of the talk, I will focus on this paper in particular, in which we provide new arguments in favor of them. Also, if at some point my connection doesn't work well, just let me know. Okay, I'm also a bit worried about the connection. And if you have any question, please don't hesitate to interrupt me. Okay. Okay, very good. So. Okay, very good. So let me start. So as we have already seen in the nice talks from Lars and Miguel, in the Schwan-Blan program, we try to determine what are the constraints that an effective theory must satisfy to be consistent with quantum graph. Okay, so we've had a very lively discussion about this and the different challenges that arise when we try to make this precise and determine what are these constraints and try to gather Are these constraints and try to gather evidence or prove them in a certain setup? Now, why we are interested in this is not only because, I mean, of course, it's interesting by itself to understand what are the constraints that quantum gravity imposes, but I'm also especially interested in this because they can give rise to potential phenomena implications. Because if we have new constraints that we need to satisfy at low energies, we can use them as new guiding principles to construct vision standard models or Vision standard models, or maybe provide new insights to solve naturalness issues in our universe. So, as I said for this talk, I'm going to spend some time on defining more carefully, especially this general feature that we observe in the swamp plan, that is at the core of the swamp plan, which is the presence of asymptotic towers of state. So, that whenever we go to large field ranges or weak up limits, we get towers of state that become light. Lamblight and review a bit what is the state of the art in this, I mean, for this property, and what are the conjectures that try to quantify this. And then, so I hope that here if you have any question in general, I mean, you can just take the opportunity to ask. And then I will today, I mean, to change, instead of showing you evidence coming from screen theory, I'm going to take a different perspective. I'm going to try. Take a different perspective. I'm going to try to think why these conjectures should be true in general and from a bottom mark perspective. Okay, so if we, as we discuss with Miguel, if we want to argue eventually that these are constraints from quantum gravity and regardless of string theory, we need to try to explain why they should hold. So I will use black hole physics to argue for this and also some notion of five. Some notion of fineness of quantum gravity amplitudes. Okay, so this is just a map that I usually show of the different most important conjectures that we have at the moment. Just to remark that one of the most important developments, I think, is the different connect we are discovering between the conjectures, which The conjectures, which hint that they are not just pendant statements, but they might be some discovery. So, one of the goals of my talk is to point out that maybe this fineness of quantum gravity amplitudes could be behind this all these relations between the conjectures. Okay, so just to put a bit of order here, as we have seen a little bit already, the first row are conjectures. First row are conjectures which are better established, like they are about non-global symmetries and it's about the kinematics of the theory. But if we go down, we start constraining the dynamics. In particular, these two in the middle constraints, the field spectra. And when we apply them to particular setups, we can get stronger constraints about the landscape of vacua or the scalar potential that is consistent with quantum gravity. So for this talk, I'm going to focus on this middle row, which is this wave gravity and this distance. Which is this with gravity and this distance conjecture. Okay. Okay. Now I want to remark that identifying these patterns, like formulating the Swamp Planck conjectures, is just the first step or the zero step of the Swamp Plan program. Of course, I mean, once we identify some feature that we believe could be general or could have a fundamental quantum gravity reason and just an accidental coincidence, the goal is to try to gather evidence. So, first, To gather evidence, so first, I think we need to combine, as we said, both quantitative tests in string theory because it's a nice framework in which we can try to prove these conjectures. And it's very useful to make them more precise and more sharp. But of course, it's also limited in the sense that by doing this, we typically focus on classes of compactifications. So we need to combine this quantitative test with explaining what would be wrong. Explaining what would be wrong if the conjecture is not satisfied. Okay, so what would be the quantum gravity principle underlying? This is not a proof because it's more like some more heuristic motivations, but without them, it's difficult to argue why this is a fundamental feature and not just some technical thing that we observe in string theory. And once we have this, I mean, we can also then try to apply to the real world and try to get what are the phenomenical implications. So in terms of these phenomena implications, So, in terms of these phenomena complications, I want to remark that I think the Swampland program becomes especially interesting when it's giving you some constraint that goes against the EFT expectations. Okay, so the point here is that the expectations that we get from working on effective field theories can fail in the presence of gravity. And if we identify what fails, I mean, what are the cases in which it fails, it's very interesting because then from string theory, from quantum Because then, from string theory from quantum gravity, we can say something new for people working on model building. Okay, so one of the examples that I like the most in this regard is that with the strong brand, we typically see that the EFT can break down at a scale which is much below the Planck mass. So, even if gravity is very weak and it seems that quantum gravitational effects are negligible for low energies, because the Planck scale is very high. Energies because the Planck scale is very high. This is not correct. I mean, this is not true because the scale at which quantum gravitational effects become important can be much below this naive estimation of the Planck scale. And this is something that happens when we have small gauge couplings or large field ranges or approximate global symmetry. So this is something that we observe in Steam Theory. And I think it can be very useful because it's precisely going against this EFT expectation. This EFT expectation, okay? Because in effective field theory, in quantum field theory, to have a small gauge campaign is completely fine. It's even good because then we have a perturbative description, or to have a global symmetry is completely fine. But in the presence of gravity, these things are problematic and come together with a drop-off of the cutoff. So why the cutoff is going down, why the EFT is breaking down, is because of the presence of an infinite tower of states that is becoming light. States that is becoming light when you try to engineer these small gauge couplings or large field ranges. So, this, as I said, I think it's something surprising just from a bottom-up perspective, okay, that you get this infinite number of stages whenever you go to very small edge couplings, for example. Could I just from the perspective stage here is actually, yes, could I ask a question? Because when you go back this slide. Back this slide. It's the same we discussed earlier. Yeah, so you say approximate global symmetry. So, in principle, I could imagine a theory with a global symmetry, and this is in weak gravity somewhat broken at the Planck scale. So, what's wrong with that? Why do I have to get an infinite tower of states? If you put it in true theory, you might argue that there is an infinite tower of state. But from first principle, But from first principle, I can have an approximate global symmetry, and this is broken by gravitational effects which are governed by the Planck scale. What's wrong with that effect? Yeah, exactly. So this is okay. So this is precisely the point. So these are features that we observe from string theory, compactifications. So you use natural string. You assume are surprising. From an EFT perspective, let me finish. So I agree. So from street theory, it seems natural is what we observe. Theory seems natural is what we observe. They are surprising from an EFT perspective. And the goal is to try to understand why it's a general feature of quantum gravity, which is non-trivial at all. I mean, that's the point. Like, it's not obvious why this should be problematic, right? Like, why you cannot have an approximate global symmetry. So, my question is, I don't have an answer. Are you assuming string theory from the beginning? So, when it depends if you mean in. And it depends if you mean in my talk or in the conjectures. So, right now, what I just want to say right now is that there are some features that we observe from string theory that are natural from string theory perspective, but are surprising from an EFT, and that then we formulate as strong plan conjectures. And the goal next is try to, well, both gather more evidence from them for string theory, but also try to find the underlying quantum gravity principles why they should hold. Quantum gravity principles, why they should hold, and this is a very hard task. And in this talk, I'm going to give you some explanation for the case of some motivation for large field ranges and small gauge couplings. But I don't have right now a completely general argument of why approximate global symmetries should not be allowed if I don't use string theory. I mean, without using string theory. But that's the goal. I mean, that's the part of the goal. Like, try to find that. I mean, why these general? I mean, why these DNR features should hold in DNR. And if we do this, it's precisely here, I mean, where we can say interesting things for phenomenology, right? Like if we can provide general arguments behind these surprising features that we observe from this thing here. Thank you. Okay, very good. So yeah, so that was the message. I mean, that there are some features that are surprising from an EFT point of view. Are surprising from an EFT point of view, but they are natural from a string theory perspective. So, let me tell you why I think they are natural from steam theory. Okay, so in steam theory, all the parameters, all the continuous parameters are given by vacuum expectation values of scalar fields, right? So, we all have like three parameters. So, when we change, when, for example, we try to engineer small gauge capping or we try to engineer a very good approach. Or we're trying to engineer a very good approximate global symmetry by tuning the couplings, what we are doing is to move it in the field space of the theory. And what happens is that since global symmetries are not present in stream theory, are not allowed in straight theory, these points in which you would restore a global symmetry or usenagits coping to zero are pushed to infinite distance in the field space. Okay, so when we go to these boundaries of the... When we go to these boundaries of the field space in the string theory, we always get towels of states that become lights. And this is something that is known for, I mean, like many, many years, because this tower of states is precisely hinting a new weekly couple description of the theory and is linked to all the beloved string dualities that we have. Okay, so for example, when you go to very large volumes, then you can have Volumes, then you can have KK towers that are dual, T-dual to winding modes that become light when you go to very small volumes. Or if you go to weak string couplings, then you get string excitations that become light. So all these towers of state that become light when we go to the boundaries of the field space are associated to the different dualities that we have in string theory. And therefore, trying to understand why these towers should be there. Why these towers should be there in general in quantum gravity? It's like trying to understand why we are observing all these dualities to start with. Okay? That's why it's a hard question. Now, I wanted to mention that typically, I mean, so far in all the extreme theory examples that we know, these towers of states signal either at the compactification limit, okay, so there is some extra dimension that emerges either in some dual. Charges either in some dual frame, okay, or some string perturbative limit. Like there is some string that is becoming tensionless, and then you recover some perturbative string here. And this observation was promoted to some to a conjecture by these people in this work. Okay, any other question about this? I have okay, so this is the yes, please. So, I mean, you were saying that. Please, so I mean, you were saying that if you want to have a global symmetry, you can well make a coupling very small and then you get a global symmetry. I sort of agree with that, but that's obviously not the only way to get an approximate global symmetry. So you could have engaging, right? Like, you can also have other ways to get an approximate global symmetry if you have a very high discrete. Global symmetry. If you have a very high discrete symmetry, which is maybe somehow exact or gauged, then it looks for many practical purposes like a global symmetry, right? Are these statements that you are making also applicable to such scenarios or is that? Yeah, so okay, here I just put one example, which indeed is like a gauge coupling going to zero. And this is like engaging the symmetry. So that's why you recover the global symmetry, but of course, I mean, there are. Recover the global symmetry, but of course, I mean, there are more ways. In particular, you can be have a symmetry that is broken and you turn off the source of breaking and therefore recover some global symmetry. Now, the expectation I do not fully agree with this. If you sort of turn off the braking, then you get a light gauge boson back, I guess, if you have a gauge symmetry initially. Yeah, I mean, what I wanted to say is that in any case, I mean, this is just one. Say is that in any case, I mean, this is just one example, there are other ways, but in any case, if we really get some global symmetry, if we restore a global symmetry in some point of the modular space, these points should be at infinite distance, should not be part of the modular space, because that would mean contradiction of not having global symmetries in quantum graphics. So, so far, I mean, this, I mean, of course, no global symmetry is also a conjecture, although it has been proven in different setups, but so far, there's no. But so far, there's no example that we know of, right, in string theory of a global symmetry in the middle of the mobile space. So, all the global symmetries that we can restore are always pushed to infinite distance. And that's why I connect this idea of getting the towers at infinite distance with recovering some global symmetry. Could be in different ways. I mean, okay, not only sending nuggets coming to zero, but in any case, there is some global symmetry that is restored there in somehow. And that should be. And that should be at infinity status. Okay, thanks. Okay, more questions? Okay, good. Yeah, don't hesitate to ask anyone. That's completely fine. Thank you. Okay, so this was, I mean, I just said it with vague in a vague way, like a general way, because this is. Like a general way, because this is the main feature that I'm going to focus on my talk, like this that works at infinite distance. But this, I mean, there are some conjectures that are quantifying this, okay, in a more precise way. And these are the Wig gravity and the distance conjecture. So Lars already talked about the Wii gravity conjecture earlier today. So let me just say it very briefly. So the idea is that if you have a gauge theory, you must have some electrically charged state with a charge to Mauritio bigger than... with a charge to mass ratio bigger than the charge to mass ratio of an extremal black hole. And this is just like the mild version, okay, that also Lars focused on. But in practice, when you study this conjecture in string theory and you go to the weak coupling limit especially, you always find that it's not just that you have one particle that satisfies the gravity, but you have infinitely many, like you have a full sub-lattice or a tower of superextreme. A tower of superextremal states that satisfy the gravity conjecture. Okay, and therefore, when the gauge coupling goes to zero, okay, since the charge is proportional to the gauge coupling, then the mass also must go to zero. So in the weak coupling limits, what happens is that you get an infinite tower of states that is becoming massless and satisfies this inequality. Okay, so this is what happens in the steam-theory examples. Now, the distance conjecture is the statement that regardless of whether you have a gauge theory or not, if you are approaching some infinite distance limit, some boundary of the field space, you should get an infinite number of states that become exponentially large in terms of the geodesic distance that you travel. Okay, so that as you go to the boundary, the states will become massless and they become. states will become massless and they become exponentially massless in terms of the geodesic field distance so these are the conjectures um and what i as i said what i the the general i mean even if these two conjectures were formulated independently and in principle had nothing to do one with the other both when we study both in street theory they become the same statement because they are just telling me that when i go to this infinite distance limit To these infinite distance limits, that maybe, or I mean, some of them will have some weekly coupled description because maybe some of them are realized by having some gauge coupling that goes to zero. Then I get towers of states that are becoming light. So that approximate global symmetries, weekly coupled gauge theories, large field ranges, I mean, you can have them in quantum gravity, but they come at a price in the sense that they come together with these towers of states, which implies that the UV catov must go to zero. To zero. Okay, so since we are talking about an infinite number of states, since we cannot have infinitely many fields which we capable to instant gravity, the quantum gravity cutoff is going to zero. And as I said, it becomes below the Planck scale. Okay, so the cutoff that is dictated by these towers of states goes proportional to the discopy or exponentially in terms of the field distance. So it's below the Planck scale and goes to zero when you take this particular. Zero when you take these particular limits. Okay. Okay, so this feature, I mean, just this feature that the catoff goes to zero when we try to engineer a small cage capping or a large field range is what I want to focus in this talk. Okay, very good. So before getting to more details on that, let me just mention why is this interesting for phenomenology. So the Wii gravity conjecture is interesting because Gravity context is interesting because, I mean, it's going to constrain theories that have tiny, like very small gauge cappings or very large axionic decay constants because they have to come together then with this reaction of the cutoff. And therefore, it depends what is the energy scale at which you need the EFT to be valid. It will be in the sample and or not. It will be fine or not. If you want to have a description of an EFT, To have an EFT which is valid up to a very large energy, then small gauge couplings and large action decay constant will be problematic, because the cutoff is very long. And the distance conjecture is going to constrain theories with large field ranges. So again, it also puts a bound on what is the maximum field range that an EFT can describe in terms of, I mean, when you have a fixed finite cutoff. Okay, so how much it depends also on what is the cutoff. So what is the So, what is the cutoff? So, what is the energy of the process that you want to describe? And for example, I mean, the typical implication is to use it for inflation, because then since the Hubble scale has to be at least below the cutoff, the quantum gravity cutoff, you can obtain some correlation between the field range and the Hubble scale, or if you wish, a correlation between the field range and the tensor-to-scalar ratio that scales with the opposite, well, has the opposite scaling. Uh, well, it has the opposite scaling and the least bound. Okay, so there is only a finite region which is allowed with slow, I mean, that realizes slow role and is consistent with quantum gravity. Okay, I put this plot precisely to emphasize that it's not that there is a sharp bound on the field range, like a concrete number, it's a relation between the field range and the cutoff. And the point is that this referres to a finite region, so not everything is ruled out, but it's constrained, depending what is the model that you want to describe. That you want to describe, okay? So, as we said, there are two ways. Now, I mean, we have this observation, we have this step zero, we identify some patterns, and now we have to gather evidence for it and try to explain why they should hold in general. So, in the past few years, we've been working a lot into trying to gather evidence for these conjectures. Evidence for these conjectures from string theory. Okay, so just taking a very systematic approach, depending on the level of supersymmetry, in which we try to identify precisely what are the towers that become light and to what extent this conjecture is satisfied for any infinite distance limit that you could have in the modernized space. So, in this talk, I'm not going to discuss this in detail. This is just one slide to summarize what is the state of the art and remark that. The art and remark that at the moment we have a pretty solid understanding of what is going on for the case of extended supersymmetry. Okay, so for theories with eight supercharges or more, because then we have just a flat modern space. We have done some systematic classification of the possible infinite distance limits and identify what are the towers in each case. Also, more recently, we are trying to reduce now the level. Recently, we are trying to reduce now the level of supersymmetry because, of course, that's the case, which is more interesting for phenomenology, but it's also the hardest one to do. So the state of the art is that now we have some studies, but that are not complete yet about what happens when you have any class one in four dimensions. And also recently, we have also translated these statements, these conjectures to ADCFT to show that. To show that also, when you go to infinite distance limits in the conformal manifold, you also get tower of operators that sat to date the unitarity bound and is the equivalent of these conjectures in the back. Okay, so that's another avenue also to try to prove them in the context of areas. Okay, so why? I mean, this is of course limited to string theory because this is about string theory compatifications, but it's useful precisely to It's useful precisely to make the conjectures more precise and also, for example, give understand what is the exponential rate. So, here, when I'm saying that it's a tower of state that become exponentially light with the field distance, the conjecture is not telling me how fast, like what is the exponential rate. And in order to give any precise phenomenon implication, I need to determine what these order one factors are. I need to determine all these exponential rates. So, from the point of view of string theory, since we have classification of all the possibilities, we can give bounds of what these exponential rates are. And they are always like order one factors that depend on the geometry and sometimes also on the discrete symmetries that restoring the limit. And that can be related to the weak gravity externality bound whenever the tower of state is charged under some gauge field. So, again, this was just a summary in case someone has any question or wants to comment on something. Otherwise, let me just also say that in the context of ADSFT, we can also give some sharp results because now we have more tools from CFT. And indeed, this exponential rate is always bounded by some sort of order one. Sort of order one factor. Okay. Okay, so any questions? So, this is what I want to say about the sleek theory evidence. And now, for the rest of this talk, I want to try to answer the or try to motivate why these towers of state that we observe in these weak coupling limits or these large field ranges should be a general feature of quantum gravity, regardless of strength theory. Okay, but is there any question before I? Okay, but is there any question before that? Okay. Yeah, this is a question? No? Okay. So, okay, so this is, I mean, this is very nice. I've been very focused and always trying to get evidence from state theory to make this more precise. But yeah, like a bottom-up explanation of why these Star Wars states should appear was always missing. Here was always missing. Okay, so for the w gravity conjecture, we have some ideas, but for the distance conjecture, there is really no bottom-up motivation. Okay, why should hope? So a promising avenue typically to give general arguments is to think about black hole physics. Okay, it's like a nice laboratory of quantum gravity. And by thinking about unitary black hole operation or other things, we can try to argue. Try to argue why, for example, the absence of global symmetries or other things would be general features of quantum gravity. Now, for the distance conjecture, so the statement that we have towers becoming exponentially light on the field distance, there is simply no argument at all based on black hole physics, okay, that could motivate this so far, okay, until last week. For the wood gravity conjecture, there is some black hole argument that motivates it. hole argument that motivates it that's why the reality conjecture was i mean got a lot of attention and was very important because it had both string theory and black hole motivations but it's based on requiring that black holes must decay so this is something that large explained before this morning and it the point or the problem is that it only supports a mild version of the good writing okay so it has it Version of the good gravity. Okay, so as it has been pointed out, the fact that a steamer black hole must decay only requires the existence of a particle, but this particle could be very massive, and still the black hole can decay, and this has no effect on the infrared, on the phenomenology. So it's like on one hand, we have this black hole motivation that only gives rise to this mild version, but on the other hand, from MST theory, we know that there are stronger versions that are realized. So it would be nice, it would be useful. Would be useful to have a platform motivation for these stronger versions, okay? For the version that will have a tower of particles that is becoming light and not just a single one. So what I'm going to do in the rest of the talk is to provide a new argument for these asymptotic towers of states, both for the distance conjecture and this strong version of the gravity, based on fineness of black hole entropy. And then I will speculate a bit how maybe these findings of black hole entropy can be generalized. And many of these champland conjectures can actually be argued or derived from more general notion of fineness of quantum gravity amplitudes, which has a very nice connection with the emergence proposal, which is something that I will explain in more detail later. Okay, so let's go for it. So just before giving you the black hole argument, let me mention something about finances. So many of these strong blank conjectures, these conditions, emerge, at least naively, from a replacement of some infinite by a finite number. Okay, so typically, for example, for the Typically, for example, for the weak gravity conjecture, it's telling you that you cannot have, like, that you cannot just take this weak gravity particle and send the mass to infinity, like the mass is upper bounded. Or if you wish, like the inverse gauge coupling, so the gauge kinetic function cannot be infinite. Or the distance conjecture puts you a bound on the field range. Okay, so from the perspective of quantum field theory, you could have even an infinite field range. Even an infinite field range, and as long as there is no energy that becomes above the cutoff. But from a gravity perspective, this field range happens to be bounded. And also, as we were discussing with Miguel, we all suspect that there is a finite number of degrees of freedom below a cutoff in the presence of gravity. So again, we go from infinite to finite and also a finite number of quantum gravity back. Okay, so all this finances in practice in the conjecture. In practice, in the conjectures, appears because the Planck mass is finite. And that's why when you send the Planck mass to infinity and you don't have dynamical gravity anymore, and you just have a quantum field theory, all these constraints disappear. So it's really important that you have gravity dynamical, and therefore the Planck mass is finite. And this gives rise to bounds on some properties of the EFT. Okay, so finite data seems to be behind many of these conditions. And what we try to do. Conditions. And what we try to do in this paper is to initiate some program to view all these one-planned criteria from this perspective of finiteness and taking a step into unifying these conditions. Okay, so for the rest of the talk now, I'm going to focus on this second part, which is, yeah, I will give you this new black hole entropy argument. Black hole entropy argument in favor of these double states, which motivate this stronger version of the gravity, and related to the finances of quantum gravity amplitudes and the Mercedes proposal. Okay, any question? Okay, so let me go through the argument slowly. So, the goal right now is So the goal right now is to, so let's try to find what is the problem that happens in the effective fist theory when we try to engineer a very large fuel range or a small weak coupling. And in order to address this issue, we are trying to engineer this large field range or this weak coupling limit by the presence of some solitonic object in my effective field theory. Okay, so when I have some solitonic object, like for example, some black hole. Like, for example, some black hole, this can induce some flow of the scalar fields or the gauge cappings as I approach the black hole horizon. And the goal will be try to tell me what goes wrong if this black hole engineers a very large field displacement or try to engineer a very small gauge capping when we approach the horizon. Okay, so what goes wrong there? Okay, so what goes wrong there just by thinking of black holes now? This has been a very useful avenue of thinking in also these previous papers in which they, for example, in this one of Eran Party, he was trying to provide motivations for this conjecture, thinking of charge the latonic black holes and requiring that the system The system, when you engineer a large field range, does not become a black hole itself, so that you cannot have large field ranges in weakly couple backgrounds. But also, like in these other papers, like thinking of bubbles of nothing, the natonic black holes or large black hole, like all these papers try to engineer these flows and somehow give a motivation of showing that when you have a very large range, that is something that happens. That happens, okay. This was not always obvious that whatever happens is a problem, but the EFT was changing in some drastic way, okay. So, what I want to do now is really to show that there is really a problem in quantum gravity when we try to do this. Okay, and by in, I mean, in order to achieve this, I'm going to focus on what we call small black holes that I will explain. Okay, so let me take Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory. Okay, so we have Theory. Okay, so we have some gauge field whose gauge coupling is parameterized by some scalar field such that the gauge coupling goes to zero as the scalar field goes to infinity. Okay, so this is the theory that we consider. And we want to understand what goes wrong when this gate charging goes to zero or the field range goes to infinity. So what we are going to do is to look for electrically charged extremal black hole solutions. Extreme black hole solutions. Okay, so this is the answer for the black hole, and they are just electrically charged, so there is no magnetic gauge field. Now, since this is like a truncation of n equals 2, one can use techniques from the attractor mechanism, and the dynamics of this solution is captured by the equation of motion of this one-dimensional Lagrangian, subject to this constraint for the case of extremal black holes. Okay, so the Holes. So, how the scalar field changes as we approach the black hole is determined by the question of motion of this Lagrangian. So, this black hole is going to induce a running of the scalar. And I'm using some coordinates such that the tau equals zero is the asymptotic, is the asymptotic value, while the horizon is located at tau equals minus infinity. At tau equals minus infinity. Okay, so the first thing is that we can prove that extremal solutions that are only electrically charged will always have zero area. So it corresponds to these small black holes. Okay, so this is, you can, it's very simple. Like if you take this constraint that we have here for extreme R solutions, since the contribution from the scalar is positive definite, implies that the derivative of the warping factor satisfies this. For the warping factor, satisfy this inequality. And now the area of the sphere, right, the area of the horizon, is given in terms of this warping factor in this way. So by integrating out, by integrating this equation, we get this inequality for the area. So this means that if the gauge coupling is constant, so doesn't flow, doesn't change as you approach the black hole horizon, because The black hole horizon because it doesn't depend on any scalar field, then the area can be finite, and then we have we recover the typical risen nostrum black hole solutions. However, if the gauge coupling goes to zero at the horizon, okay, then the area of the black hole also needs to go necessarily to zero because it needs to satisfy this inequality. And this is what we call these small black holes. Now, to give a concrete example. Now, to give a concrete example, if the gauge capping is given by the exponential of a scalar field, as typically happens in string theory, then this is the solution of how the scalar field behaves as we approach the black hole. So here I wrote it in these more familiar coordinates in which r is related to tau by this equation here. But the whole point is that the scalar field behaves logarithmically with the Behaves logarithmically with the area, such that since the area goes to zero as the gauge capping goes to zero, also the field range goes to infinity. Okay, so we have some black hole solution, and the doesn't matter what is the value that we start asymptotically as we approach the black hole, the gauge coupling will go to zero and the scalar field will go to infinity. So we engineer some very large field range already within a given effective ESDR. And this is one of the comments. This is one of the comments I wanted to make is that these large field variations, yes, we have some, are always associated to these small black holes. So when you try to engineer these large field variations in an effective field theory, they are confined in small regions of space. And that's why it makes sense that they are constrained by the UV convision of the theory. Because you necessarily need to probe small regions. Okay, so what is the probe? Okay, so what's the problem with this? Okay, so now we are saying that, okay, we can engineer this large field variation, but then they are associated with these small black holes in which the area of the horizon goes to zero. So they are like nearly point-like objects. And we have infinitely many because we can have any value of the gate charge. Okay. So this sounds weird. Like, I mean, how come? I mean, in this simple theory, I just get now an infinite number of nearly points. An infinite number of nearly point objects. The resolution, I mean, if you work from the same theory, is that we know that these solutions, this effective field theory, will receive corrections such that the area of the graph hole is no longer zero, but gets some small value. Okay, so in practice from steam theory, we know that, yeah, like this EFT at some point is going to break down and you have corrections that imply that these small black holes get a non-zero area and a non-zero entry. Zero area and a non-zero entropy. Now, what I want to do is let's forget about the string theory input. Okay, I don't know what is string theory. I just want to show that these small black holes are problematic. They are going to lead to a violation of the Wacomistine bound, unless indeed the EFT breaks down, as typically happens in the steam embeddings. And I want to derive from a purely bottom-up perspective how fast this EFT should break down. This EFT should break down. And I will show you that in order to satisfy the Bekenstein bound, so entropy bounds, the cutoff of the theory, so the effective field theory has to break down at some energy scale that goes to zero precisely as dictated by the distance conjecture and the wood gravity conjecture. Okay, so that's like an argument in favor of these conjectures. Okay, so let me give you the argument. It's just one slide. You, the argument is just one slide, or two slides, maybe. So, the entropy bound that I'm using is that a region of size L cannot have more entropy than dispersive black hole of the same area. Okay, so this is like this entropy bound, which means in particular that the number of these things of different black hole states that can fit in a box of size L should not grow larger than L. Should not grow larger than L square because then the entropy would be larger than the entropy of the black hole. So if these small black holes really have zero area, if they are point-like, they clearly violate this bound because then I can just fit infinitely many inside the box because they are just point-like. And this would be against this entropy bound. Okay, so something the flexive free theory has to break down. Like this solution cannot be valid. Okay, they cannot have zero area. They cannot have zero area. And what I want to determine is exactly how, I mean, what is the effective area that would be consistent with this entropy bound? So what is the cutoff of the EFT? Because this way this will solve the problem. So if the effective field theory breaks down, they will get some effective area. And hopefully, if the idea is that if the cutoff goes to zero sufficiently fast, this area will be. Sufficiently fast, this area will grow sufficiently fast such that this entropy bound is satisfied. Okay, so this is the goal to determine how the cutoff must behave to avoid violation of this entropy bound. Okay, any question? Okay, so how do we determine that the EFT baseline? Well, if you study these solutions more carefully, you can realize that the gradient of the scalar That the gradient of the scalar field is also going to infinity as you approach the black hole horizon. Okay, so indeed, whenever the gradient of the scalar field becomes of order the cutoff of the theory, I cannot trust the solution anymore. So this can be used as a proxy, as a way to determine when, at what distance from the black hole, the EFT is breaking down. So this will happen whenever the gradient of this scalar field range, the scalar. Of this scalar field range, the scalar field becomes a further catalog. So, using also the, I mean, these attractor flow equations, which give rise to this inequality, and that the area was written in this way, if you remember from a couple of slides before, by plugging this back here, this gives me a relation between the cutoff and the area, the sective area. Okay, so. Okay, so it's telling me that for a black hole of a fixed charge, the cutoff of the theory must be below this result that depends on the effective area. Or in other words, that if you have an effective theory with a fixed cutoff, the effective area of these small black holes satisfies this inequality. Okay. Okay, good. So now what we need to do is to count what is the entropy, like how many. Count what is the entropy, like how many black hole states we can fit in a box of size L. Okay. To see, yeah, like to compare with the Beckenstein bound and then try to get to see if we can avoid it or we valuate it. So in the, I mean, in order, yes, please. So in the bound you had in the last slide, why can't you take g to infinity? So the thing is that because of the black hole solution, so the gauge coupling is running, it's changing. And I'm considering cases in which they are electrically charged, the black holes, so the gauge coupling is going to zero at the black hole horizon. I see, I see. And that's why, exactly. I see. So it's like you start with a finite value at infinity. Okay, we start with a finite value of the gauge coping, and then the gaze coping is. Value of the gaze coupling, and then the gaze coupling is going to go to zero. And this implies that, yeah, the cutoff will also have to go to zero in this way. That depends also on the area. Okay, yeah, so no matter where you start with, at the moment you hit the horizon, your G has to reach zero. I see. Exactly. Yes. Yeah, for these particular solutions. Irene, I have a question. There are corrections to the Beckenstein bound, right? Time bound, right? And do they matter in this linear? They are correlations to the entropy, no, that's which you can try to understand as correlations to the bound. What I'm taking here is like kind of bottom-up approach. Like I'm trying to determine what should be the size of this correction, such that the biggest thing bound is not violated. So it's like we know that something is wrong, like the effective facility has to break down. So let's try to estimate from a bottom up. So let's try to estimate from a bottom-up perspective what is exactly the behavior of the cutoff such that the corrections become important and therefore, I mean, there is no problem. If you have unstream theory embedding, then you can compute the corrections and so on. But the goal here is precisely try to understand how, yeah, like what is the cutoff of the new physics that would give me corrections and therefore avoid a violation of the Wittgenstein model. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, so onehow we have this inequality here, which is just based on the attractor flow equations of the black hole and the fact that at some point the BCFT is going to break down because the gradient of the scalar field becomes too large. Now, we want to combine this now with the breaking steam valve. So to count how many steps I can fit in the box, let me work on the microcanonical ensemble. Ensemble. So the entropy is going to be proportional to the number of species that I have in the box, like the different states. And the point is that since we are going, we are the weak coupling, like the gates coupling is very small, the interactions are becoming negligible. And also, since they are becoming very small, also the gravitational interactions are becoming very small. So in this, we Very small, so in these weak coupling limits, okay, so not in general for any value of the edge coupling, but in the weak coupling limits when the x-coupling goes to zero, the each black hole for each value of the chart counts as a different species, okay, because all the interactions are negligible. So, in that sense, the number of species is just given by the, like if I have one with charge one, another one with charge two, another one with charge three, the number of species is going to be given by the maximum value of the charge. Given by the maximum value of the charge, okay, that I'm fitting inside the box. And therefore, this entropy bound is telling me that the maximum charge that I can fit in the box has to be smaller than the area of a black hole of that size. So this would be the entropy bound. So if I combine this condition that I had relating the cutoff and the area before with this entropy bound, what I get is just that in I get is just that indeed the cutoff has to be smaller than the gauge coupling in Planck units. Okay, so this is precisely the cutoff that is determined, that is predicted by the Wii gravity conjecture. That you need to have new physics that scale with the gauge coupling, such that if the gauge coupling goes to zero, the catoff, I mean, the masses of these states also go to zero in the same way. And as I promised, it's support. I promised it supports a strong version of the gravity because it's not enough to have just one state. So, this is not about instability of the black holes, this is about entropy bounds. So, having one particle with a mass smaller than the charge doesn't help, like I can just integrate it in and I still have these black hole solutions. So, I really need that the local EFT description completely breaks down. So, I need to have like the quantum gradient of must go to zero, which typically happens when you have not just Typically, happens when you have not just one or a finite number of states, but infinitely many states that are becoming light. Okay, so that's why, like, thinking of entropy bounds is more, well, can give stronger, can give motivation for stronger versions of these conjectures, okay, in which we need infinitely many. May I ask a question? Yes. So, is it clear that these states are also super extreme? So, what we can derive from this is that the mass of the states, which is associated with the cutoff, has to be smaller or of order the gauge capping, right? So, in that sense, they are super extreme. I mean, like this cutoff is, I mean, I mean, these are bottom-ups, so you just know what the cutoff should be, but this cutoff, right, then in practice is the mass. In practice, it's the mass of some states, right? Like new physics that appears. There you go, thanks. Okay. And also, it's by thinking of these small black holes, it's a way to make quantitative or this trouble with remnants and so on that people typically talk about when discussing the absence of global symmetries and so on. So we always said that. So we always said that maybe with the weak gravity conjecture, when the gauge coupling becomes small, you should get some trouble with remnants in the same way that you get it when you have a global symmetry. But it was very difficult to make that argument precise. And the problem is that before we were just thinking of Reisner-Nostrom black holes. But if you think of these small black holes that are that the gauge capping is parameterized by some scalar fields, then you can make this trouble with remnants. This trouble with this violation of the entropy bounds more quantitative. Okay, very good. So let me also mention that it also provides a black hole argument for the distance conjecture precisely because what we are saying that it's not enough just to have a finite number of states becoming large, because still that would give rise to a violation of the entropy bounds. We really need a drastic breakdown of the EFT. We need to have infinite many. Of the EFT, we need to have infinitely many fields that are charged and that become masses. So, in that sense, it correlates with the distance conductor, okay, because we need infinitely many fields. And since we are taking, I mean, this is a limit in which the field range is also going to infinity. So, in that sense, we are recovering the statement that we get infinitely many fields becoming massless when the field range goes to infinity. Now, the exponential behavior is more tricky. Now, the exponential behavior is more tricky, okay? So the distance conjecture also tells you that the cutoff should behave exponentially on the field distance. And this is only satisfied here if the gauge coupling itself goes exponentially, okay? Because what we are recovering is that the cutoff has to be smaller than the gauge coupling. So this is the, I mean, this behavior for the gauge coupling is the asymptotic behavior that we always observe in thing theory. So the gauge couplings always behave exponentially when we move to... When we move to when we approach the infinity stance boundaries of the modular space. But it's a fair question to what extent this is just a Lampos effect or a fundamental, or there is a fundamental reason behind. Because from this black hole perspective, there is no fundamental reason that supports this exponential behavior. Now, I want to comment that the emergence proposal that I'm going to discuss now in more detail, but basically the In more detail, but basically, the proposal that the infinite distance limits and the weak coupling limits emerge from integrating out the towers of states that are becoming light gives some motivation for this exponential behavior. Because if you now really associate this cutoff to some tower of states and you integrate out the tower of states, the quantum corrections to the gauge coupling from integrating out the tower implies that the renormalized gauge coupling behaves. The renormalized grids have been behaved exponentially in terms of the field distance. So maybe it's a kind of a circular thing that you need the tower, but then the tower will give rise to this exponential behavior. Okay, any other question? Okay, so in the last five minutes, well, maybe I want to push some open questions and then try to give you some more general. Give you some more general speculation or arguments of how all these features could arise more generally from thinking of finiteness of quantum gravity amplitudes and not just finiteness of black hole entropy. So first, so this was a motivation for the distance conjecture in the case in which there is a hiscarping that goes to zero. But of course, you should ask whether there is any infinite distance limit that does not correspond to all the carpeting limits. That does not correspond to what we can put limits. So, whether maybe, I mean, we can have something, I mean, whether there is some marginal limit in which we cannot apply this argument. And all I can say right now is that at the moment from string theory, all the infinite distance limits that we know always have some p-form discouraging that vanishes asymptotically. And I believe that this is a general feature of quantum gravity and also fits with this emerging. And also fits with this emergent string conjecture of Timova Ekan and collaborators, but there is no proof for this. Okay, so it would be very interesting to understand whether it's ever possible to have a large field range, an infinite distance limit that is not associated to having any p-form harping going to zero. Okay, so yeah, as I said, so just to finish in the last few minutes, let me try. Let me try to generalize this for the case in which I don't even have a gauge theory. Okay, so as I said, like so far in the string theory examples, we always have a gauge coupling, so that's why we focused on this case. But we can also argue that non-compact scalars are problematic, like infinite distances are problematic in quantum gravity, regardless of whether we have a edge-speed theory, if instead of imposing finiteness of the black hole entropy, we impose fineness of partition finess. Fineness of partition function, fineness of quantum gravity employees. So, for example, if you take a free scalar field theory and compactify to one dimension, okay, if you compute the partition function, you're going to see that divergence because I have a continuum of eigenstates, okay, because the momentum is continuous. And unless the scalar field is compact, such that the momentum eigenvalues become discrete, the partition function is going to diverge. Going to diverge. And in order to keep it finite, our resolution is that indeed the cutoff of this theory goes to zero as the field range goes to infinity. Now, this is not strong enough to derive the exponential behavior either. Okay, it's the same that happened before. But as I already remarked it, by using the emergence proposal, in particular that infinite distance emerges from integrating out the infinite hour of expectation. out the infinite hour of expectations, we can. I mean, we saw some years ago that the quantum corrections, not only to the gates coupling, but also to the thin metric, are always going to behave this way, regardless of the behavior of the mass, such that when you compute the distance, which is the integral of this metric, right, of the square root of this metric, you always get that the quantum corrective field distance behaves logarithmically in terms of the mass. So that the mass behaves exponentially. Mass behaves exponentially in terms of the field distance. Okay. Okay, so this emerges proposal is something that we, I mean, we formulated some years ago, but if you just want to use this emergence proposal as a motivation for this conjecture, there was some implicit assumption, which was that the infinite distance only emerges in the infrared from integrating out the corrections, meaning that in the UV, everything should be. Meaning that in the UV everything should be compact. Okay, so that this infinite distance is kind of an artifact of the IR description. And why the infinite distance, why we cannot start already with a classical divergence, why we cannot have a compact, a non-compact scalar in the UV was not justified. But thinking of this fineness of partition function can be used to give a motivation for this assumption that we had some years ago. Okay, so this fineness of partition function can be used to motivate this UV compact. To motivate this UV compactness in the UV because non-compact scalars would imply a divergent partition function when compactified. Now, the question, the obvious question then is, okay, why this partition function should be finite. So when we are talking about black hole entropy, like everybody accepts that black hole entropy is finite, right? Like we have all these entropy bounds and so on. But it's not so obvious whether any partition function should be finite or what is the exact notion of. The exact notion of amplitude of quantum gravity amplitude that should be fine. Okay, so black hole entropy is an example of that, but there are other examples. So the fact that this partition functions should be finite is a generalization of this idea that has been pushed in these papers by Kunron Baffa and collaborators, in which they see all these scalar fields as. Or these scalar fields as volume degrees of freedom of some brain, and therefore the moderate space of this brain should be compact because otherwise one would get infinite entropy. Okay, so there's a way to correlate like fineness of the black hole entropy to this compactness of the moduli space and fininess of this partition function. And more generally, just to finish the talk. Generally, just to finish the talk, what we did in the paper is also try to, I mean, we can think or initiate a program in which maybe these strong-planned conditions emerge not only from finiteness of black hole entropy, but more generally from finiteness of quantum gravity amplitudes. Like I should require in general this partition functions should be finite. Okay, and when I mean when I say quantum gravity amplitudes, I mean like S-matrix elements, CFT correlators, and so on. So, this, I mean, this is not an answer, this is just the beginning. Okay, so this is a possibility that we want to explore in the future whether this finances of quantum gravity amplitudes could be behind all these software conditions and be some underlying principle that unifies these conjectures. So, just sorry, if I was taking two minutes more, I wanted to make just one very quick last comment that if we believe in this. Comment that if we believe in this fineness of quantum gravity amplitude, then we can also use it to motivate the fineness of the string landscape. Because when we compactify, if we have infinitely many possible compactifications or vacua, infinitely many vacua, this scalar field is going to probe all this vacua in lower dimensions. So again, the partition function would diverge and that would be inconsistent. So this would imply that the number of low energy FTs That are consistent with quantum gravity and valid up to a fixed cutoff. So it's very important that we always have a finite cutoff. This number of effective retailers will be finite. And this connects with nice previous works that you can ask me about if you wish. So let me conclude. So I show you some new arguments based on black hole entropy to motivate this presence of towers of states. presence of towers of states that become light at the weak opening limits or large field ranges which gives motivation for the weak gravity congestion and the distance conjecture um in the future we want to explore in more detail whether finance of quantum gravity amplitudes could be behind many of these chromatin conditions and be used as an argument beyond whether we have a string theory you recompletion or not okay so thank you very much for your attention and So, thank you very much for your attention. And see if there are further questions. Thanks a lot for your nice talk, Irene. So, before going to questions, just let me remind you that we have the photo group just after finishing this session. So, please, Fernando, go ahead. Well, very nice talk, Irani, very interesting. So, but I was a little bit disappointed because I was looking forward to this final. I was looking forward to the finalness of Stream Varco, and you went very fast. Okay, I can elaborate on that. It's just I wanted to leave half an hour for questions and discussion just in case, but I would be super happy to elaborate a bit. Okay, so yeah, so the first thing is that like this same argument that we use to say that we cannot have non-compact scalars, you can use it to motivate that you cannot have It to motivate that you cannot have infinitely many vacuums because, again, like the scalar field is going to probe all possibilities in quantum mechanics, so that will give rise to a divergent partition function. So, if you don't want to have divergent partition functions, then you should have only a finite number of possibilities that the scalar field can explore. So, that's kind of the idea behind. I mean, also, regardless of scalar fields, you can think in general, like if you compute this partition function and sum over. Compute this partition function and sum over all topologies, right? Like typically, you would expect that this might give rise to some divergence if you have infinitely many. So, I mean, I think, I mean, this is just like some hand-waving argument, but then in the next slide, I think it motivates that. Exactly. So, now, so the statement that we think it makes sense is that below a cutoff, we should have only a finite number of low energy FTs. So, it's, I wanted to remark. So, the cutoff is important for. I wanted to remark so the cutoff is important for several reasons. One is that this way we can cut off the infinitescal states of vapua, right? Because I mean, you could ask what happens when you have a scalar potential and then you have like many vapua that have smaller and smaller vacuum energy. But typically, right, like this is happening like at large field ranges. So if you have a finite cutoff, in the same way that a finite cutoff gives you a finite field range, it's also going to give you a finite value, a finite number of if. finite value a finite number of EFTs so I don't think the I don't think it's true in general you have like finite number of EFTs from quantum gravity in complete generality just you have a finite number of EFTs that are valid at least up to some energy scale and it's very similar to the distance conjecture right it's a kind of a generalization of distance conjecture but thinking of discrete vacuum instead of moving in a continuous way it was the first comment then it's also it's And it's also compatible with what we know from ADS, right? Because in ADS, for example, you can have like infinite families of vacuum when you have a large n, right? Because you can have different values of the fluxes. But again, this comes together with towers of states because of the internal dimensions. So the cutoff is also changing. So if you fix the cutoff, again, you only have a finite number of variables. And it's got It connects, I mean, the yeah, with previous work, I mean, that I that's what I missed to say, that there is this, this is very interesting Chiger's theorem, that this, he shows that it's a mathematical theorem, which shows that you have an infinite family of Riemannian manifolds with a metric such that the curvatures are bounded, and the volumes are bounded, and the diameters are bounded. Bounded and the diameters are bounded, you only have a finite number of diffimorphism types. So these bounded curvatures and volumes and diameters is associated again to having a finite cutoff, right? Because if we have an infinite volume, again, the cutoff is going to go to zero. So by having a, I mean, I think the way to phrase this in a physical way, again, is to have a finite cutoff. So we have a finite curvature that we can have, like, so Einstein gravity is valid. We have finite volumes, finite diagrams. You have finite volumes, finite diameters, and therefore, like this in particular, this mathematical theorem would indeed tell you that you only have a finite number of possibilities. And it's also, I mean, probably you know this paper of Daglas and Archaria, which they also have like similar ideas that are related to having a bound on the KK scale, bound on the volume. So, I mean, all these things in the end, like thinking of the distance conjecture are like bounds on the cutoff because you want to cut on this infinite. Off because you want to cut all these infinite distance limits to have to cut these infinite distance takes. Thank you very much. So that's kind of the idea. Yeah, thanks for a nice talk. I just have sort of a follow-up question. I guess so this finadeness of the black hole entropy, I guess that doesn't really allow you to fix sort of the order one coefficient that should like appear in every gravity conjecture, because normally we know like sort of you. So, like, sort of you the bound is with respect to like the black hole externality bound. And I guess that here that's difficult because you don't really know exactly the precise value of the entropy at the transition point. Yeah, like it's true. Yeah, when we have the entropy, the package tempo, right? Maybe there is like some more than one factor. I mean, it's difficult to argue with complete with a sharp. But you can, for example, it can fix. You can, for example, it can fix okay, it doesn't fix the order one factor for the weak gravity, but it fixes for the distance conjecture because let me go here. So, if the gauge capping goes exponentially, right, then the cutoff really has to go with the same exponential power, like the same exponential rate. So, this is this A is typically the factor of the distance condition, and we don't know how to fix it. Fact of the distance condition, and we don't know how to fix. So, in that case, that's I mean, that's more clear. But yeah, I think it would be very interesting if there's some sort of way of fixing this Order one coefficient, because I think it's sort of related to the fact if you have like this black hole string transition, if you take like a highly excited string and you increase the string coupling in a bit and then it forms a black hole, then we know that the entropy matches up to an order one coefficient. And typically, only like in very special cases, or if you have like BPS states, you know. Okay, so if you have like DPS states, you know that it's coefficient. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So I think, in particular, this is like VPS states or supersymmetry setups or ADS some areas setups, then we can do it exactly because then we can have a more sharp definition of this entropy bound, right? Yeah, I think it would be interesting if there are some argument by which to fix this order one coefficient. I think you might have a way of arguing for like the microscopic description of like black hole entropy, even in the non-super. Be even like in the non-super symmetric case, which would be really amazing. Another question? Well, I don't know whether this is a good question, but I would like. Question, but I would like to repeat the question that was addressed to Miguel. Whether you have seen the paper by the Always on Radiative Generation of DS from ADS, and he states a sentence that makes me a little bit nervous at the end of his abstract, immediately. He says that whatever he shows in this paper makes the swamp plant conjecture physically irrelevant. So, have you taken a look at this paper? Can you say a few words on it? Paper, can you say a few words on it? So, say, tell me the paper again, sorry. It's uh, by Shanta de Albuz. I don't know whether you know him. I could share the link. Probably you haven't seen it. Just so I'd like to know the view of an expert in this particular paper. I put it in the chat. I think he's in the audience. I feel honored. Ah, yeah, okay. Yes. Yes, he is in the audience. Yeah. In the audience, yeah. Hi, Shanta. Yeah, but this was more about all these, yeah, you mean the swamp plant part related to the seed there and right, right? That's true, that's true. But since you're an expert in the swamp plant conjectures, I like to know your interoperability. If you haven't seen the paper, I understand, of course. Understand, of course. Yeah, I feel a bit reluctant right now, like to give a very serious opinion because I have to confess that it's in my true list to read more carefully. I mean, I want to remark, I think probably already what Miguel said, that with the Seeter conjecture, we have good evidence for it in the symptotic limits. It's not clear at all what happens in the middle of the modular space. Modular space. So it's like in process, right? Like we try to understand what is the correct statement that is realized in quantum gravity. So I wouldn't be surprised if many things have to be modified. But yeah, I mean, I should take a careful, I mean, I should read it carefully before giving my opinion. Yeah, fair enough. Thank you. Can I say something? Is there something Shanta is in the audience? Maybe Shanta, can you make a comment? Yeah, I mean, if there is a comment of exactly what is challenging, I mean, exactly, you know, what is the sorry, Yami, let me explain. I mean, the point I was making is that, sorry, can you hear me? Yes. Is that even if you prove Even if you prove that at the string scale or whatever the cutoff scale is, Kalutza-Klein scale, that you cannot get this iterative, that does not mean that the long distance cosmological constant, which is what we measure, cannot be positive. And that's it's a simple renormalization group argument, but so each. So i i i so it's if you like it's it's more uh argument against uh um saying that oh because I cannot get decided in in string theory at the string scale I must necessarily have quintessence that's basically that's basically your okay so you mean that even started with ADS by with relative ADS by with radiative corrections, you can generate the positive cosmological constant, right? Yeah, I don't know, it would be interesting. I mean, I think this connects very nicely also with how these conjectures behave and their RG flow and all these things. So, probably there are many things to understand here. Sure. Any other questions? I have a very naive question, Ilene. So, in your talk, just before Michael, let me ask you my question. You make some emphasis about just electric charge in your black holes. Is this argument changed in some way if you have magnetic charge? Yeah, so the thing is that only Is that only electrically charged black holes have this zero area? If you have both electric and magnetic charges, you have these ionic black holes, then they have a finite area. And these are like the regular black holes that the attractor point happens at a finite distance and you have a finite entropy. So the point here is that, I mean, like, not all black holes behave this way, but like the electrically charged black holes will give you trouble with the with this. Give you a trouble with these entropy bounds. And I think it's precisely, I mean, this is precisely the point like people typically study the dionic ones because it's when, right, you have control and you have finite entropy and so on. But I think it's very interesting to pay more attention to all these small black holes because precisely for these small black holes, we know that the EFT has to break down and we need to have U information. So they are very correlated, right, to all these strong-planned conjectures and these works. And this string theory and input. Okay, thank you. Michel. I have a very naive or provocative or stupid question. So, I mean, how much of your assumption that you know precisely how gravity works goes into these conjectures? I mean, I'm not advocating in any way for anything like Mond or whatever. But you know, I mean, you make a lot of statements that seem to suggest that you precisely know what gravity is. And could you sort of evade some of these? You sort of evade some of these conclusions by just saying, okay, there's some very weird modification of gravity going on, and just I'm not advocating for any of those, but I just say that logically. Yeah, so okay, first, let me say that the last three of you started saying, I have a naive question. I don't think that these are naive questions at all. They are all very good questions. And second, yeah. Questions. And second, yeah, so here, so precisely in this work, I mean, okay. So when, especially when we give evidence from string theory, you have to ask that question, right? Because it's like you are assuming a particular quantum gravity completion. And even if I particularly love it, I mean, you should ask whether maybe we are missing something. With this type of works of thinking of black hole physics, we try to be more general precisely because, yeah, we don't. Precisely because, yeah, we don't want to assume what is the UV completion, but we kind of at least assume that the, I mean, we can describe black holes within that quantum gravity theory. So I think it's an important question, but precisely, I think, thinking along these lines of black hole physics is a way to address the question and try to give more general arguments. I mean, I don't know. I mean, of course, yeah, I'm assuming that we have. Of course, yeah, I'm assuming that we have black holes, but this is also. I'm, I mean, many of these font-plann conjectures are also valid when you have an EFT that is weakly coupled to Einstein gravity. So it's not that we are giving constraints about any quantum gravity theory, we're giving constraints of EFTs that are weakly coupled to Einstein gravity. So there is no room for getting something crazy or something modified. But you probably know that there are people who say, okay, I don't like Einstein gravity, I do something. I don't like Einstein gravity. I do something like modified Newton dynamics. Again, I'm not a fan of those, but I just say that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But in some regime, right, like in the low energy regime, they should recover Einstein gravity, right? Because that's what we observe. So here, it doesn't, I don't, I mean, it could be that it gets modified at some energy scale, but there is some regime in which it looks like an EFT will be coupled to instant gravity. And in that regime, And in that regime, then I can apply these strongbranch conjectures, and they can precisely give me information about what I have to modify from the FT such that I make it compatible with a quantum gravity completion. Like what is the cutoff or what are the new features that should appear? That's kind of the... So, I mean, people sometimes what do is to use these constraints to constraint precisely models of modified gravity and so on, because you can check whether they satisfy the conjectures or not. The conjectures or not, because still there is some regime which they should look as Einstein galactically, right? If they want to describe our universe, medium yes, just a second. Depending on the value of a parameter, you can either have null singularity or naked singularity. Do you distinguish those examples? Yeah, no, so for this entropy argument from a bottom-up perspective, it seems it doesn't really matter because any behavior of the gauge coupling, as long as the gauge coupling goes to zero, will give rise to these small black holes, like this zero area black holes. So in that sense, it doesn't matter what is the value of this exponential, of this exponential A. Exponential A. I think this is more a question about what's going to be the completion. Like maybe not all of them can be like smoothly completed in street theory. Some of them will give rise to next similarity and so on. But that's like more about what would be the usual condition for these solutions. Well, you know, this value of a parameter is typically discrete, right? If you want to grab it from the... Uh, if you want to be grabbing string theory exactly, but because you have a string theory input, I mean, that's like you all these things we know because of string theory, not that we have some discrete values and so on that are realized in practice. But from a purely bottom-up, I don't see, I don't know, maybe you know any argument, but I don't know any argument selecting a particular behavior of the gauge coupling or regionality. But this global strategy. But this global structure of the solution depends. You know, A equal in some normalization, your A equals one is dividing line between null and equals singularities. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I agree. I see. I see a point. I mean, it would be, I mean, maybe it can be used for some generalization of this story. I mean, it would be interesting to check if we can be more precise and see this difference, right? This difference, right, and this entropy elements. Okay, thank you. Any other question? Maybe something simple. Yes, please. Thanks. So which kind of vacua you mean in this finite vacua related to the rounds? So these, of course, are not the city vacua, but so what is what vacuum means there? means there any vacuum like doesn't matter the cosmological constant um so yeah it's like it's just about what are the like what is the landscape right what is the landscape like how many backup we have that are consistent with a quantum gravity completion um so it's especially i mean i mean you can of course this the citadel is more difficult but with eda This the CTA is more difficult, but with ADS, like you can try to make it more precise, right? Like, and it's related to whether you have some scale separation. I mean, not scale separation in the sense that it has to be the same order, but scale separation in the sense of whether you can decouple completely the ADS length for the internal dimensions. And if you have, if we expect to have a finite number of aqua, it means that you should not be able to decouple completely the ADS scale from other, from the size of the internal dimensions or the. Size of the internal dimensions or the scale of other towers that would become light when you try to engineer, when you try to go to the flat space limit. Should if that answers your question. But yeah, I mean, in general, I'm thinking of any, it doesn't matter what is the background. I'm thinking any effective theory, like any discrete backup that I have, with Edias or Minkowski, as long as it's valid up to a fixed catalog. Unstable, the citer also counts. The citadel also counts there. No, if it's unstable, I don't count it as a vacuum, right? I mean, like if you have a runaway, then you would say that you haven't changed many points, right? In a sense, because it's dense. So that's why also like here I is after closing in my moduli spaces, right? So it's about like all the discrete possibilities, such that it costs you some energy to change it, like to go from one. To change it, like to go from one to the other. So, if it's completely unstable, it doesn't count as a vacuum. Okay, thanks. Any other question? Well, if not, I think this is a good time to.
