So our next speaker is Artanema from University of Letbridge. He is going to be talking about the discrete mean value of the Riemann zeta function and its derivatives. Thank you, Kibra. Thank you for the invitation. So in this talk, we're going to teach you about the Riemann zeta function. So let's define if it happened. So the Riemann zeta function is defined by S from n from 1 up to infinity of one remain space. This is not a power series, right? Where S is fixed with E of R sigma greater than, and then something over N of 1 to infinity. So this summary is absolutely convergent in this region, like sigma is greater than in the convergence. And you can write it as a product over time of all time. These are typical examples of additional. Examples of edition series and an Euler product. Riemann at around 1859-1860, he proved that theta satisfies a functional equation of this form. So this gives us a connection between zeta s and zeta 1 minuses with some gamma factors. And zeta is meromorphic continuation to everywhere in the complex body. I think the board is still not fit for it. Okay, so I'm just going to use the cursor for the online participants. Now, by using this Euler product, we know that zeta is non-zero and sigma is greater than one. Now, by using the poles of the gamma function here in the denominator, we see that zeta minus two is zero at minus two minus two. Minus 2, minus 2n for all n. So at negative given integers, we have zeros. When sigma is less than 0, these are all the zeros of zeta. These are called the trivial zeros. Okay, so what do you know so far? We know that zeta is non-zero when sigma is greater than. Sigma is the real part of S. When sigma is less than zero, we have trivial zeros. So the unknown part of the complex plane is just a strip where sigma... It's just a strip where sigma, dual part of S, is between 0 and 1. And this is called the critical strip. And a zero in that region, between zero and one, in that strip, is called a non-terrival zero. And here at the top, we are going to use gamma for the imaginary part of a non-terioral zero. Good, now the question is: do we have those zeros? Yes, we do. Yes, we do. If nt is the number of zeros in the critical strip up to height t, then nt again is like t over 2 pi log t over 2 pi d. So this is at least a constant times t log d. So we have lots of zeros for it. Now the question is, okay, why I'm interested in the zeros of these particular memory was a function in number. Particular normal function in number two. The reason is simple. In order to understand some behaviors of prime numbers, we want to divide by zeta s. So since we want to divide by zeta s, we want to make sure that zeta s is mausoleum. Let's be more precise about what we mean by division. If you use the Euler product representation where real part of S sigma is greater than 1, if you take logarithm and differentiate with respect to S, And differentiate with respect to s and then expanding the denominator here 1 over 1 minus 1 over p to the s into its power series, then what we obtain is a series over prime powers, p to the j s with log base, log p. Let's introduce a formangled function, meaning log p by z, where n is a trans part of the j and zero otherwise. And zero out of, then this series is exactly the same as this one, but it's equals to. So minus no big derivative of Celtic is closely related to tripods. And if you see we are divided by C. Now let's do some complex analysis. I still find it interesting that we can use complex analysis in numbers theory. Because for motivation, what do we need? But a bit of excitement, a bit of surprise. That's all we need to get motivation to study some problems. Similar to the region is complex enough, let's take an integral here. Put it there. If we are taking an integral along a vertical line, real part is 1 plus epsilon. We are taking the integral from minus i infinity all the way up to plus i infinity. This integral is Plus i equal to. This integral is not absolutely convergent. But by controlling the contribution of the tails of this integral, we can define integration assumptions. Now where do we have here? Here in the integrand, we have x over n to the s over s d s. Here n to the s comes from the sum here. Now let's assume x over n is greater. X over n is greater than 1. If X over n is greater than 1, this means that n is less than x. Now we pull this line of integration to the left. So we are integrating P3 of 1 plus epsilon. If we pull this to the left, what do you see? We see the pole at S equals 0. And the contribution that comes from there is 1. And that's how we. One. And that's how we can select the number of values of 1, 1, 10 up to x. Okay, that was the case that x over n is greater than 1. If x over n is less than 1, then we pull this line of integration to the right, in which case we can't see any poles of these. So this trick is called Perron's formula. It's a very powerful technique to select the coefficients of a divisional series. Coefficients of a conditional series in a given direction. And let's do the same with the function, generative function, minus zeta prime over zeta. Now, it appears to the left that the first fall that we see is the fall coming from s equals one, whose contribution is x. And then when we penetrate inside the critical strip, we see the zeros on the reduced as I said. So now, combine these two formulas, we see that some of the functions. You see that some of the function of for my loss function, and it broadgrades the prime powers, it's mostly related to both the loss. So that's why gamma is an emergency number. Good. Now what is the statement of the prime number theorem? The number of prime numbers up to x behaves like x over log x, as you said. That was a conjecture by Gauss by making By making long tables of prime numbers at a very early age, at around 15. And it was proved by Adamar and Dolabelle Poussin. And this statement is equivalent to saying that the summary function of the Formongo function is x plus little mod x. But what this is saying is that the contribution of this over sums of nulls are zeros of three months of actually little of x. So, if we can get a better understanding about the non-trivial zeros, then we can control this error chart in the prime. And the Riemann hypothesis is the conjecture that theta x is now zero when sigma is greater than one over two. So all the zeros are on the one half by the function declaration. What is it the best known philosophy region? It was built in 1958. Korobo and Vinogradov independently. What kind of a region is this? So, if you go up in the critical strip, if t goes to infinity, then the denominator goes to infinity. A constant over a denominator tending to infinity goes to infinity. Denominator tending to interact goes to zero. So this gap between the one line and the zero for region is getting smaller and smaller as we go up in the critical scale. Good. Now moments. Let's introduce a notation. Here in the usual notation we use J sub K, but just for this talk I wrote J sub 2K because it makes it easier to read. Here we have 2K modes. we have two k moment two k moment of the nth derivative of the Riemann zeta function evaluated at its zeros and summed over the zeros non-trivial zeros up to height t and then we are normalizing it by divided by one over divided by n n t n t is number of zeros number of terms in this sum so this is a two-k moment of the So this is a 2k moment of the nth derivative. k can be a real number. It's not necessary, it's positive. It can be negative. But if it's negative, then we need to assume some conjectures about the simplicity of the zero. Good. What can we get out of this? If we can find an asymptotic formula for the two-take moments, such as this one, or an upper bond or a lower one. Or an upper bound or a lower bound for this sum. Then we can get a better understanding about the size of the typical terms on average. It has some other implications as well, like the gaps between the orders of the zeros, or the summary function of the memory's function, or the simplicity of the zeros. So these are some motivations to state this object. What do we know? In terms of asymptotics, we just know two cases. Symptotics, we just have two cases. One case is a trivial case, k0. And the other case is due to Gone, assuming the Lehman hypothesis that the second point of the first derivative of T behaves like one over 12 times more psychology. That's all we know in terms of asymptotics. What about upper and lower bounds? Kolek and Heschal independently conjecture that two kilomons of the first derivative. moment of the first derivative is bounded below and above by the same expression mod t, where the power is k squared plus 2k for the 2k moment of the first derivative. Under the Riemann hypothesis, Kirilla obtained an upper bound of the expected standard for the two k moments of the nth derivative. Here the exponent is k squared. You would exponent this k squared plus 2k for all k greater than or equal to 1. Under Girage, generalized Riemann hypothesis, the statement of the Riemann hypothesis generalized to the Richlai function. Nathan and Milanawich obtained the expected lower bar for the two-gate moment of the first direct k is an Here joint work with Q, Ryan. In a joint work with QBRI and Nathan, we obtained the extended global bound by just assuming the Liam hypothesis for the two-ket moment of n script for all derivatives for all. This is the result with easy statement. So, from now on, what we are going to see is going to be a bit more involved. So, we need to define something. Let's consider this kind of a sum. What are we looking at? Zeta, a sum related to the values of zeta. Zeta at rho, it's zero. Shifted by alpha. And alpha is a small complex number compared to t. Here alpha, modulus of alpha is bounded by one over log. Here we see two other factors, x and y. They are some bounded. They are some bounded sums. They're just finite sums. We are going to see the definitions of x and y. And the notation we are going to use for this shifted sum is S alpha TXY. Alpha represents the shift. Okay, these are definitions for X and Y. Here we are looking at X and Y summed up to N. They are finite sums. N is bounded by a power. n is bounded by a power of t, where the power is between 0 and 1 over 2. What are the coefficients on xn and yn? The first conditions, they are saying that xn and yn are bounded by the generalized divisive functions multiplied by some powers of law. The second set of assumptions, they are saying xn and yn, they satisfy a sub-multiplicativity condition. So these are the definitions and the assumptions. Okay, so these are the definitions and the assumptions for the next obvious audience. A few more definitions. In order to realize the effect of the shift, alpha is the shift, right? We introduce S sub alpha N, an arithmetic function, just n to the alpha. Capital Phi S chi is just a product of prime factors of K. S k is prime factors of K. is prime factors of k. If k is 1, you take phi s1 to be 1. One more definition. Now this time we have h and k. We have two integer variables, two natural number variables. And it's defined in this form. Here the first term, 1 sub k equals 1. This means that this term occurs here only if k is equal to 1. If k is greater than 1, then we don't. If k is greater than 1, then we don't have this term. So these are definitions. Now the statement of our main result. What was s alpha t x k? It is the sum of zeta evaluated at rho plus alpha multiplied by x rho by 1 minus rho, two finite sums. And that behaves in this way. And it's an unconditional result. Unconditional results. So that's why the error term looks like this. And here, this definition purely f occurs here in this statement. And alpha is realized here and also here and there. But the most important thing is that the error term here is independent of alpha when alpha is bounded by 1 over log t. So since the error term doesn't depend on alpha, we can use the Cauchy integral formula and The Cauchy integral formula, and we can differentiate with respect to alpha in this form. And when we do that, if you differentiate this with respect to alpha n times, what we obtain is the m derivative of the n times. And if we differentiate both sides, n times, and if we calculate all the coefficients that are appearing from the main terms, From the many terms that currently F, we obtain this result. So here Pm plus 1 and Qm plus 1, they are monik polynomials of degree m plus 1. And for some particular choices of xn and yn for the coefficients, the main term comes from this polynomial p m plus 1. And we have some other weights, am, bm, and some other terms, with a similar error term. This is also unconditional. This is also unconditional. Now, by using this result and by using Holder's inequality, we obtain the moment result that we have seen in the beginning. What are the ideas? The first idea is that either s m the remote rules zeta, rho is that rho. Let's work with zeta rho plus a shift alpha and then differentiate with respect to alpha. That's Differentiate with respect to alpha. That's the first time. What is the reason? The reason is that you must look at coefficients for the most data. They are not multiplicative. They are not multiplicative. But the coefficients of this function is just n to the power minus alpha. This is a multiplicative function. So in order to be able to use the multiplicativity, To lose about hitting the tree. That's why you pass from this to that and then back to this final fraction. And again, the same trick, while using the residue theorem for zeta prime over zeta, we can replace zeta prime to deal with zeta by zeta s plus another shift, gamma. So this notice gamma is not the zero, or if it is not zero, it's just a variable. Any other shift can be differentiated with respect to gamma. Be differentiated with respect to the other. These ideas they can trace back to a work of income consisting of continuous mean values rather than summing integrated. And they are used in a very recent work of P, B, and Z on the starting, where we obtain an overwhelm for the first derivative, two k moment of the first derivative, and k is negative rational line. So this paper, it was our main reference. And we learned a lot from this paper. But first, the object they constered in their paper was more complicated than the object they constructed in their paper. But second and more importantly, the expressions they obtained in their main results, they were too complicated. Results, they were too complicated. They were too complicated so that it wasn't clear what the emperor would use. So, first we simplified the object we studied, and then we found a way to simplify the expressions they obtained in their main results, and then we were able to differentiate with respect to i times. Do you remember the definition of curly f? So, this curly f function is the This curly function is the simplified version of the analog of Enza. Then we differentiate this function with respect to n. So that's why we obtained. That's how you could obtain all of the coefficients in the smaller orbit of AM. Now, what is the moral of the story? What is the takeaway idea? If you want to work with the derivatives of the Liamazeta function or with some other L functions, rather than working with the derivative of the function directly, it might be better to work with the function itself with some shifts and then differentiate with respect to those shifts. Thank you. Some of the references being used. Thank you. Questions? Okay, so it means one shift, right? Or are you taking more than two shifts? More shifts? So applying to this week. Our A is Our aim is to calculate this subject. So for this, we have to see all the definition. In order to select the residue, we need to introduce zeta prime over zeta from the integral. You could say zeta prime bilateral shift, say it's a prime Z let's say we are integrating it to Zlex, say it's a prime Z, you know. So zeta prime z, you replace it by zeta z plus another shift, let's say gamma. And then we differentiate the zeta gamma. So then it's really easy. So we have two shifts. One shift is recovering the entire button, the other shift is recovering the first button. Like you don't I'm just can you take more shifts and design if we have more products and product of let's say a zeta function and a Dischland function, then we can we can we have we don't need to have the same derivatives. We can have derivative m1 derivative, m2 derivative, then we can have different shifts there. Can have different ships there. Yeah, the upper bound obtained the expected upper bound under the Riemann hypothesis. And we assume the Riemann hypothesis as well. So this is the same export. This is the same exponent for the upper bound obtained by Q, assuming Q1 hypothesis. In this result of the logenating, they obtained the lower part for the first derivative of the QK column, assuming the generalized U1 hypothesis. So we filled a small gap in the literature. Now, assuming the Niemann hypothesis, we just assume average, only the Niemann hypothesis, to obtain the expected bubble time, not only for the first derivative, but for all derivatives. So our result is similar to this. So I think it's simple. Okay, let's think I feel like
