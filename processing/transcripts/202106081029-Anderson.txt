So the the talk today is well is is more or less in a line of these three papers. So together with Jana and Nick we wrote a review paper on computational interfacial biology. Well Nick already last year gave a great talk and the workshop series so there's no need to really repeat everything he said there but I will highlight some items. Then we well we published a paper on benchmark solutions for flows with Benchmark solutions for flows with realogically complex interfaces. Well, in the spirit of the workshop, I think it's nice to talk about these benchmark problems. And then there are some work in progress, so I hope I managed to get there in time. So, well, interfaces, well, they are all around us. They play a key role in processing. You can think about many different examples in food and paints and cosmetics, materials processing, chemical industry, but also in nature biology. In nature biology, and as a typically, it's the interfacial properties which, for a large part, determine macroscopic material behavior. And there is a very large ratio between interface, so interfacial area versus volume. So it largely affects microscopic behavior. In general, this interfacial microstructure, well, it can be complicated because often, well, surfactants are being added or special components or proteins which make the interface religible complex. Complex and you can see some complex microstructures on here. Of course, well, industry is nice, but also, well, we like our ice cream. And it's nice if we get an ice cream that the interface is such that the ice cream is stable enough that we can eat the ice cream before it actually breaks down. So, well, stability here plays a role. And of course, also, well, for most of us, we like to drink a beer. We can choose our favorite color, but the phone. Different color, but the phone dynamics is also really governed with what's going on at the interface. There are protein networks, and then depending on the type of beer, the proteins which are present, well, it's either stable or it's not stable. And well, we all have our own tasting, but yeah, that's the way it is. So in today's talk, well, after this introduction, I'll start talking about these manufactured solutions we came up for two-phase flows with complex interfaces. Then I'll share some. Phases. Then I'll share something on 3D drop deformation and shear flow, and then an outlook of some work we're doing to model elasto-viscoplasticity on interfaces. Well, it's clear that these computational studies, well, they can be very powerful because, well, we have an external flow, there is a bulk flow that can be transported into faces, interfacial dynamics can be complex, rheology can be complicated, and everything is intermingled. So, with computational stuff. Is intermingle so with computational studies, well you can look at independent parameter parameters and learn something out of it. So there is also a direct connection to interfacial rheometry because with a computational numerical, sorry, with a computational experimental toolbox, you can really come up with strategies to do rheometry on these interfaces. So what is the first problem we're going to look at? So we're going to look at a droplet, a 3D droplet in a ship. Um, a 3D droplet in a shear flow, so we can impose a velocity U to impose shear. The droplets in a box, a drop can have a certain viscosity in the dispersed phase and the matrix phase. And the complexity is not in the bulk, it's not in the dispersed phase. We're going to assume simple Newtonian behavior for these two components. So, we have our balance of momentum in the dispersed phase and the matrix phase, then we have balance of mass and mass conservation also in both of them. The complexity is really. Both of them. The complexity is really coming from the interface. So at the interface, well, in general, we have a jump in traction. The two tractions, they are not equal. If they're equal, then the interface is just passive. But it's actually that these tractions, they are proportional to, well, some surface gradient operator, which is working on some interfacial stress sensor. And we all know that if this most simple case that we just have interfacial tension, then it's just. Have interfacial tension, then it's just interfacial tension in the normal direction, and maybe interfacial tension directions in tangential direction where you get Marangoni stresses. But in a general way, we can rewrite it like this. Then, of course, well, the drop because of the impulse, the velocity we get is going to move. There's going to be an interplay between the interface, which is deforming, the forces at the interface, because it's active forces at the interface, and everything is coupled. So, this is the problem we want to solve. And then at the interface, we also have. And then at the interface, we also have the kinematic condition that there is continuous normal velocities at the interface. So, to look at what type of shapes this interfacial stress tensor can have, well, this interfacial stress tensor is often written as a hydrodynamic part, or maybe sorry, an isotropic part, which is just like an interfacial tension. And maybe this interfacial tension is dependent on some surfactant concentration or temperature. You have an equation of state for it. But for these For it, but for these protein networks, I was just talking about earlier, have stability and food or in oil systems, where you have L1s. There, you have an additional interfacial stress tensor, this tau S here, which is a deviatoric in general. So, different cases we can have as just like a constant interfacial tension, then this sigma S is just a scalar sigma times I S. We can have like the, well, would you say the Newtonian count. The Newtonian counterpart and the interface, the Business-Scriven type of model. So, here what we have is that just a second. Here, what we have is that we have a separate surface dilatational viscosity, a kappa here. There is a surface shear viscosity, mu here, and then there is a relation between the surface stress tensor, the interfacial stress tensor we have here, and a deformation. And this deformation, this DS. Deformation, this DS, which lives at the interface, we all can define here. Well, in our review paper, we actually gave this some attention because, well, this is the original formulation also written down by Buzinesk and Scriven. But some of the more recent works you see that people have been tangling along and changing some of the formulations because I think it's easier. This velocity here, it really has to need to be a 3D velocity. There are these projects. 3D velocity, there are these projections. So, IS is the interface surface stress sensor. Well, it has to be projected with this U to make sure that we actually maintain at the interface here. So, these projections, which you see here, they are relevant. And some of the later work, people assume the flat interface, then these projections are not needed. And then later, people, well, they copied actually these more specified versions of this DS in this work. So, you have to be really careful. Work. So you have to be really careful to get to the original formulation, which maintains that this sigma s is really a tangential factor. Well, there can also be elasticity when we have these protein networks, for example, elasticity at interfaces. And there there are different types of forms. Typically, what you have is like a type of a Hooke's law, which has been extended in such a way that you can take into account Well, can take into account interfacial behavior. So, finite strain tangles like a Hankey strain tanger or a Grillagron strain tanger that are being used here to describe the strain response for pretty large outro deformations. More recently, there was also a model from Marcus Hutter and Theodore DeVoard, which uses a strain energy function, which separates contributions from dilatation and shear and has some thermodynamic background. And so, there we have like a surface dilatational. Have like a surface dilatational elasticity and a surface shear elasticity, which needs to be included. So we want to have, well, we want to look at this problem of the droplet shear, but I really want to do it in such a way that I know 100% sure that what we calculate is correct. And I like the concept of a manufactured solution. So what is a simple manufactured solution? Well, suppose I have a solver for Boisson equation. I want to make sure that I'm getting correct results. I'm getting correct results. Then, well, this is our Poisson equation. So, what you can do is you can manufacture a solution, just say, Well, this is a given solution. I just give some function for u as a function of x and y in my domain omega. And then what I can do is I can substitute this u. I substitute it in my Poisson equation, and then I calculate the f. If you cannot do it by hand, you put it in mathematica, you get this f, this right-hand side. Then you define a manufactured problem, well, we're just using this f here. Well, which is using this F here, so I get exactly the same. I use this F here, but I also use the solution at the boundary to impose also my manufacturer solution. Then I can use my machinery, which solves Poisson equations, and then I will have to determine the U of this equation here with the given boundary conditions. And then I can nicely compare analytically if my solution is correct or not. And it doesn't really matter what the shape of my U is, I can do this quite arbitrarily. U is, I can do this quite arbitrary. I can use different elements and different shapes. I know exactly what is the solution. So, what's the problem with this drop in my shear flow? Well, there I have this interface. And I already mentioned that in general, when we have this distraction over my interface, and it's not equal to zero, so I have additional forces at the interface. So, my interface is moving non-infinitely. It's coupled, bulking interfaces are coupled. So, when we came up with a strategy to say, well, As a strategy to say, well, let's define, let's change this traction equation at the interface and add a function f. And we add the function f in such a way that we can have a manufactured solution such that the two tractions together are equal to zero. In this way, well, our interface is then just a finely moving with some imposed flow. So, what we can now do is we say, well, if we wanted this to. Is we say, well, if we want that these two tractions together equal to zero, then we can just define this f as minus this surface divergence of sigma s transpose. And then I impose this in this equation. So the thing is, is that you can say, well, this is just simple because you just have a passive interface and looking at the drop. No, no, no, no, no. We really have the full implementation of this term in our code, which we're testing. And then, like, analytically, we determine what is this F. We determine what is this F for given specific interfacial constituent equations, and that is just as an additional term in this balance equations at the interface to make sure that the total is equal to zero. So it's a way which is pretty general. So what we did is, well, we started by looking at the constant interfacial tension, drop and shear flow, and then the analytics are then very simple. Analytics are then very simple, and so this manufacturer solution for f, well, it's defined as minus this the surface average of sigma s. Well, for constant interfacial tension, this stress tensor is just the scalar sigma times I s. I s is a tangential factor at time t. I want to stress that is not a constant because my interface is moving as a function of time. Is is also a function of time. I can put it in the equation. I can do the the equation I can do the I can do the math and I get a simple term for f which I have to add at my my traction and boundary condition. So we can contribute this. Well of course well we need a numerical method so we use our in-house TFAM toolkit. We use a mesh refinement using a GMesh, Taylor hood elements for velocity pressure and for both 2D and 3D problems. We use a full ad branch in interface tracking in this case. I'll come back here. Interface tracking in this case. I'll come back here in a moment. Why? Second-order time integration. And then, like I said, there is a remeshing for the bulk in the interface bot. So there are a number of dimensionless groups which are going to be important in a couple of moments. Well, one is the capillary number, which is just the viscous forces over interfacial forces. Then there is the Housines number, which is just a mu over eta R. Which is just mu over eta r. Then there is an interfacial viscosity ratio, which is this kappa over mu. And then for the elastic cases, for the Kelvin void cases, there are two Kaplan numbers, one in a shear and one for dalentation, which are dependent on the moduli G and K here. And then, of course, well, there is a relation that, well, the ratio of these two here has to be a small. Of these two here has to be smaller than one, and you have to fulfill the interfacial Poisson's ratio. So, to determine the solution, we're going to use a benchmark, so we need to know some more norms. One of the things we're going to look at is the position of the interface. So we can have a norm for the position of the interface, the error of the velocity, the error of the velocity we have in our domain, and the pressure in our domain. And note that, well, Domain. And note that, well, for the position of the interface and the velocity and the pressure, we have exact solutions. So, what we can now do is, well, we can look at as first as a time convergence. So, what you can see here is the error with respect to the manufacturer solution for the interface position. NC is a parameter, and this determines the number of elements on the equator of my drop. So, what you can see is that the Is that the error? Well, it goes down second order if I increase my delta t. Well, this is something which is nice if you have a second order method. And then it levels off. And it levels off because at one point, well, discretization errors, they become, well, spatial discretization errors become larger than time discretization errors. So it levels off. But you see that with increasing number of elements on the equator, we see that actually this leveling off goes down. So something you want. And of course, if you use a different type. And of course, if you use a different type of norm, you get a similar behavior. If you look at the results for the velocity, well, here for time convergence, for the velocity field, we also get second order. If we look at the spatial convergence, so we're now looking at the velocity of the error as a function of the number of elements again on the equator. Here we actually get higher order, and we would have expected the slope to be minus three. So here we get again. Slope to be minus three. So here we are getting a superconvergence, and we're not exactly sure what the origin is. I mean, it's very nice to see that we're converging to the manufactured solution, but we're doing it faster than we would expect from numerics. For the Bucinas-Scriven, well, it's something similar. So again, well, we have to have a matter of fact solution constructed by choosing this F. Well, now we need to use the Business-Scriven constituent equation. Driven constitutive equation. So we have this relation for to s with the kappa and the mu, which we have to put in. Of course, well, the equation for the f, well, it becomes a little bit more complicated. Well, because we have more terms, we get higher order derivatives. But of course, well, we can use our friend Mathematica to work out some of the details. So we work out all of the details of this F. I'm not going to bore that with that view in this presentation, but in the appendix. But in the appendix of our paper, you can see that for all the different models, we work it out, we do it in full 3D, we do it in axisymmetric, so that people could actually, if they want, they could repeat the simulations we have done. So we see that for in this case, for the Business-Scriven, well, we get third order, as we would expect, for the velocity, second order for the pressure, so as we expect here. Well, the third case I want to look at is the The elastic case. So, here we're using the Verwell constitutive equation, so the interfacial extended version of Hooke's law. Well, you can see here that the math even gets a little bit more complicated. You need to compute all these finger tensors at the interface while the interface is moving. So, really have to make sure that this implementation is all done nicely. And I can tell you we're working out the details of this effort, not that trivial. Also, here we actually. Also, here we actually observe high-order convergence unexpected. So, we get some superconvergence in this case for the velocity and the pressure as well. So, now let me go and show you what happens if you look at a 3D drop with an elastic interface. So, first, we looked at the shape of the drop and what happens with the drop when we compare to what's in literature. Well, in literature, there was some work on Boosner-Criffin interfaces from Downley and Liu. Phases from Gownli and Liu. Turns out that this Gownli is the one which is the most accurate. We see here that if we look at the Taylor deformation as a function of time, then the blue one is the Newtonian case. Well, Gowley determined some sets where you go to the same type of deformation. So the same type of D, but you do it via different pods. Well, we nicely were able to reproduce this here. And you see that for this higher, sorry, these lower values. Sorry, these lower values of the beta and the theta, you approach to the steady state faster. We can also look at the inclination angle, and in this case, it's not that interesting because they all decrease monotonically. If we now go to the elastic interface, then you can see exactly the same case for a capillary number of 0.1, some busy-ness number, and some interfacial ratio. You can see that. You can see that well, we have a drop deformation and that the deformation is less fast compared to the Busner-Scriven, which is not that strange because we have this elastic network which is hindering the deformation. We looked at different models and we quantified it. If in here in this case, you look at this inclination angle, then well, here the angle is going down for the Bouginess-Criven, but for the elastic case, it actually. Driven, but for the elastic case, it actually goes down, and then there is like a minimum with a deflection point when it goes to a steady state. So, this is, I would say, quite some more interesting dynamics for these elastic droplets. So, finally, the last minute, let me give you an outlook what we're doing with elasto-physical plasticity at interfaces. Well, in quite some literature, people look at measurements at interfaces where plasticity is playing a role. Plasticity is playing a role. Typically, you'll get a stress-frain behavior where first there is some elastic part, then there is some yielding, then you see some softening, and then you go to a plateau where plasticity continues. And this is for silica nanoparticles at the air-water interface. Well, we want to model this, but we need a constitutive equation to be able to do so. So, we're modeling this non-linear viscolastic behavior by splitting our surface gradient. Surface gradient tensor FS into an elastic part and a plastic part. For the elastic part, well, we work out an evolution equation which actually lives at the interface, which you can see here. So it has gradients at the interface. It has the rate of deformation, the plastic part at the interface. There is a finger strand over here. And all these components, well, they are just mathematically derived. So it's like a counterpart of a It's like a counterpart of a bold version you have, but there are some minor differences here. And then for the plastic part, well, we need an additional constitutive equation to tell the relation between deformation and stress. And there we rely on some work we have been doing also for quite some years on solid mechanics, where for glassy polymers a model has been developed to describe plasticity and cases where you really go from the glass to the solid and vice versa. To the solid, and vice versa. So, there are a plastic deformation, a plastic rate of deformation is being defined where you get situations which are driven by an interfacial stress, which is something similar to like a new Hookian model you would have for hypoelastic elastic models in the bulk. And then, well, to describe these relaxation times, well, we use I ring types of relaxation times to account for transitions between primarily elastic tool to primarily a viscous behaviour. Primarily viscous behavior. And then, well, let me just show you the main results. So, what we can do is with two independent dimensionless groups, we can actually play with the yielding we get, we can play with the plateau we get, or for example, we get a yielding, and then we don't get any overshoot, and we immediately go to the plateau. So, I think this is some quite promising new type of development for elasto-physical plasticity at interfaces. And well, our next step is actually to continue using this. Step is actually to continue using this and some of our simulations on the drops. So, with this, thanks for your attention. Okay, thank you, Patrick, for an interesting talk. I'm not sure whether there are some questions. So, if you have some questions, please just drop a message in the chat. I have maybe some curiosity. So, you mentioned this, you show in one of your slides. You show in one of your slides the effects on the transient effects on this deformation parameter for different interface models. Have you checked, you show essentially there is some deviations during the transient and then you got the same steady state? Did you ever consider, for example, or explore the effects of this different Of this different interface model on more challenging situations, for example, moving toward a large capillary number when the deformation is moving, let's say, off the linear part or in quasi-rupture or just before quasi-rupture. Just to see how this very interesting and very, very different physics also affect those dynamics. Well, I mean, for situations where you have like an interfacial tangent or interfacial tangent with Tangent or interfacial tangent with surfactants, we did quite some work looking at deformation and the effect of these surfactants. I would say for these cases where you have like protein networks or more elastic interfaces, then typically you're not interested in situations with due deformation. But I think the more relevant part is looking at drop-drop interaction and looking at what's happening with the drainage of the material between these two drops and how our interfacial rheological parameters influencing the fluid. Parameters influencing the fluid dynamics in this case. Because, in the end, that will determine the stability of these, like these emulsions or ice cream or beer, what I was talking about. So, I think for now, the challenging part is really to go there instead of, well, because, yeah, that's the way I see it. Okay, okay. I'm not sure whether there are any questions. I have another curiosity, just a curiosity. So, in this model, from an experimental point of view, so you should. Experimental point of view. So, you should design different experiments which disentangle, so, say, specific effects and allow you to calibrate uniquely different coefficients that you have in different models. So, you mentioned like five, six different dimensionless numbers, so essentially different coefficients. So, from an experimental point of view, is something that is doable or is just yeah, yeah, I think well, the complexity in interfacial geometry in general is that there are. Facial rheometry in general is that there is very often an interplay between shear and dilentation. So it's then very hard to actually do independent measurements of surface solidational viscosity modelling. I think with such a framework, for example, going to like a pendant ROP, we can have a setup where we actually can do an interaction between experiments and simulations to actually, well, maybe using a dynamic set of experiments to determine a DTC. Of experiments to determine indeed these maybe up to five different coefficients. So, these are our plans, you know, we have for the future, but we're certainly not there. And first, we needed to have a stable computational technique which we trusted, and that's why we spent this time and these benchmark solutions. Okay, okay. So, maybe just before to move to the next, I think Ian had a comment or a question. So, maybe, Ian, you wanna. Yeah, I don't know if it's a comment or a question. I've often Or a question. I've often thought about the yielding on the surfaces, and it just seems there's so many different behaviors you potentially might want to include. So yours seems to be a graduals of yielding, and I guess you can have rupture and fracture type things as well. I'm not really sure. I just think you've got a lot of work ahead. I agree, but we needed to have a starting point for the model where you can play in parameters to determine the magnitude. Just determine the magnitude of healing you get, the softening you get, and the position of the plateau. Okay, good. Thanks again for the nice talk and also for the answer to the question. And we move to the last speaker of this session, who is Nick Janssen from Eindoben University as well.
