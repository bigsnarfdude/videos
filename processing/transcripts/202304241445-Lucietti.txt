Okay, so welcome to the continuation of our afternoon session. Our next speaker, James Lucetti from University of Edinburgh, and he will give a survey of near horizon geometries. Okay, so yeah, firstly thanks for the invitation. It's a pleasure to be here. So I was asked to give a survey talk on this topic of near horizon geometry. It's kind of quite a late. Near Horizon Geometry, it's kind of quite an exotic sounding or weird sounding area, especially to geometry audience lately. So I was very happy to do this, but of course, when I started writing this talk, I realized this is not such an easy task because I've got to basically tell you how these things first come from a certain area of physics, some general activity. So we'll be talking about geometry of black holes. So I do have to provide that context for you. But also, sweet emotion. Sweep by division. Now, then I can't dwell on that too much. I'll try to get to the kind of geometries that we're really talking about, which as you'll see are not so different to what any geometers do study. So ultimately, we'll get to a stage where things should look more familiar. So please do ask questions as we go along. Okay, so here it Period button or outline. So, as I say, I'll start off with a fairly lengthy introduction. Black hole theory, just the relevant aspects, try to be as minimal as possible. Of course, it's in the realm of Lorentzian geometry, so really when I say physics, we're really talking about Lorentzian geometry here because it's not too physical. But the objects will be studying black holes, in particular extremal black holes. Extremal black holes. So these are the geometries that will be directly related to near-horizon geometries. I'll show you later. And I'll do this in both four and higher dimensions. So this is of interest as well, as we'll see. So after the introduction, I'll give you an overview of what we know about these types of geometries, both in terms of their topology, their symmetry, and show there's quite a lot of explicit classifications and low dimensions of these. So a lot of what I'll say. So, a lot of what I'll say is based on a living review article that Fari Kanduri, just as well. You can see that was 10 years ago now. So, since then, a lot has happened. So, I'll try and capture some of that. And interestingly, a lot has happened in the last five years or so through this connection to the quasi-Einstein manifold literature. So, it's quite nice to be in this conference, and maybe it'll prompt Harry and I to update our living routine. To update our living review. It's one of those that you can keep updating. Okay, and then hopefully, I hope to get to the end part here, which will be application of these ideas to the original problem that motivated it, maybe to understand the space of black hole solutions in certain contexts. Okay, so here is a slide. So if you know a bit about relativity, I apologize, but otherwise, this should just serve as a kind of basis point for a A kind of base point for us also. So, GR, is a theory of gravity, and the basic possible is that space-time is described by a manifold that has a Lorentzian metric on it. So, it has one negative eigenvalue. So, really this makes it one of the most precise physical theories, because now at this point, it just becomes Lorentzian geometry. So, the space-time satisfy signs equations. Stein's equations. And you can see it is a structure, there's an Einstein tensor on the left-hand side, which is curvature, so that's the beautiful part. On the right-hand side, it's all the dirty physics, so that's the ugly part. And I'll do my best in this talk to turn that right-hand side off. So I won't generically consider matter. We'll just be looking at the vacuum Einstein equations. So we'll just have this Einstein condition. We've found that being the Einstein equation. With lambda being the Einstein constant. The one exception will be when I when I when I when I the only time I look at matter fields is certain types of things called Maxwell fields. So these describe electromagnetism but when you couple them to gravity they're particularly relevant for the studies of black holes that we're talking about. So a Maxwell field is just a closed truth form that also satisfies Maxwell's direction. Okay and just orientation here, the basic Here, the basic, most symmetric solutions here are just Lorentzian versions of Euclidean space, hyperbolic space, and spheres. So just Lucrossi space here. Basic one. And remarkably, these solutions, so really, because of the Lorentz metric, they're hyperbolic in nature. Gauge equivalent of this to that. So it's a really, they contain an enormous amount of non-trivial. Amount of non-trivial, dynamical kind of physics. So they capture things like gravitational waves, black hole binary collisions, and things, all sorts of things like this. It's really remarkable it's captured by this equation, even with T equal to zero. So a full study of this is completely intractable. But we all need the similar particular type of steady-state solution that I've described. In particular, we're looking at black hole solutions. Black hole solutions. So, these again, I won't give you the formal definition, so it's a little bit heavy. I'm not completely covered with slogan. But basically, this is a region in the space-time, just some sub-submanifold, which from which causal curves, once they enter, they can't escape out to a region called infinity. So, what is a causal curve? That's a curve whose tangent vectors are either time-like or null. That's what Left as well, either time-like or null. That's what another postulate of GR is that everything moves along those curves: particles, humans, everything. On the other hand, infinity here, well, again, we're not going to talk about this in a precise way, but basically just think of it as one of these three model geometries. Typically, I'll just take Mikovic space, sort of looking at some fucking flat space stars. Okay, so we have black holes in that simple flat space stars. And the remarkable thing, as I say, Remarkable thing, as I say, these type of solutions are contained in this set of equations. So the boundary of the black hole is a null hypersurface. It's called the event horizon, so it's the point of kind of no return, if you like. So null surface here means the normal is a null vector. Does it have to be minima? Does it have to be minimal? Not in general, not in the dynamical. Not in general, not in the dynamical context. For the kind of more equilibrium, stationary, time-independent states, there'll be some version of minimality, yes. Yeah, that's a good question. Okay, so let's move to the next slide. So, right, so that is a very complicated setup. So, we're going to be looking at subclass and stationary space-time. So, as I said, these are time, just look at these time-independent. So, technically, we have a parasometry group. Christometer group which has time-like orbits. So you think of that as the time direction. And the open problem that motivates this area is classification of all space-times that satisfy Einstein's equations that are stationary and contain black holes. So that's the problem. Now, as stated, that's way out of reach mathematically. It's a problem of droning geometry. And because of the stationarity, really, it's a problem ultimately that boils down to Riemannian geometry. So we're very far from that. There's all sorts of choices like the boundary conditions. As I say, I'm sort of taking flat maybe there mostly. But even if a vacuum with no matter and none of the dirty physics, even here, this is way out of reach. The Bloomer Her theorem in four dimensions. Hair theorem, more dimensions, gives us some partial answers. 5D, there's some results, which I may describe later. But other than that, it's very wide open. Sorry, what about four dimensions? Yes, sorry, four dimensions. I'll describe it on the next slide. There's something called the Nauher theorem, the black hole uniqueness theorem, where that gives some partial answers, as I say. Things like care are solutions. So do they satisfy this first hypothesis? Satisfy this first hypothesis? Yes, indeed, yeah. So, those are, I'll talk about these on the next slide. Yeah, yeah. So, you're assuming a one-dimensional isometry. So, the orbits are not only time update updates. That's right. So, yeah, I'm brushing a lot of things on the coffee. So, really, stationary would mean near enough infinity to have time like orbits. That's his question. Question. Okay, so there's all sorts of wonderful physics motivation for this. So we're not just making this assumption to make it simpler. Actually, if enough matter collapses and forms a black hole, eventually you'd expect it to form a steady state and we describe one of these stationary solutions. So that's why the known air theorem for Kerr is so bad. Okay, there's various other topics which I won't bother mentioning. Connection to black hole thermodynamics, stream theory. String theory, holography, if you go to higher dimensions, you can get what the scripts are. Now, this last point here is one of the main simplifying assumptions on the technical side for this. So, normally this event rise in this surface of no return, is something that you can only determine once you know the full history of the space-time. So, it's not easy to get. However, stationary black holes will be. Stationary black holes, it becomes much simpler, it becomes something called a killing horizon. So now the normal killing vector can be taken, so now the normal vector can be taken to be a killing field, symmetry. And because it's a null surface, that killing vector is a null vector on the horizon. So it's also tangent to the horizon, because that's the weird thing about geometry. We have things that are both normal and tangent. So V is actually tangent. So, V is actually tangent to the null geodesics that rule or generate this surface. So, it satisfies an equation like this, and the acceleration parameter there, Kappa, is what we call the surface gravity of the black colour. So, the kernel shortshot, that would be something positive. The special class of solutions we'll be looking at are extremal, where kappa is equal to zero. So, that's how I'll define extreme. And really, the And really, the main point here, as I'll show, is that this special subclass of stationary black holes has a well-defined notion of a near-horizon geometry. So the name in near horizon geometry is actually a terrible name for this type of geometry. It's quite misleading. Of course, you can look near the horizon of any black hole, but what we really mean is associated space-time that also satisfies Einstein's equations, that describes the region near. Yeah. So, okay. So that's that's where the externality and the horizon can actually come. So kappa is non-zero. Yeah. Yeah, roughly speaking, it's the kind of it's the full, you know, if you, if you, yeah, if you put a particle on a string and you sit at infinity and let that string dangle just a The angle just so the particles touching the horizon would be the force required to hold that particle there. So is it always positive? So typically it's positive, yeah, but vanishes in that special extreme case. So it's roughly the acceleration you'd feel. Okay. Great, so here's the theorem we were talking about earlier. So this is sometimes called the no-hair theorem, the uniqueness theorem. The uniqueness theorem. So, this really is a culmination of a wonderful body of work that happened if you started back in the 60s and 70s. Really, it's a union of many different theorems, equally, all equally kind of non-trivial, but basically the collection of it can be paraphrased in this way. So, basically, we have a stationary space-time that contains a black hole, it's asymptotically flat, so the coffee if you. Flat, so the costs are fleeting, just flattened. And the statement, well, at least in one extremal case, is that the solution must be this Kerr metric, this Kerr solution that was mentioned earlier. This is four dimensions, yes. Exactly, so that's four dimensions, so that's a incredibly uh powerful result. The co-metrics, they're not particularly nice looking, uh um but you can write them down uh yeah. But you can write them down in a compact way. So it's remarkable, as you said. There's a special subset which you can think of as the non-rotating version. So typically the curve black hole you interpret is a stationary rotating black hole. There's a special case Schwarzschild that sits inside it. Okay, now underpinning this theorem, I should point out there are two sort of foundational results by King for constraint the topology and the symmetry. Constraint the topology and the symmetry of these objects. So here is a kind of sketch cartoon of what's going on. So this is a Heneral's diagram situation. So lines at 45 degrees on null surfaces. The first one there is the event horizon, H plus. And the other one is something called null infinity. We don't need to worry about that. That's just Minkowski structure of infinity. And we're interested, because everything's stationary, actually everything just releases onto a problem once the annual manifold running. Mine of thought, space, space line of thought, so sigma that interlays between the horizon and infinity. Now we're interested in the dominant topology of sigma, but also where it intersects the horizon is H. We'll call that the cross-section of the horizon. Forking generically has to be a two-sphere background. It also showed that stationary black holes actually have more symmetry than you would expect. So this is a remarkable thing. A remarkable thing. Basically, either they must have an extra commuting axial killing field, or they're static, which means the stationary killing field is hypersurface or frovin. So it splits into two. In either case, we have more structure. And then interestingly, the proof works very differently in those two cases. So the stationary exosymmetric case, in four dimensions, that reduces down to a two-dimensional problem. Which actually is equivalent to a harmonic map on a fixed R3 into some symmetric space here. The symmetric space has very nice properties. In fact, in the simplest case, it's just the hyperbolic plane. So SO2R dot SO2. So this has an egg of curvature. So very nice uniqueness results for these sort of harmonic maps. And that's how unique occur kind of proof. Yeah. So before you get that is generically what I meant that is an exceptional case which can be a torus, but actually that was ruled out by other theorems actually. So it is just a dictosphere. Okay, so there's a very nice one like that formulation. Originally in the GR literature, this was But basically, it becomes a boundary value problem, which enjoys a nice unique result. Static case, on the other hand, weirdly, is not a lot simpler. In fact, it's kind of complicated in a different way. That reduces to a three-dimensional Riemannian problem. The most powerful proof for this was the positive mass theorem. So there's a very clever gluing method where these are glue two different conforms. Where they glue two different conformally rescaled copies of the three-dimensional Riemannian manifold together to form a complete surface, which you can apply the positive mass theorem, and then it's conformally flat. So that's a really beautiful proof. We'll talk about a generalization of that in the extremal case towards the end, I hope. What's gamma? Gamma is just the axis, just the z-axis. Yeah. So really, this problem reduces to a two-dimensional problem. Problem reduces to a two-dimensional problem, but you can recast it as an axisymmetric or three problem. So you just remove the axis. And I should emphasize that some reckless things that happen with Einstein's equations in both of these situations. This didn't have to happen. It's really not really understood, I don't think, why we have such enormous results. Okay, so that's the 4D story. So, any questions, more questions on that? Any questions, more questions on that? I'll move to sketching what we know in high ID. Yeah. Yes, that's a great question. So again, I've been very minimal with my slides. So this is of course only true for lambda equals zero. Basically, we don't have any uniqueness theorems for antidistidal black holes. So all the methods here fail. There are physical reasons also to think that uniqueness should fail. That uniqueness should fail. So it's not entirely clear there'll be uniqueness. Well, so even if you fix the boundary metric, there's a possibility of having stationary non-axisymmetric black holes. So this part might fail. Essentially, perturbations can get trapped between the horizon. Can get trapped between the horizon and infinity because it sort of acts like a box ADS, and so you might get a build-up of it. Yes, it's a Lorentzian version of hyperbolic space, yeah, exactly. Yeah, so it has negative Einstein constant, yeah. So so for the basically the the simple thing is that there aren't any theorems known uh for that for that case for concepts. Is there a just the answer you can ask about? Discident, you can't be asked about considered buyers counts? Um no, there's again essentially no results. There's a couple there is for the static case, I think there is a uniqueness result in the design duck case, but yeah. Let's just focus on lambda equals zero. That's hard enough, as I'll try and convince you. Okay, so high dimensions. So the main message here is there isn't a So, the main message here is there isn't such a simple uniqueness theorem. That last slide, or at least that last uniqueness theorem, simply doesn't work. Even in the simplest setup of five-dimensional, asymptotically flat vacuum, for a while, an analogue of Kerr was known by Meisen Perry. So now it has a S3 cross-sectional corruption topology. And then, just over 20 years ago, in a remarkable paper, Ed Rand Real found a Google paper in Brian and Real found an explicit counterexample to any would-be niche film. La colonism of black lane, which has S1 times S2. So then it became clear, well, instead one needs to seek a classification rather than any uniqueness results. So quickly, a lot of these works followed, which basically all generalize the 4D methods. So it's kind of lucky that all of them work, but apart from the first one, all of them are less. Apart from the first one, all of them are less restrictive. So, the first one tells us that static black holes, so non-rotating ones, actually are just as rigid as in four dimensions. So, it's the higher-dimensional version of Schwarzschild. Again, interestingly, this uses the positive mass theorem quite a remarkable way. Both the Falking's topology and the Julie theorems were generalised as well. So, the topology theorem is less restrictive, but gives a sort of an analogous. Gives a sort of an analogous constriction. Now, now instead of positive weather characteristic, in 5D being the horizon, so three-dimensional, basically it's this list of topologies. So spherical spaces, rings, and potentially connected sums. Now the vigility result is just the same as in 4D. Traditionally tells us there's at least one extra commuting axial killing field, but generically, just one. So naturally, the problem. One. So naturally, the problem becomes higher and higher co-homogeneity. In 4D, it was kirmogeneity 2, which was just enough to be integrable. But in higher dimensions, that structure is completely gone. And actually, we don't know of any nice properties of Einstein's equations, as far as I know, reduced on just two commuting killing fields, as you mentioned. So that's really the main barrier to the classification program. Okay, so. Okay, so because it's such a wildly out-of-reach problem, it's natural to look at simplifying assumptions. So this is where externality comes in. So the main message, and this is, I guess, the main message for this particular talk, which is that the Einstein equations for the full space-time containing an extremal black hole would restrict on the horizon, in fact, precisely to the quasi-Einstein. Precisely to the quasi-Einstein equations in the sense of this workshop. So I'll show you that explicitly a little later. So this means actually, and these of course are equations which are purely intrinsic on the horizon. So you can study the geometry on topology of these objects completely independently of the full space-time. So that obviously is like the ball image, or is it like the balanced? Or is it like one dimensional co-dimension? Yeah, I'll show you this. Yes, it's a Riemannian metric on co-dimension to surfaces. But really, it is completely a Riemannian problem. And you can actually forget a lot about the black hole side. It's useful to actually think about these objects in a more Lorenzian way as well. So there's an object called the Nihorism Geometry, which is really a space-time which encodes precisely this intrinsic geometry. Intrinsic geometry of the horizon, but at the space-time level, it's something you can't get for non-extreme of the prototypical example of this would be enterant of the city at Tines of Sphere, for example. So we'll see. They all have that sort of structure. Typically, there's some ADS2 factor. It might be warped, it might be fibered over, but there's always a now. From the perspective of going back to the black hole problem, of course, the way they enter here is a smaller. The way they enter here is a smaller. So, again, we have the same picture here. The tusculation of the stationary black holes in this setup reduces, as I say, to some sort of remaining hept thick kind of boundary value problem on this hypersurface zigzag. And the near-horizon geometry gives you the boundary condition for rising extremes. That's qualitatively different to the non-extreme case, where it's just a nice boundary. In the simplest settings, it's like a tricky geodesic surface, so it's certainly. QX Geodesic surface, so it's certainly minimal. But in the extreme case, it's something quite different. It's actually another asymptotic region. So the nice thing is using this, so one of the results obtained fairly recently, I suppose by the standards of some of this area, is that you can extend the Nohair theorem for Kerr to the extremal case. So it's also true for an extremal Kerr black hole, which is sort of maximally rotating. Using, so you see, this was established much later than the original Hair theorem using this understanding of Renee horizon geometry. Okay, so let me now show you. So, that was kind of the general sort of introduction, I guess. So, any other questions? And I was going to show you a bit of these details and pack some of these sentences for you. Okay, so Okay, so yeah, so we're thinking of the event horizon now as a killing horizon, as I say. So it's a null hybrid surface with a normal vector, but it's a killing vector. And we assume these are cross-sections transverse to the orbits of this curving vector. So these are b dimension two surfaces, format H as well. Apologies for that. That's As well, apologies for that. That's gonna be a lot of H's in this talk. The extremality constraint can be tested in this way. So, just telling us that the norm squared of the green vector actually is extremal in a sense of the horizon. And then in facilitating studies, it helps to introduce a coordinate system, a little bit like the Gaussian normal coordinates in Riemannian geometry, that the Gaussian null coordinates instead. The Gaussian null coordinates instead. And it works as follows. So we have, so V here is a coordinate along the orbits of the killing vector that's normal to the horizon. So everything is independent of V. R is actually an affine parameter along null geodesics that doshout the horizon in this passed directed way like this. So it's the other null direction. And we synchronize them so r equals zero is the horizon. And then the rest of the And then the rest of the coordinates are just an average set of coordinates on this cross-section, this d-managed two-dimensional manifold. So you can show the metric takes its form. Notice, so in particular, there's a data here, the components of the metric, actually have good geometric meaning. So gamma AB, when you restrict to the horizon, is the induced metric on the horizon. We have a modiform here and a function as well. Notice there's a type of R squared. Notice there's a type of R squared in GVV. That's the norm squared of the killing vector. And it vanishes quadratically precisely because of this externality constraint. It's a double zero rather than just a simple zero. So that factor of R squared is crucial in what we're about to do. Okay, so there's a sketch of what's going on. So that's the coordinate system. So the point is: these three quantities, F, H, and gamma. H and gamma. And so this is the remarkable thing. So this is, I guess, the main message of the slide, which I've just skipped while over here. So take the vacuum Einstein equations, restrict them on this extremal horizon, and claim it's their equivalent to these equations here. For this data, it's metric gamma, which is a Riemannian metric on the cross-section, H41. Cross-section, H41 form also on that cross-section, F is just some function. So these are really all intrinsic to the cross-section, evaluated at R equals zero. Notice these equations are completely intrinsic on that. They don't couple to the extrinsic data, which would be carried by derivatives in the transverse direction, by the R direction. So that's really surprising. If you just did it for a generic, not extra more one, you would get extra terms. So it's completely different. But precisely that happens precisely. Different, but precisely that happens precisely because of externality. That's the beautiful drawing. So, so really, the geometry is completely, intrinsically determined. Notice this second equation actually just determines F form in terms of the one form of gamma. So, actually, it really reduces to this equation here, which is a fact of Quasi-Einstein equation, which has been studied in some of the geometry literature as well. It's a sticky atomic type, of the factors in part. Type of the factors in a path here in front of the quadratic term. So actually, when we were doing these studies 10 years or more ago, we were searching desperately for literature in the geometry literature that looked at this equation, but we just couldn't find anything. So it's nice that we finally emerged years later. So we're assuming typically this isn't a compact manifold because we're interested in black holes. Manifold because we're interested in black holes. For example, this is just a two-sphere. If you take the trace of the first equation, the second, or no, or the divergence of the first? No, so this is an equation just the F, not to the other data. Yeah, so this is just a completely self-contained equation by itself. If you take the trace of this or the diversion, we'll do that. Yeah, you learn about the topology. Yeah, I don't know how many I don't know what the conventions are in the literature, but at least in some circles of quasi-Einstein metrics, there's a notion of m quasi-Einstein, where the m is the factor like 1 over m in front of the h squared. So, okay, so it's just a particular type. And that class of equations. Type and that class of equations interpolates include which isolitons as n goes to infinity and just Einstein. Okay, so there's another way of thinking about this as I said before. So there's this notion of a near-reson geometry, which is an associated space-time. The simplest way of presenting this is just to take that metric I showed a few slides ago, replace all of that. Few slides ago. Replace all of that data, gamma, h, which could depend on r, the r coordinate in the full space-time, but just replace them with their values at r equals zero. So remarkably, the Einstein equations for that are equivalent to this horizon equation again. And you can understand that by taking actually a scaling limit. So there's a parameter family of kind of metrics that interpolates between that and the full space-time. Space time. Basically, yeah, you can package this up into a line-size red size size space in this way as well. Okay, so it's worth maybe mentioning that there are other appearances of this horizon equation in closely related contexts. So there's a generalization of the notion of a killing horizon and there's an isolated horizon. And the same equations appear there too. So some results have been proven in that literature and it can be. That literature, there can be the main message here really is the classification of these horizon geometries really is completely analogous to Einstein metrics on compact manifolds. Just have this extra one form or vector field similar to Richie Solidomps too. Okay, so yes, let's get to the trace of the equation. So, so you can prove So you can prove. Remember, I mentioned there were topology theorems for black holes proven by Hawking and 4D, Galloway and Schoen in high dimensions. You can prove these in this context in a much simpler way because everything's intrinsic to the horizon. It essentially immediately follows from the Horizon equation. So if you trace it, you get this equation to its galaxy curvature. And you can see that if you integrate that with a compact manifold, the Weigen's term goes away. And as long as lambda is non-negative. And as long as lambda is non-negative, you get generically a two-sphere. And the borderline case of a torus only happens in the trivial case, when this one form H has to vanish. So we recover Hawking's zero very quickly in this case. In high dimensions, you have to work a little bit harder, but you can work out the Hardley constant for the conformal class of metrics containing this Horizon metric. It's just the minimum of the normalized. It's just the minimum of the normalized Einstein field with action. You can show using this trace that that's actually always positive, an action, and so the minimum must be. You can use this though, but it must all be a positive imamaby type. Again, purely intrinsically, without any, we don't even need to know that this corresponded to a black hole. It doesn't need to, you know, just that information has been lost. Okay, further topology constraints have been. Okay, fair topology constraints have been obtained. So I'll just quickly run through some of these. So there's a class of objects known as supersymmetric solutions. I'll maybe say a little bit about these later at this time. Basically, these are solutions with a Maxwell field as well that have a certain parallel spinner. So you can do a lot of geometry with this, but you can actually explicitly classify all the geometries in these type of cases. With ring topology, for example, when you have a negative constant, it can't happen in that situation at least. On the other hand, and much more recently, again, imagine from its own work by the Art Stein H chose, realized that if you generalize many of these classic theorems of Riemannian geometry, like Mises' theorem, to the situation. So, when lambda is positive, you get a finite fundamental group, which also rules out. Group, which also rules out things into sitter space, which is also quite surprising. More constraints have been obtained even in the Land Equal Zero case, recently. So again, some sort of generalization of the splitting theorem, the fundamentals are further constraint. So at least in the three-dimensional case, we have the small mist left. And actually, if you assume there's a n uh a U1 symmetry, that kills even the connected. That kills even the sum. So, actually, really only left with spherical spaces and rings, and that's it. So, that's quite a satisfying situation. Okay. So, that's topology. Any questions about that? Yeah. No. That's right. It's uh it's like given by this uh So it's kind of coming up. I'm asking why estimates on the scalp these targets? Um not that I'm aware of. Yeah, but it even in the grading case we could have a you know a definite term here. So um Yeah, but the unstable shock. Yeah, I'm not aware of anything in the case. So, here I should emphasise: yeah, these are not necessarily gradients, right? So, yeah, so in that case, I don't have, yeah, yeah, it's an interesting question. But, you know, for example, the Kerr, I'll show you the Kerr solution explicitly shortly. I mean, that has negative curvature of certain points. So it's false, yeah, so it will be. So it's false. Yeah, so it will be false in terms of the maybe you can get some lower bound, but I don't know. Okay, so good. All right, great. So now there's a class of near-hydrodometers where you can do quite well and get quite a strong rigidity result. So static basically corresponds to this killing field. Static basically corresponds to this killing field being hypersurface orthogonal, so it's models non-rotating black holes typically. And so we have this fairly complete theorem now. So basically, when lambda is zero, turns out they're trivial. And when lambda is negative, they're rather trivial, or there's this exceptional case that actually was only not just recently. So, in fact, I think all the authors are here, which is nice. But the exceptional case, basically, the Morizon. The horizon now becomes S1 times some negative Einstein space, where this informs a killing field in that direction. And at the level of neural horizon geometry as well, the first case, the triple case is just ADS2 times, and I haven't made anything space. This exceptional case corresponds to non-gradient, so H is closed, but not exact, and it actually corresponds to the near horizontal. It actually corresponds to the near-rise drawing of the three-dimensional black hole named as BTZ, which is like a 3D version of curve, you know, times some transverse. So that's quite nice. So those are the type of near-reson geometries that were known in higher dimensions, arising from black rings. But it's nice that this has been kind of a strong name. Okay, so in Fair Equals 2, actually, you can do a lot better. You can completely solve. You can do a lot better. You can completely solve the equation without assuming any compactness. You find this given by this, at least the non-trivial solution. And you can show by explicit just analysis here that this does not extend to a smooth metric or complex space for any lambda. So actually, even for positive lambda, these have to be trivial. There's an interesting problem, I think, that in higher dimensions here with positive lambda, Dimensions here with positive lambda, well, we know they have to be gradient. There was a result saying that so it's a space-time that would be all products of designer to some transverse non-Einstein space. So the nice question is, are there solutions, non-trivial solutions in this case? I'm not aware of any work there, but basically, at least in low dimensions, it should be possible to make some symmetry assumptions. Symmetry assumptions. Okay, now this is perhaps one of the most central results in all of this, I think, because it's like a horizon version of the no-hair theorem for Kerr. So remember, the uniqueness for black holes split into these two classes, static or axiosymmetric. So now we're doing the axiom symmetric case. Here, the general solution on a sphere turns out to be isometric to the horizon geometry. Turns out to be isometric to the horizon geometry of this extremal curve black hole or the black hole with a cosmological exposure. The point is, axial symmetry allows you to reduce the horizon equation, which is a two-dimensional equation, down to an ODE, and you can just find the local solution. It's non-linear, but luckily you can work this up, even when lambda is non-zero, where the Locha theorems are not known. For the lambda equals zero case, it's a very The Lambda Cause error case is a very beautiful metric, so I thought I'd write it here for you. So you see, it's an inhomogeneous two-sphere with actual symmetry. So X is just like a latitude coordinate, phi is like an osmosis coordinate where we have the symmetry. So it's a one-parameter family of metrics, which takes this explicit form. Now, for negative lambda, recall you could have other topologies. Rico, you could have other topologies. The topology theorem I mentioned earlier was only for lambda being zero or positive. James, could you go back once? Yeah, sure. You say one parameter, but it's just an overall scaling, right? So modularized space metrics would be just a point. If you view it, sure. If you view it as a vacuum solution, yeah, you can scale up the mass. So of course this is just the rotation parameter of coal. What does it look like? What does it look like? What does it look like? What does what look like, sorry? Is a surface evolution, right? Yeah, it's like a kind of a sort of a squashed sphere, right? So, so yeah, it's a surface. You could embed it like that, yeah. Minimal facet or does it look like a PMAP? Does it have a minimal surface? I think it does. Yeah, I think it probably does, yeah. I I forget the exact yeah. No, it's a yeah, yeah. All these things are interesting geometrically, they're right, uh and probably. Geometrically, they'd write probably should be thought about. Okay. Now, for negative lambda, actually, you can do, you can actually completely classify the hyogenous surface with no symmetry assumptions, basically. So, this is something that was done in the isolated horizons literature. So, there, actually, they actually turn out to be trivial. So, actually, really, the only interesting case left is the sphere. I said on the last slide, we could classify it in axial symmetry, which is well motivated for black coal application. But actually, you can ask: well, should that symmetry actually just emerge intrinsically from this equation? So the conjecture, at least for Nanda Kuzier, is that it probably should. But that's an interesting open problem. Probably the most interesting problem left, at least before dimensions, I would say. It's been around for like kind of 20 years or something. People have tried it. It's just a two-dimensional equation, but no one's found a way to show that it has to happen. Maybe methods that are used by people here could help. Okay, so at least under equals zero, by looking at solutions near near the horizon, near the extremal horizon, you c there is a result there. So there's some evidence towards it. So, there's some evidence towards it, suggesting this conjecture with any lambda element. Yes, so I was deliberately vague about that. So, you'll have to own this conjecture, you better tell us. So, yes, in the strongest form, yes. But there is a slight caveat first. At least for negative lambda, there may be black holes with no axial symmetry. As I was mentioning earlier, this rigidity theorem does not need to work. And so the question is that that might get washed out in this near horizon limit. So because it's an infinite proper distance away, so whether there are extreme black holes with no axial symmetry in the near horizon limit, you might get an enhancement of symmetry. So then you might expect it to have an axial symmetry still. So it's an interesting question. So I think it's less trivial for lambda negative. Great, okay. So moving to three horizons, here the list of black holes actually have more than one axial symmetry, they have two commuting ones. Turns out that's compatible with a central blackness. So that was natural to assume that. So you can derive an analogous classification there. Again, it reduces to an ODE problem. Basically, the upshot is that all the solutions you get here correspond. All the solutions you get here correspond to known black holes, either with their locally topology or small chemists too. Indeed, the topologies are actually constrained by this unsquared action, right? It can only be in this list. So you have three spheres, length spaces, lens or victoria. Victoria have been ruled out. So you can, this allows for lenses, so I'm just talking about locally there. So it's quite a very good view result, but again, you can ask other solutions with fewer axial hitting fields. We probably expect there to be one with one at least, but it's not clear. So that was for lambda equals zero. If you do the same problem with lambda non-zero, actually the ODEs become intractable. They're equivalent to some awful non-linear sixth order thing, which might probably. That's quite problematic. But at least for ring topology, you can avoid solving them and just use some kind of global argument, just some integration by parts type stuff, to show that actually for rings, you can't have them in the symmetry class at list. So this complements well nicely with the result I mentioned earlier by Curie and Eric here, who showed that constant lambda without any symmetry assumptions, we can't have this rare topology. In fact, that paid motion. In fact, that paper motivated me to revisit the old classification. And then it turns out there was an elementary argument to show that for any sign of lambda, you can't have these solutions. So actually, it rules out black rings in antidepster here again in this situation. For the three-stay case, it's very much open. We know a solution, but there could be others. So there's a lot of open problems there. And this is just an ODE problem, really. Really. So, if you know what you're doing with OEDs, I'm sure someone could solve this. Okay, another class which I'll just briefly touch upon. At least for three horizons, it's natural to assume homogeneity. So, here, actually, there's a nice simplifying feature here that happens in contrast to the Pure Einstein case that we heard it this morning. We heard it this morning. This one form H actually you can prove has to be killing, correspond to killing field. So, actually, these are much more symmetric. So, for the three-sphere case, you just get the usual Virgin sphere. For the negative side case, you just get the stiff negative curvature analogues of that type. So, you get, at least within three-dimensional case, you get a nice list. The point is, when you reduce the horizon equation on this killing field direction, H. Equation on this Killing field direction H, it becomes just a 2D Kler-Einstein condition, and so the base is just constant temperature surfaces. So that's quite nice. The three-star case corresponds to the non-black hole, which has this hand-to-field genetic model symmetry. In higher than three, of course, that's open. So even though we have this killer field, we're reducing down the equations. Sort of as complicated as classifying homogeneous Einstein metrics. So that's intractable. But you can get a subclass Sasakian geometries by just assisting the basis K to Einstein. So you get quite infinite classes in higher dimensions. And talking of which, so here's a list of higher dimensional geometries. So the only classification known higher than three dimensions is this top one here, which basically mathematics. Is this top one here, which basically mathematically is the analogue of the two cases I've talked about already. So for the axial symmetry in two dimensions or bi-axial three, you have this Kermage NT1 median symmetry to determine everything. However, actually, when n is bigger than three, this is not the right symmetry to describe asymptotically flat black holes. The known metrics, the only known black hole metrics, are spones. That's set up. That's set up by circle. They have an abelian symmetry group, but the size of it is equal to the rank of the rotation group, which is strictly less than that number there when n is bigger than 3. When n is equal to 2 or 3, it's equal. So that, again, is why things, as you go with high dimensions, go harder. So what you meant by that, actually, we constructed solutions that do have the right symmetry as sort of standard constructions of sphere bundles. Of constructions of sphere bundles over K and Einstein basis. 4 and 5 D, you can get a countable number of kinetic one metrics and these sort of manifolds, just making it with Einstein metric constructions. In higher dimensions, though, this switch just gives you something much more wild. You get infinite number of topologies. And you do get examples with a single actual inner field here, which is like this. Because you can choose the Kerr-Einstein base to have no continuous isometries then. Continuous isometries then. So, the open question here, which we really are lying to, is all their black holes corresponding to this. Okay, so I think that's how much time do I have left? I guess including questions, 10 minutes. Okay, that's not good news. Okay. So, I wanted to tell you a bit about the application to black holes. So, I'll maybe try and. So I'll maybe try and maybe have to skip something. So let's see. So the main message here I want to say is actually that, yeah, if you include now a matter field in the form of the Maxwell field, as I mentioned earlier, you can still do everything we just did in four dimensions, but as you space down dimensions. But as you go to higher dimensions, even the static case is not fully understood. It's a nice symmetry handsome result that I've. It's a nice symmetry and speed result, but I won't describe that. Okay, so the classification of extreme black holes, right? This point I sort of alluded to just now, basically knowing a near horizon geometry says nothing about black hole theory. So it doesn't guarantee that you have a black hole with that near horizon geometry. So motivated by that, we looked at actually sort of testing kind of transverse deformations, integrating Einstein's equations out in this other null direction. Equations out in this other null direction away. And you can, interestingly, prove a kind of next-order digital result that those perturbations are actually curved form. So this is kind of logically different to the known hair thread, but it's only near the horizon. But basically, the generic case, that's all we kind of know. The other body of work, which I'll just describe now in the last 10 minutes or so, because my son Max. So, Kazma-S-Maxwell theory. There's a class of solutions that I mentioned before, known as supersymmetric, which we know the most about. So, I'll tell you what these are very briefly next. This includes examples, the first examples of black holes with non-trivial topology. So, we have black holes with a topology of a lens space, which is quite nice. Also, some of these things can extend to ABS, but I won't describe it. And I will describe this. And I will describe this static case because it actually forces you to actually think about positive mass theorems in some interesting situations. So supersymmetric black holes, very briefly. So basically, these are Einstein-Maxwell solutions, so there's nothing sinister about them. The point is that they admit essentially a type of parallel spinner, or killing spinner sometimes. Or a killing spinner sometimes. It's an extremely strong constraint on the local geometry of these solutions. Particularly, it defines for your killing field as a bilinear. It's V, it's stationary generically. So there are a subclass of stationary solutions. And if you have black holes, actually, they have to be extremal. So there are a subclass of extreme black hole solutions. And in 4D was this nice theorem here. Basically, the M solution has to be this multi-black hole solution. Black hole solution. I jumped out of the metric solution. It's a remarkable set of metrics, very simple to write down. So you see, this delta R is just a Euclidean metric on R3, it's static, and it's determined by this harmonic function on R3. It just has the sum of simple poles. Each pole is a horizon. You can show that actually corresponds to a null surface in the British coordinate system, and there is a black hole behind it. So that's a remarkable surface. So now a remarkable set of solutions. And supersymmetry is really fixing for you the local form of geometry here up to some harmonic function. That's power of that. And then by performing a global analysis of these geometries, insisting they have a well-defined Nikolai geometry, obviously this has to be simple poles. So that's how that kind of works very briefly. In five-dimensional, you can do something similar. It's a little more complicated, but you get something much richer. So here now, supersymmetry. So here now, supersymmetry, instead of reducing to an R3 base, now becomes a hypercalar structure. And you can classify nearhorizon geometries completely here. There's a particular class of hyperkalar metrics, the Gibbonswalking modes, for which you can solve the full Einstein-Maxwell equations. And remarkably, the solutions are just determined by harmonic functions on an R3. So they're like non-linear versions of that Majum de Papa Petru solution. Of that Majum de Papapetru solution. Because you have basically the local geometry up to harmonic functions, you can again do some global analysis, consistent asymptotic flatness, you have regular extremal horizons, and you can show basically the theorem that they must have this given talking base and harmonic functions will have simple poles. So, the nice thing about this is it's a very non-trivial model based based on solution. This is the only example where we're This is the only example where we have some sort of control of a big space of solutions, not just a unique result. And we have all these topology types, we have men spaces, and there's a non-trivial topology in exterior. So this sigma has non-trivial two cycles, contrast to what you have in four dimensions. You can also have solutions with minimal symmetry. So it's a very nice test ground for exploring. Exploring the face of black coal solutions. Okay, now the final topic. We've got five minutes. So static black holes. So here one could be a little bit more explicit about how we prove this. So here, static black holes basically boil down to some Riemannian problem on this orthogonal space. So sigma. So sigma has a metric, G hat, which is the Wallet space metric. And the Einstein equations become Einstein-like for its data on this Riemannian base space. With an extra, we're going to have a function V, which is the norm of this Fueling field. Psi is an electric potential of the Maxwell field, and V is some other micro field. And by the boundary conditions, we'll have a simple flatness. So for this, this means this Romanian. This means this Riemannian manifold has an asymptotically flat end in the usual way. The falloff defines for as the mass and the electric charge. And on the other side, we have an inner boundary corresponding to the black hole where the speeding field becomes null. For the non-extreme case, turns out that's a smooth boundary. Here is the distinction between the extreme case that becomes, in this orbit space metric, a cylindrical element. So the topology of the horror, or sort of the direction taking you towards the horizon, and the cross-section. Towards the horizon. The cross-section of the cylinder is actually the cross-section of the horizon, which I'll call S. Okay, so you can prove this following kind of a mass-charge inequality here, and it's saturated precisely when the Maxwell field is basically determined in this way, tidally in terms of the metric. And then we have two cases: the non-extremal case, which I mentioned earlier, with more dimensions. This extends to higher dimensions, again using the positive master, which becomes. Master. It just becomes, you just have uniqueness. But the m equals q case corresponds to the extremal case. The metric you could write in this form here. So notice here, we've rescaled conformally the Riemannian metric by this function h, which is just 1 over d. The reason for this is this is a much better conformal frame because in that conformal frame, the Einstein equations tell you that this metric tittle h is Ritchie flat. So we have a base space now, this Richie flat flat. So we have a base space now that's richy flat, asymptotically flat, with zero mass in band. And this function H is harmonic on that base. So these are just like these major papetri solutions I showed you a couple of slides ago at 4D. But now this base is not Euclidean necessarily, it's just Ritchie flat. Nevertheless, you can prove the following theorem in all dimensions that the base does have to be the one functions have to have these basic poles. Basic poles. But you have to go through proving this base has to be Euclidean. That's the extra ingredient. Again, homes here just correspond to extreme probabilities. Okay, so how does the proof work? Well, just roughly, so the point is this harmonic function, because you can relate it to the norm of an invariant of that form, is smooth everywhere in the interior or the exterior of a black hole, and singular precisely the horizon. Singular precisely a horizon. Then, by performing a near horizon analysis, you can show that the tune horizon in this rescale metric, rather than a cylindrical end, like it does in the water space metric, looks like a conically singular end. So it has the centre function, but now the metric approaches the standard cone metric with a horizon cross-section. That follows from matching to these Gaussian null coordinates. So now we have a situation that we have a rich. So now we have a situation that we have a richly flat, absolutely flat, zero mass manifold, which you really want to apply the positive mass theorem to, right, to deduce to this Euclidean space, but it's not complete because of these singularities. So the usual positive mass theorem does not apply. So happily you can generalize it. So at least in the simplest case where you have non-negative Ritchie curvature. Case where you have non-negative rigid curvature, you can prove this version of the positive mass theorem. So that's going to be flat. The magnetic manifold we've connected to signal ions in this way has to have non-negative ADM mass, which vanishes precisely if it's flat. So then it quickly follows that this space has to be Euclidean space minus a bunch of points plus both horizons, typically conical similarities. And because you've determined it, the main horizon geometry now has been determined implicitly. Horizon geometry now has been determined implicitly because these are just horizons or points in the taken space. The kind of a cone over that will just, the cross-sections will just be the standard round sphere. So actually, the horizon torque will just be round for the arbitrary dimension. That's the arbitrary dimensions, yeah. So, so, and then by again matching to the narrows of geometry. Matching to the neurons of geometry, you can determine the singular part of this homotide function to show that it has to be of the simplest form type. The regular part of that function is fixed by asymptotic flatness. So that's basically kind of where the proof goes. This really is the crucial kind of component. So the nice thing is here, even though we couldn't classify near-horizon geometries, even static ones, in higher dimensions, with a Maxwell field, using asymbolic flatness, you can show that. Using asymptotic flatness, you can show they're actually kind of irrelevant, at least in this center. It has to be true. But that's obviously appealing to much more structure. Okay, so let me just summarize. So apologies if I let me run, but basically the main message here is the geometry of extreme black holes is quasi-Einstein. And so you can study this quite independently. This is quite independently of black followers. There's all these remarkable kinds of rigidity results in low dimensions, even with non-zero Einstein constant, in contrast to black hole, I highlighted this mesochem problem of two dimensions and then showed you how we can apply a few of these things to learn about the classification of the corresponding extremal black holes. And I think this, yeah, this last example with the Posting Master. With the Flossing Mass theorem is rather nice, and it's probably interesting to think about generalizations of this Flauslin Mass theorem with such similarities. But okay, let me stop.
