Yeah, um I'm not sure if I can do it. That's an optimistic publisher. Okay, viewers for the final talk this morning. You want me to get started? Okay. We'll be back with a model on social communication. Okay. Well, thank you. Thank you for the great workshop here. I've really learned a lot from here. And also, I take the idea to remind my daughters to be here. I believe last time I. I believe last time when they were in my talk, that was when we were little. So, today we're going to talk about the social insight colonies. And I will give a little bit of background. And then we'll talk about at different levels, starting from the individual communication, how information is spreading inside the colonies, where you are able to see the videos. And from there, I'm going to go into the colony. I'm going to go into the colony level inside the colony, how the voyaging dynamics. And we will move to the colony migration dynamics. And I introduce a different system. And hopefully, in our time, we go to the population level between the colonies. Especially, I think this is a great example to, I think earlier the mark was asking a question when you have best stability and what's the impact of seasonality. And wasn't you had a seasonality? So, hope you have to have a time to get there. But if not, then we can talk afterwards. And just by the way, today is the beer, Canadian Beer Day, if you are eating beer. So what are the social insect colonies? The ants, warts, bees, and termites. I provide a few pictures here, and the honeybees is here. This is the leaf of colour ants, they form a Color ends, they form a bridge, you know, they have this kind of collective behavior. So, the social inside colony have three characteristics. One is the reproductive division of labor. It's not everyone can reproduce, only small portion or the queens or kings, they are able to reproduce. And also, have a division of labor. In this case, they have the social organizations, they have different task groups doing different tasks, such as. The tasks, such as you take out the garbage, you have a nurse bee, you take in the yangs, or you go outside for eating your food. And also, they are overlapping. So they have this sophisticated governance society, which can reflect our own complexity and the internal cohesion. So, here just give you one example of the colony cycle, the life cycle. So, when the colony is So, when the colony is mature, usually when the population is above a certain threshold, and then you are going to have the future queens of drones as well. They're going to fly outside to mate, and then the queens, in this case, ant species, you are going to found your locations. And at the beginning of the farming stage, they have different strategies. The farming stage they have different strategies. One can be have a solitary queen or you have cooperative queens. And then you establish your colony at the early stage. And then you move into the young colony. That would be the situations when you invest all your resources to grow the populations. And then until you achieve the certain threshold and then you reproduce. But inside the colony, each individual also goes through different data. Individual also goes through different stages. And the lifespan of the individual, also depending on species, it can be the month or sometimes it can be the year, depending on the particular species. So why we are interested in social media psychologies? First, because the ecological and evolutional importance, in terms of the biomass, this is a number, it's called the creative. This is some number, this kind of quick is one-third. And in terms of the species number, it's more than member species. And also, there are great examples as a complex athletic systems, especially you are able to manipulate in the labs. For example, the wolf is also a social group, but it's much difficult to track them down to see what they are doing. And then, also, mathematically, we are able to. And then, also, mathematically, we are able to, because you have a lot of data available, and we are able to build up meaningful models. And here, I want to provide some kind of the properties. They are decentral control. What does that mean is even a colony, you have different members, you have queens, you have kings, you have the different task groups. But the emergent behavior, like foraging, colony migrations, is coming from the simple interaction. The single interaction form locally. And I will show you an example of how they deliver information. And then we lead into the self-organizations, which is making the money adaptive to the situations. And the information flow through a physical context or the formal or many other signals can create your feedback, which And then make the colony is very resilient. So, because of their greater system to study, so the interest is neurobiology, but also in epidemiology and then optimizations. So, now I'm going to talk a little bit kind of background of the dispersal. I think over here you already know the dispersal, the moving around. So, here I'm also consider the foraging is also part of one type of dispersal. And then sociality in this case, we consider organizations such as a different task group and also the task allocations. And interactions is in a sense you have different type, can be the physical or can be the formal chemical kind of communications. The dispersal can be the foraging, but also can be happening when you the colony establishment. Establishment. So, this is the, if you are able to see that, this is the in the summer in California when you see that's the mating season during the time when a lot of colonies, they produce the future queens and then they fly, and then when they fly, you disperse to other locations, and then you maybe produce. I mean, if you have different strategies to establish your colour. Colour. Let's put the end, but also for the honeybees, they will be a little bit more like the swarming behavior. That's all the basic new queen will take some nurse bee with her to find a place to establish a new corpus. The time scales, I think, is important when we talk about the modeling and the colouring manipulations or reproductive. Colony magulations or reproduction stage, it can be lasting from days to months. So, for example, honeybee can be a few days or a couple weeks. And the one I'm going to give an example with a mathematical model is for a rocket arms end. That can be happening in a few hours or a couple days. The time scale is important because when we're doing a modeling, we may not want to consider a version-death process. And then the rock ends have very In these rock ants, have very special process when they try to search for a new colony. They have this kind of tender ant. Basically is if I like the space, I'm going to recruiting other workers one by one. And then after new space, if you establish certain quorum, and then the behavior will be switched, and then you're going to. Be switched, and then you're going to basically the ends will just carry the ends from the old colours to the new locations. They don't communicate with you whether you like it or not. And I will show some kind of videos to indicating such process. I'm to me super fascinating. It's like our human being, right? After you reach quorum, can make decisions. In the sense of foraging, this is also have different time scales, can be confirmed. Different time scales can be confirmed from minutes to several hours. For example, in these leaf cut ends, they can be the hours or days, and depending on the environment, the food availability or temperature or whether you have storms. And then the firearm, so one to two hours. The honeybee can be about 30 minutes to several hours, or sometimes depending on the temperature as well. So the property of division of labor actually. Of division of labor actually, they ensure continued foraging. So, basically, is you some, you know, some group can take, you can do in the other, can we stay inside the colony and then you have the one task group and do the foraging. And then the task allocation actually ensure, because you have a group, so you don't need to every member doing the task all the time, so you can have some kind of something out. So you can spend a fraction of the time active foraging. But all these property is division of labor. But all these property is division of labor, plus allocation is coming from the decentralized, the local simple interactions. So here I'm going to give you what you are able to see. So the law of social interactions between the members or the workers important for division of labor on class allocations, such as for aging defense or swarming or colony migrations. And as you can see, And as you can see, it's different scenarios, the ends inside the lab, you mark them, you mark them basically, you identify them, give them a name, and then you track them to see who they contact to, what you are doing. And then so you will see it's very intensive by the labor. So that's why at this point, undergraduate students are very usable as a project for them to, you know. As a project for it to mark the butt of course, later we also have other using the software to speed up the information reporting. So, here let me just give you another example, in a sense, and network. So, how do they communicate? As you mentioned, can be the physical contacts or they can be the formal, but which one? And also, what do we mean by information? And in our human, we say we're testing you like social media, right? For ants, who do we have information? So, in this case, you tell me what you see. Do you see with drop the ends? They become the behavior, they become very speed up, the train are very, you know, so that's the way. So that's the way because they are alarmed. So in this case, we consider the threat or alarming SOP information. And you can see the one has been destroying to okay, do you see the so she's become contact to the other ones? And then we develop new software, try to track each of you and to see what's your speed, what's your turning angle, who you contact to, and how the other one you contact. And how the other one in contact, what's their behavior. And least, I want to make sure: in this case, you can see the patchy dash. There's no task. In this case, we don't consider other environmental or spatial structure impact of the communications. So from here, we are able to by using the machine learning, the local, he was my former PhD student, Coleman. Former PhD students co-mentoring with the Dr. View. So we label each of them, and then we, of course, we need to train a model by random forest and then to detect when the ants are activated and in the colony, how many of you become alarmed, and when did you, when the alarming is kind of the information has been decayed, and then also we are able to. And also, we are able to connect in the network in a sense of information spreading over the colony. So, this is something, the results coming from the work. So, in this case, the green ones basically initials once I stimulate it, you become activated, it will reach the alarm. And you can see the purple ones, other ones. The purple ones are the ones actually you from calm situation and become activated without a physical contact. So, by comparison to how you become alarmed, the in terms of number, and then we are able to make a conclusion. Actually, most of contact, most of the situation, most of the scenario is the information spreading through the physical context. Because this is extremely important when we data, when we are doing the modeling, in a sense, this is through a physical context. Modeling, in a sense, is through a physical contact or just through the form. And we are able to see how long your day activated, you know, for so when you are the information, the decay, usually the time span is of two minutes. And we did provide by doing the individual-based modeling and to consider the environmental impact in the sense of how the task group given task impact. Group given task impact, the information spreading, and also we compare with if we have a disease because we talk about physical contacts. We have a disease, you see information spreading very, very fast. And the consequence is if we have disease, which means you're also ready to get spreading, right? So it turns out our study are indicating at different situations the ants have different strategies to prevent the, if you have the disease, they have different strategies. The disease they have different strategies, but allocated differently, including have this kind of isolation kind of strategy, which means during COVID, you have this kind of policy. So from here, we have this kind of going to a little bit the larger scale in the sense of inside the colony for the foraging recruitment dynamics. So we want to address what are the key factors like big inter-foraging or its system. Waiting for the C session. So, here this is the experiment setup. You have three types of ants. They are waiting at the entrance or F because they activate you going outside and also you're coming back returning with food. So, the assumption here is the colony is mature. And then the resource is constant. So, I, you know, because the alpha, you know, they are all depending on resource in here. They are all depending on resource in here is all constant because the time scale is in the minutes or hour. And we do have the communication between the available and then returning. So basically, we are able to observe when the one with coming back with the food, they are going back to this box, they will antonate the available. And it's what I can get a lot of food. They go outside and you can see the activator moving outside. And of course, we consider the pop the We consider the group, the A, the waiting ones here. You have a constant growth coming out. Also, you are allowed to go in back, but a lot going back is density dependent. Too many are waiting, more likely going back, but it's too many coming back. You will returning with the food, you are less likely to returning. And at this point, we also consider the K1, beta, they are all constant. If you're looking at longer time scales, K1 definitely will be time dependent depending on which. One definitely will be time dependent, depending on resources, depending on the internal dynamics, how the first death process. So, in the DFDR, here you can manipulate by experiments in the sense I'm moving an art. So, from here, we are able to kind of say, well, what the model is reasonable. So, we are using the validation by the available data. And it seems pretty good. And then, we're doing the analysis by following this kind of epidemiology kind of branch. Kind of French are not to see how what are the factors, right? You have internal factor K1, K2, but also you have available food and also the retractions, so how we how efficiency we can make it with each other. And of course you have durations outside the column. So we're able to, as you can see, if the amount is large, you will persist, right? But if your analytic decreasing, if you change certain parallel values, you drop into. Sort of parallel values, you drop into these regions by stability, the bio fabrication, by the express FFML. So you have this kind of behavior, but even slower and then smaller, and then you are going to the C-session will be, you don't have the full aging. This is one of the examples of including this kind of recruitment, social interactions, from the individual interactions. So we now talk about if you are. So we now talk about if you are in a colony, how you move it to the, if you don't like the current ones or the current ones is not suitable, you want to make another ones, right? So what's the process? How this is the migration process, in a sense, is how the environment impacts your decisions. So from here, I can give you some kind of background. I'm sorry, I just want to. Sorry, I just want to introduce this first. So, graded community. So, basically, if I have, if I start researching, I'm going outside to my college looking for the available houses. And if I like some place, and then I assess, and then I'm going to become, because I like it, so I'm going back to my old colony. I bring one, just one, one by one. And then I bring more and more, if my colony, the new place is achieved. The new places achieve the certain column. I switch. I don't care if you like it or not, I'm just going back, I just bring you back. So, this is they have different commitment gradient. So, this is the case of the handaruck. You can see one by one. And the other one, if you can see, I don't care, just grab you, put one there. There right here, I've grabbed you. I just move it's much fat. Anyway, so that's kind of the core to illustrate the process. So from there, we're just trying to know the communication happening there. Oh, sorry, this is too fast. So you have this kind of different component. I don't know what's going on there. What's going on there? So you have a tenor on, you have a searching, also a passive population is a constant. And then with the active A can be go to different, go to A, A can be L, C, but in order to, recruiting your different group members interactions. So like you can activate it. So the things is, you have these kind of interactions? So H1 is basically decision making, right? Is basically decision making, right? How do you switch it? Because I don't have these carriers unless you reach certain quarants. So usually the ideally for a biological point of view, you will be using the piecewise function. If you, my population, and then you, if you go to the sit, you activate it. So, in here, is we want to compare to the p. Want to compare to the piece-wise and hue function. Huge function is much more smooth, and then the light may be more friendly. And then, so can you guess which one is better? Which one is much more biological, makes sense? Here, give us heel bunching, okay. We'll see. That's a good guess. So, I'm not going to go into detail about the analysis here, right? Because the switching dynamics in your Here, right, because of the switching dynamics, you need a subsystems, and then you need to do a bifurcation. And then, with the down of that, because of time, I'm just going to give you the answer. The large colony is more likely to, and also the initial condition is important because of this comp behavior, and you do create mismarti by stability. And there's two type of scenarios: successful emigrations and partially successful emigrations. And this is particular for the peace-wise, non-smooth. Piecewise, non-smooth case. So, as you can see, they have oscillations, which is in the hue function. You are not able to see this. And you don't have the equivalent point for the system, but we do observe this, and then we are able to show this. So, this is actually confirmed by biological observations. Sometimes if you can see that the ants cannot decide, they're moving back and forth. And moving back and forth, that's under the situations. So I think, even though sometimes we do like smooth functions, but in this case, it seems piecewise observations is more metric, what we see in the biology. So here I want to quickly, I think I have time. Am I too fast? Or are you actually just auto? So I want to talk about the season impact. So, I want to talk about the season impact of seasonality. So, here is we the seasonality we incorporate into this egg laying way of the queen. So, we are using the cosine function. The reason for this is because of the study from the literature in the 1989, my collaborator, she has this kind of cutting data and then they have this kind of nice feeling. Also, our recent study from the lab, my collaborator, John Harrison, we also doing the basic. We also doing the based on the data we're doing the feeding and the least things are the one fitting the data the best. So the meaning here is Ana is basically that we can say the average over the period, right? Epsilon you can consider that's the intensity of the seasonality. The gamma is the length of seasonality or the one of gamma consider the frequency. And phi is basically the time of the maximum eight lane time. The maximum eight-lane time. So you can see this population level is different than the traditional lock-to-potential model. So you may wonder why you have this thing here, right, H squared. So here is we incorporate the organization, this kind of structure. Because if this is coming from, let's say, this is more like Holin Tap 3, right? So but original derivation is you consider the chemical reactions in order when you produce the new. Order to produce the new elements, you need to have two. So, this you're basically in the social inside colony, and you at least need two tasks. One is an inside economy, the other one is outside the colony. You work it together, and then you are able to make sure your colony can survive. So, that's the H squared. Of course, you can increase in a third or fourth as you like. So, this is a very simple model. If I is a constant, either the colony will be collecting or you will have best stability going to zero. So, here's the question: when R So here's the question: when R, the value is changed between you collapsing and then established, and what happens? Okay, that's some kind of work we have been doing. So I'll just give you one example, two examples. Basically, one case is basically you're promoting. When the average, you know, you die, but I increase your blood seniority, you can survive, but also vice versa. There's cases when you introduce a seasonality, actually, you make colony more likely to collapse. So, from here, we have some limited mathematical results, but we do have more from the simulation point of view. So, here H0, that's the initial conditions, right? So, you see these kind of, you see these straight, this basically is epsilon group zero. I don't have seen that ID. zero i don't have seen that idea if my initial condition goes to any here you establish the red which means you establish blue which means you're collapsing um so it if phase go to zero and then you can see original epsilon equal to zero you're collapsing but i'm i i'm if you including the um the seasonality you may um you know you prohibocynises um but the situation can change uh if epsilon is too large especially the when the gas When the gamma is 40. And also, the opposite is the blue area is crossing this line. So basically, we are choosing here, which means original, I'm able to survive, but after you give me the seasonality, actually, I'm not able to survive. So I'm really hoping, Saf, you're working here, you can provide more theoretical to predict. Theoretical to predict such, you know, how the gamma, I think in the Schreiber's talk, they have the frequency can impact the survival. The gamma indeed is very important. Also, upstream is important as well. And then our observation is depending on the season, length of season line is small, and then in this case, the feeder maximum time and laying maximum time is marriage. Delay in maximum time, it's marriage greater than half of a gamma or greater than gamma. And if it's not small, and then the large epsilon can tend to collapse in, and it's not small, and then we have positive or negative. And then things become much more complicated if you talk about the impact of foraging. As we know, the honeybees still need to do the same with the bumblebee, you're foraging, but you're coming back. So in the sense, if you have the In a sense, if you have the pesticides, the foraging actually may promote the pesticide spreading. So before I talk about dispersal, I just want to give you quickly a summarize of the pesticide hygiene model. This is built up from the previous model, but here I want to talk about the constant rather than complicated in the periodic function. This is basically, this is the This is basically the parasite. They need a brew to survive, and then we're using the HM because they reproduce when they're absorbing the nutrients of the brood. And then the model of this is very simple. I'm just going to... So either you're collapsing or you have a stable equivalent point or spray equipment point becomes unstable and then collapsing. So here is kind of the model what we have is we this is the motivated by This is motivated by the data, but this is the part we have dispersal. Dispersal depending on the population of the honeybee, because how much of the ability you are attaching to the frigates. But you don't have this kind of exchange between the honeybee itself. So from here, I'm just going to give you the illustrations of the impact of that dispersal. So everything is symmetric. So, everything is symmetric. So, all the parameter values except initial conditions are different. So, in that case, you can see the low when the intermediate value of the low actually creating multiple, multiple this, the equivalent point, but with a larger, that's not going to do that. But if I go into the symmetric two-patch, but also it's one patch is a stable yellow patch, it's going to go be extinct if you link them together. And you can see the large. Together, and you can see the large dispersal actually may destabilize the system. And well, if there are different, you know, the dispersal and the level also, you have huge difference of dynamics. Just tell you how the dispersal may really huge impact, especially when you have biasabilities of the model. Anyway, I'm going to stop here and thank you for being here. I'm sorry if I'm getting. Question? I've recently been thinking about encounters. Interaction, encounters. Yeah, yeah. I was just thinking about the first set of results that you were showing with the alarm call or the alarm spread of the alarm. And I was just curious about two things. One is: have you looked at Have you looked at contrasted alarm that spread by contact and alarm that's spread not by contact? Yeah. Have you actually looked at it like an encounter radius? Because with all this video that you have, how proximate are they to each other and whether that basically how the formal actually can be. That's right. So if there's some kind of a chemical cue or something, that can very much depend on distance because you'll have a Can very much depend on distance because it has a distance decay function. So if you actually explicitly look at encounter distance, you might see some really cool stuff about how the alarm call gets distributed through the network. No, no, that's great. But we are able to, because we have everything uplifted. I thought you might, yeah. And the other thing is, the other comment is just a suggestion, a curiosity, but based on Beau's talk on Monday, apparently they make these gigantic petri plates, and so you could. PP plates, and so you could do an experiment where you have encounters in small PP plates versus medium versus gigantic plates. We try because also depending on the colony size. And also, we're looking at a different context. Right now, we don't have any tasks. Now, I'm pulling a task and it seems to become very interesting. So, you know, basically, if I'm busy, I may not respond as what I want to. So, let's just trade off. When I'm busy, I'm not going to. So, but the situation becomes. So, but situation becoming quickly become complicated, but we do have the results and also agent-based modeling results. But we're hoping we can have more agent-based modeling that's theoretically expanding. But we're hoping, you know, we'll have you help. Maybe we can make it better. So, uh when I talk, yeah, so I thought about can we derive that bitalism model from supervised learning? Because you had that. Supervised learning because you had that as separate two parts. So, because we know nowadays we have some way to derive deterministic model from something-based machine learning. Yeah, we do have simple like the disease model, but ASI model. We do have one, but let's put simple ones, and then we're thinking, can you give us some ideas how the special ketogenic connecting to remove. Special pedagogy connecting to the movement. We all have this. But it's, I myself was not satisfied with sense of the model itself. Because I was hoping maybe the diffusion or the reaction, because the way they're moving is running for a particular sound. Sound line is going to run away. Sound like actually I'm tripping to my location. So they have a lot of, but yeah. So. The other thing I want to lady will know. Powerful is in my lab for two years and more stuff. And he will be involved in Kan A B experiments. Honey bee experiments. He's going to bring us some specialist in biological sciences. Because we're doing experiments, the June term, the peptides. He had some experience. I don't know whether Tao has some experience before. Experiments, no. No, okay. But he's an accidental model and then a magnetic field. Yeah, but he wanted to be involved in a Honeybee experiment. Or Olef because I probably know him, Olef. When you left, he just arrived. Usually, the students, my experience is not. Usually, the students, my experience, is the first success semester when I engage in experiments, they are so excited. Oh my god. After one semester, he said, hell no, I'm not going to do experiments because the way is so intensified. Okay, I cannot do that. So I was scared. When I begin to be left, I was scared. Someone saw the dog. Yeah. And then they take you. Yeah, they'll bite you. But they don't care. It's funny. They don't care much about this. Let's thank all the scriptures of this working game. This working game. We've got everyone signed up here and you another you guys can do it. We have a clear buyers who work the first two.
