Okay, so welcome back, everyone. Glad to see you here at the final day of the conference. So, our next speaker is Laura Capuano from Politecnico di Torino, and she will be speaking on GCD results for certain divisibility sequences of polynomials and the conjecture of silverman. Okay, so thank you very much. I apologize if I couldn't attend all. If I couldn't attend all the days, but in Turin, it's the last week of exams, so I had also to do some exams too. But I'm really glad to have the chance to speak about this work. So all I'm going to say is a joint work still in progress with Fabrizio Barrero and August Turquet, who is in the audience. And in this talk, so I will give you So I will give you kind of a large introduction to motivate our result. And you will see this talk is more arithmetic question that is linked to geometry more that geometry that is dealt with arithmetic. So it's a bit the other way around. So the motivation of this work stays in some number theoretical questions about divisibility. Questions about divisibility sequences. So I will recall the notion of divisibility sequence. So if you have a sequence of integers, dn, this is called divisibility sequence if it has the property of this property of divisibility that whenever you have an index m that divides the n, then dm, so the corresponding element in the sequence has Element in the sequence has to divide the end element of the sequence. So, for example, there are many sequences that very famous sequences in number theory that are divisibility sequences. For example, one of the most famous one is the Fibonacci numbers. But also, we will be interested in SQL, in sequence. In sequences of the form a to the n minus one. This is another example where a is an integer bigger or equal than one. So this is easy to see that is a divisibility sequence. So whenever you have a sequence of this kind of form, you can ask some questions. So a very difficult question, which is not easy to solve, is which sequence Is which sequence contains infinitely many prime numbers? And this is not known in general. But in 2003, there was one of the first work in this context by Bouzokorbay and Zamir, who proved, or at least had the conjecture, that if you take two independent divisibility sequences, they should have only a finite number of common factors. A finite number of common factors. So, what they were able to prove is the following result. This is from 2003. So, assume that you have two multiplicatively independent numbers, A and B. So, you ask that there are no relations of the form A to the R, B to the S equal to one. So, this means multiplicatively independent. Then, Then, if you look at the GCD, so the greatest common divisor of the sequence A to the n minus 1 and B to the n minus 1, then this GCD does not grow too much. This means that for every epsilon, there will exist a constant, depending, of course, on A and B, such that the log of this G C D is lesser. GCD is less or equal than epsilon to the n plus t. So this G C D doesn't grow too much. So they proved this theorem with some techniques of Diophantine approximation and application of Schmidt subspace theorem. And actually, And actually, let me just mention that the hypothesis of asking that A and B, the two numbers here, are multiplicatively independent is essential. Because of course, if you take A and B equal to some powers of the same number C, then of course you will have that C to the n minus one will divide one will divide the GCD of a to the n minus one m to the n minus one and so the growth of this GCD will be linear but essentially if you are not in this case then the growth of this GCD is small so actually there is a conjecture so not so much later Eilon and Rudnik proposed a conjecture that is even The conjecture that is even stronger of this result, and the conjecture is the following one. So, assume that you are again in the hypothesis of having two multiplicatively independent numbers, then the expectation is that there are infinitely many values of the exponent k such that the GCD of these two elements of Elements of the divisibility sequence is exactly the G C D of A minus 1 and B minus 1. Okay, so of course A minus 1 divides A to the K minus 1 and B minus 1 divides B to the K minus 1. So this G C D will always divide the G C D on the left hand side. But the expectation is that under the notion of multiplicatively independence, this you This, we have this equality infinitely many times. So, this is still a conjecture in the number theory, so in the integer case. And one can observe that from a geometric point of view, if you take a to the n minus one, this sequence comes from algebraic subgroups of the multiplicative group, because if Multiplicative group, because if you take g m for me will be c star, and all the algebraic subgroups of g to dm are given by equations of the form x to dn equal to 1. And Silverman proposed a conjecture which deals with algebraic subgroups coming from other divisibility signals. So he proposed the conjecture. He proposed the conjecture on divisibility sequences coming from other algebra subgroups instead of taking just the multiplicative group. So one of the first algebraic subgroups that he dealt with is given by elliptic curves. So let me define what is an elliptic divisibility sequence. So assume now that you have an Assume now that you have an elliptic curve defined over the field of rational numbers, and assume that we take a point, a rational point on the elliptic curve, then one can see that this point can be written as the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of this point can be written in this form, so as two quotients, where the denominator of the x. Of the x-coordinate is the square of some number, and the denominator of the y-coordinate is the third power of the same number. And what can be proved, it's quite easy to prove, is that if you start taking all the multiples of this point P and you start with the point which is not a torsion point, so not a point of five. Point, so not a point of finite order, then the sequence of integers given by the square roots of the denominator of the x-coordinate of NP is still a divisibility sequence. So it satisfies the divisibility condition that we saw before. And in this case, there is an analogous of There is an analogous of the conjecture of Einon and Rudnik. So, that if you start with two independent points on the elliptic curve, then you expect that the GCD of the corresponding divisibility sequence will be more or less always the same as the GCD of DP and DQ, if P and Q are the two points you start with. But we need first. But we need first to give a notion of independent points on the elliptic curves. And let me give the definition. Okay, so assume that we have two points on the same elliptic curve. So they're said to be dependent if there exists two isogenies, both non-zero, such that the image of That the image of the first point is equal to the image of the second point. So, for example, if you take a couple of points P1 and P2 with P1 the distortion, then the points will be dependent because you will have that there exists some n such that mp1 is equal to zero, and so you are in the previous definition. In the previous definition, but also you want to exclude all the couple of points satisfying relation, linear relation of this form, AP1 plus BP2 equals to zero with AMB in Z. Okay, so you want to exclude not only torsion points, a couple of points in which one of the two points is torsion, but also Two-point distortion, but also points related by relation of these four, or more in general, even with coefficients in the endomorphism ring of the elliptic curve. So, assuming this notion of dependence, Silverman proposed this conjecture. So, we have the first part, which is the analogous of Which is the analogous of the Buzocurbayen-Zanmir theorem in the case of GM. So, first of all, we have that the log of the GCD of DMP1 and DMP2 does not grow too much. And in this case, the growth is quadratic. And the second part is exactly the analogous of. The second part is exactly the analogous of Eilon-Rudenik result. So the conjecture is that the GCD of DMP1 and DMP2 will be exactly equal to the GCD of DP1 and DP2 for infinitely many choice of N. Okay, so let me comment on this. So the both the Both the points are still a conjecture, but for the first part, Silverman proved that if you assume Boyta conjecture for the blow-up of E times E at zero, zero, then you will have this inequality. But the second part is completely open. Let me also mention, and we will see. mention and we will see the the we will comment on on this also later that you can give more general conjectures in other algebraic groups so silberman proposed a very general conjecture for every algebraic group over z but for example you just uh just for example you can uh think to the same conjecture that is a mixture of the Is a mixture of the one of Buzokor by and Zamir and the one of Silverman, and you can look at GCD of DNP and A to the N minus one, for example. Okay, so this is more or less the situation over the integers. So let us see, so the situation is more or less that nothing is known and whenever Is known, and whenever you have that, nothing is known over the integers, you start to deal with the problem in over the function fields. And so we will consider now the function field analog of the conjecture of Silverma. So in this case, what we do is we replace, so we will fix K field, an algebraic close field of characteristic zero, and we will and we will replace the field of rational numbers with the field of rational function k of t and of course the ring of integers with the polynomials with coefficients in k so in this case we have much more results and the first result i want to mention is the theorem of ilon and rudnick who proved the analogous of their conjecture The analogous of their conjecture in the case of polynomials. So, what is the theorem? So, assume that you take two multiplicatively independent polynomials in this case. So, what I can prove is that there exists a polynomial which depends only on the polynomials A and B, of course, such that the G C D of A to the n minus one and B to the n minus one. minus one and b to the n minus one divides this polynomial here. And as a consequence of this, it's easy to see that you can prove that the analogous of Aller-Rudenik conjecture holds. So you have that the GCD of A to the n minus 1 and B to the n minus 1 is equal to the G C D of A minus 1 and B minus 1 for infinitely many n. So in this case, you see that you have not only Not only this condition, but you have a stronger result because the set of n such that this GCD is different from this one is actually finite. Okay, so this is stronger than what is asked from the conjecture of Silverman, the general conjecture. Of Silverman, the general conjecture of Silverman. And let me also mention that some generalization of this result, where instead of taking these, you take rational function is due to Alino stuff. And in the elliptic case, also we have we know something more. So in this case, what we have is that we case what we have is that we take an elliptic curve defined over k of t and in this case if you take a point in e to the k of t you can write in the analogous way of the integer case the x coordinate as the quotient of two polynomials where the denominator is the square of a certain polynomial that I will call dp. Call dp. And in this case, so the analogous conjecture of Silverman is that if you assume again that P1 and P2 are two independent points, then you have that there exists a certain polynomial D such that the GCD of DMP1 and DMP2 divides D. And again, as a consequence of D. As a consequence of this, you will have that the GCD of dmp1 and dmp2 is equal to the GCD of dp1 and dp2 for infinitely many choice of the exponent. So this is not a conjecture anymore and it has been proved by Silverman in the case of constant J-invariant and in the more general case very recent recently in 2008. Between 2018 by Georg Axia and Tucker. So let me now have a look, have a more, let's say, look at the geometric point of view of this conjecture. Okay, so assume now that we have this elliptic curve and we assume it in Biestras form defined In Bayer Stras form defined over K of T and we will consider an elliptic surface over P1 with generic fiber E. Okay, so we will have these situation. So we will have the generic fiber E here and the elliptic surface. The elliptic surface over P1 here. Okay, now if I take a point P in the generic fiber, this will give me a section which I will denote by sigma P in the elliptic surface. Okay, this is the image sigma P of C and I can take also the point zero in the ellipse. The point zero in the elliptic in the genetic fiber, and this will give me the zero section of the elliptic surface. Okay, and now if I take the pullback of the image of the zero section via sigma p, these sigma p, this will give me a divisor over p1. Okay and now what I want to do is to translate my conjecture in something about these divisors and recall that what we want to study is the GCD of DMP1 and DMP2 where P1 and P2 are the two points, the two independent points. The two independent points, and the mp1 and the mp2 are the square roots of the denominators of the x-coordinates of the multiples of the points. Okay, and now the key point is that if I take a factor p minus alpha, so this divides dp, the polynomial dp, if and only. dp if and only if alpha, the number alpha, belongs to the support of the zero divisor of dp and what is the support of this zero divisor? This is exactly the set of points in my base curve such that sigma p of t naught intersect the zero section. Okay, so if I go back to my If I go back to my picture, I will have that I'm looking at the points, so the support of the divisor I'm interested to. So the factors come from the support of this divisor here. Okay, so what I'm looking at is the intersection of the Of the image of all the sections given by all the multiples of dp with the zero section. And so this is for the presence of the factors. But not only this, I also have that the order of vanishing of every polynomial. Of every polynomial dp at point alpha is exactly the multiplicity of the intersection of the image of the section sigma p and the image of the zero section, which is exactly the order of the pullback of the zero section. Okay, so really looking at the G C D of The GCD of these two polynomials is exactly equivalent to study the number of intersections of two sections and the multiplicities of the sections. Okay, so in this way there is nothing special in having just P one as a base in our elliptic surface, so we can further generalize the the conjecture of Silverman. The conjecture of Silberman, and indeed what we will do is to consider this more general setting. So, assume again that we have a field of characteristic zero. We take a smooth projective curve defined over k and I will denote by capital K the by capital K, the function field of the curve. And I will take an elliptic curve defined over K. And again, I will take an elliptic surface defined over C with genetic fiber E. So again, I will have my picture here where E here is the genetic fiber and this is This is the elliptic surface. Okay, and now what I want to do is that I take, if I take a point here, so in E of K, so a point P here, this will give me again a section, sigma. section sigma p so this will be a section from c to e to curly e and i will consider again the zero section and i will denote by let me do this or bar the image of the zero section okay Okay, and let me denote by and I will take sorry the sigma p upper star O bar and this will give me a divisor over C. Okay, so now I want to give a definition of G C D of two divisors over C. Of two divisors over C in this case. So given two divisors, so let me write generic divisor D as the sum for gamma in C of its order times gamma. Okay, so whenever I take two divisors, two affected divisors at Two effective divisors actually, I will define the G C D of the two divisors as the sum for gamma and C of the minimum between the two orders in gamma times gamma. And if I take now two points P1 and P2 over two elliptic curves, which are defined over capital K, so this is the function field of the curve C. The curve C, but they can be also different. I can define the G C D of these two points as the G C D of the pullback of the zero section over E1 through P1 and the pullback of the zero section over E2 through V2. Okay, so I will define in this way I will define in this way the GCD of two points in two elliptic curves defined over the function field of a curve. So just notice that in the previous case, so when we were in the case of P1 here, the GCD of The GCD of two points, where is it? The GCD of two points, P1 and P2, was exactly equal to one half of the GCD of the divisor of the poles of the point P. Okay, so with this definition of GCD. Definition of GCD of divisors, we can actually give the general result proved by Silverman and Jokak Siataker, which is the following. So assume now that you have P1 and P2 two independent points, then there exists an effective divisor D such that the GCD of N1, P1 and N2, P2 is less or equal than D for every N1 and N2. For every N1 and N2 bigger or equal than one. And again, you have that the GCD of MP1 and MP2 is equal to the GCD of P1 and P2 for infinitely many n bigger or equal than 1. Okay, let me mention also that there is a further generalization of this theorem given again by Geokaksien Taker, who just recently Just realize that there is nothing special here in just taking the image of the zero section. So you can further generalize the problem by taking the image of another point of your elliptic curve. And instead of taking the pullback of the image of the zero section, you take the pullback of Of the image of another section. And just to avoid some complication, let me stick to the case in which the elliptic curves is the same. The two elliptic curves E1 and E2 are the same, but there is a more general result for two elliptic curves. So they were able to prove this theorem. So assume now that So assume now that you are in the case of Q bar, so K is equal to Q bar, and you take four points on your elliptic curves and you assume two things. So you assume that the couple of points P1 and P2 are independent with the notion of independence that I gave before. And if you assume, moreover, that there are no relations of the form Mi Pi equal to Qi, so there is no multiple of Pi which is equal to the relative Qi. Then again, you have that there exists an effective divisor D such that if you take the GCD of N1P1 minus Q1 and the GCD of N2P2 minus Q1. GCD of N to P2 minus Q2, this is uniformly bounded by some effective divisor T. Okay, so this is exactly the same as this, but in this case you have to ask something more about the independence of the points that you are considering. Okay, so let me comment now a bit. A bit on the idea that is behind the proof because this will give in some way also the idea of our contribution to all these kind of problems. So, assume that we want to prove the first part, so the fact that the G C D of these two points. These two points is uniformly bounded. So you have to prove mainly two things. So, first of all, that the support of this GCD is finite. And what is the support of this GCD? So the support of this GCD is nothing else that the sample points in the base curve. Let me again draw the picture. Again, draw the picture. So, this is the set of points in C such that sigma of N1P1 of T0 is equal to sigma Q1 T naught and sigma N two P two of T naught is equal to sigma is equal to sigma q2 of t0. Okay, so now this is not a trivial result because of course if you stick to one choice of n, you will have two sections in your elliptic surface and they will intersect infinitely many points. But here you are taking the union for all the choices of n1 and n2 and this in principle One and then two, and this in principle could be finite. Indeed, what is true is that if you take just one point, so assume that you want to study this, okay, this is actually infinite. But if you take two independent points and you ask that these two relations are satisfied, then the support is actually finite. And let me mention. And let me mention that so this generality was proved by in the in the paper of Jocha and Tucker, but for example, if you take Q1 and Q2 equal to zero, okay, then here you take the zero section. This is a result by Master and Zanier, which is Master and Zanier, which is called the relative Manning Manford. And I will comment a bit on this in five minutes. So, this is something which is related to problems of electrintersection and a series of other conjecture. So, now, once you have proved that the GCD, the support of the GCD is finite, what you want to prove is that if you fix a point Fix a point on the base curve, then the order of sigma mp upper star OQ bar is bounded independently of n. Okay, so the fact is that even if you take more and more multiples of p, the multiplicity of intersection is Simplicity of intersection is uniformly bounded. So it can depend on the point in the base curve, but it has not to depend on n. And now if you take 1 plus 2, then you have the result because now the effective divisor that gives your bound is exactly the divisor. Given by the sum of points in the support, which is finite, of the maximum between the two upper bound point by point, which is finite for the second part. Okay, and so these two things give you the proof of the theorem. So, let me mention now that. So let me mention now that, so as I mentioned before in the case of Q1 and Q2 equal to 0, actually this result on the support is related to what they're usually called the problem of a likely intersection. There is a series of conjecture which I have no time to speak about raised by Bombieri, Master and Zarnier and by Zilber in the case of Tori and by Pinky. Of tori and by pink in the more general context of missimura varieties, which study intersection in, let me say, algebraic groups, which are not which are not really meant to appear. And in this context of problems of a likely intersection, and most Section and more specifically in the context of family of abelian varieties, together with Fabrizio Barruero, we proved a result which is quite similar to the result proved by Jokaki and Taker. And I want to mention this result. So assume that you have an elliptic curve defined over Q bar of C. Over 2 bar of C and again we take an elliptic surface with genetic fiber E, and you take P1, Pn endpoints in the elliptic surface. So what we were able to prove is that if you assume that your points are linearly independent over Z, so you ask that there are no So, you ask that there are no relations of the form A1P1 plus ANPN equals to zero, which holds identically. Then, there exist finitely many gamma in the base curve such that there exist two linearly independent vectors of integers for which you have. You have that this system holds. So, this means that if you take the sum of P1, A1, P1, AN, PN, this will intersect the zero section infinitely many points. Okay, so you see that this theorem is very similar to the theorem proved by Jokak Sien Taker. By Jokaksi and Taker, because Jokaksi and Taker were interested in, let me say, special relations. So relation of the form N1 sigma P1 of gamma equal to sigma Q1 of gamma and N two sigma P two of gamma equal to sigma q two of sigma q2 o gamma. So you see that this is nothing else than a relation of a particular form of this linear system. So what is the difference? The difference is that the hypothesis that we have in this result is actually stronger than the hypothesis that they have in their result. So the idea is that as soon as you want to look at just Look at just specific relation, you have really just to ask that the corresponding relation does not hold identically. Okay, because they were asking that no relation of this form were holding identically. So, what is the truth? The truth is that we found a way to derive To derive their theorem from our theorem. So, actually, what can be proved is that assuming that this theorem holds, if you want to look at specific relation and you are in the less strict hypothesis, then you can prove the finiteness for these specific. For this specific relation. And the power of this is the fact that our result, which here is mentioned only for elliptic curves, holds also for families, for general families of abelian varieties and also for some examples of split semi-abelium varieties. And so using these and proving the more general general part of the second part so the the bound for the sorry okay so the the more general statement for the bound on the the the uniform bound on the multiplicity then we were able to prove let's say the conjecture of silverman for general abelian varieties and for some cases of splitsmith And for some cases of split Smiabelian varieties. And I will conclude by an example of what we can prove in this setting. So as I mentioned at the beginning of the talk, we had the conjecture of Silberman also in the case of E times Gm. And this is exactly what we can prove in this setting for in the function field analog of this setting. Analog of this setting. So assume that you have, so k is again q bar, you have an elliptic curve over k of t, and you take two points on your elliptic curves and two non-constant polynomials. Then what you have is that if you start with the non-torsion points and you look at the G C D of V M P and Of VMP and F to the N minus one. So this divides a certain polynomial for every choice of N and M. And so this again implies that the G C D of D M P and F to the N minus one will be equal to the G C D of dp and F minus one, actually for all n but finitely many arithmetic progression. So it's something more. Progression, so it's something more than just for infinitely many n. And moreover, we have also the generalization of Georgia and Tacker. So instead of taking the zero section, we take other two points. So if you assume that you have no relation of this form between P and Q, and no relation of this form And no relation of this form between the two polynomials. Plus, we have to assume that the J-invariant of the elliptic curve is non-constant for some technical reason. Then there exists a polynomial C2 such that the G C D of these two quantities divides the polynomial. So let me conclude by mention that, as I said, This GCD problem can be studied in much higher generality. I didn't want to enter in the case of a Belium variety of dimension bigger or equal than two, because then there is some technicalities in defining the multiplicity of intersection, etc. But there is the analogous conjecture of Silverman over the integer for every Over the integer for every abelian varieties. And we were able to prove the analogous of the conjecture of Silverman both for abelian varieties and for split semi-abelian schemes of dimension bigger or equal than two. So this theorem is just, let's say, a friendly statement of what we can prove, but we have a more general result in higher dimension. Okay, so I think my Okay, so I think my time is over, and thanks a lot for listening. Let's thank the speaker. Are there any questions?
