Yeah, well, it's a pleasure to introduce the speaker of the first online talk in this conference. The speaker is Eli from Stanford, and she'll talk about steady gradient solitons with positive curvature operator. Ea, the floor is yours. Thanks for the invitation and the introduction. I'm very happy to talk here. So I will talk about some static gradient solitons with new Static within solitons with positive curvature operators. And so there are three parts of this talk. And first, we'll state our main results. And then we'll compare our new static gradient solutions with the translators in mean curvature flow. And there are a lot of parallel results in this direction. And then in the second part, we'll show the construction of the solitons. And there's a uniform. A uniform way to construct all of these solitons. And in the last part, we'll study the asymptotic behavior of these solitons at infinity. And in particular, we'll show that in dimension three, these solitons are the so-called flying wings. Okay, so the Ricci flow is a geometric flow which is introduced by Hamilton in 1982, and it's a smooth family of And it's a smooth family of Riemannian metrics evolved by the following equation. So the derivative of the metric is negative two times the Ricci curvature. And so here I want to show you some very basic examples of the Ricci flow, and we'll see what it does to a manifold. So if you start a Ricci flow on a sphere, let's say a two-dimensional sphere, then it will shrink to a round point because the right-hand side is positive. Because the right-hand side is positive. Also, it's negative. And if you start a Ricci flow from a flat torus, then the curvature is zero. So the metric will be invariant. And so you get a Ruchi flow defined for all negative and positive times. And then if you start a Ricci flow from hyperbolic space, where the curvature is ever well equal to negative one, then the curvature is negative, so the right-hand side is positive. So, the right-hand side is positive. So, the metric will expand itself, and you get a Ricci flow defined for all positive times. So, these three examples are all Ricci flows, which are isometry, which have isometric time slices. So, these self-similar Ricci flows can also be generated by the so-called Ricci solitons. And here's the rigorous definition. So, a soliton is a Riemannian manifold equipped with a Manifold equipped with a smooth vector field x, and it's satisfying the following soliton equation. So there's a constant lambda, a real number, and it satisfies the root g minus one half, the lead derivative of x is equal to is equal to some multiple of the metric. So in particular, if the metric also, so if the vector field x is zero, then you get the Einstein metric. The Einstein metric, which is the so the distribution soliton is a generalization of Einstein manifolds. And then moreover, if this vector field x is equal to the gradient of some function f, then we'll call this soliton to be a gradient-rich soliton. And this f will be called the potential function. So in this case, if you have a potential function, then the delete Potential function, then the delete, then the lead derivative of the gradient of that of f is equal to two times the Hessian. So now you get a solitan equation which says that root g minus the Hessian of F is equal to some multiple of G. So right, so when you have a soliton, you can use it to generate a self-similar Ruigi flow in the following way. So first, you use the variable. First, you use the vector field X to generate a family of diffimorphisms such that it's satisfying this relation. And then you pull back the soliton metric using these diffeomorphisms and scale it properly. Then you can directly compute that this family of metrics satisfies the retrieve flow equation. Ruchi flow equation. And okay, so now we get a self-similar Rouchie flow modular diffeomorphisms. So depending on whether this lambda is positive, zero, or negative, you get the so-called shrinking or steady word expanding gradient, expanding solutions. So when lambda is positive, you will have a flow defined for all negative times. And so this is a shrinking soliton. See, this is a shrinking soliton. And for lambda is negative, then the flow is only defined for all positive times. And if lambda is zero, then this flow is defined for all times. So in the next few slides, we'll see some very classical examples of shrinking, expanding, and then steady gradient solitons. And so this is not a complete list of examples. List of examples we know, just some very classical ones. So we start with shrinking solitons where the constant lambda is bigger than zero. So as we see in the first slide, all the shrinking round spheres are shrinking solitons. And the potential function can be taken to be any constant. And of course, you have all the Einstein manifolds of positive scalar curvature. These are also shown. Scalar curvature. These are also shrinking solitons, and the potential function is trivial. And you can also define a shrinking soliton on the flat Euclidean metric. So you take the potential function to be the quadratic function, and you can check directly that this potential function together with the Euclidean metric satisfies the shrinking equation, the shrinking soliton equation, and the constant there is equal to. And the constant there is equal to lambda. So even the metric is flat, it is still shrinking solitum. And then you can take the product of a line and a shrinking one sphere. Then you get a shrinking one cylinder, which is also a shrinking soliton. And you can also take the products of the gauss shrinker and the shrinking one sphere, and you will have the shrinking one. Shrinking round cylindrical planes. Okay, and then for expanding gradient solitons, we want to mention that there are all the Einstein manifolds of non-negative, sorry, of negative scalar curvature, including all the hyperbolic manifolds. And the one special class that we want to mention here is the examples constructed by Dorella. So there he considers first, if you considers first if you have a n minus one dimensional remaining manifold with curvature operator non-negative and in particular it has the lowest diagonal value of the curvature operator is at least one okay so you have this uh n minus one dimensional manifold and then you consider the metric column over this m minus one dimensional manifold and so call And so call it C of M. And so his theorem then says that you can find a unique expanding gradient solitons, which is asymptotic to this cone. And this expanding gradient soliton has positive curvature operator. Expanding, sorry, so this is expanding gradient soliton. And it is unique up to Soliton and it is unique up to overscaling. So, we're going to use this example to construct our static gradient solitance later. So, we'll talk about it again. Okay, so now we can focus on the static gradient solitance, which is the solitance satisfying the equation of Ruchi equals to the Hassan of the potential function. So, first, you have all the Ruchi. So first you have all the Rucci flat manifolds, but these are not interesting segregated solitons because the potential function is trivial. And then you have the famous Sega soliton, which is defined on R2 and it is due to Homuton. This Sagar soliton is the rotation symmetric and it looks like this picture. If you take a sequence of points going to infinity, Going to infinity, and you consider the limit of this pointed manifold. And then you can show that this will converges to the flat cylinder, R cross is one. And so this flat cylinder, it has zero curvature everywhere, but it does not have Euclidean volume growth. So it is a collapse example. So it is a collapse example, and this will tell you that the cigar soliton is a collapse solution. And also, we know that about the cigar soliton, it is a rotation symmetric. So you can write the product. So you can write the metric like the warped product metric. And this warping function stays bounded at infinity. And you can also compute directly that the scalar curvature. That the scalar curvature decays exponentially fast in the cigar soliton. So, for n greater than or equal to 3, we also have the rotation isometric steady solitons, and these are called Bryant solitons discovered by Bryant. So, also like cigar soliton, it is also rotation symmetric around the critical point P, which is Which is the critical point. Yeah. And so you can write it down like an abarped product in this form. And then in this case, the warping function phi will increases like the square root of r. r is the distance to the critical point. And the scalar curvature will decay linearly. And again, if you choose a sequence of points going to infinity, And this time you want to scale it down by the scalar curvature because otherwise you will only get the flat Euclidean space. Okay, so if you scale down by the scalar curvature at this point, then the sequence of these manifolds will converge smoothly to a cylinder, R cross S2. And so because S2 has non-zero curvature. 2 has non-zero curvature, so this is a non-collapsed manifold, which says that the Brine soliton is non-collapsed. Okay, so you can also generalize this warped product to doubly warped product and multiple warped product. And there you can also find static gradient solitons carry this structure. Carry this structure. So you will have a static gradient solitan tape whose metric is of this form. The first factor is k factor, it's k-dimensional sphere. And the rest of factors can be an arbitrary number of Einstein manifolds with positive scalar curvatures. And so in these two examples, the doubly warped product and the multiple warped product, Multiple warped product, the static gradient solitance does not have positive operators. So the curvature can be negative somewhere. And so this leads to an open question by Tao Huai Dong in 2006. So he asks if there are any non-rotation asymmetric static gradient solitons with positive curvature operator in dimension n greater than or equal to 4. To four. And now we're able to give an affirmative answer to this question. So we find for each dimension n greater than equal to four, an n-dimensional zt equals o m minus one symmetric static gradient soliton with positive curvature operator that is not rotation symmetric. So I'm going to give you some pictures in a few minutes of how this soliton looks like. Okay. Okay, so let's move on. So, next, let's turn our attention into, let's focus on dimension three, where this can look at this static gradient solutions we already know. And these are essentially only two of them that we know before. The one is the product of R and Sigr, and the other is the three-dimensional bond soliton. Brine solitude. And here you have a non-collapsed one and a collapsed one. And if you consider the asymptotic cone, so this is my notion for asymptotic cone. So if you blow down these two solutions, then you get first you get for the R-time cigar, it I get a half-plane, and for the brine soliton, you get a ring. Okay, so there are. So, there are some classification results of three-dimensional static gradient solitons under various conditions. So, some of them are curvature conditions and some are volume conditions. So, under these conditions, people are able to show that the solutions, the solitons in dimension 3 is either the first one or the second one. Okay, so the first thing, the first classification. The first classification is by Brandela, and he shows that if you assume the soliton is non-collapsed, then it has to be the brine soliton. And then you can also assume that the soliton has linear curvature decay. And then the drill shows that it also has to be the Bohr and solid. And there are some other conditions that assuming which you can show that it is the first example and it is a R times cigar. So for example, we can assume instead of linear decay of curvature, you can assume that the curvature decays faster than linear. Then you can deduce that it is isometric to a quotient of r times ziggler. So this has to be a non-trivial. So, this has to be a non-trivial quotient of R times z r because otherwise, in the r direction, the scalar curvature does not decay. Okay, and then you can also assume that the average of the scalar curvature in the integral sense is zero. Then you can also deduce that this soliton is isometric to a quotient, a non-trivial quotient of R. Trivial quotient of our time cigar. So now this classification results make us to ask the question if there are any solution, any solitone that does not satisfy these conditions. And if there is some, if there's such a soliton, then it might be somewhere in between these two solitons. And we may expect the asymptotic. We may expect that the asymptotic horn of that soliton is a non-trivial sector, and this is exactly Hamilton's flying wing conjecture. So first, what is a flying wing in dimension three? So that is a steady gradient solid tone with blowdown or isymptotic cone is equal to a sector. To a sector whose angle is strictly between zero and pi. And so Homerton conjectures that there exists such a soliton. So now we are able to give an affirmative answer to this conjecture. And we'll also find a family of 3D Z2 cross O2 symmetric static gradient solitons that are all flying weights. And also for For all higher dimensions, we can also generalize the concept of flying wings to these dimensions. So we can say that an n-dimensional static width and soliton with positive curvature operator is a flying wing if its asymptotic cone is a metric cone of this metric ball in n minus two-dimensional sphere with radius one. So this is a natural generalization of the Generalization of the 3D flying wing definition. And for this generalization of definition, we can also show the existence of such generalized flying wings in higher dimensions. So in particular, we show that these solitons are O m minus T equals O2 symmetric. So I'm also going to give some pictures for this generalized flying wings in Generalize the flying wings in the last slides of this part. Okay, so now I want to compare our results with what we know in mean curvature flow. So first or briefly review what we mean by a mean curvature flow flying way. So the mean curvature flow is another geometric flow. Geometric flow, but it has a lot of parallel results with the Rucci flow, as we will talk about in a second. So the mean curvature flow is an immersions into the Euclidean space, which satisfies this equation. The evolution is governed by the mean curvature factor. And in particular, we're interested in translators, which is the analog of sadiguid and solitons in mean curvatures. Static organ solitons in mean curvature flow. So the translator is a solution of mean curvature flow, which evolves by this translation. So you can move the images of the emotions to one another. And then we can talk about what is a mean curvature flow flying wing. So it is a convex graphical translator that is contained in a finite slab. Contained in a finite slab. So the graph is defined in a finite slab for a mean curvature flow flying wing. So I'm going to show you the picture in your second, but you can just imagine the flying wing. It's also, it just looks like a flying wing in the real world. Okay, so there are many more theorems about the mean curvature flow flying. About the mean curvature flow flying wing, then what we know about the Ricci flow flying wings. So, first, there is a very complete theory of the existence of flying wings, in particular in dimension three. So, first, Wang Shijian in 2011 constructed in each dimension a main curvature fluid flying wing. But then recently, independent work by Hoffman, Eamon, and Martin White, and Bonnie, Lamford, and Tinaglia, they were able to show that for any given slab with a waste greater than pi, they can find a unique mean curvature flow flying wing contained in that slab, but in no smaller slabs. So this is a complete. This is a complete result for the existence of flying wings. And then for the uniqueness, there are also many results. For example, in particular in dimension three, for any slab with width greater than pi, they also showed that there is a unique flying wing contained in that slab. And so this And so this uniqueness result leads to the classification of all the translating graphs, all the translating graphs in R3, because every translating graph in R3 is convex. So this leads to the following classification theorem, which says that a translating graph must be one of the following. So, for example, it can be all the flying wings or All the flying wings, or the or the green ripper surface, or a tilted green ripper surface, or the rotation is symmetric both soliton. Okay, so now without further ado, I'm going to show you the pictures of all the results that we mentioned before, and we're going to make a comparison between these results. So, here we're only Only we're comparing the mean curvature flow translators with Richie flow static gradient solutions. So, well, for N equals to 2, there's a green vapor, which is the curve shortening flow, and its analog in routine flow is the cigar soliton. So, both of these examples are collapsed. And they're also the unique translators in this dimension. In this dimension, and when n equals to 3, you have to consider not only claps solutions but also non-claps ones. So that there are, but in the non-clubs case, the soliton is unique. So for mean curvature flow, the ball soliton is the unique non-clapsed soliton in demand in n equals to 3. And the uniqueness is proved by Hauser-Hoffer. Hauselhofer. And as we mentioned before, for the Rucci flow, the non-collapse soliton is the only non-collapse soliton is a brine soliton. So both of this, both soliton and the brine soliton are both solution symmetric. And in the collapsed case, we have a mean curvature flow all the Z2 cross O2 symmetric flying wings. So here's a picture for the mean curvature flow flying wings. The mean curvature flow flying wings. If you take a point, a sequence of points going to infinity along the edges of the wings, and then this will converges to some tutor-going hypersurface. So this is the asymptotic translator of this flying wing. And And now we can also show the same thing for the Bucci flow-flying wing. So, if you choose a sequence of points going to infinity, then you will see that the soliton looks more and more like the product of R and a cigar soliton. Right. And then we come to high dimensions. When n is greater than or equal to 4, There are more non-collapsed solitons except the rotation symmetric ones. So, here are those Z2 cross O M minus 2 symmetric translators constructed by Hoffman, Neiman, and Martin of White. And similarly, we can construct the steady grid and solitons in Ruchi flow, and they have very similar asymptotic behaviors. asymptotic behaviors. So they take a sequence of points going to infinity, and you will scale it properly by the scalar curvature, then the geometry will look like R times a lower dimensional Bryan soliton. And this for the non-collapsed examples. And for the collapsed ones, we have this, those for mean cover. For mean curvature flow, you have this O and minus two cross O2 symmetric flying wings, and now with our generalized notions, we also have this flying wings of Fuji flow with the same symmetry. And this is a picture for the flying wings. That asymptotic static gradient solitant at infinity in such a flying wing is a product of our. product of Rk times the times the cigar solidum okay so in the second part I'm going to construct this solutence so actually we'll show that we can construct a smooth family of family of these solitons, which are z equals o n minus one symmetric, and they are parametrized by this constant alpha. Alpha is between zero and one. So this alpha is the quotient of the lowest eigenvalue and the largest eigenvalue of the Richie curvature at the critical point P. So for example, when you are in a brown soliton, then at the critical point, Then at the critical point, alpha is equal to one because all the eigenvalues are the same. And if you're in the product of R times cigar or r times a brine soliton, then alpha will be equal to zero because you have a flat vector and the lambda in that direction is equal to zero. Okay, so now let me show you the proof. For simplicity, For simplicity, we'll only focus on dimension three, but the proof for higher dimensions is more or less the same. So, we will first find a sequence of smooth families of metrics on these two, such that this sequence of smooth families satisfies the following conditions. So, first, we want them to be Z2 cross O2 symmetric. So, not only rotation symmetric, we want them to be symmetric. Rotation symmetric, we want them to be reflectional symmetric. And then we want to have gauss curvature greater than one. And then if you restrict the u to be zero, you get a sequence of shrinking spheres. If you restrict the u equals to one, then you get a sequence of ellipsoids, and we require that their diameter converges to pi. Diameter converges to pi. So you can find such a sequence of ellipsoids satisfying both the second condition and the fourth one. And also we want their volumes uniformly goes to zero as I goes to infinity. So as you'll see on this family of this metrics look like the right hand side. So when you so let me explain So, let me explain briefly how you construct them. So, you can start by constructing a sequence of ellipsoids satisfying condition 2 and 4. So, the diameter converges to pi and the volume goes to zero. And then you can start every tree flow from each of these manifolds, and then you will scale it properly such that the volume is not too big, and it's not too big than too. And it's now too big, then too bigger than the initial manifold. And then you will end up to get a round sphere. And so this is your metric when u equals to zero. And so this is the first thing we want to do. And then for each of this metric, we consider the metric column. we consider the metric column over this over this metric uh we call it we'll call it this uh colon over g i d and then um as we said before by the relus result we can find a unique expanding grid and solitance which is asymptotic to this cone and it has positive curvature operator so next one going to take limits take proper limits of this expanding gradient solutions and to get static gradient And to get static gradient solitons. And this is guaranteed by the following compactness theorem. So it says that if you have a sequence of expanding gradient solitons satisfying the following conditions. So first you want the scalar curvature at a coefficient point to be equal to one. This is the normalization condition. And the most important thing is that you want the asymptotic volume. That you want the asymptotic volume ratio of this expanding gradient solutence go to zero. So asymptotic volume ratio is the ratio of the R ball divided by R to the A and then you take R to go to the infinity. And so get you wanted to go to zero. And then you will have a sequence of, and then you can pass to You can pass to a subsequence, and you will get a limit. And this limit will be a static region soliton with a negative curvature operator. And at the critical point, its scalar curvature is equal to one. Okay, so now we're going to apply this compactness result to our to those expanding gradient solitons we constructed in last slides. In particular, we're going to first apply. we're going to first apply this compactness to two sequences corresponding to u equals to zero and u equals to one. Okay, so if you apply the to the sequence of expanding gradient solitons, then you get a brine soliton. Okay, this is because this expanding gradient solitons are totally symmetric, so the limit is a totally symmetric, and so it is a brand soliton. Is a brain soliton, and in this case, lambda one over lambda three is equal to one, and then um and then next you apply this compactness theorem to the other sequence when you equals to one, and then you get the limit is r times gar. So the reason of this is that so you have this diameter of this sequence goes to pi, so that to pi so that so by this you can show that asymptotic cone that the metric cone over this metric will split over line and so um and you can show that the limit will also split over line which is uh so which is r and so it is r times zigr and so in this case this quotient is equal to zero um so now we're going to choose um another Choose another expanding gradient, another sequence of expanding gradient solitons satisfying this equation. So lambda one over lambda three is equal to alpha. So we can, of course, find such a sequence just by the continuity of this functional. And then, okay, so then we can apply this compactness theorem again to this sequence. Sequence of expanding gradient solitons, then we'll have a static width and soliton, and then the quotient of these two eigenvalues is equal to alpha. So now this is a static width and soliton that we want to construct. Okay. Okay, so then in the also up to here, we have finest. So up to here, we have find some new static radiant solitons in dimension n greater than equal to 3, but we still not know if they are flying wings or not. So next I'm going to show you that in particular in dimension 3, these solitons are really the flying wings. So the asymptotic cones are not race, they're sectors. Okay, so this, so first of all, we have the following theorem, which tells us that the scalar curvature has a unique limit along the edges of the wing, which is uniquely determined by the cone angle of this soliton. So here you have a Here you have a assume you have a soliton whose asymptotic comb is a sector and assume it is asymptotic to a sector with angle alpha and then this theorem says that So along the edges of the wane, the scalar curvature does not go to oh so along the edges of the wane the scalar curvature has a limit which is given by Rp times a sine score of alpha over t. Okay, so gamma here is the complete geodesic fixed by the O2 action, which we call the edges of the wing. the wing so um so this theorem by the theorem will see that um if you uh if you have a flying wing which has angle alpha bigger than zero then the scalar curvature will not vanish at infinity so it will have it will have a positive limit along the edges of the wave okay so uh i'm going to skip the proof of this theorem proof of this theorem. We're going to use this theorem to show that the solitons we constructed before are indeed flying wings. And so this is done in the following theorem. So equivalently, we just want to show that if the asymptotic column is array, then it must be asymmetric to the Bohr. Be asymmetric to the bore and solitude. Right, so the proof is done by a contradiction argument. First, we assume that this is not a brine soliton. And then we know that we can show that if it is not a brine soliton, it must dimension reduces to cigar soliton along the edges of the way. So here this gamma is also the, as we said before, it is a geodesic fixed point. Before it is a geodesic fixed by the O2 action, and then we're going to choose another choose and fix another geodesic, which is fixed by the Z2 action. I will call it a little gamma. So it is some geodesic, but we did not climate just minimizing. And then we know that away from the boundary of the away from the edges of the wave, the solitone can be written down as a warped product. Written down as a warped product, like this. And so then we will consider the following two quantities. One is called H1, which is the distance from little gamma to from a point on little gamma to the address of the way. So this is gamma, this is H1S. And another quantity that we want to consider is the Is the length of the S1 fiber at a little gamma s, so H2S. So it's the length of the S1 fiber. And then by some computations using the symmetry, you will have the following inequality. So it involves the derivative, the first derivative of the H2 and the scalar curvature. And the scalar curvature central geodesic. And then we're going to need, then I summarize the three key lemmas as below. So first we're going to need that the scalar curvature has an upper bound, which is bounded by the square root by the square of the distance h1. So h1. So h1 to this distance, and we're claiming that the scalar curvature at this point is not bigger than h1 to the negative 2 times some constant. And so you can, this is essentially follows from Peloman's estimate for non-collapsed solitons, for non-collapsed Luchi flows with non-negative curvature. So here we have a, so here, of course, we have a collapsed soliton because The solitone because in the central region it looks like R2 times S1. But if you lift them, but if you lift this region to the universal cover, you will get a non-collapsed local Ruchi flow. And there you apply Powerlman's curvature estimate and you will have this upper bound. And then we have the second lemma, which says that the quotient of H2 and Of H2 and H1 goes to zero. So, this is a consequence by the dimension reduction to cigar. Also, because along these edges, we get the solid term become more and more like a cigar. So, from there, you can see easily by some metric comparison argument that H2 over H1 converges to zero. Okay. And also, And also, you have the last dilemma, which says, which you can show that the product of H1 and H2 increases at least linearly. Okay, so you can check that this first lemma and the last lemma, they're also true in brine soliton. So it is a lemma 2 which distinguishes this soliton from being a This soliton from being a bronze soliton. Okay, so now if you plug in these three Limers into this previous inequality, then you will have the following, then you can integrate it and get the following inequality. So you will see that H2 increases less than the score. Less than the score the score root of S. So again, this is something that is also something that is not true in the blind soliton. And you will see that this slower than slower than quadratic growth is, so this inequality is a bit stronger than this lambda 2. Okay, so now we're going to replace lambda 2. So now we're going to replace lambda 2 by this new inequality, this new estimate on H2, and then we'll repeat this computation again and we integrate with this result again. And then this time we'll see that we'll see that this will give us that the H2 all stays bounded at infinity. Okay, so now recall that this H2 is the land. Is the length of the H1 fibers? So if it is finite and infinity, this will, by a convexity argument, this will tell us that the cigar solitons at the tip, it will have non-zero scalar curvature. Okay, so it will imply that the limit of the scalar curvature along these edges is non-zero. But now we can use the loss theorem, which says. The loss theorem, which says that if this is just the relation between this limit and the isometric congle, which says that if this is non-zero, then this alpha has to be a positive angle. So this is a contradiction to our assumption. So we get a contradiction, and this proves this theorem. And in particular, it shows that the 3D stack. That the 3D static widget solitons we constructed before are indeed flying wings. Okay, so now, right, so that's the results of this talk. And now I'd like to come back to the previous diagram and summarize some questions that remain open after this construction of these new examples. Okay, so Okay, so I'll come back to this to this picture, and here we have constructed these new examples, but we still don't know if for any given angle, for any given angle alpha, we are able to find a specific flying wing which corresponds to this angle, whose asymptotic cone is equal to this angle. Equal to this angle, and so this is still unknown, and also for the non-collapsed soliton, what we constructed, we know that it is, so it is easy to check by the symmetry condition that it is non-collapsed. And so it might be new singularity models of Rucci flow. And also, it is interesting to see if the what is see if the uh what is the asymptotic cone of these non-collapsed solitons so um you can ask if the asymptotic cones are sectors or are they uh are they just a race um and so i'd like to mention that in a recent result by uh troyer and herskovitz in the main curvature flows case they showed that uh this non-collapsed solid This non-collapsed solitons, sorry, non-collapsed translators, their asymptotic cones are not sectors, so they do not, they do not look like wings. So, similarly, we might expect the same thing to hold in the for the Rucci flow solutants, steady solutions. And also, except for these problems, it is also interesting to ask if we can classify all. We can classify all the 3D steady gradient solitons. So we expect that all the Z2 cross O2 symmetries flying wings are all the collapsed ones. So to this end, the first question is to see if we can prove some O2 symmetry for these flying wings. So if this symmetry is proved, then the This symmetry is proved that might later the classifications of 3D static wooden solitons or even 3D engine 2 tree flows. Okay, so I think I will stop here. Thanks very much for your attention. Let's give a thank you very much, Eve. Let's give a round of applause to E. To E and yeah, let's see. Are there any questions? So, either from the remote audience or the in-person audience? Let me first ask the remote audience: are there any questions? I have one question. Do you think it's possible to show that I noticed all your examples? They all have some symmetry. Do you think it's possible? Oh, yes. I think it's possible. It's very possible to that. So, sorry? Go ahead. Yep. Yeah. Also, I think it's very Yeah, also, I think it's very possible to show the O2 symmetry for all the 3D static grid and solitants. Yes, I think this symmetry is true, right? Yes. You have to give those salt, gradient salt, steady, steady gradient salts, which have no symmetry. You think that's No symmetry. You think that's possible to show? Sorry? Do you think it's possible to show? You have to have some symmetry if you're a steady grade. It's all done. So if you have to have a symmetry as a steady growth, you have to have symmetry. Is that what you think is true? Do you think that's true? That's true. So you're saying that if the O2 symmetry is true, or if you have to have some degree of symmetry, you have to have some degree of symmetry. Yes, I think that would be at least the O2 symmetry is right. So at least you will have the O2 symmetry, and I believe that this. I believe that this you can first show the O2 symmetry, and then you should also be able to get the Z2 symmetry from deduced from first showing the O2, the O2 symmetry. Okay, thank you. Yeah, yeah, thanks. Any other questions? Yeah, maybe in the in-person people? Yeah, yeah. Jonathan is coming. Thank you, it's fine. Is it this one? Yeah, so if I heard right, the classification for translators in the mean curvature flow case is for graphical translators. But if I remember, there's also these like semi-graphical translators constructed by Hoff. Translators constructed by Hochwin and the others. So, is there an analogue as well for Richie Flow? Those semi-graphical guys? Sorry, what do you mean by semi-translators? Semi-graphical translators, I think, is what they are. I sort of vaguely remember this paper. They have like translating annuli, and they have many, many examples of translators that are non-mean-convex and that are not graphic. Convex and that are not graphical. Oh, okay. I don't know. Sorry. Yeah, I don't know. Richard, do you know the analog of the semi-translator in Mink of Chuffler? What would that be? I don't know. What would be some graphical? Sorry, why are they semi-graphical? What does that mean? Yeah, maybe someone remembers the paper better than me. But Bob has a good point that they also don't have. I think the solutions don't have positive curvature. He always looked at the positive curvature case. But in dimension 3, all the unshin 2G fluoresc are all possibly curved. Possibly curved. Yeah, yeah, so yeah, so that's a difference between Ricci flow and mean curvature flow. Okay, okay. Yeah, maybe the analog would be 4D Ricci flow, maybe that there is some. Oh, sorry, I didn't want to interrupt. No, no, no, it just, ah, what do you say about 4D? Well, in 4D, there are steady solitons that don't have positive curvature. So maybe that's a So, maybe that's corresponding to this. I feel like when you don't have positive curvature for surfaces, it's more similar to 4D Ricci flow. Or some of the difficulties are similar. Yeah, I'm not sure. Yeah, I can, I don't know too much about that. But another thing that maybe that they, but I'm sure that it's. But I'm sure that it's analog of 3D ancient retrief flows that we don't know before. So, you know, in main coverature flow, there are the ancient pancakes or the ancient sausages. And so in main coverature flow, we can also expect to construct these solutions. Of course, they are not the translators, they're just engineers. Just the engineer solutions, yeah. Thank you. Yes, I have a related question. So, Hoffman, Illman, and Martin White actually have a larger family of examples, so essentially they can prescribe all the principal curvatures at the tip. So, I've been wondering are the corresponding examples for Richie Flow? Yes, you want to yes. Uh yeah, Sat um yes, that might be possible if you um I'm not sure, but maybe if you modify the limiting argument, you may be able to find some new examples. New examples in which the principal curvature, which in Ricci-Flow's case is the ratio of the Ricci curvature eigenvalues. Yeah, I think that might be possible, but yeah, I haven't thought too much about this. Yeah, I mean, in your construction, you had those ellipses, right? So maybe you can look at the case when the Maybe you can look at the case when the eccentricity in different directions goes to infinity at a different rate or something like that. Yeah, yeah. Wait, wait, what's your question? But in East example, doesn't she construct explicit, given some quotient, she constructs it a steady soliton with that quotient. But in higher dimensions, at least for me. But then in higher dimensions, at least from curvature flow, you can prescribe all the principal curvatures. Oh, I see, but so they would have some radio symmetry. Okay, okay. Okay, I see, I think. I have a question in the just because there's so many analogs between mean curvature flow and Ricci flow in the in the 2D super 2D examples in the collapse collapse case of mean curvature flow they can they have the mean curvature flow they can they have these um because the the cone you have not has actual wings you can construct eternal solutions which are not translators and i wonder if you expect that behavior in the rici flow in 3d or no yeah so um yes i i believe you can construct this uh uh non-static within solitons but internal solutions it might look like this It might look like this. Let me try to draw a picture. So, you know, this will have the flying wings, which are static within solitons, and they're eternal. So, and I think you can also find some eternal, but non-static within soliton solutions. And it might look like this. How it might look like this. So, of course, these are not static within solutents because the time slices are just not isometric, but you can expect such solutions to be defined from negative infinity to positive infinity. So, what I'm describing here is that if you take a limit, If you take a limit on the on this going to infinity, you will get a flying wing. But when you're going backwards to but when you're going backwards to neck to infinity, then the sequence of manifolds pointed at this point, it will converges to two flying wings. So one says here and the other is here. So these two flying wings were drifted up. So, there's two flying wings were drifted apart as you go to neck infinity. So, you may be able to construct such examples, and these are definitely not static within solitons. But I have no idea how to construct them. That's exactly the question I have in mind. So, thank you. Thanks for the question. So, you mentioned, I'm sure you told me this at some point, but you mentioned that it's not clear whether. That it's not clear whether for every angle there is a flying wing with that angle as a, you know, that's asymptotic to a cone, a sector with that corresponding angle. But you can show that, so, but your cells, do they, they give you some kind of a family of these steady solitons? So do they show that you have a neighborhood of zero or of pi of angles that can be realized as Be realized as sectors. Right, right. So I don't have a smooth family of these solitons, but I can construct a family of flying wings with smaller and smaller angles. Okay, okay, this one. Okay. So I can find what I know so far is that you can find. So far, is that you can find a sequence of flying wings and their angles converges to zero. But I don't know if you can, on the other hand, if you can find alpha converges to pi and the such flying ways that this, I don't know. Okay, but so you only know that there's a sequence of alphas, or do you know that there's some open neighborhood of zero that can be realized? My construction only. My construction only gives you a discrete alpha. Yes, so I don't know if there's a neighborhood in which for any alpha you can find a certain flying point. Okay, thanks. Thanks. That is an interesting question. Yeah. Any other questions? Well, yeah, if that's not the case, let's thank the speaker again. And I think we'll reconvene in half an hour, if I understand this correctly. Yes, that's a compliment. All right. Thank you very much, I. Yeah, see you later. Bye. See you.
