Okay, hello, everybody. So, my name is Alicia Caro Villaran. I am a postdoc in the lab of Alabados El Nan in the Plasma Biology and Evolution Lab in the center of the National Center of Biotechnology in Madrid. And so, first of all, I'm very happy to be here with you today. It's a pleasure to be learning so much and to continue to learn so much from this workshop. And I'm also very happy to be presenting my work with you, which is a very, very early. With you, which is at very, very early stages, and which I've entitled Using CRISPR-I to Decipher Plasmid-Host Interactions. Okay, so in the Plasmid Biology and Equation Lab, as you can imagine, we all work with everything plasmids. So there's several topics that we're currently working on, starting with the role of multi-copy plasmids in bacterial evolution, to in vivo evolution of plasmid-mediated antimicrobial resistance, to dynamics of nasocomial. To dynamics of nosocomial infections, collateral sensitivity driven by plasmids, and more. And my work actually focuses on the topic of in vivo evolution of plasmid-mediated antimicrobial resistance. So as I was saying, we all work with plasmids in the lab, but what is a plasmid? Plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA molecules that can replicate independently from chromosomal DNA and they are strongly involved in the spread of antimicrobial resistance. In fact, they're the main mechanism of spread of AMR. The main mechanism of spread of AMR in the community. Out of the different mechanisms for the spread of AMR, OXA48 is one of the most frequent carbapenemases in enterobacteria. It is distributed worldwide, particularly in North Africa, Middle Eastern countries, and Europe. And the gene that encodes for OXA48 is the Bla-OXA48 gene, which is usually encoded in a family of plasmids known as POXA48. These are INC-L broadcast-range conjugative plasmids. Broad host range, conjugative plasmids, meaning broad host range that they can exist in several different bacteria, and conjugative, meaning that they can transmit themselves in an independent and self-reliant manner to new hosts. And because Pioxafertiate is a relevant model, and also because it was very, very highly present in the hospital that we used to be hosted at before, which is the Ramonica Jahan Hospital in Madrid, the vast majority of us in the lab use Peoxo48 as a model. Used POXA48 as a model to study the nosocomial dissemination of antibiotic resistance. In fact, in the lab, we've been able to show that POXA48 can be transmitted between different patients, which is known as between-patient transmission, and also between members of the same mycobiota, which is known as within-patient transmission. In this first figure, we can see a case of between-patient transmission. So here we can see, I don't know if you can see very well, but if you can see the different patients in gray. The different patients in grey and different parts of the hospitals that these patients were admitted to. So, from neurosurgery to pneumology to urology. And we can see that we see transmission of PIOSA48 between patients that didn't coexist at the same time in the hospital or that didn't even coexist in the same areas of the hospital, showing that doctors and machinery and utensils must play a role in the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Of antimicrobial resistance. In the second figure, we're looking at an example of within patient transmission. So, in this case, we have a first pathogen that carries a variant of BioXA48 that was isolated from the gut of a patient. And later on in time, a second pathogen is isolated carrying the same variant that the previous pathogen carried, showing that there was a transmission between pathogen 1 and pathogen 2 of the oxyphotate. So, all of this. So, all of this paints a picture of a plasmid that is very efficiently disseminated in the community. And the question is: if the plasmid is indeed disseminated so efficiently, why don't we find it in all compatible members of the community? So to understand this, we have to know that plasmids that carry antimicrobial genes are very highly beneficial to their hosts in the presence of antibiotics. In the absence of antibiotics, however, they impose a fitness cost that is strongly selected against. Cost that is strongly selected against. And this fitness cost has several sources. So it starts as early as plasmid reception when the plasmid enters the new post in single-stranded DNA form and therefore activates the SOS response. It continues through plasmid replication and the expression of plasmid genes, where very often the machinery of the host is recruited. Continues through to plasma conjugation with the formation of a pilus or a pili to transmit the plasmid from host one to host two. But it is known. To host two, but it is known that the vast majority of the cost associated with having a plasmid comes from interactions between the proteins of the host and plasmid proteins, which lead to changes in the regulatory networks of the host. And so although it is true that carrying a plasmid that has AMR genes is highly beneficial in the presence of antibiotics, the truth is the vast majority of bacteria are never in the presence of antibiotics. It's actually quite rare in their natural habitats to be in the presence of an Their natural habitats to be in the presence of antibiotics. And therefore, throughout the evolution of hosts and their plasmids, there has to be a decision of taking care of this trade-off between fitness and resistance. So do I become fitter or do I become resistant to this one antibiotic in the eventuality that in the future I might have to face it? And so during these complex evolutionary dynamics, there is a co-evolution of the plasmid and the host. Plasmid and the host. For example, in the form of compensatory mutations that can be acquired either in the chromosome of the host or in the plasmid itself, and that decrease the cost of carrying the plasmid. And these complex interactions between plasmid and host have resulted in the emergence of successful associations between specific plasmids and specific clinical clones, meaning that there are specific clinical plasmids that we very often or always find associated with very specific. find associated with very specific clinical codes. In fact, our lab has been able to show that Peoxaportate does form this type of successful associations with specific relevant SKACODI and classial pneumonia and other enterobacteria hosts. So with very specific clinical clones, what I mean by relevant clinical clones is clinical clones that we associate very often with disease or that we find very often in patients. And we do see that throughout those. And we do see that throughout those different clinical clones, some of them are frequently associated with POXA48 and others aren't. So, for example, E. coli ST10 and Plato pneumonia ST11 are frequently associated with PIOXA48, whereas E. coli ST131 and Patiola ST1427 are rarely, or even in our case, for example, in our hospital, we never see an association between these plasmid and these hosts. And so the question is: okay, so what explains these successful associations? And can these successful associations be explained by the fitness cost of acquiring POXA48 and the initial period in which you've recently acquired this plasmid. And so, to understand the concept of fitness cost caused by Piosportiate, a colleague of mine. By Jos√© Portier, a colleague of mine built a large collection of clinical strains. And so, basically, what she did was she took individuals, clones from the different STs that I spoke to you about, but that didn't carry Peoxy48 naturally. So, they hadn't had an opportunity to co-evolve with the plasmid. And she conjugated the Peoxy48 plasmid into them and measured the relative fitness or the cost associated with the plasmid in those different posts. So, here we're looking at Classium. So, here we're looking at Clacella in blue and E. coli in pink. And the first thing that we can see is that carrying Pioxa48 produces a wide distribution of fitness costs in the different hosts, and that these range from actually quite heavy costs up to actual small benefits. However, when we try to translate this table into this figure, what we see here now is in red it's hosts that belong to an S. Hosts that belong to an ST that is rarely associated with Pioxa48, and in green hosts that belong to an ST that is frequently associated with Pioxa48, we see that these fitness costs caused by the acquisition of Peoxa48 cannot explain on their own the existence of these successful associations. In fact, if we now look at not all of the species together, but actually separated, we see that there is absolutely We see that there is absolutely no correlation between fitness, cost, and successful association in the case of E. coli. We do see a small correlation in plastic pneumoniae, where the hosts that are frequently associated with fioxy-48 seem to have a neutral cost of caring with the oxyport, and those that have a rare association with pioxy-48 seem to have a high cost. There is, however, a current However, a correlation between the plasmid content of the host and the fitness effect that is produced by POXA48. So, here we're looking at E. coli and Clafiella strains separated with the different colours. We are looking at the relative fitness. So, in orange, we have the fact that the plasmid costs a lot down to blue, in which there's actually a benefit of carrying the plasmid. And then here, we have different families of plasmids that might coexist in the cell at the same time as. In the cell at the same time as PFC38, and if you have a plasmid belonging to that family, you have a dot. And so, once again, we don't see any type of correlation between plasmid content in E. coli and fitness cards, but we do see a correlation in Klefsiella. So, we see that coexistence with plasmids belonging to the incompatibility families FIA and H1B leads to high-cost by POX48, whereas coexisting with plasmids from the family. With plasmids from the family FIB leads to a low cost of POSI48 or even a slight benefit. And so, what this seems to indicate is that the plasmid fitness costs are caused by specific genetic conflicts between the plasmid and the host instead of some generic property of the plasmid, be it the size of the plasmid or the cost of expressing all of its genes. And so, if this is the case, then this is a perfect target of study to study this. To study this concept using CRISPR-I screens. So, CRISPR-I stands for CRISPR-interference. It's a genetic perturbation technique that allows for the repression of gene expression by blocking transcription. It makes use of DCAS9, which is a version of Cas9 that is able to bind to DNA but doesn't cut it. You can direct DCAS9 to virtually any position in the genome by providing it with a guide that will have a sequence that matches the sequence that you want DCAS9 to attach to. Ticasmanate attached to. And so if you direct ticasinate to the inside of an open reading frame, you will block the running RNA polymerase, which won't be able to finish the mRNA, and therefore you will block the expression of the gene by blocking its transcription. You can do this at the level of a single gene, or you can do this at the genome-wide scale, meaning that you work with a whole library of guide RNAs, each of them targeting an individual gene. You build a setup in which you end up having a library of End up having a library of strains in which each cell will carry a guide that targets a specific gene. And so, in the beginning of the experiment, the initial distribution of these guides will be equal. And then, when you introduce a source of stress and you carry on the experiment, eventually those cells that carry a guide that blocks the gene that was essential for that condition will die. And therefore, these cells will die. These cells will die and they will disappear from the population. And so, if you compare the final distribution of each of the guides with the initial distribution, you get a proxy for the essentiality of each of the genes that they were blocking. And so, the idea of my project, my main project in the lab, is exactly to use these screens, CRISPR-I screens, to study plasmid-to-stein interactions at a molecular level. So, we're working with two different setups: a first library. Different setups: a first library that targets PIOXA48, meaning that it blocks each of the genes of PIOXA individually. And then a second library that will target the chromosome and other plasmids that might coexist in the hosts that we choose. So this part here, I've already started working on it. For this second one, we're still in the process of deciding which hosts we're going to use and try to find a design that will allow us to have a feasible experiment, right? Because these things can come. Experiment, right? Because these things can go up very quickly. Do we want to use the core genome? Do we want to use the entire genome? So, all these types of questions. So, starting first with the library that targets POXA48. So, first of all, these experiments will be performed always in clinical strains. And so, some of these strains will be natural carriers of POXA48, meaning that they will have had the chance to co-evolve with the plasmid. And others, we will introduce POXA48 into them. We've introduced Bioxaport data into them, and so this is what we call transconjugants. And so, the type of data, what the data looks like in this type of experiments is that you will compare changes in frequencies of the guides between two conditions. If there is no change, of course, it will be close to zero. If it is no change in this condition, it will be close to zero. And so, basically, by doing this, we will be able to identify, first of all, genes that are essential for plasma biology. So, if you compare having the oxy48 and not turning Piosiportate and not turning the CRISPR on, so not blocking the genes. And having pheosophritate, but do turning the CRISPR eye on. For those genes, when you block them, the plasmid no longer survives in the population. Those will be genes that are essential for plasmid stability. And the other way around, those genes that when you block them, suddenly the plasmid does much better. Those will be responsible for plasmid cost. Similarly, with the library targeting the chromosome and the plasmids. And the plasmids coexisting in the host. So, in this case, we're comparing what happens with CRISPR always on, but what happens when you don't have POXA48 and what happens when you do have Peoxy-48 in the cell. And this will allow us to identify, first of all, genes that are chromosomal genes that are targets of compensatory mutations. It will allow us as well to identify chromosomal genes that are important for plasma biology. So, those that when you target them, when you silence them to When you sign the centauri, the plasmid is no longer viable. And second of all, also chromosomal genes that are complemented by the plasmid. So, basically, genes that when you block them, when you don't have the plasmid, the cell does much worse than when you block them and you do have the plasmid. Is the change in frequency of single type RNA? Exactly. It's encoded on the plastic. Or the plasmid exactly, yes. So, basically, just a second, sorry. So, basically, we have a plasmid that expresses a CRISPR system, so basically, DCAS9, and as well, the guide. And what we measure is what we sequence is the guide. So, the plasmid having the guide is the proxy for fitness. If you do a population measurement, you have to library in your test tube. Exactly. So, everything is in a population, yeah. I go as you think this. So, we've tried. As you think this? So, we've tried different things because the fitness costs are very often very, very small, so it wouldn't be very easy to see. So, as I said, I recently started this. I did some preliminary experiments, which I'll show in a second. We've done up to 80 generations, so then you run with problems of the CRISPR system already not working so strongly. So, mutations on the CRISPR system itself, on the target, so you have to play between. Target, so you have to play between actually being able to measure a cost and nothing happening right to the CRISPR system. So, yes, so we've done up to 80 generations so far. But that we're seeing here right now, is this a replicate replicate plot? What's the difference between the x-axis? So, this is our changes in the frequency of the guides. So, from maybe here it's easier. So, from the final So from the final frequency compared to the initial frequency, so log tuple change of that. And basically, in this case, this is not carrying pioxy48 and blocking the genes or carrying pioxy48 and blocking the genes. So in this first experiment, I'm sorry, maybe I went too quick with this. In this case, because we're looking at genes from the plasmid pioxy48, of course, it doesn't make any sense to not have it there. So in this case, we're comparing what So, in this case, we're comparing what happens when you don't have the CRISPR turned on. So, when no gene is being blocked, and when the gene is being blocked, and in this case, it's not carrying the button at all or carrying the password. I forgot to say you can interrupt me whenever you want. In the case, so yes, in you mean the Peoxo48 or you mean yes, yeah, exactly. So, basically, we find very Yeah, exactly. So basically we find very different variants of Piazza protein in the hospital and there's one that is the most prevalent. I cannot give you a percentage, but it's really, really like is the most prevalent and I'm working with that one. In the future, maybe I'll move to other guides if it's possible. Guides the target for fame. Yes. So basically, yeah, so basically that's what I did during my PhD was to optimization of this type of setups. And so we've gotten quite good at being able to Gotten quite good at being able to predict how, because there's differences in the activity of DCAS9 that are driven by the sequence of the guide itself. And so we are now quite good at being able to select very, very small numbers of guides per gene. In this case, because I've had the space, I'm working with five guys per gene, but as I move on to larger libraries, this won't be possible. So we tested before and in And in lab strains, you can go down to one or two guides per gene. These are clinical strains. And I've learned in the year that I've been working with them that they do whatever they want. So we'll have to test. Thank you. Okay. So in the end, when we use these two libraries, we will have a very general and complete idea of what's going on in these plastic host interactions. So from the library targeting POXA48, we will be able Targeting POXO48, we will be able to understand the genes that are responsible for plasmid cost for the library that targets the chromosome, which are the targets for compensatory mutations, potential targets for compensatory mutations, and which are the genes complemented by the library, and in both cases, genes that are essential for plasmid biology. So as I said, I've already started working on this, and it's actually very sad because if this conference had been two or three weeks later, I might have some data to show you, but it's currently being sequenced. So I cannot show you, unfortunately, I cannot show you anything. You unfortunately, I cannot show you anything, but we do have some experiments that we did-some preliminary experiments in which instead of using clinical strains, we worked with the lab strain E. coli MG1655, so K12. And so, in this case, we have the same library that targets POPSI48. And we were able to identify a set of genes. So, first of all, a set of genes that are essential for plasmid stability, but they are in no way new. So, it was known that, in fact, in this field here. In this figure here, they're marked in pink. So these are genes that are important for plastic replication and maintenance. But this experiment was more of a proof of concept than anything. And we were also able to identify that the main source of the cost that we see when we carry POC48 comes from the BLAOX48 genes, the resistance gene itself, which, once again, this is something that is known very, very often happens. The main source of stress occurring the plasma is the expression. Of stress occurring the plasma is the expression of the antimicrobial gene. Regarding the library targeting the chromosome, so because we're working here with E. coli MG1655, so of course these doesn't have any other plasmids apart from the plasmid that we put in it. So this is a lab that targets the chromosome alone. And in this case, again, we were able to identify a set of genes, more specifically, quite a few genes that are important for plasma biology. The first set of them were genes involved in Set of them were genes involved in periplasmic stress. So, DEC P, DEC S, RSE. These are genes that have been associated with periplasmic stress in the past. And basically, there are genes that will take care of any misfolded subunits of the pillus that is formed to transfer pioxid from one host to another. And then we've also been able to identify genes involved in the outer membrane integrity, such as the TOLPAS system, and as well genes involved in membrane test. So, all in all, this So all in all, this paints a picture of what is important for compensating the cost of POSA48 from the point of view of chromosomal genes is the ability to maintain a periplasm space and a membrane that is stable. And so with this, I come to the end of my talk. So as conclusions, we know that the interactions governing the common service of successful association, plasma costs, all of these common Association, plasmid costs, all of these concepts are very complex and that they come from complex molecular interactions. These complex molecular interactions drive the co-evolution of plasmids and their host, and that understanding these interactions will help us understand the dynamics of antimicrobial resistance and its evolution. Something that is very interesting with the work that we do in general in this lab is that we have access to this incredible collection of quite a bit of clinical strains throughout time. Clinical strains throughout time, we have a lot of metadata on them. We know if they came from a patient that was in contact with another patient that took an antibiotic treatment at some point, so we can do quite a lot of stuff in there. And so that in the end, what we aim at is actually getting something that can translate into the clinic and eventually in the long term, find new targets for antibica, for new antibiotics, for being able to predict dynamics within a hospital. And because any opportunity is as good. And because any opportunity is as good as I need to plug one's work, I also do a bit of scientific illustration on the site. So if anybody needs scientific illustration at any point, please think of me. You can follow me on Twitter. And yes, with this, I would like to thank all of you for your attention. I would like to thank the people that pay the bills. So an ERC from Alvaro and an EMBO postdoctoral scholarship, which I'm actually starting in February. So I'm very excited about that. Excited about that. Albert himself for creating an ambience in the lab in which we can all have a lot of fun and grow a lot of scientists. Heronimo, who was a postdoc in the lab and now has his own lab, and Aida, that my work builds quite a bit on the stuff that they did before in the lab.
