Sarah is going to be our first speaker today. We're very happy to have her starting us off right this morning, afternoon, evening, wherever you are. Annabella finished her PhD at Paris 6 at some point in the not too distant past, and essentially since then has been at the University of Lisbon at the Instituto Superio Tecnico. Her expertise is in stochastic analysis and its relationship with PDE. And its relationship with PDE and geometry, particularly probabilistic methods and hydrodynamics. And today she's going to tell us about stochastic KLPs variational principles. Thanks very much, Annabella. Well, thank you for the introduction. Thank you, Fue, for having me here, for the invitation. Thank you also for the organizers, particularly to Marsha, that I understood had a lot of work. And it's really very nice to be here and to see all familiar faces. So, unfortunately, we're not really getting together, but hope times will get better and we'll see each other personally in the near future. But anyway, this is already very nice to have you around and all these people that sometimes I don't, some of them I don't see, I haven't seen. them I don't see, I haven't seen for ages. Well, not for ages, but for several years. And so I'm very happy to be here. Thank you. Okay, so I'm going to talk about stochastic claps variable variables and claps variational principles. So this is joint work with Dario Holm from Imperial and to the Rat Yu from Shangai as well. Chain guide at the moment. Okay, so let me see. Let me first begin with things that are very well known, but just to recall some notations. And okay, so if you open a book on stochastic, sorry, on geometric mechanics, so these are Mechanics. So these are the elementary things that turn out to that come in the beginning of every such book. One of them is called Euler-Poincare reduction and it goes like that. So you have a Lie group, G will always be a Lie group, with left or right invariant metric. Actually, everything I wrote with, not necessarily, well, sometimes it's left, sometimes it's right, but that's. Sometimes it's left, sometimes it's right, but at the beginning at least it's left invariant. Anyway, it doesn't change much except for a few signs around, but it's the same. E is the identity element of the group and the curl G will be the Lie algebra, which you can identify with the tangent space at the identity. Now, if you have a family of elements in the Lie algebra, so In the Lie algebra, so well, let's say a function defined on some time interval with values in the Lie algebra, you can associate the ordinary differential equation with the, so the derivative of g essentially is the u, well, up to this operation, which is the differential of the left translation that puts things on the right. things on the right on the right spaces so uh g uh are the corresponding so u correspond to velocities and g correspond to uh positions trajectories so let's say that you describe some dynamical system in terms of its Eulerian velocity u or its Lagrangian position g, starting from say the identity. And if And if you consider a Lagrangian, so I'm here using the so-called left left, again, left or right, it will be the same, but in this first part, I wrote it in left. In left trivialized coordinates, so you have the G and your G and the U. G and G is always in the group G and the U is the algebra element. So you just write the GMA. So you just write the G minus 1 G dot as the tangents of the left G minus 1 G dot. So it's hard not to have a pointer, but okay, I'll do without. Anyway, so this is by definition what means g minus 1 g dot. And you can define an action functional with this Lagrangian. So written in terms of g dot or written in terms of g dot is the derivative in time, of course. G dot is the derivative in time, of course, or written in terms of u. So u is as above. And if you apply Euler Lagrange to this actions function, you get the sort of more or less famous Euler-Poincaré equations, which are V D T D L U is equal to the operator. To the operator add star, I wrote it down, so it's sorry, just the dual of the add of the derivative with respect to u, plus some term here. So the last term actually sometimes doesn't show up because Lagrangians, for example, if you use just the kinetic energy, you don't see any dependence on g so sometimes you don't you don't see this last term, but actually the Term, but actually, if the Lagrange depends explicitly on the position, you have an extra term here. So these are called Euler-Poincaré equations. And all this method is called Euler-Poincare reduction procedure. And then there are many examples. So the point is that, of course, you have many examples where you can apply this whole This whole strategy, if you want, this whole framework. And the first example that also comes in every book of geometric mechanics is the rigid body equations. So in this case, the group is the rotation matrices groups, SO3. The tangent space is the little SO3, as you know. And then, so any S little SO3 matrix, so anti-symmetric matrix can be written in the form here, the V. So you can talk about SO3 matrices or vectors, it's a bit the same. And you can define some inner products which is defined here with some constants ij, positive constants. They are I it stands for. I it stands for inertia, moments of inertia. So you define these inner products, you get exactly a structure that you want, a Lie group, a Lie algebra, everything. And then you can define as the Lagrangian the kinetic energy. So it's just one half of the square norm of the U. And when you write down the equation, the Euler-Poincaré equation here. So in this case, you don't have the last. In this case, you don't have the last term as it only depends on u. When you write them down, you get the equations of motion for the rigid body, which are well known and are written here. So, this is a sort of the first example. I'm not doing anything stochastic for now. It's just things, standard things from geometric mechanics. So, this is the first example, maybe the simplest one, or if not the simplest. One, or if not the simplest, at least the most well-known that comes as an example of Euler-Poincaré equations. Now, my favorite example is not as simple, although for me it's even more intuitive, but still. Because it's not that simple, because I'm jumping from a finite-dimensional one, which is quite sort of easy to write, to an infinite dimensional one. Right to an infinite-dimensional one, which of course must be more difficult to deal with than it is. But it is in some sense an example of this situation. So this is the example, and again, I'm still not doing anything stochastic. This is the example of the volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of... Well, the fact that I'm in the torus is just because it's a nice example where it's a compact manifold and you don't have. Manifold, and you don't have boundaries. But you can do it with boundaries too. But I don't want to put boundaries here because it messes a little bit the things. So I just wrote the torus case. So it's the volume-preserving diffeomorphism group. So it's the G. So our group is the functions, the bijections from the torus to the torus. Again, can be any, say, Any say compact manifold that are so bijections that have some regularity, Sobolev regularity, let's say HS. I'm not going to be very technical in my exposure in my talk, so some regularity. And which are volume preserving, so they preserve the volume measure. So, okay, so if S Okay, so if s is greater than two, then you have a Hilbert manifold that comes back from work of Evan Marsden in the 60s or 70s. I don't remember quite well. So it appeared after 66. 66 is the major motivation of this geometry framework and comes from Arnold. There is a famous paper of Arnold, which Which dates back from 1966, and then Evan Mazden came later, exactly. I don't remember exactly the dates, but they considered this structure, this if you structure, then they studied the geometry, they studied it very carefully, very detailed, the geometry of this group. Well, it's a Hilbertian manifold, it's a topological group for the composition of maps, it's not quite a Lie group. Not quite a Lie group, but who cares? I mean, not who cares. It's not quite a Lie group because there's lacks some smoothness. But anyway, it's a sort of more complicated object because it's infinite dimensional to start with. And the fact that it's not a Lie group, it's not very important in the sense that most things go through and you can do geometry. Well, some things you have to. Well, some things you have to prove independently for this case, but anyway, it looks like a Lie group anyway, for all relevant purposes here. And the Lie algebra is the Hilbert maps, so the vector fields, the vector fields, which are of divergence zero. Of divergence zero. So the fact that they are a divergence zero is because the group consists of volume-preserving maps. So the tangent elements to this space are divergence-free vectors. You consider the inner product, which is essentially L2. So it's not the HS, it's not the sublf1. So you have a topology and you have an inner product. So they are different. The inner product is L2. Product is L2. Then you consider again as before the G's associated with Us we represent the velocities, divergence-free velocities. G we represented the correspond will be the family of the corresponding Lagrangian family flow associated with you. And then the major statement here is that the Here is that the Euler-Poincaré equations that come from this structure, exactly these Euler-Poincaré equations that I wrote in general terms above, they for the action function all being the kinetic energy, simply the kinetic energy. So if you write down this give the dUDT, the at star operator will give the UDT. star operator will give the u dot gradient of u. Well then there is a gradient of some function that comes up because of we are working in L2. Divergence U equals to zero because it's written in the definition of the Lie algebra. And the equations of motion for this action function, so the Euler-Poincaré equation are exactly this that you are seeing. Exactly, these that you are seeing here, which are the Euler equations. Well, the Euler equation. And this is my favorite example, of course, because it's not, of course, but I mean, because it's related to hydrodynamics and it's a very, I mean, this is a case where you can go from PBEs, from a PBE in particular, with a vacuum dynamical model. Vagrodynamical model, and you can go from here to a group formulation, which gives you the possibility of using geometry in this infinite-dimensional group. So in this Lie group of infinite dimension, and studying all this geometry, which has in particularly been done by Evan and Marson, gives you a lot of information on the Euler equation. On the other equation. So, I mean, you can import geometry to study this PDE. And there are many other examples of other structures that give other PDEs, but again, this is my favorite one. So that's why I wrote it down here. Okay, so for the moment, I didn't say anything stochastic. What is the... Well, let's. Well, let's say that during the past years, I don't want to know exactly how many, but during the past years, actually, I've been working in sort of doing the same thing for Navier-Stokes. So when you have Navier-Stokes, you have a Laplacian. In this equation, you have plus and Laplacian term. The Laplacian is, as we know, As we know, associated in many senses to the Brownian motion. So, how to stochastize this model to get Navier stokes. But again, the fact that I'm particularly interested in Navier-Stokes doesn't mean that the general approach shouldn't be possible in Li groups to stochastize everything. So, the idea, and here I'm referring, I'm going to speak. I'm going to speak about the CLEPS variational principles, which are a particular case of variational principles. So there are other approaches. So the general purpose here is to start from the formulation of geometric mechanics that I told you about in the Lee group. And instead of considering just Instead of considering just g minus 1 g dot equals to u, you consider a random perturbation of these trajectories. So I have put here this perturbation plus some vector fields, some elements of the Lie algebra actually, psi i, Stretanovich dw, w of course being the Brownian motion. And while I wrote here the definition of the Definition of the certain of each differentiation and each differential, but of course, you know that, and you know how to go from one to another. That everybody knows here. So, I'll skip this. And why does one may want to do this? I mean, to stochastize all the trajectories in the Lie group, actually. Well, first, one can try to be. Well, first, one can try to build stochastic geometry mechanics. So, in the sense of perturbation or in the sense that geometric mechanics deals with conservative systems and you want to go to dissipative systems. So, this is like, you know, the big goal behind here. And actually, it's being pursued by people like Verry Holm and other. Home and other people, and it's a very big goal. The other goal is applications. I just put, I mean, I copy-pasted this, right? So don't ask me too many questions about these applications. Again, there are many applications where these things can come up. I mean, including random perturbations in models. Perturbations in models which are deterministically described in this kind of areas, but I'm not doing this. And again, my major motivation is related to other dynamics, although I'm not here talking much about this, which is, as I said, going from Euler to Navier-Stokes in some way or another. I mean, in some variational kind of principle or Variational kind of principle or another. So, this CI actually in practice, this is true. This CI are chosen from the data. I mean, people that do modeling oceans and waves and things like this, they take these CIs from real data and so say, they're not quite arbitrary, but let's say there are some factors. Are some vectors, some vector fields in the case of mapistics? Okay, so much for the motivation. So there is the Lagrangian approach, where you just consider the action to be the Lagrangian. And there is the Klebsch approach. Now, when you are so essentially the Klebsch approach consisting in introducing not only the UNG, but another variable P. But another variable P, which is the tool of the tangent space of the group, and considering this extra term, so it's the Lagrangian plus this extra term here. That, well, let's say it's a constraint. You oblige the G dot to be the the the by the definition of the the g dot to be essentially driven by the velocity u. By the velocity U. Okay, so the first time I saw this, and the second, and the third, and the fourth, I mean, every time I see this, I think about Pontryagin principles, maximum principles. And for me, it's still the same spirit of the Pontriagian maximum principle. But the fact that you use these kinds of variables in Lie groups and many. And manifolds and so on turn out to be that, I mean, explain the reason why people call this the Klebsch variational principle, but it's sort of a variational principle with KLEPS variables. Okay, I tried to see exactly why they call it like this. I'm not so sure, but I think that's because it uses KLEPS variables on some principle, but the principle is used in other. Is used in other situations like Pontriac. So we are going to use these kind of things. We are going to consider our configuration space now to be a finite dimensional REM manifold. So the manifold will be called Q. And then you have a Lie algebra that acts on the, so you have a sort of a representation. You have a Lie algebra that acts on Algebra that acts on Q, so that means that you have a nomiomorphism, so it's invertible that goes from the Lie algebra to the vector fields on Q and back. So each time you have a Lie algebra element U, the corresponding vector field on the manifold will be called U. u underscore q and you can write it in in terms of local coordinates on the manifold or you can use a basis on your Lie group and write it like like that. I can't point it. Actually I have a machine that can be plugged here and to point, but well it will take time to plug it. So this UQ So this UQ is the vector field associated with the element of the Lie algebra U, and it can be written in the basis A alpha, U alpha, and then in coordinates of the manifold I. So alpha goes from whatever, from the one to R. R will be the indices in the Lie algebra and I and G will be the indices. And G will be the indices in the manifold. So, in short, you have a representation of your vector fields on the manifold in terms of a Lieutenant. And I won't consider any sort of regularity issues here, just explain the ideas. So, everything will be smooth, Q will be compact, and again, no boundary because that complicates. Well, at least for me, it complicates. Well, at least for me, it complicates a little bit things when you consider the boundary. So, what is the action now? It's the start. So, I wrote it down here to give the idea in the deterministic case. And it's the Lagrangian plus, the Lagrange multiplier term that is associated to a new variable p. And so, if you want to go stochastic, you do it. You want to go stochastic, you do exactly the same. Okay. The Lagrangian plus, but now, but now instead of having P, instead of having the dot Q, you have the stochastic equation satisfied by the Q. So the Q is something that lives on a manifold that will describe your Describe your particles or your motion and it will satisfy a stochastic equation, which is a stochastic differential equation with drift u and with a random perturbation determined by this Lie algebra elements q c k and there is a q missing after the c k. So it's also a representation on the q. Okay. U. Okay. So L the Lagrangian, U the element of the Lie algebra, PQ is the new variable, and so on. So now I'm writing dx, the stochastic term that drives all things. And the theorem goes like this: so the critical path. critical the critical path of the stochastic uh the stochastic uh uh actions functional which is is written above annabella just a quick clarification um bruce was asking have we gone to the one-dimensional torus now no no i'm not going to the one-dimensional torus i'm going to well i'm rotated with a general q but q has to be compact Q, but Q has to be compact because otherwise I have problems in the proofs. And I didn't consider any boundary. So, well, of course, it can be a sphere, it can be something like this. In particular, it can be the torus, but I'm assuming Q to be a finite-dimensional, smooth, Riemannian, manifold, compact. I think it's my mistake. All the It's my mistake. All the spatial integrals are built into the function little l. Sorry? I think there must be some spatial integrals built into things like the function little l I mean, u of t is a vector field, time-dependent vector field. Is that correct? So u of t is an element of the Lie Algera. Okay. And Q is an element of the manifold. And the P is an element. And the P is an element of the dual of the tangent space of the manifold. Okay, and I can go from the Lie algebra to the Lie algebra to the vector fields on the manifold through this representation and back. Did I answer the question? Okay, I think we're back to a finite dimensional setting and we're doing practical. No, yeah, yeah, it's a finite dimensional setting. No, yeah, yeah, it's a finite dimensional thing. Now you can write it formally in an infinite-dimensional framework, but uh, but then that I wouldn't write a theorem, right? Because I would have some questions on the proofs. Okay, so now let's see. So dx is this element, I mean the stochastic differentiation that we are dealing with. And the theorem says that the critical part. And the theorem says that the critical paths, when we assume that Q of zero and Q of t are fixed, okay, are solution of this equation. So I have to stop a little bit here. Stop. Because this is one possible formulation, then I have a corollary that you might, maybe, maybe I come to the corollary first because it looks much, much closer to the. Closer to the first equations that are written in the deterministic case. So, if you remember the Euler-Pancari equations, so here we have exactly a generalization of those equations. So, dt dl du, now dt is a stochastic differentiation, of course, is eight star dl du. But of course, here now you don't have in underscore, you don't have. Um, in underscore, you don't have only the u, but you have the all uh the all uh the drift plus the martingale part. So, and then the LDQ in case the Lagrangian depends also on Q term. So, the corollary says exactly what the it says that the equations of motion in the perturbed case using the straton of each perturbation is. Of each perturbation is exactly what you should expect to be if you plug in some stochastics in the Le Poincaré equations in the first place, the deterministic ones. So this is written in terms just as I said, as I wrote them before, in terms like the Poincaré equation with the eight star operator and so on. Star operator and so on. The theorem, at least in the form that we proved it, goes like this. So M here is DLDU, just to be short. And the equations can be written also in terms of a Poisson bracket like this. So it's just another way to see them. But if you want to get close to the Euler-Point Carrie approach, then you get to Approach, then you get to the corollary. And the dq, the q will satisfy. So this equation, the first equation is for the u. So this is the equation for the velocity, equation of motion. And then you have an equation for the trajectory, q, and then also an equation for the p, the variable p yes, okay, which is not. Um which is not extremely important, but it's just that you use it in the proofs. But anyway, this is less important because it's an extra variable that you plug in here to use this claps or Pontreagin or whatever you want to call it. So now I have some slides with proofs, but essentially the proofs are done in coordinates and you may ask at the end the At the end, the important question, but I will ask it for you. Because in the proof, what you do is simply calculating in coordinates, right? So you make variations in the action functional, nice variations. View of P and of Q, which are your three variables that you have in the action functional. Fixed, so this is in order to keep the fixed. Is in order to keep the fixed initial and final point fixed. And when you just do the computation, you get equations. I mean, of course, it's a lot of writing for, and nobody can follow this in two or three minutes. So I'm going a little bit fast. So you make a variation of u, you get one equation, you get the variation of p, you get another equation, and you get. Another equation, and you get, and you make a variation of q, and you get the equation for dp. And then you plug into to you plug in the three equations to arrive to the equations for of motion, which everything is stochastic differential equations, as you have noticed. The equations for the LDU. So, the LDU, you already know that's PA because of it, and then you consider You consider, so this is the differential of a product in terms of stratona, which it goes like the usual differential calculus, the standard differential calculus. And then you substitute by all the things that you have here, and okay, and you have the equation at the end. So, of course, this you have to do it calmly, but there's nothing else here than computation in coordinates. Computation in coordinates, just computing. Now, now there is the major question, okay? So, if you maybe if you are a physicist, you probably get satisfied with this, but we are not. So, we next question is: Okay, so these are the other questions, the other questions for the QDMP, but now question. But now, question. How do you justify this computation in coordinates? After all, what you are varying here are paths, right? Our continuous paths endowed with a measure, which is a measure of the process, is the stochastic process. It's not only Brownian motion, it's Brownian motion with some coefficients and some drift, but you have some stochastic process. And what you are considering here. And what you are considering here is variations of stochastic processes of paths with a measure, right? Path space. We are doing variations in the path space. So how the hell do you do this in coordinates like everything is finite dimensional and there's nothing else? So, I mean, you can do it, but how you justify that's independent of coordinates and so on. So, the way I have done it, of course, we Have done it, of course. We have done it. Of course, there is probably another way is that it's proving that everything is independent of coordinates, but it's probably, well, I don't know. It's if it's more difficult. I didn't try actually. Anyway, I didn't try for long. So it's using Mali-Van Calculus on manifolds. So this is a way to justify the computations that we have done here. We have done here. So, you have a functional, your Lagrangian, your action functional is defined on path spaces that of stochastic process, which verify some stochastic differential equations. You want to make variation of the path and you want to justify that the computations can be done. So, we use a global chart approach developed a few years ago, again, some years ago. Again, some years ago, I'm not specifying years here, who counts, and where the works of Bruce have been fundamental to develop all this kind of machinery. So let me recall a little bit what happens in the case of Malia Van Calcus, which is a calculus to do very To do variations for paths, right? In the path space, in the Euclidean setting, and then go to a manifold. So in the Euclidean setting, you just have paths with values in Rn. Let's say that you have a pin Brownian motion because here, as you remember in the action, I wanted to fix the final and the initial and also the final points of the trajectory. Sorry, I'm having the sunshine. I having the sunshine in front of me. Oh, I have. Okay, that's better now. So we consider the pin Brownian motion to be analogous, but in the flat case. And then you have this Cameron-Martin space, which the tangent space, natural tangent space associate. That's where you make your variations that are defined like here. And this Cameron-Martin space as Martin space, as most of you certainly know, are the bounded variation paths here with the which are zero at the initial and at the final point of the interval. So in particular, this derivative can be written like this when the function f is smooth, right? And this can be extended to a semi-martingal. And you can take this definition, you can derivate some function in the direction of a semi-martingale by doing exactly this kind of sum. I'm using Einstein convention, right? I'm summing indices which are low and up. Now, this is in the flat case. I'm just recalling you what is the derivative, and if you are in a remote. Derivative, and if you are in a Riemannian setting, which we are, if we suppose that our, in P, our metric, which is written here in these two lines, so you have a coordinate expression, or it's written in terms of the representation with respect to the Lie algebra, and it is associated to the size, which I recall are the coefficients. Are the coefficients, diffusion coefficients of our class? So the diffusion coefficients, the vectors which are in the diffusion coefficients determine the metric and you want to have a non-generate metric. So you start from this assumption and then you have the whole geometry around. And your paths are, I wrote them again, are written in terms of this stochastic differential equation. Of this stochastic differential equation here. So the Ci C k's are the Lie algebra elements read in the representation of the manifold. U d of T is an element of the Lie algebra read in the representation of the manifold. So you consider the path space of this Riemannian manifold with the law of this process. Now, do you, I recall. I recall, U is not fixed actually, because U is what you want. U is a solution of your Euler-Poincari equation at the end. So you said a variational principle tells you that some action functional is some path is critical for the action functional if and only if u, so psi are fixed. So ψ are fixed, you will be satisfied by some equations of motion. So actually, you are considering a path space with many u's. So you have to assume that u's are very nice so that all these measures are absolutely continuous with respect to each other. But still, you consider the bus phase for this process. Then you know that from already from Ito that From Ito, that you can parallel transport over paths, over paths, over stochastic paths. And with this, you can define a NITO map that transport the things from the path space on the manifold to the sparse space on Rn, on the initial tangent space that you sort of identified with Rn. So you can transport all these structures to All these structures as a sort of a global chart to the flat path space. And so it gives you a way to define Maliathan derivatives for the case of manifolds to path space, manifold value paths, which is defined here, but okay, so you don't have to worry much about this. So you have derivative function. So you have derivatives of functions, derivatives of vector fields. And the main thing is that if you have a functional on the path space of the manifold, through these i functions, through this parallel transport application, you can derivate functions on the path space and consider them through this isomorphism i. I with, I mean, if you want to derivate in the path space of a manifold, you can pull the structure back to the path space on the flat case derivating with respect to some other process, which has to include a Ricci term and since I have a drift U, another term which is not B, it's U. Well, okay, the B is equal. Okay, the B is equal to U. I'm sorry. Anyway, the idea is that you can derivate on path space of the manifold, which I recall you had was what I wanted to do in the first place, that we did a little in coordinates. And you transport all the structure to the flat path space and this. And this amounts to consider a deformation term when you go back to the Euclidean path space. But still, you can do things and you can do back and forth. So variations Z, let's say, on the path space of the manifold Q in this ethoglobal chart correspond to variations with respect to some semi-martingale on the path space of the flat space. Space and these variations are related with each other through this equation. So they are deformed, in the flat case, they are deformed by the Ricci term and by some derivation of the drift. The map can be inverted, so you can go back and forth, and so you can have arbitrary variation. So that's the whole business. Is that also made here the remark. Also, made here the remark that you is not fixed for our purpose, but one has to consider assumptions on you such that all the laws of the process within drift you will be absolutely continuous with respect some fixed law, say, of the Brownian motion. Of the Brownian motion with the Xi-Chi's vector fields in front. But anyway, so they are absolute continuity with respect to each other. Absolute continuity with respect to each other. And so the final conclusion is that if you go, if you use Malia van Calculus on the manifold, and if you use all this machinery that is there around for some time, then you can justify the variations of path that you did before. Because you are allowed to get any variation on the path space going back to the Going back to the flat case. So, actually, so this is one of the reasons why I decided to speak about this now. It's this work that I have been talking about is not completely new. It has two years or two years and a half, but it's and let's say that CLAPS. And let's say that KLEPS variational principles, so that these ones with the which are not strictly Lagrangian, are not even my favorite ones, and I can even explain you why. But the point is that there are not so many, as far as I know, there are not so many applications of outside probability, let's say, outside theoretical probability. There are not so many applications of the variations of the Malay-Van calculus and all these structures in the path space of a manifold, so in curved spaces, to concrete examples. In as much as a concrete example, this can be taken for, but there are not so many applications outside probability itself. So I find it nice to use this machine. To use this machinery in something which has to do with mechanics and eventually with applications to other fields like aerodynamics. So, okay, so I wrote down the equation in E2 form because I had only written, so M, remember, is dLDU. So if you only have the kinetic energy, M will just be U, the velocity. And then if And then, if you write the contraction terms, so if you write all the equations that I wrote before in Stratanovich, now in Ito, then you have a double bracket here. Or in the other form, you have a second-order operator, which is an 8 star, 8 star, 8 star. Now, I'm going to ask you a question. In case you have seen this operator before, H star, H star, please let me know. Because the thing is that it's not so, of course it depends on the size, that's for sure. But if you have some size that determines some metric and then you compute the Levitic Vita, sorry, you compute Sorry, you compute the RAM operator, it's not exactly equal to this one. When you do the computation, it looks like you are going to arrive to the RAM watch, but it's not. So I had never seen it before, but people in geometric mechanics say this is a very well-known operator. So maybe so. If people in probability have seen this operator, In probability, have seen this operator before? Well, I'd like to know because I hadn't anyway. Okay, so I'm almost finishing. Oh, I should be finishing now, right? It's at 50. So just very rapidly and without entering into details, you can go from this Lagrangian to an Hamiltonian through user. Through a usual Legendre transform, but stochastic, and you have the equations written in terms of the Hamiltonian. Okay, and the other thing that I would like to notice that among many other properties, you have this Casimir functions, which are functions that verify this condition and are invariant of motion. Here, they are also invariant in the sense that the Also, invariant in the sense that differentials over the stochastic paths are zero. In particular, one invariant quantity is the inner product and the norm, the norm. So if you have the norm, having the norm as an invariant of this stochastic motion, you can prove that there exists a probability, an invariant probability measure for the motion and that the Measure for the motion and that the measure disintegrates along the level sets of the norm, and so on. So on. So then there are many other properties, but I think I'm going to stop here. I wrote the Comograph equations, but okay. I just thank you for attention and give the reference, which is I said it's not so new, but again, I chose this topic because we have used heavily probability on past. Uh, heavily probability on past basis to the developed basis. Thank you for your attention. Maybe we can thank Annabella for her. And maybe if there are a couple of questions, we can take those before the break. David Elworthy.
