I just won't look at the Zoom dialogue box. That seems to be working. Yes. Well, thank you to the organizers for giving me the opportunity to present here. I am here from the Ring Monty Lab. I'm on it, as I said. Yeah, unfortunately, Padmeati couldn't be here, so you had to open with me instead. But hopefully, you'll enjoy still hearing about her stuff. Yeah, so basically. Yeah, so basically, I want to somewhat build off of some of what Anatita was talking about, in this case, really thinking about simulating bulk surface reactions in cell geometries. And so this is kind of a little of a teaser about what some of our simulations could look like, especially if we're looking at calcium dynamics in realistic cell geometries. But I want to start out talking about measures just a little bit. Talking about meshes just a little bit, which you already heard about today, of course. And there is a big effort in our lab to kind of develop some meshing framework for realistic cell geometry. So basically, starting with some electron micrographs and then eventually getting into some usable mesh for simulations, right? So this was work from Chris Lee and others in the lab before I came in. Basically, they developed a software game. Basically, they developed a software Gamer2 that allows you to preserve geometrical features that can include structures inside the cell as well. So the yellow here is the endoplasmic reticon inside of a dendritic spine, which is a small region of a neuron that we'll go into in a little bit. But essentially, if you just built a mesh on this, you could end up with something with all these distorted elements and such, which could definitely cause problems with the finite element simulations. But once you go through, But once you go through some conditioning, you can end up with something looking much smoother and allowing you to run different tests on it. And this is kind of an example of what it would look like embedded in the block electron microscopy here. So, yeah, you have to do a lot of work to actually get this information out from these images. But I do love this visualization. You can see the entire ER in there and everything. You can see the entire ER in there and everything. But yeah, I'm not going to talk about the actual meshing software today. I'm going to talk about our next step, which is really using these meshes to then do reaction transport simulations in these cell geometries. So we're able to start with some network of cell geometries, perhaps like ER as shown here, and then using our software, we're able to simulate the reaction diffusion. The reaction diffusion dynamics in these cell bodies. And we called our software spatial algorithms, spatial modeling algorithms for reaction and transport. See, alright, I messed it up here. Which, if you put it correctly, then it's smart. I feel this is ironic. Very well. But that's what it is. So basically, we're using finite elements. We're using finite elements to solve these reaction transport networks in 3D. It could also be in 2D, but I'll show some 3D examples today. So first I'm just going to give a brief overview of the equations that are involved in this and some of the techniques we're using to solve these systems, and then go over a couple of kind of applied examples. First, with calcium dynamics and generic spines, and then with calcium dynamics at more of the whole cell level at each side, as we. More of the whole cell level inside a specific type of neuron called Murkinjean bones. So the equations will luckily look familiar because they're basically a simplified form from what Anatito was showing earlier because now we don't have any movement of these cell boundaries, right? In our simplest treatment of it. It'd be nice to add that eventually. So first we could consider maybe a cell body surrounded by some platinum membrane and By some cloudy membrane, and the site is all with the interior here. So the boundary label gamma, the volume label omega, and we have some species, chemical species associated with the volume, which we label u, and chemical species that can live on the surface, which we label v. However, there's a little bit extra complexity in most of the simulations we test in that we can also have other embedded surfaces and volumes within this cell. So you can think of this. Cell. So you can think of this as some organelle, maybe the mitochondria or the endoplasmic reticulum. And these organelles will also have surfaces, which are their membranes, and also the interior of the organelles. And once again, we have some volume species, U, and some surface species, V living there. So there can be quite a few different coupled equations depending on what sort of. Depending on what sort of reaction network you're looking at. And so to form the actual equations, if we just consider one single species, one single volumetric species here, in the simplest case, we would have some diffusion of the species and some reactions within the volume, which will of course depend on the context that we're talking about here. And so this could involve some mixture of other, not just this. Not just this given species, but all of the species that are in that volume, right? And in general, could be highly non-linear. Of course, we also have boundary conditions. So, if we were considering the species inside the ER, then we would consider the boundary as the membrane of the ER. So the diffusive flux has to be balanced out by some sort of surface reactions that are occurring between volume species and surface species. And then finally, we could also think about the surface species themselves. The surface species themselves and how they're evolving over time. Just as Anatita was showing us, we can have some diffusion of species on the surface, and we can also have reactions of species on the surface. And then when we consider all of these things with all of the species, we have an entire couple mixed-dimensional network of partial differential equations that we need to solve. And so the way that we actually do this is using the finite element method. So I don't have to show the gory details. So I don't need to show the gory details. Basically, we just need to get some variational form associated with each of these PEs. I'm just labeling capital F associated with the volumetric species, capital G associated with the surface species. And once you sum all of these together, you have an entire single monolithic formulation, is what we term it. And so we just solve this all in one pass, basically. Easy enough, right? So we assemble this nonlinear finite element system using the finite element software Phoenix in Python that some of our collaborators also work on, so that helps us out. And we solve this system using Newton-Ratz iterations. And ideally, see some pretty interesting dynamics. So, yes. For the kinetics, do you have mass conservation by any chance? Do we have what? Mass conservation. Mass conservation, yes. Mass conservation, yes. Well, yeah, it depends on the context, right? But usually there will be some simplifications from the mass conservation. So, yeah, we could have some, we could have two different forms of the species that are in cytosol or something, and we only need to treat one of them, right? So, we usually consider that, yeah, well, we always consider that we can. Okay, so now we get to look at some interesting suggestions. So, basically, I already mentioned these dendritic spines, right? You may or may not know what these are. I didn't really until a year ago until I started working on these things. This is kind of a typical cartoon drawing of a neuron that you might see. They have this really interesting geometry, right? They have all these different extensions that they send out an axon where they're maybe sending away. An axon where they're maybe sending away some signals to other neurons, and they have dendrites where they're receiving signals from other neurons. And along these dendrites, they have these bulbous protrusions referred to as dendritic spines. So that's where they're receiving signals from some axon of another neuron. And based on the signal that they receive and what goes on in these little dendric spines, that will determine the action potential is going to fire, what sort of signal the neuron is going to send out. The neuron is going to send out. And so, if we zoom in on a single dendritic spine, we're really interested in the calcium dynamics within here, because it's pretty much the most important second messenger that you have in these neurons-dendering spines. So, this was one instance of a model that was used for a previous grad student in the lab, Marianne Bell, and she considered an influx of calcium through the plasma membrane, both due to. Both due to the NMDA receptors and also voltage-sensitive calcium channels. The NMDA receptors are concentrated in postsynaptic density, or the PSE, which is a region around the plasma membrane shown here. VSCCs are kind of all around the periphery. And we also have calcium exiting the cytosol either by getting pumped out through the plasma membrane or pumping into the spine apparatus. The spine apparatus, which is secretly just a special type of endoplasmic reticulum that's in the dendritic spines. So lots of terms, but the basic idea is again some calcium coming in, some getting pumped into here, some getting pumped out, right? So kind of a natural case for us to treat using this framework. And nice enough to start with some simplified geometries, right? Might as well consider kind of sphere-hook-cow mindset first. So we have a sphere. So we have a sphere in a sphere where the inner sphere is representing the spine apparatus or an ellipsoid in an ellipsoid. And importantly, the volume of these compartments doesn't change between these two. So when I'm changing these shapes, I'm just changing the surface area to volume ratio. Basically, just adding surface area. So we add some stimulus, simulate calcium dynamics, goes up, goes down, goes into the spine apparatus. The same sort of thing will happen for the Of thing will happen for the ellipsoidal shape, but the dynamics are different, which you may or may not be able to notice when I play those together. One thing that happens is that the one on the right actually does go down a little bit faster, which is hard to tell. But we can also plot it out. And so what you see is a higher peak for the ellipsoid in the ellipsoid. You also see a faster decay of the calcium. And this can be explained by the change in surface area volume ratio, right? You have more surface area of. Great. You have more surface area of plasma membrane, allowing for increased entry of calcium into the cell for this higher elevation. And you also have increased surface area to volume ratio for the spine apparatus to the cytosol. So you have more calcium getting pumped back into the spine apparatus, more calcium getting pumped back out through the plasma membrane. And so this is kind of the basic idea and one of the main points of one of the previous papers from the lab. Things get really interesting if we look at a real Really interesting if we look at a realistic geometry of a deutritic spine, which is shown here. The regions marked in red are the postsynaptic density, which is where these NMDA receptors are concentrated. And if we cut this open, we could see the spine apparatus inside, which is this ER structure, right? So we run the same exact model, but now over this complicated geometry, have elevation in the head and calcium repackaging into the spine apparatus. Into the spine apparatus over time. We can plot these out and kind of just get some idea. So, as calcium is going down in the cytosol, it's going back up in the spine apparatus by a little bit. But we can really get some insights if we run a geometry where we have multiple spines, right? So this is one geometry where we condition the mesh using gamer two for a section of the dendrite that has two dendritic spines. Again, Spines. Again, postsynaptic density is in red, and the spine apparatus/slash ER is shown in the interior here. One thing to appreciate, which you can kind of see here, is in spine one, there's a higher amount of spine apparatus compared to in spine two, which basically manifests as a higher surface area to volume ratio in the spine. So, if we play the simulation, it goes kind of fast. It goes kind of fast, but one thing that I saw from staring at it a couple times was that the calcium stays elevated longer than the one with the lower surface area to volume ratio, which is exactly what you might expect. And it's what's shown if I just plot this over time, right? So in spine one, where we have more spine apparatus, we get faster repackaging of the calcium back into this spine where the cytosolic volumes are where the column is. Volumes where the spine apparatus to cytosol ratio is the highest, right? So we're still doing some ongoing simulations and geometries like this from spines, but I want to kind of branch out into a more involved case, because you may or may not know the ER is not just kind of a passive sink for calcium, right? But in reality, calcium is dynamically exiting the ER under certain circumstances. The ER under certain circumstances. In the case of neurons, we're mainly thinking about calcium exiting the ER through the IP3 receptor or through the ryanitine receptor. The IP3 receptor is dependent on the production of this second messenger, IP3, leading to its opening and calcium released into the cytosol. And in both cases of IP3 receptor and rye ending receptor, we have this interesting positive feedback. Positive feedback. So, what that is, is that we have increased calcium leads to increased opening of these channels, which then increases calcium leading to increased opening of the channels, so on and so forth. There's negative feedback eventually that kind of keeps this system from entirely blowing up, but this manifests as some sort of large burst in calcium that will occur locally. So, things can definitely get really interesting, especially with all this positive feedback. Especially with all this positive feedback and complicated geometries. And we wanted to apply this to a larger system. Let's see what it looks like. So, this was a separate project that's more at the wholesale level. Could you comment? So, are you able to derive the reaction network by chemistry for this? Yes, so that's a lot of, so there's been a lot of work going into that, right? And based on previous papers, we've used. Based on previous papers, we pieced together a model including all of this, which I think is like 21 different chemical species or something, which is still quite simplified from what actually happens. And a lot of those reaction rates are measured experimentally. Some just have to be determined from fitting the model, stuff like this, but it's a big challenge, right? And you fit this model into your framework that you have. Yeah. For the outside is time. Yeah. Boxer is tight. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, our framework extends to as many species as we want to have. Yeah. What are some of the ways that you're supporting it? So, well, some of the ways that you're... What are maybe like the top three ways that would make the most impact, but you haven't included any model? Okay, yeah. Well, one that comes to mind is there's calcium buffering that appears. Is there's calcium buffering that occurs in the ER, and we use a rapid buffering approximation, just assuming that it occurs instantaneously, which then automatically eliminates the species. We do some simplifications with buffering and cytosol, but it's not as simplified. Mass conservation is obvious. The receptor kinetics is is somewhat simplified as well, because people have spent a lot of time developing models of the IP3 receptor and the Ryan D receptor, you know. In the right end game restructured in terms of like each single like the like you get one markup model for each single exactly yeah so but what about the local concentration or concentration gradients how does that come in so well the opening rate of these in this case is just depending on the local concentration of well IP3 and also calcium right and then the flux depends on the gradient and calcium I do spatially yeah and you're spatially representing fine Yeah, and you're spatially representing fine enough the local count like the spatial calcium concentration? Well, it's represented everywhere in the finite elements, right? So it has a continuous representation. They're linear elements, right? So it depends on the metrofine, but the above radiate terms. Yes. You mean in the representation for these receptors? Right, the gradient. So that takes care of the expression. So that exterior gradients yeah there's concentration gradients, yeah. Yeah, and these and these species are also continuously represented on the membrane as well. It's not like single instances of them or something like that. And I guess I should mention it's also kind of a limitation in some ways because if you start to zoom in on the system too much, it no longer makes sense to just do it. It no longer makes sense to just do a continuum model, especially like in a dendritic spine, for instance. This is like a sub-micron structure, right? And for that reason, in our lab, there's also been a good amount of effort for doing stochastic simulations within these geometries as well. And then try to compare the two to see what the differences are. Yeah. Okay. So this is the exciting part because we have these really interesting geometries. Because we have these really interesting geometries from collaboration with the Ellisman Lab at UC San Diego. And these images were taken of mouse Turkinjee neurons. And that's a particular type of neuron that's in the cerebellum. It's important for motor activity. And basically what they were able to do is segment the ER in these geometries. They used some machine learning-based approach and lots of manual corrections to eventually get something like this. To eventually get something like this, right, and come out with some sort of VR characterization of the body. I wasn't involved with it, but I imagine many, many hours. And so basically they did some quantitative characterization for the overall trends in, again, in cell body. And so what you see here also includes the mitochondria, but for our sake, we'll just talk about the ER. The ER is most concentrated close to the plasma membrane, actually. Close to the plasma net brain, actually. As you can see from this blue curve here, there's a peak in the volume fraction that occurs within about 100 nanometers. The other thing that they really pointed out is that most of the ER that's close to the plasma membrane is parallel to the plasma membrane rather than perpendicular. And so we're naturally kind of curious what sort of implications this would have for reaction diffusion in this network. And so wanted to model. And so I wanted to model. So I already kind of popped up the image of this model, right? This was based on a previously developed model from this 2005 paper, but we added some additional things onto it and also had to convert it to a spatial model of determined diffusion coefficients and stuff like this. Overall, actually, 26 species. Yeah, so 21 on the surfaces, 5 in the volumes. And the other thing I'll mention is that all of the ones. All the ones on the surfaces in this case are not diffusible. So it's only the volumetric species that are diffusing. But our framework fully supports surface diffusion as well. So the inputs that we put into the system are calcium influx and some glutamate input. So this was kind of meant to mimic some physiological situation in this other paper. And it consists of five different pulses. It consists of five different pulses of calcium and glutamate, and then one larger pulse of calcium eventually. So these are just things we put into the system. When you see the simulations, those are the inputs that we'll hear. And so this is the instance of the geometry that we actually used from electron microscopy. They were able to segment this into ER and cytosol, and the resulting mesh was conditioned using our software, Gamer2, to give you an idea of the 2. Give you an idea of the size of the mesh. It's about 62 million tetrahedral elements, like 10 million points in the total geometry. That's pretty large. But provided we have enough memory and enough time, we can run the simulation. I think it took about three to four weeks to run the entire extent of this, which could be sped up in some cases, and it's not super bad, but you have to have patience, I suppose. But you have to have patience, I suppose. One cool thing about this is we couldn't necessarily predict what the dynamics would look like ahead of time. This is so complicated, there's so many little pieces of VR inside this body and everything. And so it's something where you just kind of have to run it and see what happens. The IP3 dynamics are not surprising. They come. Okay. So IP3 is produced at the plasma membrane, and that's this boundary here. So that's why you see just incoming. Here, so that's why you see just incoming waves of IP3 sweeping through the cytosol. This back boundary, I think I forgot to mention, is where the nucleus would reside, and it's just not included in our simulations in this case. It's a no-flux boundary. So IP3 just keeps going up over time, but nothing entirely surprising there. The calcium dynamics, on the other hand, this will come pretty fast, so I'll probably play it a couple times. But if you look on the right, we have these pulses of calcium, and then eventually leading to this release of And then eventually leading to this release events throughout the cell that come fast for the early events and then slower later on as it gets extended throughout the cytosol. So you can kind of see these really cool traveling waves across there. And you can see the individual calcium release events from regions of the endoplasmic particularly, which is pretty fun. I'll go ahead and play that from the beginning too. Is that wave affected by how the color scheme is kind of diverging a bit? Like how there seems to be this sort of There seems to be like this sort of well, yeah, so that highlights the wave front, right? And actually, it's very exaggerated because of the transparency or yeah, of the color map that we used in this case, right? So it was intentionally built to see these wavefronts, but they're real wavefronts because these are clusters. It's content much at some arbitrary level. Right, right. Yeah. So the grad student who originally worked on this project had some color map that he probably tried a bunch of times, and I was like, oh, this looks pretty good, so I'm going to keep using it. But yeah, visual. But yeah, visualization gets to be kind of difficult in this case, right? Yeah, but I'll go ahead and play this one more time, put both of them together, just for full treatment here. My favorite part is the release back here, because it's so surprising. Yes? Also, could you comment about the experimental observations? Are these traveling waste observed experimentally? Well, people definitely see calcium waste. See calcium waves in experiments, right? I don't think people have observed them in this type of neuron or anything specifically. And unfortunately, they didn't look at this in the experiments. Or in the our collaborators weren't looking at the calcium dynamics in their experiments. They just characterized the localization of the ER and stuff. So I would be interested to specifically kind of look to relate the To relate the traveling waves to the geometry in experiments. This would be quite interesting. We have observed some in some, I think, cancer cells, I cannot remember exactly, but contracted where you have traveled in webs, passes, molecular, small periodic pulses of CAF, ROW, and myosin as molecular species. But this would be quite interesting to see. Yeah, I mean people I know probably the most popular literature on calcium-laying is like cardiomyocytes, yes. And I'm not as familiar with the literature in neurons, which I should probably look into more. But it would be nice to get some direct experiments kind of looking for something like this and comparing it to simulations, right? So yeah, I think that would be a definite kind of next step in this. Follow up on that question. How do you how would you How would you start validating such models in the first place? Reaction crate, yes, they've been found from experiments, but usually they've done paralyzed things you need to get back to just sort of prevent explosion. Well, that's kind of, I mean, it's a very fair point, but it's also kind of the cool aspect of this. So we kind of know all the relationships, but we don't. Know all the relationships, but we don't know what's going to happen if you plug it all into this, right? And this is, in some ways, a prediction, right? But how do you validate this? I think it's pretty difficult, right? Especially if you design like a white leather white leather experiment. You think, say, take cardiomyosins or something. Right, right. Or do the calcium flux experiment. Yeah. I mean, what I would want to see in that case is some imaging of the endoplasmic reticulum that you could also correlate with these calcium emergence events, but I'm not sure how feasible. Calculating the expense, but I'm not sure how feasible that is experimentally. You can do things with multiple sensors, so I'm sure you can figure out something. I haven't seen it. Yeah, it is your point. So I want to come up with this related question, right? When I heard your talk, I think, okay, there's a clue you got, oh, there's a real geometry of the thing. But let's say an important thing, let's use quite simple model, you simpler geometry, and you write down some uh OE PDE and you light your ray pigneur. And you like your rate, and the parameter maybe depends for them, but okay, that's a bunch of the surface of things. Okay, then notice much simpler problem, much less parameters. So then the question comes to, you know, essentially the question is, can you make some predictions? You see, because there's complex geometry, you'll make qualitatively different predictions, right? Some exponents, right? Scaling relations, some of them will be different. Yeah. Yeah. So we actually. Yeah, so we actually, yeah, I left it out because it's not as fun to look at right now, but we did a bunch of tests on much simpler geometries. It was the same model. We had also reduced forms of this model, but basically we just had a simple geometry of see I didn't organize my things now. Wait, sorry, I skipped past it. Oh, yeah, so this was kind of the Oh, yeah, so this was kind of the simpler geometry. This is just a cross-section. They were basically like rectangular sheets of ER. And so we just had like a rectangular block. And we tested just by varying the spacing between these sheets of ER, varying spacing between the ER and the plasma membrane, and varying the angle with respect to the plasma membrane. And so that was, I hope, to kind of more easily tease out some of the general principles of this. It was. This. It was the model itself isn't any simpler, but the geometry was big. And so we did learn some general lessons from that. Like, in general, well, unsurprisingly, putting these stacks closer together leads to more calcium because you have stronger positive feedback if everything's kind of packed tightly. And interestingly, we also saw that calcium really seems to be kind of optimal at either kind of parallel to the At either kind of parallel to the plasma membrane or perpendicular to the plasma membrane. And in this case, it kind of acts as a diffusional barrier, whereas in this case, it acts as kind of a track for reaction diffusion to occur along. Ah, dang it. I would not want to play. Oh, there it goes. Yeah, this one's actually kind of fun because you can see it kind of form this track so it kind of. Form this track so it kind of like protrudes further in with the calcium increase there. So we did a bunch of analysis of this to get the general principles, yeah. Is it possible to change your mesh on the fly as you were running yourself? Well, it's possible, but why? Because I'm wondering how much the organelle of your organization is important for results use. Because in this time scale, for instance, mitochondria can have a drastic change in the change. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that would be, that's a very great next step. It gets to be very difficult, right? Now you have to couple. Well, you can, if you prescribe the changes in geometry, it's more doable. All the fusion and features on the right of one on that word. Right, right. That's it's difficult. But that's definitely something we need to do. The movement into account in your model could be very good. Yeah, it it's doable, right? But it's a difficult computational task, I'm saying. In the interest of time, why don't you continue? Sorry for oh, that's okay. No, I mean I'm pretty much done, I think, with what I wanted to mention, because the main thing is that I need to show those cool videos. But let's see, okay, yeah. So I did try to tease out some general principles from these videos because this geometry is so complicated, so what can we make of it, right? Well, one thing is we can look Right? Well, one thing is we can look at the surface area to volume ratios throughout the cytosol of this cell and then kind of see how the calcium release events depend on the local surface area to volume ratios. And if we integrate the total calcium over time, so look at the calcium area under the curve, we do see that if you get higher surface area to volume ratios, you have a higher calcium area under the curve, which is indicative of kind of more calcium release events. And on the other hand, And on the other hand, if we look at the time that the calcium release from ER occurs, it occurs much earlier at these higher surface area devolving emissions. The more confusing bit is trying to think about the orientation of the ER with respect to the plasma membrane. And in that case, interestingly, we did see that when you get close to parallel to the plasma membrane, and actually I'll point out the blue curves here, because those are the ones that are close to the plasma membrane. That are close to the plasma membrane. If you're close to parallel, then you seem to have a higher area under the curve and also an earlier release time. So, this possibly indicates that the release of calcium from the ER is somehow optimized if you have orientation parallel to the plasma membrane, which would explain why maybe there's a higher abundance of parallel ER to the plasma membrane that's kind of reaching at that point. But it's interesting, and basically, that was. Interesting, and basically, that would be attributed to the fact that it's providing a diffusional barrier, allowing for higher calcium elevations in that region, leading to greater amounts of calcium loads. So, that's one current working hypothesis. Yeah, that was just a couple bits of summary here. So, basically, hopefully, you're convinced that using Gamer 2 also with SMART, we're able to look at some interesting phenomena. Some interesting phenomena by considering nonlinear reactions, surface volume coupling, and detailed geometries. And I'll mention that we have our code available and some examples online that you're interested in. And of course, I want to talk to anyone who's interested in it. It's something we want to apply quite a bit, and we'll be putting out more of a paper about it soon. So work out. Other than that, just want to acknowledge the people in the lab. Of course, Pat Mini. Of course, Pat Mini. We have a whole host of people right now. I mentioned Chris, who worked on a lot of meshing. Previous grad students, Justin, actually was the first one to start this code, SMART. And also, we have some collaborators at Simula Research Laboratory that are really helping us turn SMART into more of a usable software for general people in computational biology and also acknowledge our funding sources. So, thank you so much. Oh, I have an infrastructure question. So what's the difference you would say between your framework and say MCEL? Well, MCEL is stochastic, right? I think it can do both. That's what they claim. But VoiceThread Cell, for example, it does. Virtual cell does. Yeah, so Virtual Cell does the spatial model. Does the spatial model, right? They don't use finite elements, actually. So that's one very key difference. You don't have these same sort of tetrahedral measurements that you can use in those geometries. There's some sort of limitations in the exact resolution that you can get with those measurements as well. It's all finite volume. Yeah. Could I suppose they set heterogeneous distribution coefficients for the example? Fund it out all cost. Exactly, yeah. So you certainly could, right? We would just need the theoretical, experimental motivation to do so, right? It's sufficiently flexible to capture that. I was just wondering if you guys spoke with people in all digital headings. So you will not have such a resolution of the of the demritic spike, but you will see the way that cards will propagate. We'll see the way that calcium propagate in the electron. So we'll see whether the geometries are of importance. They are actually calcium binding dies and they are actually videos you find of calcium propagating down in place and doesn't look like trapping wave. Yeah. Not sure in the name. In dumb axons I've seen it's faster than the open genetic techniques. Yeah, well in the in the model that we have right now, I should mention we don't actually we don't actually We don't actually explicitly model the changes in voltage. We don't model the entire action potential and stuff like this. But we don't really directly collaborate with people in electrophysiology right now. But I think that would definitely be good. And I started to want to look at some other models, like calcium release units in cardiac cells and stuff like this. And then, yeah, anyway, it's a good idea. Definitely. Yeah, it's really interesting. Yeah, thanks. Very interesting. Very, very interesting. Can you, can you, or have you looked at, well, it appears that you have different time scales for the evolution of these travel waves. Would it be, have you looked at maybe time scale analysis to try to reduce some of these models and then probably have, I don't know, some simplified models that you can validate with your numerics? We haven't looked at that directly, but I should think about that more. That's really good. I mean, we do adaptive time-stepping, right? So we're not taking the same time steps. Yeah, I'm not thinking about the numerical method. I'm thinking about the time scales of the one between the two. You could write some simplified version that's more valid over the longer time scale. No, I should think about it. I wanted to express more. I wanted to, if there's more other question, I wanted to come back to Yanhua's question and ask. So, I think what he was asking was: is there something that the complicated geometry gives you that you would not see in a simplified model? Like, why do all this hard work if you're getting the same results? Right. Well, we don't get the same results. That's the interesting thing. So, whether or not it was a good idea to do, we did see something new. In that, we do see kind of And then we do see kind of different behavior that we plot out over here. And so, like, I did similar quantifications for that simplified geometry, but didn't see anything here like that. I think in these realistic geometries, you have very different kind of surface area to volume ratios, and that you have these convoluted networks, right, that just kind of inherently aren't captured. In the simplified geometries, you have kind of tighter. So you have kind of tighter feedback in that way. That's my intuitive way of looking at it, but I don't have like a good general answer to it. Instead of a simplified geometry, have you looked at homogenization, mathematical homogenization of the would make sense? Yeah. No, we haven't looked at that, but I'm only somewhat familiar with how we would go about that, so I should talk to you. Well, I'm not a specialist, but I didn't further. Well, I'm not a specialist, but I've heard of that, and I know it can be applied and derive some non-trivial results. But like, specifically, if you know, like, if we have some perpendicular or all directions, you're gonna get some different results from methods. I have a comment on the little type of thing. You're like, you know, when you have a complex geometry, then the effective fusion can be abnormal diffusion, right? That maintains a thing. Diffusion, right? That may take place, right? So if you go to simple geometry, you have to take your different equations, right, to have add up as of a normal diffusion. So I might have it. Okay, so you kind of consider some sort of anomalous diffusion or something over similar geometries. And then you could capture the same. Yeah, because you are you're you're a geometry, you're couple exactly. That gave you like the sub diffusion or whatever and you'll have like also coupled reactions, right? So couple. Right, so come quickly afterwards.
