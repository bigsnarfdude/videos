I hope it was a great one. So, I'm one of the oddballs here, and then I guess I'm at least all of you envision me as a biologist. But I will tell you when I go to biology meetings, they envision me as that quantitative person. So I fit nowhere and hopefully everywhere. So, oh, here. Okay, I don't know about this is I don't know why this is a matter of time. Yeah, it just works great. Maybe I have to escape or something. There we go. All right, so many of you have thought about DNA, and we had that wonderful talk with Simon about DNA, so you may be thinking about tiny bits of really cool DNA. But in fact, DNA can be thought of in many ways. In fact, DNA can be thought of in many, many ways. And at my college, Baylor College of Medicine, they were one of the first human genome sequencing centers. So pretty much all my colleagues do DNA this way, the code that codes for life. And so they don't think about structure and they don't think about other things that some of us might think about. And the gene-centric view is, well, DNA is just what provides us the proteins and enzymes that we might need. And there's always this really interesting fattening of the DNA. Fattening of the DNA. And if you think kind of more physically, like I do, it's like DNA doesn't get fatter in the part that encodes a gene. To, you know, the outside, it's all the same. So I could have a gene in the middle of that, it can be the rest of it. So this is a rather misleading depiction. And then an elastic medium is how a lot of physicists think of it, you know, exactly like this, where it behaves perfectly. And you can stretch it. When does it break? You can knot it and say, ooh, what knots break faster. Whatnot break faster when it's the DNA, and that's a perfectly valid way to think. And then there's the protein-centric view, and that's the view I grew up with. So I was an enzymologist. I worked on DNA topoisomerasis, and I'm only telling you that because we're going to return to that in the end. And those are the enzymes that change the topology of DNA in living cells. And so really, these kinds of models often depict DNA really as sort of something fun. Well, really, it's sort of something flat and straight, more like this, right? So it's got no bendability and no coil or anything. It's just these, you know, these rigid rods that the topoisomerases beat upon. So the topoi somerases have arms and legs and they grab one here and they pass it there. And that's very protein-centric because the DNA in this model is the passive participant being beat upon. And then, of course, most of us in the room. And then, of course, most of us in the room think of DNA as a topological entity. So we've reduce all that complexity that has got, you know, Paul that packing, that lovely density that Simon showed in his talk earlier. So you just reduce all that and the fact that it's a coil, you make these nice line drawings. They can be ribbons, it can be whatever you want, and we can make them make knots, and we can show consequences of knots, etc. So, where did this view of DNA come from? Of DNA comes from, and I think we all know, is it came from the early work that was using tiny little pieces of DNA? And they were looking at the diffraction pattern of these tiny little pieces. Well, of course, you can do really cool things when you put tiny pieces together that have all these really interesting properties. But in the real life cell, DNA never looks like this. Never. Not ever, unless you're dead or your cell has died. Or your cell has died. So when cells commit what's called apontosis, for example, when you have a heart attack, the cells around the heart attack all die. That DNA will look like this. But otherwise, no. So it's rather like the old viewing the elephant blind. So if you're only looking at this tiny little piece of the DNA, you're like, oh, it's a little rigid thing that's a helix, and it's perfect. But you miss all the rest of the elephant. So this was the original. Someone asked me to, where did those original data come from? So these are actual measured data points. It was really a tough experiment done in vivo in living E. coli, where we said how much underwining on this axis before you get a DNA reaction, in this case recombination. And Coya mentioned recombination. It's these two sites of the DNA have to come together before that wonderful. Together before that wonderful band surgery can really be done. And so along that bottom axis is: pretend this is a sealed circle, but you just say, how much unwinding do you do of this helix, and it will buckle all up about itself, and that's what's happening in this x-axis, do you need before that can happen? In this case, this is reformation. So this is where that threshold sort of model came from originally. Came from originally. And it's been repeated. The linking number really matters because you see that what are you doing in a circle, a closed loop, is that you're changing the linking number. This is minus one, minus two, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So this is no activity, and this is activity. So there's this threshold amount, and then it goes. So that tells you that you've got to have something other than what we know. Something other than what we know about that little piece of DNA that we have the perfect crystal structures for to living DNA. So all atomic structures, until the last slide, and most experiments have been done with either this or at best circular DNA. And in fact, any DNA reaction now, I mean, we started, like I said, with that seismic. I mean, we started, like I said, with that site-specific recombination. We've looked at topois summerase activity itself. So it's wild, the thing that changes topology requires topology. And initiation of replication and initiation of transcription. And these are big biological words that basically say living and dividing. So here is where for the organisms has been measured. We all maintain. We all maintain our linking number. So it's not really about linking number in this context because let's normalize it for the length of the whole genome. And it's kind of intuitive to think that it lives on the precipice between inactivity and activity with just a little bit of delta OK, just a little bit of change of linking number, and you can have a gene be off or to be on. And it's also maybe not surprising that for Not surprising that in the cells that have been measured in, for cancer cells or for rapidly dividing bacteria or viral infections, that DNA is beyond that homeostasis. And what is that but just uncontrolled growth? So we reason, if we can only understand the nature of this switch that's promoted by DNA underwinding or negative supracoi, then maybe we could, through different from poisons that we all have. Different from poisons that we all have to take for cancer treatments now. Try to tune it back to normality so that we wouldn't have this uncontrolled growth. So that was the motivation for some of the work that we did. And I think a few of you, I know Chris, you were there in the audience when we revealed this for the first time in Italy. We did set up simulations and these are all atomistic simulations and they just crammed out for years. Each of these For years. Each of these are in independent simulations. And the thing, so here's the relaxed DNA. The linking number is just exactly what that beautiful crystal structure would have predicted. And of course, nothing happens. So you can put all the forces that you want and nothing happens. So that's kind of a negative control. And it demonstrates to you why that's just not representative of the whole elephant. And when you underwind it, even just, we were so shocked by. Even just, we were so shocked by this. We didn't build any of this into our models. We didn't know anything. We just put what we knew about the parameters that we could measure. And a slight underwinding, and we got the bases to flip out. So we heard already from Simon's talk that those bases take up space. And the two rings versus the one ring, they take up different space. So DNA sequence will really matter, yes. By flip out, you mean instead of being like just trying to get the geometric picture, she might have. Just trying to get the geometric pictures. You might have known any thought. I have a drawing of it in a bit, but it's considered Pauline-like. Because remember, Linus Pauline, you know, there were some bad kind of assumptions, but he also had the intuition to say, well, how in the world can a protein come in and know a sequence when it's all buried in the phosphate background? And so if you have an alternative model where the bases are on the outside, well, you could then read the sequence, and there you go. And you could tell chemically that C is different from. Could tell chemically that C is different from A, different from G, etc. So, in this particular case, with the torsional strain, the bases will spontaneously, so they're all stacked around in the helix, going right up to 10.5 base pairs per turn, one will flip out. And in our movies, as we put more and more negative supercoiling in, so first the first one's flipped out, then the neighbor, I mean, sorry, their partner flipped out, so you've now got two hanging out bases, and then the neighbors on the other side. And then the neighbors on the other side. And of course, that was very site-specific. So not every base pairs really matter. Only certain sequences would do it. And what they did is that they would make a denaturation bubble. Now, I can really go into it, but in the biology textbooks, you might have read about these melding proteins that kind of open the DNA and whatever. So again, the enzymatic, protein-centric view of the world. View of the world. And this brought about the possibility that the DNA opens its own self-up at the supercalling that we all had evolved to have. And then now the proteins can just go in and start reading the code. So it's a little bit of a flip in the way of thinking. So fortunately, for 70 years of lots of great research, when you slightly overwind the DNA helix, it indeed acts like that elastic rod. acts like that elastic rod. But remember, we've evolved to keep our DNA around this negative supracline, even though transient when we do have positive supracline happening in living cells. At a very critical transition, the DNA turned itself inside out into this poly-like conformation where the rest of it became B-form and this was completely inside out. So all of these were unexpected. So, all of these were unexpected, and you know, we got lots of flags. Oh, does it happen in real DNA? Well, it took us, this is a long time ago, it took us a long time to test: does it happen in real DNA? But these simulations said, hey, the DNA sequence really matters. So this thing only happens at a certain sequence. These things happen only at a certain combination of sequences. Now, layered on top of that, so mathematicians love to reduce complexity. Physicists love complex complex complex complexity. Reduce complexity. Physicists love to reduce complexity, and I think biologists are defined by life is complex, we're comfortable with it, drive what you can, but here's real life. So here is what all of our DNA is really existing at. Again, it's not linear ever. It's never, certainly never this, right? And all DNA is looped. And some of these loops are as short as around 100 base pairs. They can be up to a couple of, like 10 kB. Of like 10 KB, but this is like going across the kingdoms of life. And what's really, really interesting, and something that was a puzzle for years and years, was, for example, this one is black repressor. Maybe you've heard of that. It's an old model that people were measuring in the old days to understand a lot about DNA. And they know that these certain sequences that you need supercooling to get the two together, that you cannot change the distance in little. The distance in the loop between those two things coming together. You just can't. And Mark Atrashi said, Oh, it's just phasing. We heard a little bit about that. If you're not a complete turn of the helix, there's going to be some puckering and some problem, and then things couldn't go maybe. So even accounting for phasing, you can't change the distance in those two sides. And there's many, many examples of that, enhancers, promoters, all these things in biology that totally matter. And you just can't mess with the system. You just can't mess with the system. Why not? It kind of doesn't make any sense. And we've got maybe an answer for that. So we had to make it. I put this back in because people always ask, how do you make it? So this, I'm reducing the complexity of the double helix into just the single line here to show that this is a supercoil plasmid. So we use, and here is COIA's band surgery, and it's even a coherent band surgery. So we use these two recombinations. So we use these two recombination sites, and then they perform the coherent band surgery. They go downhill. Absolute biological enzymes follow the downhill pain. Perfectly. I think it's astounding and kind of like unexplainable. Like one of the questions now is how do they do this? But anyway, they do this band surgery, and when they do that, this thing that wasn't caffeine makes the catenine. And so what we figured out how to do is we wait a moment, we let this other inside. We wait a moment, we let this other enzyme. There's another band surgery, and this enzyme will unlink those two to release, to give this thing which is big and floppy and you can't really do experiments with, and the tiny little DNA. Now, unintentionally, and following quite carefully the group from Ed Seaman's group, we've made a new kind of nanoparticle. And this one, we've conquered the scale. The scale. It's 99.999% pure, and that's some of the problems that they are having. And we are utilizing whatever we want to encode on this red bit to actually make new messages. So we have another dimension of functionality with our nanoparticles. So we're really paying attention to that field, and it's a kind of a new version of it with different issues, and it's kind of fun. Trying to find. So we started looking at those circles. What do they look like? We thought that might be the, you know, we all were talking about, you know, how important it is to look directly at what you're actually asking. And I depict here on knot because we love knots so much. But we used a technique called cryo electron tomography, and that is where you've got your little DNAs and you tilt the And you tilt the stage and keep taking shine in the beam through. Shine, shine, shine, shine. And so you can reconstruct with just a little bit of the misty dance because you can't turn the thing completely over. And so you can get really great 3D information on this. And it's good for specimens that adopt a wide variety of confirmation, which ours did. You didn't think they would. We thought we had made circles that were so small that if all the rules of DNA The rules of DNA had been true, then there would be no way that they could do anything but just barely exist there. Like we couldn't even put a water in there. This is what we expected, and that's what all the rules predicted. But in fact, and we've talked about this before, this is just going to be very fast, we saw all kinds of conformations depending on the supercoiling. So this is how pure each of our bands are. This is no supercoiling. This is plus one, plus two, plus three. Plus 1, plus 2, plus 3. Here's minus 1, minus 2, minus 3, minus 1. This one can go further. Why? Because it has this alternative for the base flipping and the denaturation, which means you can keep on cranking the thing. This doesn't have that as an option, so you can only limit. Even that gel was already a hint at what we found, which we weren't smart enough to put that together until we looked back. But anyway, look how broad the distribution of a Broad the distribution of a single band, this single band, is very broadly distributed. I'm not going to talk about this, it's published, it's old, but everything in yellow violated the rules that we knew about DNA based upon all the physics and all the other things that we had done, not we, the world. And I just show some of those as to why, and it was these really, really sharp bends. And how in the world can you get a molecule? How in the world can we get a molecule with a persistence length of 150 base pairs to bend? I mean, it doesn't want to bend. This thing wants to be an open ring as much as possible. So that, again, was some early support for the idea that that might be the point of base flipping. Because once you have a base out, you now have almost infinite flexibility around that. So this base flipping, even though this wasn't proof of base flipping, this was an early indicator. This was an early indication. But we went in with first, we had to really characterize these enzymes. There are these nucleases that will only clip when there's a base exposed. So what you're looking at this axis is how often was a base exposed? A single base. So you look at the supercovin level. In this case, we're going negative in this direction. So no bases are exposed, no bases are exposed. They're never exposed in a relaxed DNA on this latency. In a relaxed DNA on this length scale. And you see, as you dial in the negative superclone, you get maybe one base exposed, two bases exposed, three bases. Boom, you've got your denaturation bubble, and now you've messed up the enzyme. So that is a very threshold effect, much like we had measured in living E. coli, and now people have measured in living yeast and living human cells. And I'll just point out, we'll get back to this in the positive direction. So to form the Z. So, to form the Z-like DNA, you would also have exposed bases. So, we can't get it very, very positively supercoiled, but you see that maybe we're assessing some exposed bases even in the overwhelm direction. But it takes a lot more supercoiling to get an exposed base from zero, right, than you do for the negative. So, here's where another huge, huge... Another huge, huge surprise. Remember, I told you that you can't mess with the two lengths of DNA. If you're trying to have a site-specific recombination reaction, that loop length is fixed over evolutionary time. And some of these experiments is 3.5 billion years of evolutionary time. So when we did this same experiment, but with a circle that had a larger geometry, so it just had more base pairs, what we found is you need. What we found is you needed a lot more of that underwinding before you could get those bases exposed. So, what in the world is that? Well, it ends up that the tighter the circle, the more the string. We heard that this morning. And it's just much easier. So, looping is tuning the supercoil-promoted effects. And they're evolved, you can't mess with it because. You can't mess with it because if it's any larger, it won't reach the critical density. We've all evolved to be here. It'll never go. And if it's smaller, it goes too much, and that's going to be lost immediately because it's an unstable DNA. So geometry matters. And let's return to this where we blew up, and here's the picture for you, Andrew. We blow up this axis, you actually can see. You actually can see that there is a little bit of activity starting, starting, starting, and then gone. And indeed, you know, we don't know how these enzymes would act on the inside-out DNA. And this isn't like some artificial thing. This is happening at levels of torsional stress that happen in our cells all the time. So, we really do think this is happening in real life. So, it might be harder for the enzyme to access these exposed bases, but nonetheless, there is. Bases, but nonetheless, there is indication that polymlaction is a tactile. And so we have one nuclease that will clip when one base is exposed, and we have another nuclease that will only clip when there's four bases exposed. So think how handy that is. We can actually just differentiate the denaturation bubble promoted by the base flipping events from the single base flipping event. And you'll see that the shapes of those curves are very different. Curves are very different. This one looks like the threshold effect that we saw for so many of the measurements we've made in living cells. And so that makes us think that the initiation point for so many of these processes, these proteins, must be base flipping. And it might be because the base flipping allows the conformation, the shape to change, the geometry matters, or it might be that that's just another. Or it might be that that's just enough for an enzyme to come and launch in and start its process. And maybe the protein does contribute part to the equation. But when we measure these exposure of four bases, you see it was a nice monotonic linear thing, which we really, really liked because it says that you don't really max it out. And the kind of the more torsional stress you put in, the more likely those are going to turn into these spontaneous denatured bubbles. Majority bubbles. So, having this tool now, we can start to differentiate one from four bases exposed. So, the shapes of these curves are so informative and useful, and the comparisons are pretty extreme. So, what is the model? Well, you might have heard of Craig Denham's WebSID program, and indeed, if you run this program through, and that accounts for supercoil. Through, and that accounts for supercoiling, and just based pretty much on first principles, it predicts this first site is going to be the one that's, you know, first to go, if you will. And indeed, this is the first site to bend. That one is the first to deviate as you take and start putting more and more negative superpoints, taking the linking number away from here. But what happens, because this is a circle, and this is the model of Andre Stasiak, he had this 100. Andre Stasiak, he had this 180-degree model, the coordinated. So this one bends, and that forces this one to bend. It may not want to. It may never normally bend. Because it's an unusual sequence that it's forced because of its opposite orientation on the loop, that one actually sticks out its single base first. So this is an action at a distance in biology. Something over here is triggering something over there to do something. Over there to do something it didn't want to do, which is got a base exposed. But then once that base is exposed, that makes this tighter and that base also exposed. So again, the DNA sequence, the topology, the geometry, all of it really matters. So site two forces that, and that's the cooperative Ginking model of Castasiac Weinberger et al. 2011. So this is a direct proof of that model. And if you go further in the And if you go further in the supercoiling, what happens is this bend now will also face flip, and now you've got this really tight bends, much like the ones I highlighted in yellow that you were looking directly at by the microscope. And then there's this other class of bands. So when you have enough supercoiling, you get these open circles. And our enzyme that says, ha, more than four, says, yes, there's four. Says yes, there's four. And in fact, our good friend and collaborator, Alice Pine, in a paper right next to ours, said, Hey, I've got these open circles that she can see directly by atomic force microscopy. You can't see a single base exposed, but you can see these four bases exposed because she's really improved the resolution of these things. So we were quite excited that our model was rather shown directly, and people can stop saying, oh, that was just a Can stop saying, oh, that was just a model. I don't know if you guys ever run into that in math. That's just a model, but we run into it with computational simulations. So again, the sequence really matters. We had this third site, and this is just a single 300-base pair sequence that had nothing interesting biologically in it. We wanted to set the ground state and then start putting interesting sequences in there and see what those really interesting sequences were. This was, you know. This was a 20-year side project, a delay of where we're trying to go, which happens if we put the site that HIV enters. What does that look like compared to this ground state? Well, the ground state itself had all these new discoveries that you did never predict. So I've already talked about this first site, the one that WebSid will predict, forcing this new one to flip. But there was this third site. So again, remember in our simulations, it was very important. Our simulations. It was very important to say that these things were highly site-specific. They weren't just any sequence of details. It's according to really the chemistry of what the thing is. And is there room for the two rings versus one ring? And the methyl or the not-methyl or the nitrogen or whatever on that particular DNA base? And so this third site popped up where we kept putting negative supercoiling in. This third site, we never could detect it with the one base probe. We went from nothing. Probe, we went from nothing to the four-base probe. So when it released, boom, it really released. So there's at least four bases of denaturation that it could be longer. And of course, WebSight didn't detect site one or site three because there's more to the equation than we knew originally. And that's where we get back to my title of cracking the secondary codes. You can consider these, supercoiling and looping, as secondary codes. As secondary codes that are really controlling access to the enzymes that do it for the primary code. So, if you're thinking like someone from Baylor College of Medicine in the Human Genome Center and all you want is that code output, CATGG, you've got to get to it. And these things are the things controlling it. And so, what's again really, really fun is even though this circle has a whole lot of negative supercoiling in it, and you remember, linking number is equal to the delay. Linking number is equal to the delta twist plus delta rhythe. So writhe is what we're usually depicting this stuff as, but there's twist. So the LK is going to be the same as this molecule. There's no change. It's just, is it manifested as totally twist, like in this molecule, in this strange open button bubble? Or is it manifested as raw? Then of course it's a sum of the two. And they just fluctuate according to the linking number and of course according to the DNA sequence. The DM sequels. So again, Alice Pine, she had seen, what are these? And gosh, reviewers, maybe one of you in this room, went crazy. You have a contaminant of relaxed DNA in your supercoil substrate. Like, no, we don't. You can see on the gel, we've overexposed the gel, we've grossly overloaded the gel. We never saw contaminant. So this is truly a supercoil molecule. And when Alice saw these looking like holes, first of all, this length of DNA wants to... First of all, this length of DNA wants to be linear. So if it were truly relaxed, and this is a hole and it's, you know, it's linear, it's never going to just bend. If you cut the thing and lay it out, it's just all a bunch of rigid rods. So this is, again, how much the real DNA that's negative supercoils deviates from the rigid rod. And I'm going to say that persistence length of DNA that's supercoiled is two-phase pairs. So just throw that out there. All right, so very satisfying. So again, DNA sequence. Very satisfying. So, Gandina sequence really, really matters. Now, you have heard of Manning's theory, maybe, that you've got all these phosphate backbones, there's going to be this concentration of counter ions that allow that DNA to A, pack into such a small space. Don't forget, every one of you and every cell in your body have six feet, two meters of DNA packed into every cell. So if it looks like this, well, we So, if it looked like this, well, we would all be at least two feet wide or three feet, or obviously, it can't be this small, right? So, these counter ions are really, really important. And in fact, in biology, why I'm making the link between physics, math, and biology, in biology, calcium, and maybe some of you have dealt with some of these issues, they control mitosis, that's just cell division normally. Meiosis, that's cell division when people are reproducing. Viral advantages. Reproducing. Viral infection, like, oh my gosh, when viruses are about to come and invade a cell, they propagate this calcium signal, which somehow turns off our immune system, and the virus can get in. Who knew? That's so fascinating. Oocytes, so maybe that's a word y'all don't know. Maybe when the eggs get fertilized, they turn into oocytes. And if that's going to turn into a little baby, you've got to have these calciums. And fertilization itself has depending on calculus calcium. But if you dysregulate calcium in our bodies, there are all these major health consequences. So here I am at Baylor College of Medicine, and my students have to go to all these seminars, and I have to go, and I'm hearing about hearts, and things I never studied, and there's no equations, right? It's like sometimes you feel like you're watching pain. I'll think this is live. Oh, there you go. Paint drive, but it's not really. So, anyway, heart disease, neurodegeneration, cancer, osteoporosis. Wait, I do know those words, right? All of us have. Those words, right? All of us have family members or loved ones who have suffered with these diseases. They're all about calcium. So then I ask, well, okay, how does calcium do all this junk? Oh, unclear. And if I look for some people bold enough to put forth a model, it's all protein-centric. So there's calcium-sensing proteins, but really so much of this research is about how do you control the calcium. You want calcium inside this cell. Calcium. You want calcium inside this cell and outside that, or in the nucleus and not, you know, in the cytoplasm. But none of those are like, well, what is calcium doing in the first place? So we had a real good time with this. And I know some of you don't do gel electrophoreses, although I've already shown you a couple of electrophoretic gels. So this is just, you know, you're squeezing DNA through the pores. And what makes it squeeze through the pores? Well, how long it is, and its shape, and its charge naturally, but DNA is all the same charge, so that's not in our art. That's not in our, and all of our mini-circles are the same exact length and the same exact charge and sequence. So the only thing that changes when we start exposing these things to these cations here in a minute is going to be the shape. That's the only thing left. All right? So, and you were talking about changing shape, and it can be a little bit challenging. So you've seen this show already, I was showing you how pure our bands were, and how, no, these are not contaminated with any of that. Not contaminated with any of that. Don't even tell me that. No matter these are. And what was really interesting and shocking was here: if you don't have any counter allowance at all, like why would anybody even learn a gel like this? No biologist, no thinking person would ever do this. But we were like, well, what happens if we don't have counter all this? And the positives just march on exactly unimpeded. They can care less about those counter ions. So this is interesting because remember Manning's theory. Because remember, Manning's theory was applied to DNA that really is only DNA-like what we thought in this positive realm. So even the DNA that we thought we knew a lot about is not at all caring about what the status of the counter ions are. And you'll see that repeatedly through every experiment I show you. But look at the negative supercoiling. So the zero runs here, and then the minus one, there's a big O jump, and then minus two, there's a little more. And then minus two, there's a little more of a jump, and then it's just a bunch of blur. So remember, we now know that those things are exposing their bases or becoming denaturational bubbles. There is no theorem for how counter ions might interact with that, but you can kind of think about what it might be to have these hydrophobic bases flapping on the outside. This is certainly going to change the counter ion cloud. So now let's add the counter ions and see how those change. And see how those change. So, kind of hold that one in your mind. Boom. If you add calcium, where we usually run our gels, the negatives all lay out and the positives all lay out. Okay? So that is a dramatic change with counter ions. So then we started messing around with, okay, how much do you need of the counter ions to make these changes? Well, we've depicted this a little differently here. So now here's where zero is, unchanged, uncared. Again, all the DNAs and all the experiments that. And all the DNAs and all the experiments have mostly been done. It's totally impervious to what we're trying to do now. But so is the positive superfluum. These are almost coincident. The positive supercoiling doesn't care. It doesn't care if you have a whole lot of calcium or no calcium at all. There they are. But the negative supercoiling are tunable. Okay, this is where the counter ions are a third example of a secondary code. If we haven't cracked, they control access to the primary code. Controlled access to the primary code that we think correct, right? So look at the difference, for example, that I don't know, let's just take the minus 3. So the minus 3 can be a very slow moving, you know, not going past the gel, going down the gel at all, or it can be very, very fast. And so we started thinking about this and said, look, models that leave out DNA conformational changes, oh, and then we learn, guess how they determine what part of meiosis. They determine what part of meiosis or mitosis they're in. They're assessing the DNA changes. And I'm thinking, how can anyone think that the proteins are coming in and changing the DNA when the DNA itself changes with these counter ions? It's just wild. But just like mathematicians are often siloed away from biologists and physicists or someone in another building, too, people who work on this are not DNA people. So I think this is sort of an unintentional, just at the end. So then my friends said, Oh, you're crazy for a heart attack or heart problems and all this sort of stuff. This is in a much, you know, you're using 50 millimolar ammoniums, big amounts. My god, that's what we can make easy. So we went back and we really timed this up. And this one cardiologist said to me, if you see a difference, then I'm going to be really intrigued. So we did the experiment and look at the change. The changes occur even over these really Even over these really small differences in salt. And where we've evolved to keep our DNA homeostatically are the major differences. So I'm just telling you that this is not yet published. So geometry matters, topology matters, sequence matters, counter ions matter. Like it's all kind of really giving more than it can handle. And my father, who's a physicist, he asked me, and he's also the physicist, Lynn, I know you love biochemistry, but just keep taking. Love biochemistry, but just keep taking your math. So I'm so grateful to my dad that I have a math minor because I love math. And anyway, my dad says, you know, man, if you had known how complex this problem was, would you have started? I'm like, oh, gosh, that's dead. That's a horrible question. The answer is yes, because even though it seems to my father, who misses the biology part of it, that we've made no progress whatsoever, I think we've made some small progress. So in summary, based on the biology, So, in summary, base pair disruptions make DNA hyperflexible, and that allows very, very sharp bending without breaking any strands. So, we don't have mix or any kind of breaks in our DNAs. The bending strain in DNA loops contributes to base, and that's just intuitive, right? As you take this and you've got supercoiled, it's already supercoiled, you're already straining the thing torsionally, and now you've forced it into these loops that are small, it just makes sense that you're going to pop those little bases out. Sense that you're going to pop those little bases out even more or faster or whatever. So DNA bluetooth tunes the supercollion promulgated site-specific base pair disruptions and this action at one site is transmitted through the DNA to cause action at the second site. And then this calcium, which is called, I think it's called the DNA messenger of life or something, like biologists are totally into this stuff. It's new for me. I never took a biology 101. I never took a biology 101 class. I don't know these things. But the positively superclotemia is impervious. Now, I didn't tell you this, but when we use one-third of all anti-cancer drugs, we inhibit the topoisomerases, and those topoisomerases are inhibited only when they're bound to positively seeprocaladinate. Now, I haven't solved cracked that either. Like, I don't understand it, but it's something about the impervious. But it's something about the imperviousness of those things, I think, to either the code that might be longer lasting, not sure, that may help inhibit the topos bound to the positive superproport to kill cancer. And antibiotics. So 50% of all antibiotics anybody takes also target the bacterial version of these top postomerids. It's the same story. They only kill when bound to positive rec. This difference might be relevant. So, positive and negative supercaldena differ dramatically. I can't kind of believe that people used to think they were the same, just the chirality. And together, all of these are hidden or secondary codes that control activity and access to the DNA primary code. And all of that, in the absence of these magic proteins that get all the credit currently. So, the take-home message is really whether you think of DNA in all those different ways that I DNA in all those different ways that I outlined on my opening slide: sequence of letters, the elastic rod, the origin double helix, the long flux of the string. They're right. It just depends upon what length scale you're talking about because certainly the averages of all these little things average out when you're looking at very long DNAs. And you would really miss them because they're all important at the atomic scale. So you're also wrong. So all of these descriptions apply to DNA. These descriptions apply to DNA, but none of them yet fully explain actual active DNA. So, I just want to give you a hint about I started my whole career as an entomologist, particularly the topois samurases that we thought did all the bashing of this inner little thing here. And I proposed, and this is super fun, it's the first time I said this out loud. I proposed back when I was doing my job talks a few decades ago. A few decades ago, that if I could just figure out how to make scale and purity of these supercloiled circles, that we might start to get a hint of really what these topoise sam raises look like. And the hypothesis was that this is the actual substrate, and that it would actually be an active enzyme that we're looking at. So I'll contrast it to the kind of the enzyme beating the rods kind of model. Here is the grill's picture. From Quirrell's picture. It's in press. You can watch. I'm not allowed, it's embargoed, but you can see it's going to come out very soon. So we averaged a whole lot of particles, and this is DNA gyrase. This is the target for the fluoroquinamine antibiotics, bacterial enzyme. And here it is making this absolutely gorgeous, crazy. So the protein is this gray stuff, beautiful beta hairpin thing. And here's our mini. thing and here's our mini circles and what's so fun is only the delta the linking number changed minus two would form this complex the minus one doesn't work the relax certainly doesn't work it's just inert nothing material right and here's the other fun thing about this is this is a minus two negative supercoil minicircle and yet the posit the rhythm that this gyrase puts into it is positive. Is positive. So the Casarelli sign inversion mechanism is true. So that's just a little hint, and I can't talk more about it, but that's sort of fun. And you're looking at the very first structures of relatively at this level of resolution. All right, so I've somehow messed up because I went to my computer. Oh shoot, I want to start it all over. There we go. This is kind of knowledgeable. So this is my laboratory. So this is my laboratory and really most of the work I talked about today are by long-term senior staff scientist Jonathan Bogg. We've worked together for three decades and then all of these wonderful students and trainees have contributed. And these are my fantastic colleagues because as we were listening to, if you went to the Nancy Hopkins story, you know, there's no lone wolf metagenias, right? You really, we are all influencing each other. Are all influencing each other? I take a little bit from all of your talks hung with me. So these are just the fantastic collaborators I've worked with. Funding, you know, just somehow we're getting funded again because I guess we've proven some of the crazy ideas that we've had. And I want to thank you for your attention and I will be happy to answer questions. Do I put this off? Do I put this off now? And I just say power off. No, no, no, no, keep back. Recording in progress off. Goodbye.
