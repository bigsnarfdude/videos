So, I'm going to talk about some theory of motive ecology, which is really an extension of the work of Eldon and Matthew Moreau. But let me first recall, so it's been done by Eldon over Phil, but let me first recall the theory of classical motive ecology in the Smooth case. So, it's not like eight or nine points of properties, just a few properties, but the important ones. That's the important point. Okay, so it's a multi-commercial use case. Again, it's new to many people, but it was first envisioned by Bidenson and Nichtenbaum in the 80s. It was really a theory in mixed artistic, even for them. Then there's been a first definition by block. By Block. And it was related to algebraic K-Series and to the Wollermann series by Pobetsky, Leiden, and maybe also like Geyser and Speedsback. So Geyser and Speedsback are really for mixed characteristic situation. Okay, and so it's mostly around 2000. Okay, so it's Okay, so it states the following. So any smooth scheme scheme X, so it's either over a field in equity characteristic and mixed characteristics. So the typical situation is for the Dekin domain. So or Dadekin domain. So typically over Z. Okay, so there are some complexes of materialic homology. In this case, in the smooth case, these are called the block cycle complexes. So there are, in this theory, this is A1 invariant. So this is the property, block cycle complexities. Those are written by ZIX bullet. Okay, so the bullet here is for the homological degree. So this is defined as a really a complex of abelian groups. And this is really certain algebraic cycles on x times some simple x of dimension minus. Mentioned a minus this is minus because here I take the homological convention for block it was really like some homological complex and you have some different flow which is really some alternating sum of of these cycles when you take the differential maps on the faces. So you impose some condition like that. You just say that you have some certain codimension, something cycles. Codiment something cycles on that and see the okay, which is just a complex of cycles, and we see that as a complex in the direct category of public inputs. This is indexed by some integers I say what? Yes, absolutely. So the I here is indeed the okay, so I think it's a codim. I think it's a codim uh codimension with nine dot plus three i it really depends on the dimension is for that yeah okay so the idea is that it's a generalization of the of the of choke groups because if you take like uh dot is equal to two i uh no dot is equal to zero then you have just uh codimension uh i cycles uh I cycles. Sorry. Okay, yeah, sorry. Yeah, like that. So you have codimension I cycles on X, and this really is definition of the true group. This is a generalization of true groups called higher true groups when you take the combination group to that. And this is supposed to be a good generalization to describe the higher K groups of X. More precisely, the main property for these complexities is that there is a spectral sequence. The spectral sequence. I'll call it the Attier-Azog spectral sequence, which computes the algebraic K-series of X in terms of this cycle, of this cycle complexity. Okay, so these are the algebraic K groups of X. The fact that these complexes are A1 invariant reflects the fact that algebraic K theory is A1 invariant on smooth schemes. Okay, so this is fine. You can compute algebraic K groups, but in the vision of Berlinstone and Nicholas-Baum, you had two things to verify. Initial bum, you had two things to verify. First, the relation to algebraic case theory, that is, that you have a refinement of algebraic case theory in terms of motivic homologies, so these motiv complexes. And second, you can compute this motivic homology groups in terms of etal homology. It's one of the main important main properties of motivic homology. And so this is facing in this way. So moreover. So for any prime number L, you should have. For any prime number L, you should have a comparison map. Right here, but if you take these complexities. Modulo L, you should have a comparison map to the etal homology of X with L invertible. Okay, so this is the first difference with the case of a field, because if L is a general prime, it's not necessarily invertible. So you need to invert it to have a well-behaved theory of the palacomology. Okay, so you have a comparison map, and the fiber of this comparison map is in degrees at least i plus one so if l is non-zero in x are two cases here first if l is actually inversible in x then this is just equal to the etal cohomology of x okay and this is saying that in low degrees motivic is computed by etal khomology in degrees less Computed by et al. com logic, so it will be less than i like that. And then there is the other case, which is when L is non-zero but not inversible in X. This is really mixed characteristic. And he's saying that even in mixed characteristics, the Motiv complexes are computed by the etal homology of the generic fiber in logic bit. Okay. Okay, so this is all I want to say about motiv homology in the smooth case. Is there any question? Okay. Okay, so the goal of what I want to explain is really to extend history, so extend motivic communology then smooth skins. Okay. So even for algebraic K theory, there are really different properties of K-theory of non-smooth schemes compared to K-theory of smooth schemes. For instance, K-theory is not A1 invariant on general schemes. So you need to adapt the theory and in particular to introduce the theory which is not A1 invariant of quantification. So first I'm going to explain the general construction. First, I'm going to explain the general construction of this new multi-communology, and then explain how to adapt some of the properties of multi-communology in the smooth case to non-smooth case. First, general construction. So just to say that we have a theory which is kind of the same as this one, let me say that for any, okay, so the context for me will be any quasi-compact quasi-sparing scheme X. So in particular, any affine scheme is permitted. There are There are some natural, so in particular, functorial motivic complexes denoted by Zi mod of X again living in the zero category of the Belarusian groups and for I non-negative integer. Okay. Okay, and the heat in a spectral sequence similar to this one converging to K theory. There is a spectral sequence. I'm saying the same things. On the E2 page, you have a metallic chronology group. And converging due to Aldrich K-theory of X, if X is not smooth, the Aldrich K-theory can have a non-zero negative K-group. The whole negative K groups. And so this is really the non-connective algebraic K series. We can see the information in the negative K groups. Okay, so two more properties in this theorem. So the first one is similar to this Benzo national composite map. Okay, so for any prime Look at the So, here's an extension of the previous map, the Berlin-Nistenbaum Basin map. Again, you take mod elementary homology and discuss to the etalic homology of the generic fiber of And to have some control on motive ecology mod L, you want to control the fiber of this app. And similarly, we have a result for NO, which is a bit weaker than the result in the smooth case, but I'm going to talk about it later in the talk in the rest of the cases. So with fiber is in degrees at least i plus one. degrees at least I plus one. So if L is invertible in X because I said there were two cases in the previous theorem. The first case is when L is invertible and then we have this. So this extends directly to any scheme for this metallic homology. So you have the same comparison for any scheme when L is inversible and when L is not inversible but still not zero in X in mixed characteristic. X, the mixed characteristic, I'm going to say later what happened. Just to compare to the classical theory, if X smooth of the detecting domain, then you can prove that if you enforce A1 invariance on On these motiv complexes, then you will get back the original cycle complexes of block. Okay, so the classical theory in the smooth case is the A1 localization of this theory. So it would be interesting to remove this LA1, so this A1 localization, and this will be. So this is A1 localization, and this will be a subject of RNAPS talk. Okay, I'm going to make a few remarks to put this theory in context. Okay, so first it says theorem A is due to Elmontomarau. For schemes over field. Okay, so this is really an extension in Nix that is thick of the work. Okay, so the second remark: so we use the recent work of Bachmann and Montcombour. So yeah, so this is an interesting question, but actually we don't know many things about these block cycle complexities for regular schemes which are not smooth. So we would expect something like that, but for now, even having some control on these motivated complexities. And these multiple complexities in the regular case is kind of tricky, but you can say something. Yeah, I don't have a precise result for this kind of comparison in the regular case. Okay, so we used some work. Okay, so we used some work of Berkman and Motomoro, who used to construct some variants of these motivat complexes, which is a CDH local variant, which is a CDH specification of these motivat complexes. So it's not related to algebraic K theory, but instead to homotopy K theory, KH. Okay. So motivated complexes. I will denote this complexity as a Zi CDH, and this is really the CDH simplification of this complexity, CR mode. The CDH certified version appearancy. Okay, so I'm not going to say more about that right now, apart from the fact that there is a map. That this map is an equivalence after A1 localization. So the ICH should really be some A1 invariant theory of motive ecology, which works for general schemes, not only smooth schemes. And so we can prove that if you enter We can prove that if you enforce A1 invariance, then these two are the same. So it's compatible with some intuitions on algebraic K theory. Okay, so just say this is expected to be A1 invariant. And this is actually proved. And this is actually proved over the field of the perfect grade valuation rate. Okay, any question about these? I had a quick question. So do you know how the complex is constructed? Uh do you think the complexes that you have compared to like the pro tau complexes? Yes, yeah uh okay it will be related to a result I'm gonna state later, but uh but basically yes, you can prove that for so their complexes are a kind of motivic combinology for Notarian schemes typically and I can prove that zero complexes are equal to these complexes for any Neutron. While you're erasing, I just have a so that's like a very concrete thing that you're erasing there. So when you say there are complex, is it going to be like a because I shouldn't ask this because you're about to explain. I'm actually about to explain to you. No, no, yeah, I'm actually about to explain the explicit construction of this complexity here. But you're right, so it's not at all the same construction as these cycle complexes. So it is not obvious to prove a comparison of this form because these are not signature forms. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually, I have another question. So I thought that this particular evaluation thing was really I thought there were some issues about like NK same type of questions. Here you really, okay, you really expect this to be true for any scheme. This should be a one invariant in any context. So when I say like So, when I say like it's proved over a field or a perfect weight valuation ring, it's pretty for any scheme over a field or any scheme over a perfect weight valuation ring. So, you see just some technical hypothesis to prove this result, but I don't think you really have properties of perfect weight valuation ring involved. You aren't going too far. Uh yeah, no, it's not the same kind of it it's actually some control of uh valuation rings over perfectoid valuation. Over perfect data evaluation. Uh okay so no for the construction okay so these complexes are Zariski sheaves. Okay, so just to simplify notation, I'm going to explain this for rings. Okay, you can just Zariski shiftify everything and you get the construction for any scheme for any QCL scheme. Okay, so you fix the Okay, so you fix a R a commutative ring and an I is an integer for no any integer. So the construction uses so instead of algebraic cycles, we need to replace algebraic cycles by something. The main input is actually trace method. So trace methods in algebraic case theory. Created methods in algebraic case theory are usually formalized by the so-called topological cyclic homology. And we actually use that, and in particular, the topological technique homology denoted by T C of R. Okay, so I'm going to say more about that in a moment. But basically, this is a variant which is better behaved in characteristic P or in mixed characteristic of the so-called acidic homology developed by CON, which works best in cartetic zero. Okay, so before I explain the relation to that, let me just give a quick construction of this complexity z i mod, and then I'm going to explain how you relate the construction I'm explaining to algebraic case theory. Okay. algebraic case theory. Okay. Okay, so first, those are two steps in the construction. Step one, we define some auxiliary complexes instead of the I mode. Yes, we define complexes denoted by ZITC because they are related to C. So again, this is a complex in the category D of Z. In the category D of Z. When you define that, there are some Cartesian square. So, this is really some pullback of three things. Yes, we define that. So, Z I T C or R. So, you first use, Elden talked about that with please. So, you first use Girard. So the R during comology of R okay is okay, so I'm going to explain as an notation. So Hodge complete derived the RAM chromology of R. It was first introduced by Elusi and then studied about 10 years ago by BAT. Studied about 10 years ago by BAT. Okay, so basically, this is a variant of Durham cohomology for not necessarily smooth skin. So you just left-can extend the classical theory, and then you take some variant of that. So the part here is for the Hodge completion. You have an actual Hodge filtration on the RAM homology, which is just taking the forms of degrees at least i. You just take the derived version of that and you complete for this filtration. For this filtration, you actually take these poles which are in degrees at least i. Okay, so then you want also the following object, which is actually the profinite completion of this object. So this is the derived Ramkomology of R, but you just decomplete this thing. Of the previous object. You want to glue these two things along something which is also pre-complete for one piece. So this is the syntomic homology of R. So this is a syntomic homology. And so Elden said that this motivated homology should be related to prismatic homology and derived or logology. So this is derived or you can actually define the syntomic homology as the organised eigenspaces and prismatic homology. Just to say, so you can just understand all of this term in terms of. understand all of this term in terms of prismatic components. This is introduced by a bad moral suk so you have a cartoon sprawl like that and you just define this complexity. Okay so you say it's gonna make sense how it's related to motivational homology. So all of this information is really some information coming from topological cyclic homology, and we want to use that as an input to define the metallic complex. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's product of all prime numbers P or of this complex like it's some kind of adapting no not not ataic, noticeable No, no, not that they ignore the yeah. Why am I not worried about actually the topological cyclic homology itself is defined in a similar way? I'm going to say a word about that later, but the idea is really to say that the integral version of TC does not depend on the place at infinity. There are recent questions asking how to Are recent questions asking how to get some refinement or adding some information, some Archimedean information, but it's not done yet or anything. For now, we okay. Okay, step two, but uh but also uh last step, not many steps. Um okay, so define the motivated complexes. Okay, so define the multi-b complexes with di mod of x so similarly by the Cartesian square. So here we define it similarly. So first we use the So, first, we use the ZITC we just introduced. This is the step one. We also use, as it was said in the second remark, the CDH local metallic complexes of Bachelor and Montemorrow. And then we glue these two things along the CDH certification. Along the CDH certification of the ITC. First, you CDH certify this construction and then you evaluate it at X. This is really the CDH specification of step one. Okay. Okay, means this is really long. Pdh local MOSV complexes. Okay. And well, that's it. That's the construction of the MOSFET complexes. Of course, it's a bit not enlightening. Let me just say how we relate this to algebraic K-theory. And this actually motivates these two Cartesian squares. Z0 and Z1. Yeah, so Z0 should be similar to what Eldon explained. So it's not the Zyski stratification of Z, Zayski chromology of Z, it's actually the CDH homology of Z. So you can prove that. And in weight one, you can describe it in degrees less than three, I think, in terms of the... In terms of the chromology of GM, so Zaiski or Nisnevich chromology of GM. So again, weight one is related to GM and weight zero is related to Z. Okay. Okay, so It's hard to know what to expect, actually. I think. Yeah, I mean, it's false that it's equal to Nisnevich Komology of GM, but I don't have any intuition of what it should be in higher degrees. Even in white zero, actually, it's TDH chromology of Z. So it's not really Nisnevich chromology of Z, because it's general schemes for magnet. It should be related to something. I don't. I don't have any philosophical reason to read. Okay, so just I'm not going to say more about all of the proof of CRM A, but just the main result of CRM A was the relation to K theory. So the L T A is a rush of a spectral sequence. So there are really two points. The first we use. The first we use two Cartesian squares, which are really the Cartesian squares similar to these ones, but at the level of K-theory. Use Cartesian squares. So first you have a Cartesian square, saying that the Tc of R, so topological cyclic modity of R, is related to topological cyclic. Topological cyclic homology of R, T complicit for U prime T and then to the so-called negative cyclic homology. So, this is really some easier variant of topological cyclic homology. And then product over all points P of a negative cyclic homology of R and P computed for every point P. And then the idea is that you have your You have your filtrations on all of these three terms with graded PCs given for H- by derived RAM cohomology by results of ONSIO. On these terms, you have similarly the same filtrations, but P-completed with graded pieces given by the P-completions of the previous graded pieces. This fits in this diagram. And then on Tc, T-completed of R, you have filtrations by bad morals, also. Filtrations by bad morals, also, so this is really the content of the work, with graded pieces given by a version of syntomic chromology. And so, the idea is really to glue these three filtrations to get a new filtration on the integral version of topological chromology. This is just to explain the direct constructions of the complexes like that, but this really comes from filtrations on these complexes at the level of K theory. Okay, and then okay, so this Cartesian square for Tc. Okay, so with this Cartesian square for Tc, let me just say that it's almost just a rewriting of the definition of Tc. Okay, so it's not a deep thing, it's just like a definition of Tc of R. And then we use another Catholic square which is similar to this one. Okay, so this is a K-series of X. So here's this Tc of R, sorry. Tc of R. Here is this homotopy K-theory of R, which is defined as the A1 localization of the K-theory of R. And here this is the CDH declaration of Tc of R. Okay, so let me say that this is not a direct consequence of the definition of algebraic K-theory. It's actually a result of two theorems, which are actually quite deep. Which are actually quite deep. So, first, a theorem of the casting term. And another theorem of Long Thamus, I'm going to say what it is. Okay, so the first theorem of castling tamer is actually that homotopy K theory, which is defined as the A1 localization of K theory, is actually also the CDH certification of K theory. Certification of K theory in two different ways, which are dual kind of dual to look at this theory. And so, this explains why we have some CDH local version of multiple ecology here. And here on TC, well, we have a filtration in step one defining this complexity as graded PCs on TC. And we just glue these two things to define a filtration on KCR. So it is not obvious that all of these filtrations are compatible. So here you need to prove something to have some compatibility. You need to prove something to have some compatibility between these two objects. And here, similarly, you have to prove some compatibility. At least you can do that, and you define this definer. Okay, so then the second point to prove the actually the spectral sequence is to prove, which is not obvious using these definitions, that ZI mod is zero for I negative, right? For I negative. With this definition, these derived RM complexes are not zero for I negative. It's just all of derived RM homology. It has no reason the probability that it vanishes. And the idea is that it vanishes when you compensate with CDH certification of that. It's not obvious to do that, but you can prove that. Once you have that, you actually have kind of directly a spectral sequence from regime from multi-communicate to algebraic case theory. Break history. Okay. Any question about that? So this H C minus the P computer is the function. This one? Actually these two. These two are not computers. Two, these two are not opus. HC minus NP completion. So, okay, to prove this, you actually need to prove that the difference between H C minus and C D Hification of H C minus is not zero. This is true in characteristic zero, but not in general. So, the idea is that the difference between this term, this term, and both of the CDH specification is zero. Maybe more precisely. Can you say one word about the action from this one? Okay, I don't know the classical way to look at that. I think the modern way is to say that you have decent properties for these two objects. More precisely, you know that you have some left-hand extension properties for this two objects. So you can reduce to the proof for polynomial rings. Polynomials are. polynomial rings, polynomial Z algebras. More generally, you can then construct this map for casi syntomic rings, which include polynomial z algebras. And to do that you do casi syntomic descent on both of these objects because these two objects are casi syntomic sheaves on casi syndomic rings and then on casi regular semi-perfected rings so locally in the casinomic topology these two are in degree zero given by some tailored rings and you can just construct yeah absolutely yeah yeah it's not like Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah. In Cartesic P, yes. In Nix Cartesic, I think it's more related to A crease in screen sense. But it is the same kind of argument, but in Nixcartic. Maybe there is a way to see that directly, but you understand less of what's happening. You understand less of what's happening using the event filtration arc. Okay, so this is a general construction, but I'm gonna do an example right now. So I hope it becomes a bit more clear. Okay. Okay, so this was for the general construction. Okay, so this was for the general construction, and now I'm going to explain how to adapt some of the properties of classical motivation beyond two schemes. So, first as a kind of warm-up, let's do an example. Let's consider something which is singular in Nix characteristic for the Z. Characteristic over Z, and which is given by trungated polynomials over Z. We consider this ring for E at least one. Now what is classically studied for this ring is actually a relative version of K-Series. So we define if you take a ring R and an ideal I in R, then you can define the relative. Then you can define the relative version of that as just as a fiber of the value at r and the value at r mod i. Basically, for this ring, you take the relative version of this relative to the ideal t. You just kill all of the information coming from the ring z because it's knowingly hard to compute, for instance, the k theory of d. Okay. Okay, so now the upshot is that you can actually perform some calculations. Okay, so you try to compute the motivated complexes of this ring. You go to the definition and you see that there is this pre-sheaf, which is actually a CDH sheaf. But it kills all of the nilpotent information. But if you take ZICDH and you look at this thing, then everything is just zero because this you can. And everything is just zero because this is equal to that, because little buttons are killed by CDHC. Similarly, for this one, all of the information you need to compute is in ZITC. And then you look at the definition of ZITC, and it's defined in terms of giraffe-durham chromology, and syntomic chromology, so in terms of prismatic chromology. So now the upshot when you do that is that calculations in prismatic chromology And derive the ontology. Okay, so for prismatic, it's due to no Argenbach. I'm going to say something about Durham chronology. Okay, because these two things imply that you can actually have a complete description of the motivatic coherence. Description of the motivic homology, the relative motivic homology for this. Okay, so what does it say? It says that if you compute the motivic homology groups, the IMOT of this ring relative to the ideality. So you can prove that this is a global. Can prove that this is a group of order EI factorial. So, this is for L is equal to zero. Then, this is a free abelian group in degree one or for the e minus one. This is zero otherwise. Okay, and this is for all white. Okay, so in particular, when E is equal to one, you can check that these two things become zero, because for E is equal to one, this is just relative homology of zero relative to Z, so everything is zero. Okay. Okay, and so you have this complete computation of matrix homology, and then you can use the ATIS Robo spectral sequence to compute back the Sequence to compute back the k groups of this. So this actually implies directly because you have only a few times in this pixel sequence. This implies the similar calculations, which were made with completely different techniques by Angelweit Gerhart and Esselwold. Of the Holative K groups of this thing. Okay. These computations were made using really techniques for measurement K theory, and now you can reinterpret all of this computation only in terms of computation in chromology theory. Yes? Question? Do you know how the transition map works as the Do you know how the transition map works as E vary? I think they're all zero. Yeah, yeah, you can actually prove that. So, okay. In prismatic cohomology, you just take as an input the work of Noah. In derived DOM cohomology, there was a classical computation actually using some H C minus, those kind of things in the 80s by Suley and Schlepelt. And you can actually reinterpret all of these calculations in terms of derived arm homology. In terms of derived ROM homology, because these terms for this specific thing are actually really easy to compute. You just take an explicit resolution and you just find that you have these things. So the maps are pro-zero. I mean, the limit is pro-zero. Which limit? The transition maps are zero, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, you can identify everything. So the one? No, for every funny grouping. I think you do know using some kind of tweak, but it's harder to generalize, for instance, to more general number fields instead of if you not if you want to put Z but like ring of integers of number fields, it's a little harder. Okay, but you're still saying that the traditionals are all zero. Yeah, I think so. Okay. So any any question about that? So any any question about that? Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah. So for unramified extension of Z, you can do similar things, similar computations, but for unramified extension, But for unramified extensions, you can generalize only like the three parts. You can compute the ranks. Yeah. You're just saying that this becomes heavier computation. So this is really. Yeah. Okay, great. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. I think if you try to compute the the PLD part Okay, so let me try to to say some general properties of these multi-complexities in the singular case now for non-spool schemes. So first let me So, first, let me recall that on smooth schemes, so for instance, on smooth Z schemes in mixed statistics, we have that albumic K theory is A1 invariant. So, K theory of X is the same as K theory of A1 of X. It's not true for non-smooth schemes. And we have another. And we have another property which is also used in the classical theory, which is that the negative k groups x are zero. So k n of x is zero for n negative. Okay, so for the first property, I'm going to say what we expect replace, so what should replace this A1 invariance property for more general schemes. But okay. Modern schemes. But okay, at least for this vanishing, this was a conjecture of variable, which was settled a few years ago. Okay, general Nuclear schemes. There was this conjecture to recall this variable vanishing conjecture. Which is a theorem of Casting the Move. Stating that for the negative K groups, you still have some vanishing, but it depends. still have some vanishing, but it depends in the singular case, it depends on the dimension of x. zero for n bigger than dimension of x. Okay, so you still have some control on the negative k. Okay, so now the idea is to take some intuition from the algebraic K theory of singular schemes and to see if they fit into into the framework of this pneumatic homology, which works also for singular schemes. Fox also post mutant. And as it happens, it actually does. Okay, if you take X, any QCQS scheme, X, any QCQS scheme, and I some integer. Okay, so you can prove a modelic refinement of this result. Okay, called the Motilic variable in the machine. Okay, so you said that for X, which is notarian, then you have that the motivic homology groups of X, so H n of Z are remote of X are zero. So again, for N, which is bigger, this. So again, for n which is bigger, this times n i plus the dimension of x. Okay, so it's not exactly the same bound, but actually if you look at the Attias of spectral sequence and you take this vanishing, it actually implies directly the usual vanishing in algebraic K group. You just look at the spectral sequence and you have the desired vanishing directly. Now, the proof of that, you see similar techniques as a proof. Of that, we see similar techniques as a proof of K-theory, but adapted for this new homological setting. So, this was related to this pro-CDH decent. Does this get a new proof of Weibel's conjecture? Okay, it's more of a refinement of Weibel's conjecture because the proof is actually kind of similar. You first proof possibly descent. You first prove Posit H descent and then you prove some properties of these for local rings or something like that. But actually, the proof for Posidi H descent is a bit different from the classical proof for K0. I think that it reproves if you follow the same lines for the possible distance model for material complexes, it gives a new proof for post-edit distance for case theory. Okay, okay, and then we'd like to replace. Okay, okay, and then we'd like to replace this K1 invariance of K theory, which was one of the really like main tools to study multiple comology in the Smooth case. And the idea was already by Eldon before, so there's this classical idea of rotendics that actually comology series should satisfy the P1 bundle formula, or projective bundle formula, as a replacement, as really a geometric property, which should be, which should come from motives, actually. In motives, you always invert P1 instead of A1, but T1 instead of A1, but in the smooth case, you can actually embed A1, which is some practical tool. In the non-smooth case, we expect this A1 invariance to be replaced by some kind of P1 invariance, which is formalized by the P1.Null formula. And we're going to actually prove the P1.Null formula for theory. Okay, so it says that. Uh okay so there is a notion of uh of first of motiv uh first chain cars Okay, so there is a first and fast in H two of the first one. In H2 of Z one mod of P one X very kind of small button right. Yeah. Okay, so there is a multi-first chain class which actually induces an equivalence. An equivalence of the form. So you take weight i metallicology of x and weight i minus one metallic homology of x and these two together actually compute the weight i metallic homology of p1 of x. Okay. Okay, so these are what? Ah, okay, great. Okay, cool. Okay, so I'm not going to say much about the proof of these two things, but yeah, these are just two of the main properties of motivic multiple journalists can. Of motiv economy for general schemes. And then I'm going to end with the first discussion on Beninston National BAM. I said that there was a comparison when L was invatable in the scheme. And then when L is not invatable in the scheme, we'd like to still have some comparison between motivology modulo P and et al chromology, so P addic etal chromology of the genomic fiber. And so this is formalized by the last result. Okay, so you have to see. Okay, so to state this result, let me just say that there is a notion introduced by Bat Matthew. Let's see the notion of F-smooth strings, F-smooth in I'm going to use this definition because it is a Because it is a non-nutarian generalization of regular rings. So, here the telecomology is defined for any rings, in particular, any non-notarian ring. And so, we have this notion, which is well suited for non-nutrient rings, for schemes, and which is really a good notion for regularity. Or regularity. So I will not define it, but let me just say that it's a piadic notion and it's defined in terms of absolute prismatic homology. Okay, and it includes the class of F. Of F smooth schemes. This includes regular schemes and also smooth schemes of a perfected ring. Okay, so perfectoid rings could be non-Notorian rings which behave like regular rings. And so smooth things of a regular So, smooth things of a regular team should be also regular. So this fits into the intuition of regularized. Okay. This could be some Baylin Sunnischenbaum for F two schemes. Okay, so we fix a P a prom number. X somewhere, so we assume p torsion free n S here P torsion free S in the scheme P torsion free implies that the P is not zero in the scheme okay and any integer I then the fiber Of the Berlinstone Nicholas-Mamme-composed map. So we had a map for any prime p, and now we consider this prime p relative to this x, which is p torsion free. Okay, so it goes from a model homology of x, modulo key to the etal homology of genomic fiber. Okay, well, this, as in the smooth case, this is in degrees at least i plus one. So this means that in degrees less than i, this is an isomorphism, in degree i, this is injective. You can actually even say that this is injective, and the image is generated by symbols. Okay, so just to show. Okay, so just a few marks to finish. Okay, so in the smooth, so this generalizes the smooth case, similar result for smooth schemes of a dedicated domain. And it also generalizes this result to regular schemes, which was not proof before for classical multi-communology, because classical multi-communology was only in the smooth case. You can actually extend that to regular schemes. And well, it also works for smooth schemes of perfected rings and modinals. Of the perfected readings and marginals. And so, yeah, it really says that this Perdinson-Isnammeum comparison, which was one of the classical results in motivation chromology, periodically, so in mixed hypothetic at the time t, really works for schemes which have a regularity hypothetistic, not any scheme. Thank you for the talk. Any questions? There's a memetic question. This is a thing that is motivic stuff, but is it the thing? Okay, I'm not going to answer with some philosophy. Let me answer with some pragmatical things. Pragmatical things. So there are some recent approaches, some other approaches to multi-decommology, which works for non-smooth schemes. So there is first the one mentioned by Noah using pro-CDH descent, so the pro-CDH topology, which works best for, which works only for Notarian schemes, but any Noterian schemes. And it is not finatory, so you cannot extend it to general schemes directly. And you can prove that these two are the same on every Noterian scheme. So at least these two are the same. Okay? least these two other things. And then you have another approach by Anala Oiwa Iwaza developing some framework of Motilic spectra for non-A1 invariant things. And so it should work. So it's related to this P1 bundle formula, which is actually taken as the main property which motivates spectra should satisfy. Which motivate spectra should satisfy. This result actually implies that this fits into the context of motivic spectra that they are developing. So, at least it's a part of the framework, but in the framework, you could define directly some multi-lix spectra which would represent multiple technology. For now, the framework is still in progress, and so there are several possible definitions which are not proved to be equivalent. They should all be equivalent, and well, I expect that they are all equivalent. And well, I expect that they're all equivalent and equivalent to this alport. Can I answer that? Yeah, this is like related to this question. So whatever be thing is, okay, on a regular scheme, it must behave the way you like it. Like even classical blocks have context. We don't even know it behaves well for like regular, but not through the print. So I think like any. So, I think like any Ethereum with theory homology should have, on the regular scheme, should behave well in the sense that you have those sub-scheme inside X, which is also regular. Then you have like a longer sequence with anything, the thing on Z, the thing on X, the thing on R. I think some set there's like a test case for what the correct thing should be. We don't know it for this thing, we also don't want regular processing. So, I'm not sure do we expect this for regular? So underfoot, do we expect this for regul for general regular things? Yeah. Because it's true for kids. It's just purely about records, nothing. Is it like regular blow-up accident or it's not regular blow-up? No, no. Yeah, just localized. Okay, at least, okay, you have these few properties expected by Bellington. Few properties expected by Bellingston and Nichtenbaum since the 80s, which were formulated for general finite type schemes of a Z, because they wanted to study like values of L functions. Maybe the two main properties, because there is this localization sequence property, which is not known for this, but there were also like the two main properties, which is first the relation to K-theory, and second, the relation to adult homology. And this theory has these two last properties at least. Yeah, maybe I think I saw one. Yeah, I still wanted to I mean, something this is sort of the old thing, but also um, and then yeah, you just mentioned sort of the old functions of things like this. I mean, there we have there's something there that wouldn't Something there. I mean, or is it something that we can talk about? I'm not sure if there is something missing actually related to values of L functions. Because if you look at values of L functions, you actually have some quotient of two K groups varying in each value. And these K groups are only like for small dimension things. For small dimension things like number fields or number rings. If you look at higher dimension, I think it should be expected to be related to multi-commercial groups instead. And this is really like good motivation groups related to algebraic case theory, at least in the classical cases which are better understood. I think there's nothing missing from the real case. But I guess I mean something like the No, definitely, yes. There's something going on, I think, on the real case using condensed math. There should be some version of this to be using T. Some version of this tree using TC, but the real version of T C, like H C minus, basically, the solid version of that, a liquid version of that, condensed, and with which has a filtration with gradients given by the link homology. I think there should be that, but it's still conjectural for now, but it's expected to be to hold. Oh yeah, the next talk is at
