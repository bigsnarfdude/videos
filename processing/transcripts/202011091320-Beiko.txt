Oh boy. There it is. We were working on not behind the scenes. Sorry about that. Summary short read sequencing is a huge pain and we're trying to do something about it. All right. So, and the other thing is by investigating these, looking at the presence of elements and their associations, this can allow us to prioritize some of these isolates. To prioritize some of these isolates for more expensive but more informative long-range sequencing. So, let's talk about associations for a moment. So, this is the actual tree of these Enterococcus isolates from the study focused on Enterococcus fecesum. And one interesting thing you can see here, and I forgot to include the legend, but red is clinical samples, green is farm samples, and blue is wastewater. So, you can see immediately that habitat does not have. That habitat type does not sort out phylogenetically. So that's interesting. That lets us ask all sorts of interesting questions. And so, for any pair of elements, for example, a given resistance gene and some arbitrary plasmid, you can ask the question, to what extent do they co-occur across this data set? So, I've given you a hypothetical example here. We've got plasmid ERMA, sorry, gene ERMA, and plasmid P78Z4Q ampersand. And you can see pink is And you can see pink is presence in particular isolates that they do show a really strong pattern of overlap there. It's basically almost always either both present or both absent. So you could do a Hamming distance, you could do Eclidine distance, whatever. The problem is that this method is, this approach is phylogenetically naive, right? They're all from the same clade, more or less. And so we could be talking about a single event here. And so the correlation could be completely spurious due to phylogenetic. Be completely spurious due to phylogeny. However, when we look at something like this, so now we have ERMB and plasma P 009, A percent T, you can see that there's still a strong pattern of co-occurrence. It's not perfect, but it's still quite strong. And the co-occurrence is spread out across the entire tree. So this is far more informative, I would argue far more interesting, but we need appropriate methods to try and deal with this. And so one method that was applied a couple of years ago by myself. Applied a couple years ago by myself, PhD student Chao Ya Yu, and Hong Gu is actually part of this workshop as well. Was to adapt a co-evolutionary model that thinks about the gain and loss of different elements on the tree and contrasts a model where the gain and loss of a pair of elements is independent versus dependent. So that's what we're going to be focusing on for the next few slides. All right, so features we care about, there's a whole bunch of them. I'm going to be showing you. There's a whole bunch of them. I'm going to be showing you our preliminary results with plasmids, antimicrobial resistance genes, which were predicted through the CARD, the Comprehensive Antimicrobial Resistance Dase Database Resistance Gene Identifier, virulence factors, and metal resistance genes. So we're going to look at the associations of those. And so when we take all pairs of these elements and we apply this Pagel co-evolutionary co-occurrence method, we get something like this. A gigantic heat map. Okay. So what do we do? Heat map. So, what are we looking at here? Well, let me show you a small sample of this. The rows and the columns are the same, they're all of the elements of interest. What I'm showing you here is a little excerpt where the columns are three erythromycin resistance genes, and the rows are a whole bunch of plasmids, putative plasmids, bits of plasmids, whatever, that have been predicted by the MobSuite tool. The larger the number, the greater the likelihood ratio that favors correlated patterns of evolution. Of evolution. So ERMA, ERMB, ERMNT are three determinants of erythromycin resistance. But as you can see here, now I've just taken that profile matrix and turned it on its side. If you look at the tree, you can see that ERMA, B, and T have very different distributions. B is a great deal, a lot more common than A and T. Okay, so we take this matrix. What happens if we look at this most strongly connected? This most strongly connected other elements to these three erythromycin genes, resistance genes. And so I've highlighted the resistance genes in yellow. Other AMR genes are in red, virulence factors in blue, and then some of these putative or predicted plasmid chunks are in green. And so you can see some of these degrees of connectivity. If you look at ERMB on the left, you can see that there's some implied connection with several different predicted plasmids. Again, there's some uncertainty as to the nature of these plasmids, how different are they. The nature of these plasmids, how different are they? But at least we can start to see these connections emerging. So, one thing that's interesting is that none of the three ERM genes, no pair of them, is associated with each other, although you can see that paths exist. So, they're not strongly correlated, but one is strongly correlated with something that's strongly correlated with something that's strongly correlated with the other. So, it's interesting that there's this sort of honeycomb of relationships. So, we can say, all right, all of these putative plasmids are associated with. Putative plasmids are associated with ERMB, but what do we know about them? So, let me take one example and show you. So, this is plasmid AB369. And so, this tool, MobSuite, basically took 14 contigs from the genome assembly for this particular isolate and identified a few different genes, some associated with vancomycin resistance, some associated with aminoglycoside resistance, and then a whole bunch of. Resistance, and then a whole bunch of other genes, many involved in just plasmids replicating themselves and partitioning themselves and moving themselves around. One thing that's interesting is that this particular plasmid does not have erythromycin or tetracycline genes associated with it. There's a couple possibilities there. One is that those other genes are in fact plasmid associated, but the prediction of the plasmid from short-read sequencing just failed miserably. That's one possibility. The other is that Possibility. The other is that there is a strong association. We see this from the statistics, but they're actually not on the plasmid. So there's a strong association, but it's not because of direct genetic linkage. Okay, and so we can map these, we can look at the context of ERMB. And what's interesting is that across our set of genomes, we see some consistencies. So in these gene order diagrams, ERMB is in red, and you can see the neighborhood of genes upstream and downstream. Neighborhood of genes upstream and downstream, these are pretty much identical. And it's interesting, we see transposases, a lot of unidentified stuff here. Other neighborhoods, we start to see associations with known antimicrobial resistance factors and other genes that are sometimes implicated in resistance. Sometimes we see the same thing just truncated because we have incomplete assemblies, these contigs, but clearly the same thing. Things, but clearly the same thing. And you can keep going. So, again, here's ERMB, but it's again in a context that is different from the others. So, associated with different resistance genes than the others. So, lots of diversity here. Okay, we can do the same thing for tetracyclines. And again, we see patterns of association, including with erythromycin. In some cases, we saw this before, in other cases, we didn't. Okay, one thing that's interesting. Okay, one thing that's interesting about this, I should point out again: so we have these three: TET M, TET L, and TET45 that are associated with each other strongly in this network. But when we look at the distribution here, you can see the presence patterns of TET M, which is relatively common. You can see TET45, which is relatively uncommon, but you can see fairly strong patterns of association there, which we're picking up. But then, if you compare TET45 with TET L, you can see that there's actually negative. You can see that there's actually a negative association there. So that's interesting. We're finding these relationships where, in most cases, either one is present or the other. Okay, so out of this, we can see that these genes are associated with different other genes, different candidate mobile elements. And this is again coming from this single data set from Alberta collected over the span of two years. So there's a huge amount of diversity there. And there's a lot to open up when we take the can opener to try and understand the dynamics. To try and understand the dynamics of these genomes and these genes. Strong positive and negative associations, like I just mentioned. We also see associations with other things like virulence factors. If we look at the bigger graph, some things are quite strongly connected and associated with many different factors. And so teasing that out is going to be really interesting too. Like I said, this is a work in progress. So what else do we have on the go? Well, one thing we're in the process of doing is doing genomic island predictions, predictions of other types. Predictions, predictions of other types of elements, prophages, ice. We're going to add other enterococcus species to the pile, fecalus, which was mainly clinically associated, and heerae, which is mainly agricultural, to look at the broader perspective of the transmission of these things. And then again, trying to prioritize for long read sequencing, looking at presence and absence of elements, phylogenetic diversity, and also trying to get a perspective on habitats. On habitats. Ultimately, when we want to ask questions about transmission, I didn't have much time to talk about these results in part because we're still generating them. But one thing we want to do is to take some of these genes and elements of interest and infer phylogenetic trees to understand their relationships. We can overlay this, we can contrast this with something like a core genome phylogeny, which I've already showed you. We have methods based on something called the rooted subtree prune and regraph distance. Tree prune and regraph distance that we can actually use to compare our core gene tree, our reference tree, with individual gene trees to try and unwind these relationships, these histories of lateral gene transfer. So with the gene information in hand, the plasmid information in hand, and habitats, we'll be able to build a more comprehensive map of who is sharing with whom and across which type of habitat boundaries. So, with that, it just remains me to thank our collaborators. Me to thank our collaborators, both at universities Dalhousie and Simon Fraser, and then the Canadian federal agencies Agriculture, Agri-Food, and the Public Health Agency of Canada. And that's it. Thank you very much. All right. Thanks so much, Rob. We actually do have some time for a couple different questions or one long question, as the case may be. So let Rao take a drink of water there and feel free to. And feel free to pipe up or write in the chat. Well, maybe I'll start with one question. Maybe I missed this. I apologize. I was a little distracted trying to get the recording going, which I didn't do, but it came from above somehow. What kind of statistical cutoffs are you using to draw an edge? To draw an edge? Are you doing, or is there like a, yeah, like what's the null? Is there like a permutation that you're doing, or is there some statistical distribution that you're looking at in order to call an association significant? Yeah, that's an excellent question. And so so far, we've really been focusing just on thresholds that give us the top results, sort of the best likelihood ratios. But with the likelihood ratio test, we can apply the chi-squared distribution and get corresponding p-values. Corresponding p-values. And so the next step is to really look at p-value thresholds and see how that can actually allow us to sort through different things. She's getting a global stage. So yeah, and I think this is important because if you look back at the, let's see if I can guess, slide 12. Nope. If you look back here, it may not be immediately obvious, but if you look at different elements, they have very different mean likelihood ratio values. mean likelihood ratio values. And often this has to do with their distributions on the tree. And so, you know, if something is really confined to a clade, it's very difficult to say are these two attributes evolving independently or dependently. And so the p-value, you know, the sort of statistical test will allow us to better differentiate these things and hopefully get us more robust networks. Cool. Cool. Sounds great. Cool. Sounds great. Any other questions? Can I ask quickly? It's Lindy. I saw you say you said lots of transposases. Is there something interesting there? I'm just inviting you to tell me what you found about transposases. Yeah, so let me see if I can guess this time, 17. 17. So basically, when we take the 14 sort of little contigs that map to this plasmid, none of which is particularly large, we're talking about 10,000 nucleotides and less. The smallest six or seven are all basically, to the extent they're mapping to anything, they're mapping the transposases. So it's one of these cases where the assembly and The assembly in general is not fantastic. And I didn't include the data, but essentially the average N50 for the ECM data set was about 80,000. Right off the bat, you know, lots of repeats and then just essentially catastrophic failure. And so this is a great example of why we're getting terrible plasmid reconstruction. MobSuite is kind of saying, well, we have this reference database, but let's see what we can associate with individual plasmids. With individual plasmids. When it comes down to things like transposes, it's really difficult to make the call. So we don't know whether all of these actually associate with a given plasmid, or they could be elsewhere in the genome, right? Is it just that they're really easy to identify? Are they particularly well conserved? Sorry, they're being quite distracted there. It's horrible. It's horrible. So, yeah, so sorry, you mean in terms of how frequently they're detected? Part of it could just be that there's so many of them in the reference database, right? Plasmids are probably swimming with transposases. Yet, a lot of transposases mapping to a lot of plasmids. And I can't speak to the accuracy of that overall. Overall. But it'll be interesting to get the long read data and see if we can read across a lot of these and more reliable answers. Okay, thanks. Thank you.
