Telling us about why it's really interesting here for Betting Online Arts. Thanks for the introduction, and also thanks for the invitation. So today we'll be speaking on my latest project, which is an analog of Ethereum of Weiss and Williams for embeddings. And then I will tell you about some consequence in the in describing the homotropy type of this space of lung knots. Okay, so here's the setup. Okay, so here's the setup. Um M will always be smooth compact manifold and I will also fix an embedding compact submanifold inside M and I will write a partial 0 of P to be the part of the boundary of P that intersects the boundary of M and And little P will be the handle dimension of P relative to this part of the boundary. Okay, so the first section will be about some context, so I will basically explain the Weiss Wheeler's theorem and also state the analog in foreign metadata. Right, so of course we're all interested in the homotopy type of behavior manifold, right? And then there's this 3D V so isotopy program that tells you that in order to understand this, you might be interested in first approximating it using block embeddings. And these block embeddings are kind of understandable using surgery theory. They are carefully designed. Sergio theory. They are carefully designed, so that surgery theory studies the homotopy type of data. And so, in order to understand the homotopy type of this, it remains to understand the fire of this map, which I will write as modif modif. Mindful. Right, and then there's this little theorem by Bias and Williams. And Williams, which was around the 80s. And it says the following, namely that there exists a map. It's called phi diff from this mock diff, mock diff space to a certain infinite loop space, namely it's the infinite loop space of Space of the following thing. So the desuspension of the smooth, simple white spectrum. No worries if this doesn't make sense, I will explain it now. And there's some kind of weird involution in this spectrum, and you take the orbits off. And then the statement is that this map is highly connected, is about B over 3 connected. Yeah, it's about B over 3 connected. Yeah, it's already already connected. And really what this is not what they show. What they show is the uh the connectivity of of this map is the so-called uh concordance stable range which by a theorem of IUSA is bounded below by this number roughly. Okay, so let me explain what this is. So, maybe recall that the A theory of a manifold, also known as the K theory of the suspension spectrum of its loose phase, this splits as firstly the stable homotopy of M and then there's another factor which we call the smooth quantum spectrum of M. I will shortly stop writing if. And from this point of view, one sees that the lower homotopy groups of this wider spectrum are the following. So it is the well-known wiser group of the fundamental group of M if we're in degree one. It's the reduced k-theory of the fundamental group of m if in degree zero. And in negative degrees, And in negative degrees, because this is collective, is the negative degree of this of M, but it happens to just depend on the final impact group of M. Just a question. So you mentioned here S is white spectrum is something I'm going to just define. Yeah, yeah, so yeah, this is the simple H spectrum. So these are important invariants. So this classifies all H covariance. This classifies all H covariance static at M. This is where wall the wall variant lives, and this kind of classifies so-called bounded each organisms. And in order to define this thing, what we do is forget about this important variant. So the simple smooth white spectrum of M. This is just the appropriate white cover. Cover, but yes, it kills all of us. Okay, and yeah, so any questions about the statement? Yeah, you truncate below, so you can walk off this. Exactly. You should take it you have to cover, right? Yes. Well, I mean, something that yes, yes. I mean, w one thing that is I mean if One thing that is, I mean, if M is simply connected, then the simpleness, I mean, this and this are the same. So that's okay. So this is what I want to say about give you more information. In this talk, I kind of want to advertise a way of understanding embedding spaces in a similar way as we do with this pseudo-sotopy problem. So we may be interested in the embedding space of P into M Of p into m, where we fix this partial zero part of the boundary. And similarly, we can map to a block operation listing. And as before, these block embeddings can be understood using SOI theory. So it remains to understand the fiber of this map of the embedding iota directs. And this thing I will write this. Exist and refer to it as Suisodopian edge. And then the main theorem I wanted to restate, which is due to the initial of my surname, is the following. So it's essentially the same thing as the byte with Ethereum backward embeddings. So there's a map. Let's call it by embeddings. Embeddings. Uh going from this pseudase copy embeddings to again some infinite loop space. And now the notation becomes more complicated. So the twofold desuspension of the smooth Poisson spectrum of the pair n, n minus p. So, how do I define this? Maybe this is just Define this. Maybe this is just the fiber of the smooth white spectrum of m minus p. And the white spectrum is factorial, so it mounts to the same thing for m and this is the fiber, and the reason why there's a minus two is because I've written this in like a relative notation. And from the Weiss-Meam's theorem, we get involutions in these two spaces, which are compatible. So one gets an involution here. So one gets an evolution here, and we have to quotient by this situation of action. And then the statement is that this map is also highly connected, but the connectivity turns out to be much higher than that one. So this is 2d minus P minus five connected as long as E is s or equal minus three. So as long as we're doing we've got images at least three embeddings. We've got to mention at least three embeddings, then this is stable range. Again, what I show is that the connectivity of this map is not this specific number, it's so-called concordance embedding stable range. So embedding stable range, which one could think of as like the connectivity of the structure maps in this, in the infinite loop space of this. Maps in this in the infinite loop space of this spectrum. And then a recent result by people that we should know. So Goodwilly, Pranik and Coopers. They recently showed that whenever a piece list recorded near IMS3, then this is bounded below by this number. And in fact, this range is, I mean, this bound is quite sharp. This bound is quite sharp, so in general one cannot do better than this. Okay. So let me make some remarks about experimental hysteria and why it is useful at all. Ah, so here's some remarks. Just some remarks. Sorry, so that this collimation restriction is only to get this better. Yeah, so in fact, such a map always exists, but in order to get this number, you need that question. So I always enhance. So, firstly, is why should this map file embedding exist? Let me try to convince. Try to convince. So here's a big diagram that I was not, I wanted to prepare before the talk, but I couldn't. So we've got some sort of survey of some my setup extension. So this will map to the block diff mod diff of the conference of PCN. And this will map into the modifier. And then we can use the vice-variance map to go to the loop space of the simple smooth white spectrum of M, C2. And here, sorry, this should be M minus 2. The one for M again. And there's a map like this, and it shouldn't be too difficult to believe that that commutes. So we can take fibers. And the factor of this is something similar to what appears in the theorem. Maybe so it's the two-fold suspension of the simple smooth relative weight spectrum of M and M minus B. M and M minus B. So, really, what changes from this spectrum to the one that appears in that theorem is the appearance of this simpleness condition here. But one can get rid of this. And that's because whenever p is less or equal than d minus three, then the map from m minus p into m is two connected. Right? So, in particular, it's an isomorphism in pi one. Anisomorphism in pi one. But if we got rid of these simpleness conditions here, the map on lower homotopy groups would be an isomorphism because it just depends on the pi one. So therefore we can get rid of that simpleness. And that's why. That's it. And then one can take factors of maps and that's how one may define this kind of. I have a memory that may be wrong. Isn't there an issue with the isotopy extension count that? The high situation extension count in the block case when you don't have a code dimension to say it's not? So, in the smooth case, I think it's fine. Topologically, you need co-dimensional zero. I think. We need a co-dimension assumption also. Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry, yeah, yeah, sorry, yeah, my bad. Oh yeah, yeah, sorry, yeah, yeah, sorry, yeah, my lad. You don't, yeah, exactly. But this you can thicken, yeah, yeah, my lad. You can thicken P here, and that doesn't change this guy over here. So yeah. So the pseudoisotopies and this isotopy embeddings, you don't care too much about the covariment of P inside M. This does, so maybe one has to think and distinct. And for that you need co-immensions. So yeah, you're right. Thank you. So, yeah. You're right. Thank you. Okay. Yeah, so that's how one could define this phi embedding map. But the thing is that these two maps are about B over 3 connected. And in order to raise the connectivity of this map to the number over there, then this is not a way of defining this map. So one has to be a bit more clever. And that's essentially the content of that theorem, improving that much. The second thing that I wanted to The second thing that I wanted to remark is that this thing over here can also be used to our advantage for another thing, which is that by the good-willy Jumpus-McCarthy theorem, the relative A theory of the pair N minus P coincides with the Tc of this pair. And we all believe that TC is much easier to understand than A theory, and in fact it is. So, yeah, this can be used to our advantage for computing the homotopy type of this bad boy version. Something that I should also point out is that in understanding the homotopy type of this infinite loop space, the worst part is not understanding the homotopy type of the spectrum, but rather figuring out what the evolution is. What the evolution is. This turns out to be a pain. If one works rationally, it's much easier to understand by a result of Mauricio Ustarmante Farrell and Jan, but if one wants to get integral results, it is much more difficult. But it's something that I do in the paper for some pieces, so you're welcome to check it out. Okay, so this is all I wanted to say about the statement of the theorem. Are there any questions? Yeah. Any questions? What is T C? T C is topological security formality. Okay, so what range spectrum are you taking T C of? The suspension spectrum of loops, often relative. It's like M relative M minus P. Yeah, okay, but this is just like a map of Loops spectrum. That's what we're doing. Yeah, just taking five. Okay. Okay, so if not, what I will do now is sort of explain how these five maps appear. So and kind of give an outline of how the proof of this theorem and the bison-Williams one go in sort of a parallel way, because the proof is essentially the same as long as. Syng as long as you make this point. So for that, I will have to recall a bit for programming calculators, which was greatly inspired by the Weiss in William Steel. Surely Michael Weiss had it in his mind when he was proving it, but it was not written in these terms at the time. Maybe I will start writing that. So let J zero be the pointed topological category whose objects are finitely dimensional. Are finite-dimensional vector spaces, sorry, inner product vector spaces, spaces over the real numbers. And this is the polyta category, so the morphisms are actual spaces. And the morphism spaces in this category, from a vector space u to a vector space b, is the Stiefel manifold. I don't know how to do it. Stieffold manifold of U into B with To be with a base point added. This is, I mean, this is a bit technical, though we are. And then an orthogonal factor is simply an enriched fighter from this from this orthogonal category to the category of To the category of basic spaces. Okay. So to such orthogonal factor, we can always associate some sort of calculus tower. So let me develop it. So this we can always say some tower of orthogonal functors. So tc of f, t1 f. T2 of F. It goes up indefinitely. And these decays are known as the stages of the tower. And in some sense, they are the best k polynomial approximations to have in a sense that I won't be precise. But when k is 0, this means But when k is 0, this means the best polynomial approximation, sorry, the best approximation to f by a constant factor. So this t0 of f will be the constant factor of the value at infinity, which is just quantitative unit of all the f r's. That's n versus. Okay, and now the game is to try to understand what the layers of of this tower is. And they turn out to have quite a good description. With a good description. So here are this form. Screen of vision now a bit. Where this theta fk is known as the kth orthogonal derivative. Orthogonal derivative, and this is a spectrum, so it's with an okay action, so it's an okay spectrum. And so, for instance, in fact, we will just need knowledge of the tower up to here, so don't worry about this. So, here O1 acts on this mesh diagonally, where it acts by O one as it should do, and then it acts by minus one in this thing, where here S to the B is the one point compactification. Is the one point compactification of the vector space V. So here there's an action by minus one, a point of action, and you act directly. Okay, and maybe I will also need what the description of three type one is. So whenever k is one, this first derivative is a sequential spectrum whose n space is just the fiber from f of Rn. From f of Rn to F of Rn plus 1. And then O1 acts by minus 1 to these two vector spaces and therefore by functoriality on these two spaces. And the fiber also inherits an O1 action. And this yeah, so so the structure maps on this spectrum I won't define, but they are kind of defined using a rotation of a two plane. Rotation of a two plane. Okay, so maybe at this point this is a bit too esoteric for some people. So let me give some examples for their own functors. So my favorite example is the function that sends a vector space v to the classical. Space V to the classifying space of the Osterl group of V. So in this case, the zeroth stage at any vector space V is the constant factor on the value of infinity, which is just EO. And one also realizes that there's a fiber sequence, EO, EO, E plus R, and since the fiber is And the fibrin of this is going to be the b state in that sequential spectrum. And this is just s to the b. So one will see is that the first derivative of this functor is the sphere spectrum with the trigger loss. Okay, so that's one pointer. Another one could be the one that sends Another one could be the one that sends a vector space V to the classifying space of G of V, which is just the automorphisms of the unit sphere inside V. And in this case, Tc of F will be the constant functor with value dg, where G is the atomorphism of the sphere spectrum. And the first derivative by a theorem of Hebliger. By a theorem of F dier is the same for the factor one for PO. So it will also be disfused by two with PO1 actually. Okay, so this is a bit too general. I will now introduce the orthogonal functions that play a role in the Weiss and William theorems. So I sit down with the right. It's impossible to read. Oh, it's simple. Oh, it's simple. What is important? It's fine, but simply block covering numbers. Oh, I'm so sorry. Yeah, thanks. I'll try not to. Yeah, thanks. So there's this third example. So I recall that self-diffeomorphism of m times v, so this is a non-compact manifold, and this is said to be bounded if essentially the Uh if essentially the it is bounded in the B coordinate. If so uh if it doesn't move the B vectors too far apart, so uh in other words if the following set is bounded, so we take we evaluate the diffeomorphism phi at some point M D, and then we project it to the vector space V and we take the distance with D, with the vector V, and this way you. And this ranges over all mb side mt and this subset of r and we ask this to be valid. This is valid. And one can create a space of bounded diffeomorphisms, which I call like this, of m times v. And this is a bit technical. One can define One, I mean, one can define this as a as the realization of some simplicial set, but that's not the right way of doing it if you want to do a formal calculus. But okay, that's very technical way. And this is the space of bounded diffeomorphisms. And in fact, it's a group, so it is the loopable. And we can consider the factor that sends a vector space b to be the boundary of m plus b. And in this case, the T0 is nothing too surprising, it's the morphisms of n plus R infinity which are bounded. But the first derivative happens to be quite cool. It is the desuspension of the white spectrum, the smooth white spectrum of M, with some mysterious overarching. And okay. I would prove this. I'll treat you as a blackboard. Excuse me, what was one function on the second example? Also trivial, sorry. So that's they were sort of hard to do. That's the orthogonal factor that one should consider for the regional vice-agulean proof. The one that one uses for the UM diet I stated is the following, is the functor that sends a vector space v to something similar, embedding is bounded of p times v into n times v. And okay, the way one defines this is just as the fiber of the following. Of the following. So you make it fit into some isotopic extension theorem for all that stuff. And yeah, you define it as the fiber of this map, essentially. It's not the most nice definition, but it gives something. But this is a fiber sequence of around factors. So this will result in the we will. And we would be able to understand what the first derivative of this factor is, and it will be just the fiber of the first derivative surface two, which will be kind of by definition the smooth wavelength spectrum of n minus p with some mysterious overaction as well. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So in here from now on I think P should be thickened into into M so that's not context. So let f be any of the random functor and consider the following diagram. So it starts with T0 of F, the value at 0, and you map to T 0 of F of Rn for N E N. You can use now the tower and go to T1 of F of 0 and T1 of F of Rn. And then we know what organization. And then we know what, okay. I think I raised the tower, but now the Forerunner tower will tell us what the fiber of these two horizontal maps are. They are essentially two infinite loop spaces. Here there's the one-point compactification of Rn, smashed with the first derivative of F, which I write like this now, and then taking BO1 orbits with respect to the. The O1 orbits with respect to the diagonal action, and here similarly is just the homotopy orbits of the derivative. Okay? But now the realization is that this map by definition is an equivalent. So if we take fibers vertically, this will be a point, and the fiber of this, which apparently we should know what it is, happens to be the same as the fiber of this map of infinity traces. Infinity traces. And in order to understand what that is, let me recall that for any vector space V, in this or not category, there's a configuration sequence as follows. So you take the unit sphere inside V plus. This maps into the point plus by sending plus to plus and the whole sphere to the point. And the co-fiber of this is the one-point compactification. And in fact, this is a And in fact, this is a covibration sequence that is O1 equivalent, where here O1 acts antipodally and here it acts by minus 3. And we use this to realize that the 1B is S3RN, this guy is this. Here there's a secret point slash plus. So this is S. is the unit sphere inside Rn, which is Sn minus 1, plus S mash over O1 with the very spherical sphere. Okay, so in particular, the outcome of this discussion is that that map is colorful. And now I will define what the five maps are. Uh so I will define phi n of the factor f to be the following map. It goes from the phi of f of 0 to f of rn. And now what we can do is apply first linear approximations to go to the fiber of t1 of f at 0 to t1 At 0 to T1 of F at Rn. But this fiber is exactly that one over there, right? Which is this infinite little space. It's to be n minus 1 plus mash over O1 with theta F1. And now if we take n to infinity, it shouldn't be too difficult to believe that these maps are all compatible. So this ends up giving a map phi F infinity from F infinity from the fiber of f0 to the value of f at infinity to well what the infinite loop space of S infinity plus which is EO1 because O1 acts antipodally here. So essentially to by definition the homotopy O1 orbits of the first uh spectrum. Uh spectrum. Uh okay, and that's that's one map that one can just construct for any orthogonal functor F. So let's try to see what it is in the cases, in the orthogonal functors that I've introduced before. So example when f is the functor that sends b to sense B to B G D then this phi infinity is phi d f is a map that goes from the factor of f of 0 to f of phi infinity namely g to the infinite node space of its first derivative which was the sphere spectrum with the trivial one actually but this is exactly q plus of r p infinity or b c two and the Or EC2. And then one could realize that this is very similar to a CAN preview map, and in fact, it happens to be so. And this is a CAN preview map. So these five maps happen to be quite interesting for many different orphans. The second one is the one for the bounded. is the one for the bounded diffeomorphism factor. Okay so if f is the function that sends b to be def bounded of f times v, then this phi infinity f will be a map from the phi ref0 to f of r infinity, which I write as diff bounded of m times r infinity. boundary of m times r infinity mod b and this maps into the infinite loop space of this thing right okay and this is not quite the device we have it is very similar but not quite so let's try to connect it uh so for instance the O1 text on the N minus one spheres are interpreted N minus one spheres are integral. Yeah, they're integral. Why in the column do I get the true direction of this? This is the spec over.h01 and suggested. Yeah, because, okay, this is secretly undived, O1. And then if you take n to infinity, this is this becomes PO1 plus, which by definition is the whole of the orbits. Right? Yeah. Yeah, this is secretly undirect because the action is free, so okay right, so here we're missing the simpleness condition, so we can map simple m c 2 and uh we would like to construct uh map on. like this. And in order to connect these two spaces, we introduced space here, where this space is the same thing as above, but for blocked if. So block diff n times r infinity. mod j. And then this includes naturally, and this also does, and the content of the Weiss-Wayer's theorem, part of it is showing that this mod is microbial. And then realizing that the difference between these two spaces happens to be the same as the difference between these two spaces magically. And and by an ad hoc kind of uh uh result they they show that uh one can lift this map to to a map like this. Map to a map like this. And that's how you construct it. But for instance, in the case where M is simply connected, then this is an equivalence and this will also be equivalent. So this map happens to already be the nice view. Okay. And yeah, they prove that this is a cognitive. Finally. One does this for the embedding functor. So for the functor that sends B to, embeddings bounded of B times V, E term minus V, then the following happens. This phi infinity F is exactly phi values. And the reason why this is true is kind of similar to Why this is true is kind of similar to the previous realization that the simple white simple relative white spectrum in the collimation conditions that we had coincided with the non-simple version. So in this case, the map that we would get here would be an equivalence and nothing would change. So that's how one is this map, and it becomes kind of easier in this case. So any So, any questions at this point? Is it actually obvious that you get the same map as in Weiss-Williams, like using this requirement? No, but it is good enough. I mean, no, it is not, but one. Yeah. One can still prove it. So it could be like, yeah. I mean, not at least to me, I don't know. So it's not known yet? Or you've proved it? I know, yeah. So the way I'm going. No, yeah, so the way I'm going to present it, one proves it, but I don't know if this map exactly is the vice plane. Surely it is, but if I may say something, it surely is, but in this vice versa, this was before the authentic. Yeah, it's very often. And it was a little bit improvised. It used, for example, something like groups group structures. It worked with these core search spaces. Yeah. Whereas the mechanics later avoided that. Yeah, in some sense, a deep exactly. Yeah, I mean, the whole point of autonomy, I mean, it gives you a very clean way of setting all of this up, which is quite nice. Yeah. So then let me just explain how one attacks the connectivities of these file maps. And with this proposition, which is that there is a map of fiber sequences as follows. As follows. So here we have the fiber of f of so here's the fiber of f of 0 to f of Rm and then we can use this unstable file map to map to loops infinity of S m minus. loops infinity of S n minus 1 smash over O 1 with the first derivative. This maps, we can do this for one n increased, so the pier of f of 0 to f of R n plus 1 and then the corresponding thing, so seven plus O one theta one and then And then what goes in the base here is just the fiber from f of Rn to F of Rn plus 1, which is by definition the nth space of the nth space of the first orthography. So this would be phi n plus 1f. And the confiner of this map, when you really look faces, or the fiber you spend it, is Is well, Sn minus one includes into Sn as the meridian, and then we collapse that, so we get two a wedge of two n spheres, and this O1 action interchanges them, so the O1 action disappears, and it becomes Sn smash. And then there's a clear map from here to here, which is the inclusion of this n space as. As the C of space of this included loop space. And the content of this proposition is that this diagram commutes, which, I mean, it obviously should, but it is a bit technical. Oh, right. Yeah. So then maybe what I should, let me point it out here. And it is that now how do we attack the stability, the connectivity of this? The connectivity of these phi maps. So the first thing to point out is that phi 0 is an equivalence by definition because both domain and codomain are points. S to the minus 1 is the empty set, so that's a point, and this is also a point. So it is an equivalent. And therefore, if we have some connectivity for this stabilization map, we can just work inductively. We can just work inductively and go upwards and get a connectivity for the fine maps, I mean for the fine finish maps. So if we have a connectivity for the stabilization map, this will give a connectivity for higher 3. Right, and then what I should say is that either Igus's theorem in the diff case or the theorem. Or the theorem of manual Sunder and Bogoturi is exactly the ingredient that one needs to get a lower bound for that study. And yeah, that's kind of essentially the poo. Okay. So yeah, any questions at this point? So enough of what's around calculus. Let's look at some applications. And this will be the applications to spaces of laminars. And what is the space of long nodes? For those that may not know, it's just the embedding space where it's a full power. interface where it's the full boundary of E disk into a D disk. Okay. So what we're going to do is apply this story isotopy program for this particular so we have this fiber sequence having the block part of it. And same for the suizon piece. And let me call this fiber sequence star. Okay, I should write it. So here's the statement, again you to my surname, and is the following. So in this So in this codimension three case, there exist, let's say, explicit virtual DM representations. Let's call these representations rho n, such that if we take this fiber sequence, star, we truncate it We truncate it up to the concordance table range or roughly, so to minus six, and then we invert the point two. Then this thing becomes the following sequence of spaces. So in the middle we have what we were interested in, so we better not change it. These block embeddings become have a nice formula, they become have a nice formula, they become loop P of the fiber of G D minus P model or D minus P into G model. So that's the natural map. And then this pseudoisotopy using this embedding Weiss-Williams has a very nice formula. It splits as a product of infinite loop spaces. Or right, I should say dm here is that I hit all the stuff. So the composites are product over m, at least two, of the infinite loop space of the sphere representation associated to this virtual representation. And then as this is a TM space, we can just quotient by this TM action. And maybe I should point out that this space is not horrible because in Horror because in each degree it is, even though it looks like a product, in each degree it's finally united. And that's because the dimension of these virtual representations is m times e minus e minus 2, which in this co-dimension case is a positive number and it increases by m. So in each degree, it's finally negative. So, this representation is one dimensional. Sorry. What is the dimension of this representation? M times D minus B minus. And from this embedding thing, the one P is the D. So there are one of the P's in your embedding partial thing. Embedding to GP, from GP to GP. Oh, absolutely. It's fine. Yeah. Otherwise, I would have been doing something very cool. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, what means one half inverse? You invert the prime two. So you look. So all of these are default look spaces. Correct. I'm forgetting the most exciting part of the statement. Which is that not only that is a fiber sequence, but if we truncate and invert the fiber 2, it is a split fiber sequence. This is split. If P is at least two, or after looking once if P is one. And that's and that's the statement. That's a correct a type of you truncate it. You want to truncate, not take a connective colour. Oh, we have uh thanks. Uh right. Uh okay. So it splits as like a Pfold loop space like that? No, it's spaces. Okay. Yeah. And yeah, this I'm not sure. No, probably is I'm not sure. No, probably it's okay. I'm not sure, but maybe it's important that we okay, so let me just say some remarks about this statement. First is Thirdly, is why does the block embeddings become this? So, from the block embeddings, one realizes that block embeddings of d into dd is equivalent to loop speed of block embeddings of a point into dd minus p. And that's essentially because if you have a p-fold family of block embeddings, you can graph them together and get an embedding. them together and get an embedding of DP into DD and block is carefully designed so that that thing is an equivalent. Maybe the second thing that I should say is that the splitting result is analogous to a result of Bouglia letter. Is analogous to Uh where they show that for certain manifolds uh uh as long as you restrict to the concordant stable range and you work to, then the if you're morphisms of that manifold it's a splot diffeomorphisms and block diffomorphisms. Excuse me, I didn't understand the statement of Ethereum. So you say that this space is what it is. And I didn't see this one. Ethereum. I just don't understand the statement. There exists explicit. There exists explicit representations. Yeah, so there are representations. I'm trying to describe the homotopy type of this space. And this is a fiber sequence which is split. So in particular, the homotopy groups of this are the ones of this plus the ones of this. So this is a certain range or it's? Up to the range that I've truncated. So up to 2D minus B minus 6. That's because we're going to stable range for to get the. Yeah, to get this thing. And you're averting too because of the involution causing problems. Exactly. Exactly. In fact, the space in the convex is not the same as the star space, so the one which you have. It starts the sequence, sorry. Yeah, yeah. Truncate is the sequence. I truncate the whole sequence. Okay, okay. Now I just need to use transcription to the sequence. I see. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Maybe the third thing I want to say is exactly what John has pointed out. The fact that I invert the prime two is because an involution is horrible and trying to analyze it with full coherence is very hard. And if one inverts the prime two, then an involution you can always treat as a homotopy involution, which is essentially a map whose squares homotopy to identity. And then everything becomes as a square. And maybe the last thing. Maybe the last thing is that this species of long nuts have been studied very recently by a lot of people. So to name a few, Aron Turchin, John Hess, will be the device. But the statement I want to recall is the one by Kesse, Turchin and Gilbacher. And they essentially completely describe the homotopy groups of this rationally. So they show that, here it's here. They show that the rational homotopy groups of something called embeddings bar, not block. So this is the timer of map from the maps from embeddings to immersions. So dp into dd are roughly To dB rationally, this is exactly the homology of some graph complex. So it's the homology shifted by P of the Harry graph complex degree P T. But every, I mean, this graph complex decomposes by its order. So equal to 1, 0 of Of the Graphic complex, G loop. And what I wanted to point out is that this theorem exactly recovers this only up to the zero on one loop order. So this theorem recovers this up to loop order. And maybe And maybe in words, say how. So before we move it, I just want to comment that actually the sequence you have here, the last two terms are exactly the same as the EF sequence. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is exactly this. Yes, yes. Right, so this part over here roughly recovers the 0 loop part. Loop, but this thing over here roughly recovers the first degree of the one loop part and this product of infinite loop spaces recovers the rest of one range of qualities in the range of degrees lengths. In the range of degrees, then, yeah, exactly. But that's what I wanted to point out. That's what I wanted to point out. This one loop part, I mean, it exists forever. And then this suggests a rational splitting of the biceps plot. So this suggests that over the rational numbers, this phi embedding slap from what is it? The pseudo-set of the embeddings of d into dd into this product of Into this product of infinite loop spaces, this has a rational splitting. And yeah, that's what the calculations suggest. And it would be quite interesting to understand what the integral picture of this of this thing is. Like, yeah. I mean, I'm not I I've tried to produce a splitting, but it's it's pointless, but yeah. But it's it's pointless, but yeah. I think yeah, that's probably all I wanted to see. Thank you. Okay, any questions? Yes. I have a, we would have thought that the trivial case of that theorem where P is zero, right? P is zero. Which I assume the theorem is true when P is zero. Yeah, so and the total space Then the total space is contractible. Yes. And that's telling you that the fiber looks like a loop space of the base in the range, right? But the base is something that was studied by Heifliter in a certain stable range. So you're getting a description of that stable range, which I don't, I mean, that seems new to me. I think after that range, this theorem doesn't say anything. It doesn't say anything. Yeah, because the 2d minus p is below the hefier range already. Yeah. Braph complexes that describe the homotopy type of these embeddings analysis. There was always this wondering whether you could define them integrally and does it capture the homotopy type integrally. And I was wondering if you could sort of check that with your theorem in this range, like whether you have. In this range, like whether you have tried this or not. That would be great, but I don't know that much about graph complexes, unfortunately. But yeah, it would be very nice. Yeah. So the follow-up to this is, do you see, if you don't work rationally, but only with two inverted, do you see more classes showing up than what you see rationally? Yeah, definitely, definitely. Like, for instance, this, if you localize at some prime that is co-prime to 2n, then the homotopy groups of that And then the homotopy groups of that interlock space are just the DEM co-invariance of the stable homotopy. So you see a lot more. And yeah, I got some calculations of the prime 3 of some of this. So by dimension of rhyme, you mean the homological degree or you mean the virtual dimension of the representation. The virtual dimension of the representation? Virtual dimension of the degree. Yes. So it is really like the both as a degree, but So, what is the? What does it say? M times D minus P minus D. What is the homological degree? So, if you have representations, there are two things. It's a graded vector space, right? So, first you have the gradient. Is it concentrated on one gradient? Or is it concentrated on several gradients? I'm not sure I can't answer. So, we can consider gradient vectors. We can consider the, if you take the. Can consider the if you take the pieces, it's got to be a certain topological degree and also the dimension of the vector space. So I think all I can say is that the virtual dimension of this representation is this. Yeah, maybe let's discuss. But virtual dimension, so what do you mean by virtual dimension? So it's, I mean, it's like a representation where you allow to invert some actual representation. That makes sense completely if you take the special complex. But all I have to say is multiple degree or not? Yeah. Okay, but you need to do some kind of shift, not some kind of suspension shift. Yeah, I mean this is the sphere spectrum of the virtual representation. I mean, one thing that you can do is suspend it enough so that the virtual representation is not virtual. I'm kind of curious to see what exactly is virtual. I'm going to read one question from the chat, and then we'll do one more, and then we'll go to lunch because we're starting out at one. So John Rockner asked, in Hedgehog's 1978 standard precedings paper, he describes a filtration of block automorphisms relative to automorphisms with layers given by concordance spaces and associated homotopy spectral. An associated homotopy spectral sequence, the same as the C2 for the other spectral sequence apparent in the Weiss Williams there. Is there a similar filtration of block embeddings velocity embeddings by degree of unblockability with layers given by components embeddings? Yeah, I would expect that for sure. Making this explicit, make it easy to show that the maps phi agree, it might also help to get the sign-up name solution right. Maybe. I mean, what I thought about that. What I thought about that in order to get a splitting of this map. And it gets a bit more clear how to do it, but not complete. But yeah, it is definitely useful. One more question. Do you get like an interesting Weiss-Williams theorem with U1 orbits if you do it in unitary calculus? And you stabilize by complex vector spaces? Yeah. I haven't thought of it. Spaces? Yeah. I haven't thought about it, but maybe, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. That's uh, I'm going to go to the next one.
