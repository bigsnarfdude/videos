We're happy to have Jonathan Gravesby from the University of Nevada, Reno, who will tell us about interpretations of the truncated Picard spectra of KU and KO. Take it away. Thank you, Anna Marie. Hi. Hi to everyone. I haven't been paying attention to anyone who's actually physically here. Hello. And thank you for inviting me. This is, as I said, is absolutely. Is absolutely beautiful, gorgeous here. I'm really loving it. Okay, so I want to talk about the Picard spectra of KU and KO, and to some extent about twisted K theory. I should say this is, as written here, joint work with Jack Maraba and Kiran Luca. Kiran is amazing and on the job market this year. So if you have a job to give, To give, give it to him. Okay, anyway, so okay, so let's start out just defining the very most basic objects here, which are Picard spectra. So maybe I'll start over here. So the basic data that we're going to start with is some commutative ring spectrum. And And if you're the sort of person that likes very specific things, then we can take this to be a E infinity algebra in the infinity category of spectra. So this is going to have a symmetric monoidal category of modules which Which is pretty standard. So, modules over R, there's a tensor product over R, and then R, of course, is the tensor unit. And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to define, pick R to be the subcategory of invertible R. Of invertible R modules and only equivalences between them. So that's some sub-category, some sub-infinity category, if you like. A couple things to note right off the bat. Pick R. Pick R is an infinity groupoid, aka space, or if you prefer, an anima. Right, so actually, perhaps instead of space, I should say homotopy type, something like this. But this is immediate from the fact that I've taken the equivalences between the objects. But the nice thing, I mean, it's sort of one of my favorite things. But the nice thing, I mean, it's sort of one of my favorite things about working with quasi-categories is that one can sort of consider categories and spaces on the same footing now. So this is some space and an infinite loop space. So it's an infinite loop space because it inherits a symmetric monoidal structure from this ambient category. And I mean, at least intuitively, if you think about it, tensoring to invertible R modules. Tensoring two invertible R modules should give you another invertible R module. It's group-like because the invertible R modules form a group because they're invertible. So it's this very nice infinite loop space. A couple bits of notation about it. Because it's an infinite loop space, I'll write lowercase pick R for the associated spectrum. For the associated spectrum. And I will write BGL1R for the subspace of pick R. Well, let's say it this way: the connected component of the base point. So, you know, it has a base point because it's an infinite loop space. So it's a monoid. But in particular, we know specifically in this case, it's the connected component of R itself. So R is an invertible R module. So it's just R and equivalences from R to itself. And this will have an associated spectrum as well, which again, I'll just denote using lowercase letters. All right. All right. So, I don't know, a sort of moral here is that pick R classifies twists of our theory. And it depends on who you ask, right? I mean, you could sort of say, Of say, uh, if I were writing a paper, uh, I would simply say that a twist of R theory is a map from X to pick of R. But there's a reason that you might believe this, which is that a map from X to pick R is, and of course, this is an infinity groupoid, so. Yeah. I cannot see any photos I see that is not. Oh, on the green? Okay. Ah. I think it's the light because I can read that green board much better than I did. That one's readable. Okay, so let's. Yeah. What happened? Maybe if we just filter, it's is that better? Close the window? I don't know. Oh, it's the overhead light. Ah, okay. Oh, it's the overhead light. Ah, okay. Okay, so just don't use it. I guess. Okay, yeah, no problem. Thanks. So, anyway, this is a bundle of invertible R modules, and that seems like a pretty natural thing to twist R theory by, if you like. But let me maybe give you a slightly more compelling example. So it turns out that there is a map. There is a map of infinite loop spaces from KZ3 into pick of KU. And well, you'll see where this shows up later when we talk about pick of KU. But what this lets me do is it lets me take all the sort of classical twists of K-theory that you might get from, you know, Dixmier-Duati theory, bundle gerbs, whatever you like. Bundle gerbs, whatever you like, and actually import them into these what I might call homotopical twists of K-theory. So this is essentially the sort of universal receptacle for twisted K-theory. Is that okay? Oh, different K's. Say again? Different K's. Oh. K's. Oh, yes, yeah, absolutely. So, this is topological K-theory. This is the Eilenberg-MacLean space. So, maybe I should write B3Z rather than KZ3. Okay, so these pick of KU and pick of KO are what I want to understand. In particular, I'm going to want to understand their relationships to some very classical things. And it turns out to do that, I really only need to look at the low homotopy groups of these things. So let me make some definitions just to save us time. I'm going to write E sub U. That's going to be. That's going to be the spectrum. Well, I'm going to take the Picard spectrum of Ku, and then I'm going to truncate it. I'm going to kill the homotopy groups above degree three. And then EO is going to be the same thing, but for KO. And, well, I'm going to truncate it at two instead for. Said for reasons. Okay, so I've got these two spectra. So, a couple of things to note, and this is maybe either a proposition or something that one might already know, so it's relatively classical, which is that if I take the underlying space of this EO, this is going to be the same. This is going to be the same as pick of KO, the space truncated at two. And then, and the sort of, well, there's two pieces of information that are going to go into this. So what this comes out to be as a space is Z mod eight cross, okay, now I have to translate my Eilenberg-McLean spaces into D-loopings. So I think, let's see, just BZ mod two. BZ mod two cross B two Z mod two. So it decomposes as a space and then something similar happens for Eu. Again, this is just, well, I won't write it again. It's the three truncation of the card space, which is now going to be Z mod 2 cross BZ mod 2 cross B3Z. And there's that B3Z. And there's that B3Z happening. That's precisely sort of this where these twists live is in this decomposition. Although it takes a little more work, as I've said, there's a sort of splitting of spaces. It takes, you know, you need to sort of fiddle around with things to make sure that that map is a map of infinite loop spaces, but it works out that way. And so let me just clarify. This is as As spaces, very much not as infinite loop spaces. And that's sort of the whole point of what we're doing. So let's see. I started five minutes late or something like that. Yeah. Eh, three minutes, whatever. Okay. Okay. So it follows pretty immediately. It follows pretty immediately from this. Oh, there's a message in the chat. Let's see, what does it say? Oh. Oh, that's from an earlier, something about the diffeomorphism group. I was concerned there. Okay. So it follows pretty immediately that as sets E O zero, apologies. O zero, apologize, of some space is going to be the zeroth homology of x with coefficients in z mod 8, the first cohomology of x with coefficients in z mod 2 cross h two x z mod two and then e u zero of x 0 of x is going to be h 0 of x z mod 2 h 1 of x z mod 2 cross h 3 of x z. So this is certainly true as sets, but again, because as I said, this is not, these are not splittings of infinite loop spaces, this isn't telling me what the group structure is on these two things. And sorry, I forgot to mention the fact that you have a Z mod 8 here and a Z mod 2 here. A ZMOD 8 here and a Z mod 2 here is a computation. There's a Z mod 8 I know is Matthew and Stoyanoska. I'm not sure. It might be the same for Z mod 2. And then, but then this, once you get rid of pi 0, the splittings, these splittings are classical and go back at least to May. So that's old news. Old news. All right. So, what I want to talk about is the group structure here. And that's essentially the theorem. So, one thing about this theorem, the way that I'm going to state it is. State it is what I can say is we know all of the K invariants for EU very specifically. We know the first K invariant for EO and the second one we almost know, but, or rather, there's sort of two possibilities, and it's not clear yet how to differentiate them. But in determining the group structure, it ends up being irrelevant. So the theorem here is that all the k invariance, well, all the possible k invariants, all the possibly non-zero k invariants of EU and EO are non-trivial. Moreover, Moreover, they induce the following group structures. So for EO, what we get is that if you take ABC and you add it to A prime, B prime, C prime, you get You get A plus A prime, B plus B prime, C plus C prime, but then you introduce this little twist at the end of B cup, B prime. And then, whoa, EU, and actually I guess I should say EO0, EU0, ABC plus A prime, B prime, C prime. Again, in the low degrees, it's just the direct sum group structure. But then in this last degree, it's C plus C prime plus the Boxstein of B times B prime. So those are the group structures. And if you know twisted K theory, these group structures are probably pretty familiar. So let me say why. So, let me say why should this be interesting? Why are these group structures interesting? Well, these groups have very interesting geometric interpretations. So I'm starting with something entirely homotopy theoretic. I'm saying, you know, this should know about twists of K-theory. And then I'm going to produce these groups. And then what you can say is these are precisely the groups containing sort of. The groups containing sort of known classical twists of K-theory. So, or maybe I should say something like a consequence of this. So let me write something like E0O slash U. It's not O mod U. I apologize for this notation. I just don't. This notation. I just don't want to have to write the same sentence twice, switching out O and U. So, first of all, this is isomorphic to the Brouwer group of Z mod 2 braided continuous trace C star algebras. With spectrum X, different spectrum here. This isomorphism here is, well, in the complex case, it's from Ellen Maycock's theorem thesis. And then the real case is Mutuo thesis, his thesis. Okay. Okay, C-star algebra's twist K-theory via this, you know, K-K theory. By the way, also, if you know the Donovan Karumi story, then you've seen these before. This is, these are, except here I'm not taking torsion, but if you ignore that part, then these are the Brouwer-Wall groups of Donovan and Karubi, which also twist K-theory. This is also isomorphic to, yeah. Ah, sorry, continuous trace real/slash complex C star algebras. Thank you. And so next we have isomorphism classes of Z mod two graded Real or complex, what are called two lines. So, a two line, you can think of it essentially as an. So, if you take complex, super, well, complex or real Z mod two graded vector spaces, this is a symmetric monoidal category. And so you can talk about categories. And so you can talk about categories which are modules over it. And then you can take the invertible such ones. That's one way to talk about what a two-line is. Of course, all of those are also just the same as categories of modules over Azimaya algebras. So there's a connection. There's a sort of the same type of data. This shows up in a lot of places. Certainly in Dan Freed's notes, this sort of description shows up sort of really A sort of really concrete description of this group is in this paper of Christo Matthias and Conrad Waldorf. And then finally, and this is really not distinct from the second line here, but you get pi zero of the groupoid of either KO or K. Either KO or KU twists that shows up in Freed, Hopkins, and Telemon's work. So, sort of all of these things that are showing up in twisting K-theory are living in this truncated K-theory spectrum. Spectrum. Ah, and perhaps I should have said complex two-line bundles on X depends on X here. Questions, concerns? Vesna says it's pretty much all old news. Fair enough. All right. So, okay, so yeah, so this is all this stuff is indeed relatively well known. But let me point something else out, which is that let's assume for now that X is connected. Oh wait. Vesna says, Vesna says, I'm sorry, it reads very badly after 10 minutes. So I guess it was perhaps in response to something very specific. Oh, did I? Okay. Oh, I mentioned Vesna. Oh, oh, oh, okay. Okay, so we're going back to that. Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay. Anyway, so if we suppose X is connected for a second, then, well, let me just do the complex case. Well, let me just do the complex case now. The same thing holds for the real case. But so this thing, the zero thing, actually, let's not put zero there yet. This is going to be the same as BGL1 of KU zero three zero of X But one thing you can do is you can work out that this thing here is actually equivalent to BGL1 Ku of, so the two truncation of Ku, where here it no longer matters if I put, you know, connected or, I mean, I might as well put connected, but Ku theory of X. So one sort of interesting consequence of this is that all of this data here, and this is something I don't really This data here, and this is something I don't really understand. Any one of these pieces of data is a KU02 line bundle on X from the point of view of parameterized homotopy theory. So I don't know. This is all just formal abstract isomorphisms and equivalences, but I would love if someone could tell me how to take a line bundle of truncated KU theories and produce something like And produce something like a super two-line bundle on X, something like that, or a graded bundle gerb, any of these sorts of equivalent formulations of this sort of thing. Okay, so that's, I don't know what's going on. I mean, this is, there are gonna be a lot of questions here. I don't know why that's what that means. Here's another thing, which I suspect people here. Which I suspect people here are more likely, or well, people here probably can tell me about that. But here's something which I really think people here can maybe tell me something about. So here's another proposition, or really it's a corollary of the main theorem, which is that if you take BGL1 of Ku 03, which remember is equivalent to BGL1. KU02. This is equivalent to the fiber of the seven connected cover of B string to BSO. And similarly, BGL1 of KO, again, now I can pull that truncation inside so I get KO01. This is equivalent as infinite. This is equivalent as infinite loop spaces to the fiber of B spin to B O. So this is telling me if I have some, well, let me, maybe I'll just, I'll draw the picture. This is telling me about twisting string and spin structures now. So lifts. Lifts, let's say X to, I've got some X to B S O B string. So I can ask for a lift like that of an SO structure. Alternatively, I can ask for a lift like this. So lifts of this form are torsors. For the group of Ku02 bundles on X and the group of KO01 bundles on X, respectively. So, in some sense, this is a very sort of similar question to what we just described, which is that there are all sorts of ways of twisting string structures. This really saying this really relies on this work of Corbett Reddin, where he shows that lifting from B spin. Shows that lifting from B spin to B string, such lifts are torsor, is a torsor for just KZ3, for just homology, the third integral homology group. And we're sort of extending this a little bit more. It's just that you can't just sort of take the direct sum of the two intervening homotopy groups. There's this twist introduced by the infinite loop space structure. All right. Going very fast. And the final consequence. Oh, well, perhaps I should say, by the way, that the fact that you do have these equivalents. Have these equivalences. One other thing that this implies is that M string to MSO and M spin to MO. Both of these are Hafgawa extensions in the sense of, well, John Rognes and Catherine Hess have written extensively about. Catherine Hess have written extensively about such things. In other words, there's sort of a generalization of a Galois extension in which you replace the Galois group with a Hopf algebra, with a bi algebra. In this case, the relevant bi-algebras are that space and that space. And the reason that they're bi-algebras is because these are both infinite loop spaces. So they have a multiplication, but they're infinite loop space. But they're infinite loop spaces. So they're commutative monoids in a category of co-monoids. So this is another way to sort of phrase this is to say that MSO is a quotient of M string by an action of this group right here. And similarly for MO. And then you can say all kinds of things about descending from MSO to M string and from MO to M. MSO to M string and from MO to M spin and so forth. All right, now the sort of, well, one more corollary, but this is going to sort of require some buildup. So let me just remind you of a couple things here. So we have a few cohomology theories. So IQ star of X, what that's going to be, it's going to be defined level wise as hom from pi, let me just mess up the degrees here. Yeah, well, this is one, this one's actually not bad, pi negative star of x into q. These are all sort of duality functors. This one, IQZ, is just brown common its duality. Pi negative star of x into q mod z. These are both cohomology theories. They both satisfy Brown representability. So we can define another thing. Another thing, IZ to be the fiber of the inclusion of from IQ into IQ Monzi. And this thing right here is called the Anderson dual of the sphere spectrum in particular. To clarify what I mean by dual here, all of those things induce functors from spectra to spectra. So in particular, we have functors. Well, let's just, we only need one here. One here. We have a functor i sub z going from spectra to spectra defined by you want to take the spectrum x to the mapping spectrum of x into this, well, overloading notation here into this thing I defined Iz before. So we just write, you take IZ and you apply it to the sphere spectrum. IZ, and you apply it to the sphere spectrum, we just call that IZ. That's the Anderson dual of the sphere. Why might you care about the Anderson dual of the sphere? Well, this thing shows up, seems to show up in mathematical physics, sort of surprisingly. Oh. So Fried and Hopkins make a hypothesis. Make a hypothesis about the role that this thing plays, or one of the roles it plays. It also, well, let me write this and then I'll tell you what it also does. So they basically say the following: A continuous, invertible two-dimensional. Two-dimensional extended topological field theory with a structure group or rather symmetry group H is a map from From you want to take the double suspension of the Madsen-Tillman spectrum to the triple suspension. Now, you could just write triple suspension of IZ here. I didn't mention this. IZ is co-connective. So it has a whole bunch of stuff happening in negative degrees. This is connective, though. So it's going to ignore the stuff in negative degrees, but just to make this really. But just to make this really sort of explicit, I'm going to write IZ, I'm going to co-truncate at negative 3. And then I'm going to write infinity here, but of course, that's going to stop at 0. So I could write 0 or infinity. So this is this thing, and higher suspensions of it are supposed to control higher-dimensional field theories. Dimensional field theories. This thing also shows up, and ask Danielle if you want to know more about this in SRE phases, which I'm certainly not going to attempt to say anything at all about. But that's also showing up in work of Dan Freed. And so then the corollary here. Ah, well, maybe. Here. Ah, well, maybe I should tell you what the homotopy groups of this thing are, at least abstractly. So, pi i, it turns out that Anderson duality, because of its construction, which I've now erased, is sort of there are tools to compute the homotopy groups of Anderson duals of things. So, in this case, what do we get? Well, as I said, it's co-connective, so it's zero if I. It's co-connective, so it's zero if i is greater than zero. It's the integers if i is equal to zero, it's zero if i is negative one, and then in lower degrees, make sure I get my indexing right here now, comm of pi one minus i, there's this sort of shift of s q mod z for i. mod z for i less than negative one. And so this is just the brown combined's dual living down here. All that this sort of construction of the Anderson dual has done has sort of changed what's happening in degree zero. And well, and I guess introduce this little empty spot here. And so let's write out what that is for at least a few degrees. So pi, let me write pi negative star of IZ, so I'll write these in descending order. Descending order. It starts with Z, then it's zero, then you're going to get a Z mod 2, then you're going to get a Z mod 2, then you're going to get a Z mod 24, and then you're going to get other things. And well, that is something we've already seen. And the non-triviality of the k-invariance of the sphere spectrum is going to tell me. Spectrum is going to tell me that the k-invariance of this chunk of the Anderson dual of the sphere are also non-trivial. And I should add, these spectra are so small once you take these truncations that there's not, there aren't that many degrees of freedom in computing these k invariants. You know, the second k invariant of pick ku, once you know that it's non-trivial, there Once you know that it's non-trivial, there are four possibilities. Well, three possibilities. It's a Zmod four. There's three possibilities right off the bat. One of them doesn't work because it would induce, essentially, it would induce the sort of trivial symmetry on super two-line bundles, if you like. And so then you've got two remaining. And one really interesting thing is that those two both give you the same spectrum. You have an equivalence of Posnikov. An equivalence of Posnikov towers, and that switch is basically complex conjugation. So there's something very interesting here that I would like to know about, which is encoding both all of this data inside of the Picard spectrum, the sort of C2 equivariant Picard spectrum of Kr theory. And I don't, that would be very nice if anyone wants to do that. Okay, so. Okay, so the point is then, the corollary is that indeed pick of Ku 03. So this again, remember, was my EU. This is, this spectrum is equivalent to sigma 3 of IZ negative 3. So So, I don't know what this means. You know, it seems one could simply say, well, look, there aren't that many homotopy groups here. This is just coincidences. But all of these things are showing up in the same place, roughly. It also happens that this is a chunk of KO, if you prefer, same K invariance. K invariance. I think that's a coincidence, but maybe not. I mean, that's also sort of lingering around here. One sort of nice thing about this is that it seems like in the literature, KO is used in this setting. And no one can really seem to be able to give sort of a reason for KO showing up there. But this, this is completely natural, at least in the setting of twists of K theory. Setting of twists of K theory. I mean, this is what you should be getting there. You should be getting something that twists K theory. This, I have no idea what's going on, though. This is somehow telling me about topological field theories when I map into it from these Tom spectra. This is somehow telling me about super two-line bundles or bundle gerbs on spaces. And certainly, one might expect from a two-dimensional field theory to get. Field theory to get a super two-line bundle, but I don't know how to link those two things together. So that's something I'd be very interested in understanding better. And perhaps to be more precise, what's actually happening here, you can work this out, is that there is a generator of pi zero. So you take, now I'm using the fact that Anderson duality is a functor. I'm taking. Duality is a functor. I'm taking the Anderson dual of the negative three suspension of, let's just write it this way, Eu. This induces an equivalence after truncation. And there's a funny degree shift happening here because of truncation. I wrote trunctation. There's a funny degree shift happening here because. Degree shift happening here because of the way Anderson duality behaves. So the truncation here is actually S02. Okay, we're doing fine. Any comments, questions? Okay. So maybe I'll leave you with a bit of wild speculation. Or, I mean, I don't know. Either this is completely wild or it's, you know, completely. Completely wild, or it's completely just the most natural thing you could ask next. So it's either domestic, you know, I'm not sure which one it is, but it seems interesting. It'd be interesting to know why this is false, if it is false. Both of these sides here, I mean, this in some sense, obviously, I could just shift this up one more and ask about. This up one more and ask about classifying three-dimensional TFTs. And I'd need to take this to be negative four. But this also has a very natural sort of shift up, which is to replace it with the Brouwer spectrum. And there's a reason, I mean, there's, I probably won't have time to sort of get into all the reasons. I think this is reasonable, but a sort of, you know, conjecture would be that if you take the Brouwer spectrum. That if you take the Brouwer spectrum of Ku and you truncate it now at four, then this should be equivalent to the fourfold suspension of IZ negative four infinity. There's one really easy way to disprove this. Way to disprove this. Well, okay. One really direct way to disprove this, which, as I far you know, as far as I know is actually not easy at all, which is to tell me what the Brouwer group of Ku is. So this would imply that pi zero of the Brouwer group of, or rather, pi zero of the Brouwer spectrum, hence the Brouwer group, is Z mod 24. Mod 24. 24 shows up a lot in this sort of setting when you start talking about these sort of higher dimensional field theories and so forth. Some people, so for instance, if you really take all of this, just if you just, you know, swallow it, hook, line, and sinker, then this should be telling me something about super three lines. And And nobody knows what a super three line is, but whatever it is, people think that there should probably be, well, they think that there should be 24 squared of them because that shows up in TMF and people want, you know, lovely chromatic picture here. But unfortunately, we don't know of a single non-trivial element. We don't know of a single non-trivial element of the Brouwer group of Ku. So if you can find one, we might have a foothold into this kind of thing. So that's one picture. And then if you really want, just go nuts with this. There are higher Brouwer spectra, right? Because one way to construct this Brouwer spectrum here is now to take invertible modules over L mod of Ku. Well, that's a Of Ku. Well, that's a symmetric monoidal three category, some of the two categories, you know, and then so then you can take modules over that, and that would give you sort of the next level, and you could ask if that, how that corresponds to shifts of the Anderson dual. I really don't know. The other thing that's coming up here, though, which is why you might believe that even if you get into Z mod 24 and you Into Z mod 24, and you sort of lose track of TMF in there. One reason that you might believe this is still capturing something of the chromatic picture is that, oh gosh. So you can build the K-theory of connective KU out of super two lines. And, you know, so the Brouwer group of Ku Group of Ku is closely related to the Picard group of the K-theory of Ku. And if we believe that K-theory increases chromatic height, then we're still getting something about sort of level chromatic height two here. And then again, you can just sort of widely start wildly speculating about K of K of Ku, so on and so forth, and higher dimensional super n lines. So, yeah. Please, somebody tell me whether or not this is clearly false. But okay, maybe that's good enough. Thanks. Oh, yeah, you need my microphone. Yeah. Any questions? We'll start with questions here from the audience, and we'll have them. Yeah. Can you tell us something about other K-theories? I mean, real K-theory. Can you repeat the question? Okay, so the question was, I believe, can I say something about other K-theories, in particular, real K-theory? I cannot. I would like to. So I mentioned this thesis of El Khayyum Mutuo, who wrote about, he wrote about real great. He wrote about real-graded C star algebras. What he really wrote about was real graded C star algebras with an involution. So he really did this sort of C star algebra approach to KR theory. And I 100% believe that there is a relationship here and that you could restate all of these things in terms of real K-theory. And that, you know, ideally. So here's a really simple question. So here's a really simple question, a question I currently have posted on Math Overflow, which is that I've got the 0,3 truncation of pick Ku, and I've got the 0,2 truncation of pick KO. Is there some kind of slice of pick of KR, some sort of slice truncation of pick of KR that will, the underlying spectrum will be the three truncation of pick KU, and the fixed point spectrum will be the two truncation of pick KO. That seems like something people That seems like something people know how to do. I don't know how to do it, but it seems like something people would know how to do. So that would be a start to understanding that. I can also, our methods also allow us to say something about the algebraic K-theory of the complex numbers and the algebraic K-theory of the real numbers with the discrete topology now. And you get things that also show up in Freed's work. Show up in Freed's work. It's just that, I mean, basically, so in the complex case, you're usually looking at something like, you know, Z mod 2, Z mod 2, and then you'd like to have something here like C cross. And so if you've got the discrete topology on the complex numbers, then these are going to be the first three homotopic. Are going to be the first three homotopy groups of just K of C. And yeah, Fried gives a physical interpretation of this. But then if you pay attention to the topology, then you're getting an S1 here, which bumps up into a Z in degree three. So, and I believe our methods show that these K invariants here are also going to be non-trivial. Also, going to be non-trivial. And I think probably for any field you like. So that was just spurred by you saying the words other K-theories, and it's maybe not related to your question at all. Anything else? I just want to make sure I understood why you truncated at three. It's not because the rest of the Picard spectrum doesn't make sense as twists. It's just because that covers all the commonly used twists. Commonly used, Twist, is right. That's right. There's another reason, though, which is here's another question for you. Yeah, ah, sorry, sorry. Yeah, so Omar asked, essentially, you know, what's the reason you truncate KU at three? You know, one reason might just be to say, well, look, when I do that, I get all this stuff that I know about classically. Another very natural reason, though, is that BGL1 of KU03 splits. 03 splits off of BGL1KU. So there's a very infinite loop space. So there's a very natural splitting that lives right there, which is compelling on its own. All of this is just tantalizing. I don't know if pick KU03 splits off of PIC KU. And as far as I know, the people who know these things very well also don't know if that's the case. So that would be another really nice. Really nice result that could sort of add to some understanding of this. Anybody online want to have it have a question? Yes. Hello. Is that Jack? Yeah. Yeah. Hey, what about this map from HZ3 to PIC of KU that you mentioned early on? It early on. Oh, okay. Let's see. So, in some sense, like, where is it coming from? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Let's see if I can do this off the top of my head. Come from the specific PL1. So certainly, as there's a, there's a sort of, it includes, you know, into this product as spaces, if you like. Um to get it as an infinite loop space inclusion, you have to be a little bit clever with your with your truncations and so on. I don't care about that. That just is a map. Oh, like what is the map? Yeah. Oh, so it's it's um so you've got, you know, Z mod two cross BZ mod two cross. BZ mod two cross B three Z. And it's just point cross point cross B three Z going into there. And I'm using the fact, of course, that these are infinite loop spaces, so have canonically chosen base points. But that's, and classically, that's what people have worked with. You know, they twist K theory. Well, yeah, right. K-theory. Well, yeah, right. Topological K-theory by classes in integral third homology. Yeah. Right. But that's the truncation, right? And you said that it also exists as a map to pick KU that lives this. Ah, okay. So let me, so, okay, so this is fine. If you want it as a map into the whole thing, then you've got to do this one. Where now you're using that splitting to make sure that this just includes right in there. Are there any further questions? Let's thank Jonathan. Thank you. Jonathan. Thank you.
