To all the organizers, Rob, Framinha, and Lucien, for inviting me to this very nice workshop. And it's great to be back to Canada, or at least virtually. So yes, today I'm going to talk about quantum operations with indefinite time direction. So this is an interesting new line of research that been starting quite recently, and I will give you some of the first results in this. You some of the first results in this line of research. So, as you all know, indefinite causal structure has been a topic that attracted quite some interest over the past 15 years. The idea is that quantum theory is compatible with many scenarios where the causal structure is indefinite. This is not our standard quantum theory, but at least quantum theory is compatible with these extensions. And this is interesting for both theoretical physics, of course, for quantum gravity. Of course, for quantum gravity and also for information processing is interesting for new models of computations and new models of information. So the language to describe this quantum theory with indefinite causal structure is pretty consistent. It has been developed in a series of papers over the past 10 years. And one way to understand this framework of indefinite causal structure is to think in terms of supermarket. is to think in terms of super maps. So super maps are transformations of processes. So they are kind of higher order transformations. The idea is that the supermap describes a possible way to interact with the process. So you can imagine that there is a process there, like a box, and you do something on it and you transform it into a new process. So this is what the supermap is, and the relation with the causal structure. With the causal structure and indefinite causal structure is the idea that if you have many processes, like here in the picture, this C, D, and E, so you could have many processes and combine them together. So the combination, the operation of combining a set of processes and building a new process is what we call a quantum supermap. It's a transformation that has processes as input and produces processes as output. As output. So, this is kind of a broad language for describing indefinite causal structure in quantum mechanics. Now, this language has been adopted to study different types of processes. First, processes with definite causal order, like networks of quantum gates with a precise ordering in time and precise causal order. So, this is what's called quantum comps. And it has also been used to study many types. Has also been used to study many types of indefinite causal order. One example, probably the easiest example, is the quantum switch, where two processes F and G are combined in a quantum superposition of two different orders with F before G or G before F, depending on the state of a quantum system. Another famous example is the process matrix by Oreshkov, Kost and Bruckner. This is another type of process where This is another type of process where the operations that happen in two laboratories are combined in an indefinite order with, let's say, Alice before Bob and at the same time Bob before Alice. Now, there is an interesting technical feature here that all the supermaps that have been considered so far used their quantum channels in a definite time direction. So, even if the order is indefinite, the direction Indefinite, the direction from the input to the output within each process is fixed. So, here is one example, again, probably the easiest, the example of the quantum switch. Here you can see that there are two processes, C1 and C2, mathematically two quantum channels, C1 and C2, and they are combined in a superposition of two different ways, either the one with the blue dotted lines, so we go through C1 first and then through C2 and then to the And then through C2 and then to the output. Or we go from the orange line, starting from the input, we go through C2 first and then C1 and then to the output. So you can see that the relative order between C1 and C2 is indefinite. But when you go through C one and when you go through C two, you always do it in the same direction. You always enter from the input on the left and come out on the input on the output on the right. Input on the output on the right. So, both on the blue and on the orange path, we have the same direction in which we go through the device. So, the same time direction. So, why is that? Why is the case that all the processes considered so far have a definite time direction? Well, the technical reason is that all these processes that have been studied so far are supermaps that were defined on the full set of quantum channels. The full set of quantum channels, and the set of quantum channels is a time asymmetric set. So, without going into too much technical detail, a quantum channel is what you can think of as an evolution of a composite system, of an open system. So there is an input system that interacts with an environment, initially in some pure state or in some general state psi Io V. Then there is a unit. Then there is a unitary interaction where the system interacts with the environment, and eventually you discard the environment. I put this waste basket here to mean that we don't look at the environment anymore. So what we call a quantum channel is the effective evolution from the input to the output of the system alone without caring about the environment. So this kind of representation of a quantum channel is clearly time asymmetric because you can see here that there is a pre-system. See here that there is a preselection of a quantum state of the environments. So, if we have to engineer a quantum channel in the laboratory, if you have to build it by yourself from the unitary evolution, the way you would do it would be to initialize the environment or in a kind of auxiliary system in a given state, psi of it. So, you need to have to have control over the preparation of the environment at the beginning, or at least some degree of control, in order to implement an Control in order to implement an arbitrary quantum channel. And this is time asymmetric because, of course, we have this control for things that are in the past, so we can pre-select the state of a system, but we don't have control for things that are in the future. So we cannot post-select on demand at least. We cannot post-select on demand the outcomes of a measurement. So this asymmetry between pre-selection and post-selection kind of generates a strong asymmetry in the set of quantum channels. Asymmetry in the set of quantum channels. And this asymmetry has been recently studied in different aspects in the papers that I've cited here. So the basic object on which the supermaps have been defined so far is a time-asymmetric object, is an object that can be used only in one direction, all in this picture from the left to the right. So there is a general sense that quantum mechanics is actually fundamentally time symmetric. Fundamentally time symmetric. So, for example, in field theory, we have the CPT theorem that says that the evolution of particles and fields kind of is invariant, the form of the equations is invariant if we apply a suitable combination of time reversal and other transformations. So, there is a sense that the time asymmetry that we see in quantum channels is not really a fundamental property of nature, but it's more like an artifact of More like an artifact of our way of interacting with the nature, of our own perspective as agents. So, this idea has appeared in different ways in the literature. Probably the original works that started introducing this idea that quantum physics is fundamentally time-symmetric was the work by Aaron of the collaborators. And there are more recent works like the one I cited before. Okay, so. Um okay, so if we believe that the fundamentally physics, or at least quantum physics, is time symmetric, it makes a lot of sense to look at the possible ways in which we could interact with the fundamentally time symmetric processes. So, in other words, it makes a lot of sense to study the possible supermaps we can define on time-symmetric quantum processes, on a subset of the quantum channels that we can interpret as time-symmetric. We can interpret as time-symmetric processes. And this is what I'm going to talk about in this talk, in the remaining part of the talk. So, the quick outline of the main points I want to touch upon is the following. I will first characterize which processes are the time symmetric ones, at least according to a certain notion of time symmetry. The second thing, I will define a framework for operations with indefinite time directions. With indefinite time direction, so different ways that we can interact with the time symmetric processes. And finally, I will give a concrete example that is what we call the quantum time flip. So let's get started with the first part on defining a time-symmetric fragment of quantum theory. So this is what I call the b-directional quantum processes. So a b-directional process is a process that we can think of a black box with two poles. Think of a black box with two ports, port one and port two, and we can interact with this device in two ways: either by sticking an input into port one and looking what happens in port two, or vice versa, by sticking an input into port two and looking what happens into port one. We can think that these two ports correspond to two different moments of time. So, one way of interacting with the device is the one of the forward agents, like or the Agents like ordinary agents like us who look at physics by initializing the devices in the past and looking what happens in the future. And then we could imagine also a backward agent that looks at physics in the opposite direction from the future to the past and probes the device in a different way. So for the point of view of the forward agent, this black box will be described by some quantum channel that I call C. Quantum channel that I call C here. Now, from the point of view of the backward agent, this may be a different channel. I will call it theta of C. So these are two different descriptions of the same physics, the same black box, the same process between time T1 and time T2. But we can see it from the point of view of agent or a forward agent or the point of view of a backward agent. So you have either C of T or C. So, you have either C of T or theta of C. So, what I call a time reversal in this talk is just the change of description from the picture of the forward agent to the picture of the backward agent. So, it's a transformation from channel C to channel theta of C. So, in a sense, this is a type of supermap. It's a transformation of processes from the point of view of the forward agent to the point of view of the backward agent. Backward agent. Now, to characterize these processes, we put forward the four axioms for what the time reversal, what properties should the time reversal satisfy. The first one, which I consider the most important and the most fundamental, is that the time reversal should invert the order of the processes. So if you look at two processes like C1 and C2, and if the forward agent sees C1 before C2, the backward agent sues The backward agent should see the time reversal of C2 before the time reversal of C1. So it should see the order in which the processes happen to be reversed. This, I would say, is basically what is the definition of a time reversal. At least it should invert the order of processes. The second axiom that we require is that, well, unitary processes or like reversible processes are time are are time are bidirectional and when you take the time reversal of a of a of a unitary process you still get a unitary process and again this is motivated by physical considerations like the cpt theorem that the prototype of a bidirectional process is the fundamental unitary dynamics of particles and fields so now the third axiom is that if you have a mixture a random mixture of channels the time revolution Of channels, the time reversal should map this mixture in a mixture with the same probabilities, where you just mix the time reversals of the channels you had in the forward direction. Finally, the last axiom is that time reversal should be kind of a symmetry. So what are two distinct processes from the point of view of the forward agent should remain two distinct processes from the point of view of the backward agent. So basically, this should be a So basically, this should be a one-to-one correspondence when you do a time reversal of a process. Now, if we take these four axioms together, we can have a complete characterization of the time reversal that satisfy the axioms. Here is the characterization. The easy one is for unitary processes, for like reversible processes. You just need the first and the fourth axioms in this case. If you want to see the time reversal of a unit according to these axioms, According to these axioms, there are only two possibilities up to change of basis. One possibility is that the time reversal of the unitary gate U is U dagger, the inverse. And the other possibility is that you have the transpose. So you fix a basis and transpose the matrix, the unitary matrix. This is another solution that satisfies the axioms one and four. So these are the only two possibilities up to changes of basis. Changes of basis. You can always conjugate, let's say, the dagger with some fixed unitary that changes the basis overall. But besides this freedom, there is no remaining freedom. Now, if you have a general process, a general noisy process that may not be unitary, you can still meaningfully define a time reversal that satisfies these four axioms. And again, there are only two possibilities. Either you take the dagger of the channel, which means that when you represent the channel with the When you represented the channel with the Krauss operators, you take the dagger of the operators, or you take the transpose. Again, in terms of the Krauss operators, and you decompose the channel in the Krauss representation, you just take the transpose of the operators. So these are all the time reversals satisfying the axioms. And the channels on which you can define these time reversals are the ones that are known as b-stochastic. So the only type of channels that admit a time reversal satisfies. That admits the time reversal satisfying these four axioms are the b-stochastic ones, namely the channels that can be written in this Krauss representation. So they map a density matrix rho into density matrix Ci rho Ci dagger, sum over I. And these operators Ci, the Krauss operator, should satisfy these two conditions. This normalization condition where Ci dagger Ci is sum over I is equal to Ci C i dagger sum over i and is equal to the identity. Sum over i and is equal to the identity over the space of the system. So these are the only quantum channels that admit a time reversal according to these four axioms. So this will be my b-directional quantum processes. And now I will define the ways we can interact with this type of processes. Okay, so the second part of the talk is about quantum operations with indefinite time direction. So what can we do? Time direction. So, what can we do on a time symmetric process? What can we do in principle at least? Or maybe I should say, what can one do? Maybe not we, like maybe some other type of agent could do on a time-symmetric quantum process. So, the framework that we defined is a framework of supermaps on b stochastic channels. So, we define transformation that take as in Transformation that takes as input a B stochastic channel, so a channel that represents a time-symmetric process, and the map, the supermap, spits out as an output a new channel, now in general, an ordinary channel, that we can use in the ordinary way. So, this is one thing that we can do to a bistochastic channel. We can transform it into a new channel with which we can interact in the normal way. In a normal way. So graphically, I represent the supermap as this green box that takes an input process and produces an output process. An important property of a supermap is that we want it to act also on part of a composite process. So here I represented the supermarket acting locally on a part of a bipartite process. So everything should still work well. Everything should still work well. All right. Julio, you have five minutes until question time. All right, good. So, one example of a supermap like this is the time reversal when you choose the transpose to be the time reversal. So, this is the only one that works as a supermap that can be applied locally to a bipartite process. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to do this. So, if you take the adjoint, this wouldn't be good. The adjoint, this wouldn't be good. So, other examples are forward supermaps where you just plug your channel between the two channels A and B, and backward supermaps that are the one where you plug the time reversal of the channel between two channels. So, these are the forward ones are the maps that a forward agent can implement, and the backward supermaps are the one that a backward agent could implement. Now, the interesting thing is that there are some supermaps that cannot be implemented by either type of agents or by By either type of agents or by any mixture of these two. So, this is what we call an operation with indefinite time direction. So, it's an operation that cannot be decomposed as a mixture of forward and backward operations with some probabilities. So, this is the analog of the definition of operations with indefinite causal order, but now we are talking about time direction instead of order. Okay, now to conclude, the last part of the talk is about an example of a supermap that has indefinite time. Supermap that has indefinite time direction. The idea is that we could create superpositions in the arrow of time. We could have a superposition of an agent acting in the forward direction, like here in this black cat, with a situation where the agent acts in the backward direction. Maybe like the same agent could act in a superposition of two different directions. Some exotic agent could do that. Now, this is the situation which has been studied actually independently. Actually, independently and recently by Rubino, Mansan, and Bruckner does not necessarily define what we are looking for, does not necessarily define a supermap on channels, because this superposition of kets that you can write in general may depend on more things than just the original channel you want to interact with. So, a way to build the superposition is to use this notion of superposition of processes. So, you can take the Kraus operators of your channel and create a controlled channel. Create a controlled channel where you have either the forward process Ci or the backward process theta of Ci, where this theta of Ci is either the adjoint or the transpose. Now, what we get here is that we can construct this process, this controlled process, and this is a valid channel if and only if our original process is a B stochastic one. All right, at this point we can define the quantum time flip. It happens that the Find the quantum time flip, it happens that the transformation that takes a channel and spits out this control channel is a valid supermap if and only if you pick the transpose as your time reversal. So, if we do that, we call this map the quantum time flip. So, the map that takes a channel and creates a superposition of using the channel in the forward and in the backward direction at the same time. An easy theorem is that this map, the quantum time fleet, Is that this map, the quantum time flip, is not an operation with definite time direction, so you cannot decompose it as a mixture of forward and backward operations. And the funny application of this is that you can build a game. You can build a game where there is a referee that challenges a player to discover a property of two black boxes to unitary gates UMV. So they have two properties: either UV transpose is equal to U transpose V, or the same thing with a minus. So the goal. Minus. So the goal of Alice is to discover which of these two processes holds, these two properties hold. And the result is that if Alice can operate in a superposition of directions, she can build the quantum tensile flip and she can win the game with probability one. But if she's forced to use the boxes UMV in a fixed direction, let's say both forward direction for UMV or backward direction for UMV, then she will lose the game with probability at least. Will lose the game with probability at least 11 percent. So, the surprising thing is that this holds even if the black boxes u and v are combined in an indefinite causal order. With this, I am done. I get to the conclusions. So, we have this characterization of b-directional processes as b-stochastic channels. We have the possible ways to interact with these b-directional processes, these are the supermaps, and these operations are with indefinite causal order, like the quantum time flipper. causal order like the quantum time flip are things that are sorry that are not mixture this is this is a typo operations that are not mixture so forward and vector operations have indefinite order so the moral of the talk i would say indefinite causal structure is something bigger than just indefinite causal order because in principle we could have other things like for example indefinite time direction that's all thank you for your attention so thank you julio for keeping on talk Julio, for keeping on time. You're actually a little bit early, so we do have time for questions, and please raise your hand to do so. And I already see that we have Agnion with a question. Please go ahead. You can unmute yourself. Hello. Hi, Julio. It's more of a comment on the first part of your talk. I wanted to point out that actually in a paper of mine, together with A paper of mine together with Nicolas Serre, which is entitled Operational Formulation of Time Reversal in Quantum Theory, we have actually classified the types of possible forms of time reversal on a channel in particular. And I believe that includes your classification, albeit it's done in a more general framework where we don't... Actually, I know the paper. Sorry, I didn't edit in the references here. It's cited in our paper, but for some reason I forgot to put it in the beginning. I forgot to put it in the beginning of the talk. Yes, what you do there is a bit different from what you do here, because what you do is to define these transformations in post-selection. So you allow for invertible transformations, right? For example, in the case of a unit era, you would conjugate it between two different invertible transformations that are either linear or antilinear. I think the motivation for that is post-selection. Motivation for that is post-selection, whereas here we fix somehow these conditions, these four axioms, and what we get is a kind of a more specific set of operations that are basically only the dagger and the transpose. And if you want complete positivity, it's only the transpose. I see. So here you have more. I mean, of course, we consider a larger set of transformations because the philosophy there, which I still support, is that it makes sense to not It makes sense to not do this restriction to a subclass, but irrespectively of that, we classify those that are compatible with all types of channels, or in particular, of course, the subset of channels that are time symmetric, the subset of standard channels. So would you say that now, in our classification, of course, there is the assumption that we study what are the most general forms of symmetries on a circuit, on a channel? It on a channel, and so obviously, the classification we get includes those that you spelled out. But would you say that in your approach there is a difference in the strength of the conclusion because you start from presuming this smaller set of allowed channels to talk about? Well, we actually don't. I mean, we assume that we consider channels, that we start from that every set of. From that, every set of evolution we consider would be a subset of quantum channels, which is already different from what you do because you allow every sort of at least completely positive map, I think. So you do everything in post-selections. You don't care about the normalization. But in particular, we have two other questions. I think we're going to have to go on to keep to the time. And the questioners are Alex and his time-reversed counterpart, Alex. And I'm not sure which one is first. So we'll arbitrate. One is first, so we'll arbitrarily go with Alex Smith and then Alex Kissinger. Oh, perfect. Thanks a lot for this nice talk. I had two quick questions. The first is, why didn't the axioms that you defined spit out a unique time reversal map? Is there some like underdetermination there or is there another? Why don't they spit out a unique time reap? Yeah, yeah. So my question is: why is that? And then is the output of any time reversal map? Output of any time reversal map is it always like physical in a sense? And I naively have in mind if I do the time reversal of a unitary that's generated by a Hamiltonian, say bounded below. If I do the time reversal, that's kind of like the forward process of a Hamiltonian with a negative thing, and then it's not bounded and it's not physical. So I was wondering if there's things that could uniquely spit that out. And since the last question, last bullet here is: why do you separate that causal order and temporal order are somehow different? And temporal order are somehow different, I guess, fundamentally, and there's this room rather than like one being derived from the other. So, I feel like that's maybe a choice you have. Let me answer one question at one time. So, first of all, regarding the underdetermination, yes, what we classify are all the time reversal that satisfy these four axioms. So, nothing prevents us from adding some more requirements on top of that. One requirement that I touched upon very quickly in the talk, but maybe it was too quick. Quickly in the talk, but maybe it was too quick to be noticed. But if you want this time reversal to be applicable locally, so if you want the time reversal to be a meaningful operation that you could do on a channel, which could be part of a bigger process, then you kill the dagger and you end up only with the transpose up to changes of basis, which I don't think it makes sense to kill often. So you would kill the dagger, the inverse, and you would end up with the transpose. To with the transpose. Now, this is interestingly related to what you said, because another argument to kill the dagger is exactly the one that you said. If you want, for example, if you have a process with a Hamiltonian that is bounded from below, but not from above, and you want to define a time reversal that is nice in the sense that it still has a Hamiltonian that is bounded from below, well, the transpose works, and the transpose is indeed in one-to-one correspondent to the kind of canonical time reversal that you can find in quantum mechanics. Reversal that you can find in quantum mechanics, even in kind of undergraduate textbooks, like the time reversal that does the kind of anti-unitary operation on the states. If you look at that at the level of evolutions, of unitary evolutions, this becomes the transpose, it's unitarily equivalent to the transpose. So yes, you can add these extra requirements, like either the one that you knew or the one that I told you in the talk, the idea of applying locally the supermarket, and then you end up with only the transpose. And then you end up with only the transposes, the kind of the canonical time reversal. Okay, Julio, I think we're going to have to speed up here. Alex, is your question brief, Alex Kissinger? Not so brief. Maybe I'll save it for the discussion. It would be better if you could save it for the discussion. All right, why don't we all thank Julio with the silent clap, and we will now move on. And we will now move on to the next speaker, which is Alex Kissinger.
