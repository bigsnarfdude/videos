First, I'd like to explain the aim of this talk. The right stock, let K be an algebraic sphere of character zero. For the Netherlands an integrated K algebra A, pair Q A and master A is called the non-communal is called the non-cumulative projective scheme of A, where Q A is a quotient category of finitely generated gradient by A module by the category of finitely generated torsion models. And masculine A is the image of the gradient module A in QA. If uh QQA has finite global dimension, then the non-communicable scheme is called smooth. Scheme is called smooth. And in this talk, I try to present examples of smooth non-commutative productive schemes using following two classes of RTO class. First is skewed quadratic hypersurfaces. And second is twisted circular products of S-regular artificial regulars. Let's start the first part. We will discuss skew quadratic hypersonics. If you're in the first part, we will use this set for symmetric matrix equation, such that diagonal entries are one, okay, or one. And the other entries are positive one or negative one. one or negative one. For such asymmetry matrix equation, we fix the following notation. Ex equation is a quotient algebra of the free algebra in L variable box. By the ideal generated by xi xj minus epsilon ij xj xi. So this is your skill point here. And because epsilon ij Because if shown ij is positive 1 or negative 1, so we call it a plus minus 1 square polynomial. We assume that it is generated in degree 1. And every option is this element of Z epsilon. I'm so sorry. Okay, okay, okay. Thank you. Okay. Okay. F epsilon is x1 squared plus x2 squared dot xn squared. This is a central variant of S epsilon. And A epsilon is the quotient algebra of S epsilon by F epsilon. As if shown by F epsilon. So, this is a skewed version of a quadric hypothesis. And this is the main object of the first part. Q epsilon is a category of graded maximal coima core modules. So, this is a category of finitely generated graded epsilon modules such that it satisfies this punishing function. So, there are no positive extensions from M to M. Extension from M to A. And the underlying GM Afghan is a stable category of gradient collaborative models. So this is a factor category of GMAF shrunk by the idea consisting of morphisms which factor through a pre-A module. And in this case, Steve's category has Category has the structure of a triangulated category because F shipped is an S-Gorange layer. And G-psion, a more G-pshium is a graph such that the vertices are 1 to the n. So vertices are integers from 1 to n and edges are given at first. If epsilon ij is possible, then Ij is positive, then Ij is H in G, if you know. So if I is negative one, so H is not H in G. Is this now I will directly explain how to calculate the stable category of column of models over AFCL. Ethereum is due to a joint work with Hilashani, with R B. Let R be the luity of this matrix over F2 where Mg epsilon is the adjacency matrix of the graph G epsilon. So here is the adjacency matrix. We add one low and one current. So 1 1 1 1 1 0 and 1 1 1 0. And we calculate the nuity of this matrix. Of this matrix over F2. So over F2 means under the condition that 1 is 0. Then the stable category of quantum modules over F shipped is equivalent to the bounded derivative category of finitely generated modules over this semester browser. So this is the product, derived product of k to the R types. So this theorem says. So, this theorem says that the stable category can be calculated by this number. As a collary, we see that an Epsom has two to the R indecomposable non-free graded coin macro modules, up to atomic and degree shift. So, Epsom has finite coin-macallary representation time. So, EFCO has finite number of indicator variables. Number of indecomposable related polymer. In particular, QBA epsilon has finite global dimension. In general, finite polymer representative type implies smoothness of non-commutative predictive scheme. So, we get examples of smooth non-commutative predictive scheme. We now give an exclusive. We now give an explicit example. We consider the case n is equal to 5. So, especially pseudonym is a plus or minus 1 skew polynomial algebra in 5 variables, where 2, 3 and 4, 5 are positive one. The geos are negative one. We consider this case. We call that the aim shown is this, position. This portion of link. Then the graph tip shown is this curve. Because 1, 2, and 2, 3, and 4, 5 are 8. And here is the adjustment symmetry of Egyptian. For example, 1, 2 is 8 Egyptian, so the 1, 2 and 3 and 2, 1 and 3s are 1. Okay? 2 3 is 8 in Egyptian, so the 23 and 3 and 3 2s are 1. And three entries are and so on. Here is a JSIN matrix, and we add one node, one parameter of zero is our zero. And the nullity of this matrix over F2 is two. It is easy. So we see that the stable category of polymer modules over IF shown is equivalent to the bounded derived category of model K. Category of model K to Z4. So in this case, APC has four indecomposable non-free gradient component modules. Next, we give another example because it's a commutative case. So let S if Shong be the polynomial rings in polynomial ring in n body. In polynomial ring in end particles. Okay, in this case, the graph G shown is the complete graph because everyone has J is positive. So, the corresponding matrix is this. Note that the size of this matrix is n plus 1, because we had one row at one, I don't know. So, this matrix is n plus 1 times n plus 1. Then the nullity of this matrix is zero. This matrix is 0 if n is out, and it is 1 if n is even. So we see that the stable category of form of real module over IF shown is equivalent to the boundary-derived category of k, if n is of. And it is equivalent to the boundary-derived category of model k squared, if n is even. The first term. In the first term of the category, people need to do the stable category, oh, so one variable case. In the second term of the category, people need to do the stable category, two variables case. So we can reduce the stable category to one variable case or two variable space. So this is a special case of Kundalini's theorem very unique theorem. Okay, I want to give an application. It's the derivative category of qubit H. Assume that n is equal to or greater than 3, and let R be as in 0 1.1, so R is a new view. So let R let X 1 d X 2 the R be the complete RB the complete representatives of isomorphism classes of independent possible non-pre-created coordinate models. And then in this case, we can and do assume that all xi are generated in degree 0 by using degree shift. Okay, but using degree shift, we can assume these are generated in degree 0. Then, Then, bounded derivative category of QGA shown has a hurricane-Stolengwe exceptional sequence of this form. So, this derivative category has a Hurricane exceptional correction. Here is the here is the shift of A shown in Q curve. And here is the Colmaco modulus in Q curve. It's formed. Is from a pro-storm expression condition. And this result is a generalization of Caprono's self. Caprono proves that the derivative category of smooth quadratic hypersurface has a full-strong exception. So this is a skew standardization of approximate theorem. And then yes, note that if commutative If commutative, if we consider the commutative case, the length of this part is only 1 or 2. Because in the computer, this R is 0 or 1. So the length of this part is only 1 or 2. But on the other hand, in the non-commutative case, the length over here can be The length of here can be very long. This interface. And yes, if you is this object, so this is the direct sum of these objects, okay? Use this object, then the endomorphism algebra of u is an extremely fun algebra of global dimension n minus 2. This is a This is a finite dimensional algebra and a finite global dimension and it satisfies some special property. And in particular, lambda is an n minus 2 representation E-finite direct form in the context of higher dimensional ulster lambda, I guess. So, roughly speaking, okay, lambda equation has finite global higher global dimension, higher global dimension. Dimension, okay? I have lower dimension, but it has similar property to the pass algebra of extended dictionary group. So, lambda has higher global dimension, but it has similar property to judiciary representation finite algebra. And we have this derivative. So, the derivative finite derivative category of cubicle is equal by two. Is easy by two about the field category and model round that is okay big on example because the case n is equal to 3 and if keeps on 1 2 and it's strong 1 3 and if you're on 2 3 and 2 because that is the case in this case the clock uh The graph uh has no edge. Okay? So the graph is only uh three isolated vertices. So the corresponding graph is this, okay? And the nuity of this matrix is two. So we have this uh hurricane exception for the shape. And moreover, uh the endomorphism are represented this object, okay. Of these objects, the sum of these objects is isomorphic to KQ, pass algebra KQ, where Q is this equipped. So this is the extended link equipped of type D for tilde. And we have this and derived this. So we now consider the case n is equal to 3. So lambda dimensional has global dimension 1. has global dimension 1. And it's reason global dimension is 1. So in this case it's Helidity. So extremely found algebra is nothing but the pass algebra of extinct D equivalent. Yes. And I'll give example in the case n is equal to 4 and if And if shown one power is positive one and the others are negative one, then it is easy to set r is equal to one. And in this case, lambda diffusion is given by this quiver and these relations. Okay, in general, the quiver of lambda, if shown, is easy to compute. The quiver Easy to compute. The quibbler is easy. But relations are difficult. Relation follows from matrix substitutions of efficiency. So if we can calculate all matrix subtitles of efficiency, then we can get a relation from that equation. And yes, using these calculations, These calculations, you can get this reason. The classification of the derivative category of calculation for n is equal or less than 4 is obtained. So we can get the classification of derivative category for in low-divisional case is obtained. Okay. To conclude the first part, I want to give a bit of a digression. I think it is interesting to study a C shiko communatori by using the graph G Shio. For example, okay. Okay. This theorem was proved by combinatorial methods of graphs. Was proved by combinatorial population of graph. And yes. Or Higashitani and I, essentially Higashitani and I gave the classification of the non-commutative project schemes of SE. Schemes of S E visual in terms of the graph G view. So we give combinatorial classifications of plus minus ones to projective space. So my question is, how about my impact and theory of SEPG? Maybe I have these questions. So what is the group of graded algebra osomorphism of SEPG? And can the homological determinant to sigma be easily calculated? Peng is the global dimension of Q equals invariant suffering, finite. So in other words, Peng is the non-commutative projective schemes of an invariant suffering smooth. And what about of action of exhibition? Of execution. This question can be first in the setting of profession. And I hope to give combinatorial answers to these questions. Okay, this concludes the first part of this talk. So let's start the second part of this talk. We will discuss twisted segregate products. This part is based on joint joint work with GWAHE. From now on, Tensor means TensorFlow working. And the second product And the segreg product of two Z-graded algebras, A and B, is a Z graded algebra whose degree I part is Ai tensor Bi. And segregate variety. Segular variety is a project variety whose homogeneous coordinate ring is a segregal product of two polynomial rings. And And it is well known that a secular variety is smooth. Or we want to consider a non-commutative button or secular variety in order to get the smooth non-commutative pressing experience. And we now see a typical example of a parameter. Typical simple Typically, the simplest example of a secular variety is P1 times P1. So this is a projected variety whose homogeneous coordinate ring is several products of two polynomial rings. And in this case, it is a smooth quadric surface in P3 given by this zero locus. And given by this zero locus. And now we are naturally interested in this algebra. So let A and B be two-dimensional nasal and quotient-based regular algebra. And we consider the secret product of A and B. Because this algebra is natural non-commutative generalization of this commutative. This this algebra. Okay, these these algebra so we are naturally naturally considered this algebra okay but in the following sense this algebra is not so interesting because their graded module categories are equivalent. So the algebra is that will be is a chunk twist of the commutative case. In particular, the non-commutative projective schemes of SRQB and the commutative case are equivalent. So, SRQB is not a proper non-commutative similarization of this commutative algebra from the viewpoint of great module category or non-commutative projective scheme. So, we introduced and discussed the notion of twisted segment product. This is the motivation of the second product. To define and twisted cell products, we need twisting maps. Great A and B be Z graded algebra. The bijective The bijective linear map psi from b tensor A to A tensor B is called a twisting map if it satisfies the following five conditions. First condition says that site reserves degree. Site reserves degree. And the second one and third one say that elements one tensor A or B tensor one A or fitting some one are just freaked by side. These elements are just freaked by sign. And the fourth condition, the fixed condition says we have this commutative term. So yeah. And where M B and M A are the multiplications of B and A. So uh this condition requires that This function requires that psi is compatible with the multiplications of A and B. And we let psi be a twisting mark. Then, the twisted silver product of A and B with respect to psi is a Z gradient arthral defined as follows. The twisted silver product is equal The twisted segregate product is equal to the usual segregated product as gradient vector space. And the the multiplication of the twisted single product is defined by this omega. So the multiplication is twisted by sine. Multiplication is twisted by sine. And uh in this yes. In this case twisted single product is the graded algebra by the definition of a twisting map. Definition of a twisting map. So a secular product has identity by this condition and it satisfies associativity by this condition. And the size of Crypt Map, then the twisted segregate product is nothing but usual segregated product. So this is the notification of usual segment. And to study twisted segre product, we need the notion of densely bigrated argegas. First, I define a densely graded algebra. Not bi-graded, densely graded argebra. Let S be a Z-graded algebra. S is called a densely graded. S is called a densely graded algebra if S0 modulo Si times S minus I has finite dimension over K. This is finite dimension over K. Note that strongly gradient algebra is densely graded algebra. So a densely graded algebra is a generalization of a strongly Generalization of a strongly graded algebra. And because if S is a strongly graded algebra, then the functor from the category of graded module over S to the category of module over S0 is 56 degrees apart, is equivalence. If it is strongly related algebra, this functor is equivalence. Very nice property of Very nice property of a strongly created algebra. And this is already called data server. In this talk, I want to give a version of data serving. Yes. Next, we define in three vibrator devices. So let S be your Z times Z vibrated or spot. Vibrating transform. So let this be a vibrating transform. Let Si be due to the sum of Sij with j run through integers. Then Sz defined by the direct sum of Si is the gradient algebra. So S and S Z are equal as algebra. Equal as algebra. S and S is equal as algebra. But they have different gradients. S is bigrated algebra and S C is a graded algebra. And S is called a densely bigrated algebra if S C is a densely graded algebra in this. This is the definition of a density vibrated algebra. Vigorated algebra. We now consider quotient categories of densely vibrated algebra. So let S be a densely vibrated algebra. The reader assumes that S satisfies the following two conditions, one and D2. D1 is that S0 divided by this is a necessary Is a Netherland and graded algebra. S0 is a graded algebra, and we assume that it is a Netherian and N gradient. And the condition D2 is that Si is a finitely generated graded right and left S0 module. So Si is a graded S0 module. We assume that. We assume that it is finitely generated on both sides. With this algebra, then an element m of a bi-graded module is called locally torsion if m times is zero is finite dimensional over kilometer. And bigred And a bi-graded module M is called uh locally torsion. It's called locally torsion if every element of M is locally torsion. And then, yes, we consider the category of locally torsion by graded module. Then, this is the same subcategory of bi-graded bigled models. So, the category of biography models. By the way, so we can get the quotient category. This is a general version and we now consider a finite version. So we consider the category of bi-grade module M such that M i, so M i is defined by this, Mi is a finitely generated grade module. Generated graded S0 models. So this is a category of locally finite bigraded models. This is a category of locally finite bi-graded models. And to consider the category of locally finite and locally tosome figures models. Completely locally finite and locally tosome pig related models. Locally total by the general. And we get the quotient categories. A finite version, and this is a general function. And then we have this theorem. Let S be a densely bigrated algebra satisfying D one and D two. Then the functal from the category of bigraded module over S to the category of graded S zero. Category of graded S0 module, which takes degree 0 part. Degree 0 part is defined by this. Induce, this factor induce equivalence between quotient categories, this and this. Let's compare with data server. Graphically speaking, densely graded algebra is strongly graded algebra. Graded algebra is strongly graded algebra up to torsion one. Okay? Tensively graded algebra is a strongly graded algebra up to tossing one. So we can we get equivalence between quotient categories up to modulo toss modules. So that we speaking. And we now consider left hand side is biprated model. So by taking degree zero part, So by taking degree zero path, sorry, left hand side is bigrated mode. And by taking degree zero path, right hand side is grade. So this sering can be considered as a data serving for density by great diagram. Let's go back to logistics. 2674. Let S B A and B be let A and B be S Tauchu S regular algebras with a twisting map side. We now consider the twisted tensor product. And twisted tensor product is equal to usual product as vector space. But Vector space, but the multiplication is twisted by sine. A twisting map, similar to twisted several maps. Then we it with biography. So the degree Ij part degree ij part of the twist cancer product is given by the given by the degree I plus j part of A tensor the degree J part of Big grading of twisted tensor product is defined by this then the degrading part of the twisted tensor product is equal to a separate product because the the degree 0 j part of a if i is 0 then this is a i tensor of p i. So taking dx sum then we get segregated. So the degree of product of the twisted tensor product is uh twisted segregated product. And it is known that twisted tensor product has finite global language. Finite property language. Okay. This theorem is the main theorem of the second part. The twisted sensor product, in this case, tweeted sensor product is densely bigrided algebra, that is y T2. And we assume that the tweeted separate product is necessary. Then, by this fact, by this fact, the twisted tensor product satisfy the condition D1, because degree 0 product is necessary and integrated. So, this tensor product satisfy the condition D two and D one. So by this theorem, This theorem, we get this. So, left-hand side is a quotient category of twisted tensor product, and the right-hand side is quotient category of twisted segregate product. We get this equivalence. And now, twisted tensor product has pointed global definition. Point global dimension. So it is easy to see that left-hand side has this category has pointed global dimension. Original has finite global dimension, so this category has finite global dimension. So the right hand side is also finite global dimension. Therefore, Qu of this TC segment product has finite global dimension. This is a, so this gives an example of smooth non-community projectives. And this result is an analogy to the fact that a segregated variety is single. As a typical example of twisted segreg product, we now focus on Segregate product. We now focus on certain segregated products of polynomial rings in two variables. So very considered very easy. Let A and B be polynomial rings in two variables. If psi is a twisting map, then psi should have this form. And yes. And yes, psi is called diagonal. Psi is called diagonal if this part and this part by zero. So we consider a special uh twisting mark. Then we have this theorem. Then we have this theorem. So let A and B be polynomial rings in two variables and let psi be a diagonal twisted. Then the twisted segment product is a non-commutative equatoric surface. That is, the twisted segregate product is equal to isomorphic to the quotient algebra of S by M, where by M, where S is a four-dimensional Nazi M for sure S legular algebra, S is equal to C. And F is a regular normal homogeneous element of degree 2. So we see that 36 segre product is a three-dimensional Nasrian Hoshu S-Corage diagram. In particular, it is necessary. So this condition is satisfied. So we see that of this algebra has finite global timing. It is not that there is a okay, in this in this setting, Okay, in this setting, there is a twisted segue product such that its non-commutative project scheme is not equivalent to the one of the commutative case. So this is different from proportion to point one. So this is different uh from the usual segregated product case. So this theorem uh Theorem, uh include uh proper non-competitive example. Okay, so our result from separate questions. So let A and B be a neither Yang cushion based regular algebra of dimension T and D prime, and let psi be a general twisting mark. A general twisting. Then is the twisted segreg Nathelium? If is it? If D and D prime, then is it S correlation? D and D prime are two, then is it non-computed quadrant? So these questions are all. And but Our theorem gives a partial answer for these questions. A and B are two polylinear rings into variables and psi be a diagonal twisted part. Then these equations are positive. I hope these equations are positive. Yeah. Thank you for Thank you. All right, clean talk. Are there any questions? Yeah. Several slides earlier, you mentioned about the twisted tensor product of two, I don't know, nice enough AS regular algebras as finite global dimension. Yes, right there. So it is known. It is known that the global dimension of A twist intensity is I guess how how is that known? I'm curious about that. Maybe it's easy to talk after. Yeah, maybe it's walk after any other questions? So, you implied, you mentioned that if you had the matrix factorizations, then you can do like these relations on the quiver. On a quiver. For the case of the 2 to the r many of them, have you made those explicit? Like, do you have explicit matrix factorizations for those examples? Yes, in this case, the number of, we understand the number of much more coin marker modules in comparison to much more coin marker modules, so we can calculate the all parts of the pattern. Any questions from online? Any questions from online? All right, let's thank Kenton again and thank you for speaking of the morning.
