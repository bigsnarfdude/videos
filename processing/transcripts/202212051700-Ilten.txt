To come to this beautiful place and to speak. I'm going to talk about joint work with Alfredo Madias Chavez, who's in the audience, and Jimito Teffinger. I also want to give a special thanks to Laura because this whole project was inspired by a talk that I heard her give several years ago about some joint work she did with Fatima and Alfreda. So that was sort of the origin for this, so it's maybe fitting that I'm talking about with the organizers. Okay, so I promise I will talk about. I promise I will talk about deformation theory for finite cluster complexes, but I'm going to spend the first half of the talk talking about everyone's favorite non-toric variety, which of course is the Grassmannian G2A. And so this is going to be sort of a special case of what I'm going to talk about then in the second half of the talk, and hopefully this will make the second half. This will make the second half of the talk make a bit more sense. Okay, so we're going to start out with some combinatorics. I'm going to look at an n-gon, and so I'll label the vertices. Here's my n-gon. So one, two, three, four, five, et cetera, to the nth vertex. And I'm going to now look at a simplicial complex, which I'll denote by k sub n. And the vertices for the simplicial complex are given by diagonals of the. are given by diagonals of the narrative. So vertices are diagonals, which I can label by some pair of numbers, i, j, in between 1 and n, and have to differ by more than 1, right? 1, 2 is not a diagonal. And the phases of this simplicial complex are given by collections. By collections of non-crossing diagonals. Okay, so let's look at an example. So here we can take n to be equal to 5. So here I have 5 gone. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And so for instance, And so, for instance, I have this diagonal here, 1,3. So, that will give me a vertex of my simplicial complex. I also have a diagonal, let's use a different color, 3,5. We notice these do not cross, so I connect them by an edge. Likewise, here's a different diagonal. We have 1, 4. This also does not cross 1, 3. This also does not cross 1,3. This gives me another vertex and another edge. However, 3, 5, and 1, 4 are crossing, so they don't form an edge of the simplicial complex. And you can keep on going around, and you will get here maybe 2, 5 and 2, 4. This connects here, and lo and behold, this is our summatial complex. Coincidentally, we started with the five-don. Incidentally, we started with a five gun and we got a five gun. Don't let that lead you astray. This is not what happens in general. So, in general, kn topologically is an n minus four-dimensional sphere. Here we have a one-dimensional sphere. And this has a name, this is called the dual associahedron. The dual associahedron. There's a famous polytope called the Staschiff polytope, but the osocehedron, if you take its polar dual and take the boundary complex of this polar dual, you get exactly this official complex distraction. Okay? So, is this clear? Any questions about this? Okay, so we have some beautiful Some beautiful combinatorics. Now let's translate this into algebra in the usual way. So, in fact, anytime I have a simplicial complex k, I can get a square free minomial ideal from this, which I will denote by i sub k. This is what's known as the Stanley-Reisner ideal. So, this is going to be an ideal in a polynomial ring where I have one variable. Where I have one variable for each vertex of k. So here b is the vertex. Okay. And what is this idea of? So this is going to be generated by certain square free monomials. So I'll look at products over D in certain sets A, X V. So here my A is a certain subset of the set of vertices of K. Of the set of vertices of K, subset of the vertices of K, and my demand on A is that it's not a face of my symptom complex. So let's maybe do this in this example, and I want to write down things in a very particular order so that I'll look at my notes. So for instance, we notice that 1,3 together with 2, 4 is Is not the face of the symplical complex. So that gives me the binomial x13x24. And there's four more, namely we have x13, x25, x14, x25, x14, x35, and x24, x35. So in fact, So, in fact, when I'm writing down generators, it suffices to take the minimal non-phases of my simplicial complex. And that's exactly what we've done here. These are generators for this Stanley-Reisner ideal. We also might want to look at the quotient ring. This is called the Stanley-Reisner ring. I'll denote this by sk. So here we've taken our polynomial ring and taking the quotient by IK. Okay. So that's a nice recipe. So that's a nice recipe from going from this combinatorics to an algebraic object. And I think now I'm ready to state this theorem. So this is a, I think, well-known result that goes back to Baron Schirmfeld, I believe in the early 90s. Frank can correct me if this is incorrect. And it says that the Grasshannian G2N has As a Grodner degeneration, here it's really just a family over A1 to a certain thing which is related to this, namely, I take this family Meisner name, and somehow I don't have enough variables anymore. I'm maybe thinking about these things as being toker variables, but I'm missing. These things as being Plooker variables, but I'm missing all the Plooker variables where the indices were different just by 1. So I need to add in those as well. So x12, x13, up to x, n minus 1, n, and then x1n. And the Allen told us what proj was this morning. I can look at proj of this, which just means I'm looking at the projective variety that has this homogeneous coordinate. And so this is. And so this is a very nice degeneration of the Grassmannian G2n. It's not a torque degeneration because, yeah, in general, proj of one of these things is going to be a union of projective spaces. So this is a semi-troid generation. So first I'll do what you ask. Yes, this is this, you know, Schurmatil's point is this reinterprets what high state is in the whole. Hodge did in the 40s. But in fact, he's really inspired by Hodge to do all this. And Hodge does not for two. Yeah. Okay, but two's good. But does it work as a number of affine phones? Yes. Maybe the second. Yes, and in fact, I will state it in a minute in terms of affine tones. It's true. For affine colours, yes. And we'll maybe talk about it that way soon enough. Talk about it that way soon enough. So, what is this talk going to be about? The first thing that I'd like to do is I'd like to strengthen this theorem. And the way that I'd like to strengthen this theorem is turn it on its head. And instead of thinking about starting with G2n and degenerating into this, I'd like to start with this thing and figure out how we can get G2n back from this combinatorial object. Okay, so that's how we're going to strengthen it. And then the generalization is going to come that we're going to do this not. Come that we're going to do this not just for the Grassmanni and G2N, but for a whole class of varieties that have some nice combinatorial structure. Okay, so that's the plan. I maybe should also mention, so if we're thinking about this theorem, at least I'm not sure if this is the way Hobbes thought about it, but the way that Barrett thought about it, we can maybe think about, well, what actually are the Plooker equations for G2n in the Plooker embedding? So let's write. So let's write these down as well. And again, I want to make sure I write them down in the right order. So here I have x14, x23 plus x12, x24. Here I have x12x25 plus x15x23. Here we have x15 x24. x24 plus x12 x45 almost done x13 x45 plus x15 x34 and finally x25 x34 plus x23 x4. Okay, and so the way that uh And so the way that I think Berg was thinking about this degeneration is, well, we're starting with these closure equations for the Gratzmannian. And he shows that there's a term order on the ring of variables x, i, j that for each one of these equations is selecting this as its leading term. And so this gives rise to this row change. Okay, so let's talk about how we can go backwards and start with this. And start with this and get back to this. And as Michelle suggested, I'm actually going to formulate this in terms of the affine colonies. The signs are all correct. There could be index mistakes, but the signs are all correct. Okay, so this thing here isn't quite enough information to recover the grass and onion. I need a little bit more, namely, I need to know something about a torso. Namely, I need to know something about a torus action. So we're going to look at C star to the N, and this is going to act on A to the N choose 2. So this is the ambient space for the affine cone over my Gross Mini. It's a hooker embedding. But how does it act? So it acts with, say, With, say, weight Ei plus Ej on a variable Xij. These are my standard basis vectors in Z and Enough. So this is giving me an n-dimensional torus action on this space. Sitting inside this space, we have the affine cone over my Grassvannion G2N. And this torus action. And this torus action is the maximal torus action of my standard torus here that is also acting on this FN colour. This torus action really is coming from just looking at this and saying, what torus can I make act on this? Okay, and I actually wanted to give this a name. We're going to call this H. Okay. So here's the zero. So this is due to myself. I'll frame. Myself, Alfredo Van Hero Chavez, and Hippolyta Truffinger. And it says the following. So we're going to start with X, which is the thing that we had over there, except now we'll look at affine colons instead. So this is spec of SK, where I'm adding in these extra variables, et cetera, up to 1n. Okay, so now I'm going to write a bunch of words that might seem somewhat mysterious, although hopefully slightly less mysterious after Alan's talk this morning. And I will explain them all on time, but let me just write it down. So this has a canonical H invariant versal deformation. Reversal deformation, which I will call script x, which is sitting inside a to the n choose 2 times a to the p. This is a family over a to the p, which is just given by this projection here. This is this map pi. Okay, so this is a set. Okay, so this is a sentence, and then the second sentence is: moreover, if I take the pre-image of the all ones point here in my parameter space, I get what you think, namely, I get the affine form over this cross form. So let me go through and explain sort of word by word what's happening here. But before I do, let me say sort of what the upshot is. The upshot is if you know your simplicial complex, your dual ethosahedron, and you know this particular torus action on this space, there's essentially a canonical way of reconstructing the Graus Marian G2n from the state. Okay? That's the upshot. That's the upshot. And so, I'm going to next explain what a bunch of these words here are, and then we're going to actually see how this theorem works in this particular example. And hopefully, that will make things even more clear. All right, so let's maybe start with this word deformation. So, what do I mean in general by deformation? So, we're talking about a deformation of hex. Okay, so a deformation is going to be Okay, so a deformation is going to be some flat family over a base S. And this base S has a distinguished point. I believe it's called Omicron. And so this is sitting inside here. And I can look at the fiber over Omicron, and that should be my x. I should have a Cartesian diagram that looks like this. So this is what I mean by a deformation of Of this X. And what do I mean by being versal? So versal comes from the word universal. It's kind of like universal, but not quite. So let's imagine that I have some other deformation, x prime over some base s prime. And I'm going to restrict my attention to very special bases, namely those s prime that are Those s prime that are the spectrum of a local Artinian ring. So this means geometrically I'm thinking about this thing. Well, it's just a point with some thickening information. So versal means for any other deformation I have, I can induce it from my versal deformation. So if this guy's my versal deformation, this means that there's a math between S prime and S, and a map from S prime. and s and a math from x prime to x so that this is a Cartesian diagram. So this is what being versal means. You can sort of think about a versal deformation as being something like a local moduli space for your x, even when such things can't exist. I should also mention, Alan was complaining a bit maybe about this word flatness before. In our situation today, we're going to see that this actually has a very concrete meaning. That this actually has a very concrete meaning, which we'll come to see. Okay, so we've done deformation, we've done versal. So this map S prime passes that eating this case or just exists. No, it exists. So this is the huge problem. Yeah, I mean, so you can, if you want, you can require that S has a tangent space of minimal dimension at omicron, in which case the differential of this map will be unique. Math will be unique, but the math will not. And that's somehow the whole point. And why here this word canonical actually matters and is interesting. So you're sure, what's P? Yeah, P here is N choose 2 minus N. Yeah, okay, what does H invariant mean? Well, H acts on this space here. I can extend it to an action on this space just by having acts trivial. This space just by having act trivially on AP. And so I want that this strip X is H invariant, which means in particular the fibers of this map will also be H invariant. And I'm only going to consider other deformations that are H invariant in this sense. And so this versality isn't completely versal. It's only versal with respect to H-invariant demonstrations. Okay, so that's taken care of. We've already talked a little bit about this canonical business. Talked a little bit about this canonical business. Let me maybe just mention sort of two problems in general that we have in deformation theory. One is that, yeah, versal deformations aren't unique. And even if you require this business about the tangent space having minimal dimension, then the versal deformation is unique, but up to non-canonical isomorphism. Up to non-canonical isomorphism. So it's nasty. So problems is that in general there are choices to be made, and we'll actually see these choices in a second. And so this is the first problem. And part of this canonical business here is I'm claiming that there's sort of a best choice to be made in this situation. And so this non-uniqueness is maybe not so bad. The second problem is that, yeah, I kind of struck this under the rug. Yeah, I kind of struck this under the rug. In general, these things that we're talking about are actually purely formal objects. So I'm thinking about these maybe both as being given by power series. And the great news in this situation is that there is a versatile deformation that's not just given by power series. It's actually something that's algebraic and sitting inside here and living over affine space. So problem two is usually And if not algebraic. Okay, so really the content of the first part of this theorem is that we can avoid both of these problems in this situation. And then if you've made the right choices, which was really the right choice to be made here, then you do recover the rest of it. So let's actually see how this works in our example. And so what I'm going to basically talk about is a general procedure for constructing one of these H-invariant versus deformations. And so the idea is we want to start with first-order perturbations. So start with first-order deformations. So this is where the base S is just given by spec C T T squared. Okay, so I'm looking at things where I have a point where I have just a tiny tangent direction here. And looking at, well, how can I flatly perturb my original equations for this? My original equations for this. And it turns out that if I'm in a situation where I'm starting with one of these Stanley-Reisner schemes, these have been studied by Klaus Altmann and Nero Christofferson. So Altman and Christofferson describe all possible such things. So these actually form a vector space which is often called. And it turns out, so for Stanley-Reisner schemes, it's not always the case that there's a canonical basis for this space. But in this particular situation, and under some reasonable assumptions on your simplicial complex, it turns out that there actually is a canonical basis for this space of first order deformations. And so this sort of eliminates any choices that you would have to make at your first starting level when you're introducing your first perturbation. You're introducing your first perturbations. It turns out in this example, this space is five-dimensional, and so we're going to have sort of five independent first-order perturbations. And so we're starting off just with these five elements of our ideal. The idea is we're going to perturb them. That one has a question. Is there an adjective you can say about this little sphere that would say y would have this nice property in this case? Yeah, so if you have something that's a sphere, Yeah, so if you have something that's a sphere and something about the links that I can't quite tell you off the top of my head, that will guarantee it. I mean, if it's showable and sphere, then the links are spheres. Yeah, this might be enough. I'd have to think about it. I can't answer right now. But yeah, but. There is like a combinatorial thing. It's a combinatorial thing that will guarantee that it's true. I think it might actually be a property about how links. A property about how links intersect. I just read your paper. Yeah. I think it's a property about how links intersect, and then you want a link to also have that property, so it's inductive. Yeah. Thank you, Chris. Would you like to come up and give the rest of the talk? I'll continue. Okay, so we're starting with these five guys in our ideal, and now we're going to perturb them. Now we're going to perturb them. And yeah, by the way, here H-invariance means that we're only allowed to perturb by monomials that have the same degree. So for instance, this has degree E1 plus E3 plus E2 plus E4. So, well, look at that. We could perturb by this monomial. This would be okay with regards to the degree. We also need to check flatness. And in this case, it's okay. So here I have T1, T2, T3, T4. So I've added in these perturbations. Don't look at this yet. These terms don't exist here yet. Okay? So this was our first order perturbation. And this is flat over C T1 up to T5 modulo the maximal ideal squared. Here, this is the maximal ideal. Here, this is the maximum ideal generated by my dariers. Okay, so fantastic. Now the idea is we want to take this perturbation and lift it to higher and higher order, which means that we want flatness not just over this ring, but over this to higher and higher powers of k. Okay? And so what I wrote is not true. This here is not flat modulo m cubed. However, we can introduce higher order perturbations so that it does become flat. So to get flatness over m cubed, it's possible to introduce the following perturbations. Here I have T2, T5, here T1, T3, T2, T4. T2, T4, here T3, T5, here T4, and T1. This would do the trick. So I told you I was going to explain what flatness actually means in this situation. What flatness here means is if I look at the original generators of my ideal, any relation that I have among them has to lift to a perturbed relation among my perturbed equations. Perturbed equations. That's a very concrete interpretation of flatness in this situation. And so you could compute that the systygies among these things can be lifted to syges among these things. I'll spare you this trouble. Or if you didn't want to compute, there's a wonderful McCoy 2 package that will do this for you. Remember by you. Yes, it's true. Okay, so this is great. Now you might say, well, the 8th. Now you might say, well, do you mind if I turn? Please do. I will add some time in your mind. I'm looking at the clock too. So here, every fiber has an HR. Yes. And this is, so presumably in your paper, you define some kind of functor of H, some page actions. We don't define that, but yes, this is true. So, I mean, there is like a general theory of H-invariant deformations. And this is exactly. Yeah, there is a deformation functor, and that's what's secretly being considered here. I didn't want to say the word functor, but there is a functor of age-invariant deformations. Variant deformations. Okay, so you might complain though, because you might say, well, Nathan, you chose exactly the right lifting here so that we got back what we kind of like to dress module, right? And in fact, there are other liftings that I could have taken. So for instance, it would have been at least modulo m cubed, it would have been allowable for me to also add on maybe the perturbation t3 squared. T3 squared times, say, x14x23. So, I mean, this monomial we already had over here, but I'm packing in this sort of higher order perturbation. I could have done that, and this would also still be flat. You can check. But then I would say to you, well, why would you want to do that? You've added an extra term that you didn't need. And so the idea is at each step in this lifting procedure, Step in this lifting procedure, you always want to make sure that you are choosing a lifting that involves the minimal possible number of pneumonolians. So get rid of this. So step two, always choose minimal liftables. Is that where we thought about all of them? Yes. So part of the theorem, right, you might think that, yeah, you could, there might be different possibilities. There might be different possibilities for minimal liftings, but actually, there's only if you're imposing this minimality condition, at each stage there's a unique lifting. In this example, the actual construction is sort of gone. Sorry, maybe that's not it. Let's debate that after Okay, so yeah, so we can always choose minimal liftings, and this is what gives us this canonical H and variant version deformation. I should mention here, this lifting that we had modulo m cubed, right? We have flatness here at modulo m cubed. This is actually flat modulo any power m. And in fact, it's already flat over this. And so this is then actually what gives us this. This is then actually what gives us this flat family over a time space. So, this is not a proof of the theorem, but maybe an idea of what one has to do in order to prove the theorem. Step one, you mentioned that you can do this for perhaps more general and special complexes. Step two special about the graph mining here? Yes, we are using something special about the graph mining. In the second part of the talk, which we're about to start. Of the talk, which we're about to start, is going to be about some other simplicial complexes that we can do this for. Okay? But to the extent that you write this down, and because it integrates all of the T1, isn't it just automatic that it's the first one? Yes, so versality is automatic as long as you A have all of the T1. Have all of the T1, and B haven't introduced any unnecessary obstruction equations. And since we don't have any obstruction equations at all, it is versal. Yes. So this is why it's versal, exactly. Yeah, I just wanted to come back to how I do think this is still somewhat of a minor miracle, though, because, right, so initially, when we added in the first order deformations, Added in the first order deformations, we didn't have any of these terms over here. We only had these guys here. And then somehow, flatness is forcing these extra terms upon us that's going to give us the Gross 1. So that's kind of cool. And of course, we see here if we substitute in one for all our deformation parameters, we get back exactly those observations. Okay, so now I think it is time for the second half of the talk. So, what they're saying is, at this level, you have these. At the first level, you have these binomials, which is the core variety that Crossman degenerates before it goes on to the G25. I think for N larger, you won't quite have a Toric thing after first order of the conditions. Okay. And in fact, well, yeah, because we want to do the second part of the talk. And so the second part of the talk is supposed to be about. The talk is supposed to be about cluster algebras. And I should tell you, I know very little about cluster algebras, but fortunately, there are experts in the audience, including my co-author. So please ask him your questions. And in particular, I'm not going to give a precise definition for what a cluster algebra is. Rather, I'd like to tell you just enough so that you can understand what you need to for this talk. So, how can we think about a cluster algebra? When you think about a cluster algebra, let me actually first write down some names. So these were introduced by Foman and Zeleninsky, I think, in the early 2000s, with a view towards solving some problems in representation theory and some interesting applications in combinatorics. But they've really taken on a life of their own. So yeah, what is a cluster algebra? So a cluster algebra A cluster algebra A is a C domain, so an integral domain that's simultaneously a C algebra, equipped with some combinatorial structure. So let me stress, it's really Let me stress, it's really not just the algebra itself, it's the algebra together with this combinatorial structure. And I'm going to tell you a bit about one piece of the combinatorial structure, but not in full generality. So a key piece of this combinatorial structure are what are called clusters. So clusters are certain sub- Are certain subsets, say x1 up to xm of an algebra A. And some properties that they need to have is that these things should be algebraically independent over my ground field C. And in fact, they should generate The field of fractions of my cluster algebra. So I have some number of clusters. This is part of the combinatorial structure. Each cluster is a sort of a distinguished set of elements of my cluster algebra. And instead of making that more precise, I'm just going to give you an example. Okay, so I said that we were going to generalize this result about the Grassmannian G2n, which might lead you to think that G2n has the structure of a cluster algebra, and indeed it does. And so, at least for one of its cluster algebra structures, let me tell you what the clusters are for G25. are for G25. And when I say for G25, I mean the homogeneous coordinate random of G25, or the homogeneous coordinate, the affine coordinate rate of its affine coordinate. Okay, so what are the clusters going to be? So all the clusters have these boring plucker variables. These boring plugged variables, x12, x23, x34, x45, x15. And then each cluster has two more elements as well. So what are they? So there's going to be five clusters, and the additional elements in the clusters are as follows. I have x13, x1, 4. X14 X13 X25. This is maybe starting to look somewhat familiar. X35, X25, X25, X24, and X24, X14. So these are the five clusters. Maybe just to say a couple more words about cluster algebras without. A couple more words about cluster algebras without going into too much detail. There's actually a combinatorial rule that's encoded by a skew symmetric or skew symmetrizable matrix that tells you how to move from one cluster to another by a process called mutation. I assume we'll probably hear a bit more about that later in the week, but I don't want to discuss that. Should those be sets of pairs of variables? Yes. Yes. So, I mean, each cluster is the union of this one of these standard pairs with this set here. Thank you. Okay, so we noticed in this example, there are some common variables, or common elements of my cluster algebra belonging to all the clusters. So these are called frozen variables. So elements Common to all clusters are frozen variables. Okay, and then the things that are not the frozen variables are called cluster variables. So in this example, we have five frozen variables and five cluster variables. The frozen variables, there's always a finite number of them, let's say q, and so I'll always just label these by y1, y2, up to y2. Okay, so these are my filters in variables. Okay. Okay, and so it's an interesting question. Does my cluster algebra have finitely many cluster variables or not? In general, there are many cluster algebras that do not have finitely many cluster variables, and these are typically the ones that people are most interested in. Unfortunately, for the purposes of this talk, I'm restricting myself to the uninteresting situation when there's only finitely many cluster variables. And this is what's called being a finite cluster type. Being a finite cluster type. So finite cluster type means only finitely many cluster variables. So some examples of cluster algebras of finite cluster type. The coordinate ring of G2n. The coordinate ring of G2n is a finite cluster type. The coordinate ring of the Gasmanian G36 has a cluster structure making it of a finite cluster type, similarly for G37 and G38. Ordinant rings and other Grossmanns and their Pliker embeddings have the structure of cluster algebras, but they are not of finite cluster type. I should mention that there's a beautiful classification of things of finite cluster type in terms of Dinkin diagrams, again by Fulman Zelavinsky, but I'm not going to talk about that anymore either. Okay, so our goal in the second part of the talk is to somehow generalize the theorem from the first part of the talk, which means that we need a simplicial complex here. So how do we get a simplicial complex? So this is what's known as the cluster complex. Complex. This is also due to Foman and Zelovinsky. And let's only talk about this in the case where we are a finite cluster type. Then we're actually going to get the finite simplicial complex. So I'll denote this by KA. What are the vertices? So the vertices are given by the cluster variables. Okay, and what are the faces? Okay, and what are the phases? These are given by collections of cluster variables belonging to a common cluster. Okay, so over here, I basically already told you what the cluster complex looks like. What the cluster complex looks like for the coordinate ring of G25. And if you think back to the first part of the talk, it turns out to be exactly this 1, 2, 3, that's a 5 down, this 5 gun that we had before, where each one of these vertices, and here is x13, and here is x25, et cetera, et cetera. So indeed, for I have no chords, so I need to erase. But for G2n, the cluster complex that we get is exactly Kn, but you will associate with that. And so example, cluster complex for C Gn is exactly this Jn that we had before. Okay, so now we have this combinatorial thing, our cluster complex, and the idea is we want to recover our cluster algebra A somehow just from the combinatorics of the function. Somehow, just from the combinatorics of the plastic combinor. That's the goal. And if you think back to the Grasmanian situation, yeah, having the combinatorics or that piece of the combinatorics wasn't quite enough. We also needed this torus action. And so we'll need the torus action now as well. And so the idea is the following. We can look at spec A. So this is the variety that has our cluster algebra A as its coordinate ring. I'm assuming that we're in finite cluster. I'm assuming that we're in finite cluster type, which means that I have my q frozen variables, and maybe I have p cluster variables, which means, yeah, this ring is a quotient of a polynomial ring in p plus q variables. So I can think about this as living inside affine p plus q space. And so now I'm going to take my big torus on a p plus q and I'm going And I'm going to look at the subtorus H, that's the maximal subtorus here acting on specing. So H, maximal subtorus acting on second. Okay, so this is exactly the same way that we got our H in the case of the drops of model. Alright, so Alright, so now I can state the generalization of the theorem. Again, this is me, Alfredo, and Hippolito. Okay, so let's say A be a clustering algebra of finite cluster type with enough. Enough frozen variables. So I'll say a word about what I mean by this in a minute, but first you can just think that G2n, G36, and G37 and G38 all have enough frozen variables. Okay, so then what do we get? So here we're going to take x to be To be spec of the Stanley-Reisner ring for the cluster complex. And again, I have to add in these extra frozen variables. So y1 up to 1Q has, yeah, this is almost verbatim from what we had before, a canonical H invariant versal Versal deformation. So, what does this look like? This is going to be some script x sitting inside AP plus Q times AP over AP. So I'm going to have pi. That's a sentence. So same as in the first case. And now, what did we want? We wanted to recover our cluster algebra. We cover our cluster algebra A. So, moreover, so if I look at the special, not the special, at the fiber over the all ones point, this is exactly me covering our cluster algebra A. But actually, it turns out that this X that we have is something that's also interesting from the point of view of cluster algebras. From the point of view of cluster algebras. Namely, x itself is a spec of another cluster algebra, which is called the cluster algebra for A with universal coefficients. So this is something that was first introduced by Fohman and Zalevinsky. I'm not going to define exactly what this is, but let me just leave it as saying that this is something that's interesting in its own right in cluster theory. So not only So, not only do we recover the cluster algebra A using deformation theory, we actually recover this other interesting cluster algebra along with the universal coefficients. So this is the generalization of the theorem. I have a little bit of time left, and so I'd like to talk a bit about its proof. And it's actually in this general setting that the first theorem I presented also gets proved. So, proof sketch. So, the proof sketch is going to seem actually kind of backwards. In the proof, or I mean, in the statement of the theorem, the idea really is that we're starting with this combinatorial thing and using this to build back the cluster algebra and the universal cluster algebra. In the proof, though, it's going to look like we're doing the opposite. We're actually going to start with The opposite. I'm actually going to start with the universal cluster algebra and use this then to show that the deformation theory approach gives us what we want. Okay? So step one, Foman and Zelavinsky give us this universal cluster algebra, A universal. And this is actually an algebra over, so this has a bunch of frozen variables. It has all the frozen variables. It has all the frozen variables that my original cluster algebra A had, and it has P more of them, which are called the universal coefficients. And so this is actually an algebra over the polynomial ring T1 up to Tp. And so if we look at this geometrically, this actually gives us a map from spec A universal to affine space. The affine space AP and let's call this title for now. So is having finite p where you use finite type of a number of times in the clip, so I'll thank you for asking this out at the beginning. For asking, I'll point this out again in a second. We're going to use it heavily for the next thing that I'm going to say. So, step two is there's this work of Gross Hacking, Kiel, and Savich, where they show that for certain cluster algebras, there's a canonical basis for the cluster algebra. And in particular, if you have a cluster algebra of finite type, the finite. Type, definite cluster type, then using their results, you can show that the universal cluster algebra has one of these canonical basis. A universal has a canonical basis. And so as Alan pointed out, that actually shows that this map, not only is it a flat map, it's actually a free map. It's actually a free map. But it's enough for us to say flat. So this implies that this high-tilm is flat. Okay. So now this map here, at first glance, we don't know what it has to do with our x. What we would like is to show that actually x is the special fiber of this map. And this turns out to be true. This turns out to be true, and the way that we do this is we show that there exists C star P plus Q action on X and this base AP for which this pi tilde is equivariant. And using that, you can then argue that the fiber over your point zero, or omicron here, has to be given essentially by a monomial ideal. And combining this together with the fact that you know something about the basis, this actually tells you that it has to be the square of the monomial ideal given by the cluster components. So this plus GHK implies pi tilde. implies pi tilde inverse of zero is exactly your x. Okay, so now we're at the point where this family pi tilde, this is some deformation of x. We don't know if it's versal yet. And so, oh yeah, for reversality, we need to, as Alessio pointed out earlier, look at first-order deformations. So we look at Look at the first order deformations of X that are induced by this family pi tilde. And so on the one hand, yeah, Fohm and Zelovinsky, they don't really give an explicit description of this universal cluster algebra, but they give enough of a description that we can read off what the first order definition is. That we can read off what the first-order deformations are. On the other hand, using this work of Altman and Christopherson, we know exactly what the H-invariant first-order deformations of X are, and we just need to compare them. And so this is actually what it means to have enough frozen variables. This is a combinatorial criterion that I'm not going to write down exactly what it is here. But maybe something that's good to know is that if you have a cluster algebra that does not have enough frozen variables, That does not have enough frozen variables. There's another cluster algebra that you can get by adding frozen coefficients to it that does have enough frozen variables. And if you have enough frozen variables and you add more frozen variables, you will still have enough frozen variables. Okay. All right, so yeah, so if you have enough frozen variables, then this gives me universality in this family pi tilde. Pi tilde. And so now we can actually do what we wanted to do, though, which is to forget about the universal cluster algebra and instead start with this combinatorial thing. And so what do we do? We do exactly like we were doing in the example of G25, where we take this canonical basis for first-order deformations, and we lift step by step. And at each step in the lifting, we take a minimal lift. And you can show, since You can show, since you know this family pi tilde exists, that this family pi tilde is actually the unique minimum lift at each stage. What if you didn't know pi tilde exists? So if you didn't know pi tilde exists, then there's the two problems, right? There's the uniqueness at each stage, and then the question of two questions actually. Could it be that you get obstructions at some point, and does this lifting? And does this lifting ever stop? Do you actually get something algebraic? And so, to the first point, if you have more than enough frozen variables, then you actually can get uniqueness of lifting without telling about y tilde. That's fine. If, yeah, so algebraicity is some other condition you can impose, though. Yeah, algebraicity positive grading exists. Yes, if you have something like that, you can get that. And let me maybe just squeeze this in here. So, this is actually another theorem I wasn't planning on saying, but since you asked, P2, so if A is a finite cluster type and it's skew symmetric, so this is saying something about the combinatorics of the mutations between clusters, then T2 of T2 of A is equal to zero, which means that you'd never get obstructions, even if you weren't just taking H invariant declarations. And so this would guarantee that you're not going to get obstructions. Could this be phrased as a combinatorial condition on a cluster complex? Sorry, what? Could this be phrased as a combinatorial condition on the cluster complex? Yes, it is in the paper. In fact, you should read it again. Yeah. So let me write down the fifth step. The fifth step was just to The fifth step was just to take minimal lifts. And you can see that, in fact, this must be your high colour. Okay. So this is the idea of the proof. And yeah, let me maybe comment on this since I wrote this down. So not every finite cluster type, cluster algebra, is skew symmetric. So in fact, if you look at So, in fact, if you look at cluster algebras of, say, type B and C, these are not schizometric, they're only schizometrizable. And this fails. T2 is not equal to zero. But there's actually sort of a reason why T2 has to be non-zero, because if you have something of type B and something of type C of the same rank, they have the same cluster complex. And so it would be very strange if you could somehow take this cluster complex and deform it into cluster algebra of type. Into clustered algebra of type A and clustered algebra of type B, or sorry, of B and C, but somehow like no obstructions occurring in between them. So, this is, for me, a good reason for why this only works in the skew symmetric case. Okay, so I think Alessio took up a bit of my time. So, I'm going to end early, though, by staging one corollary of this, which is, I think, a nice application. I think a nice application, which is that if A is a finite cluster type, so the cluster algebra of a finite cluster type, this implies that A is 1. So this was previously known if you take cluster algebras that have no frozen coefficients, but to the best of my knowledge, this is new for cluster algebras where you have frozen coefficients. And the proof is, as many of you probably already know. Probably already know. Common autorics tells you that this thing here is Borenstein. Then, actually, I didn't tell you this, but this entire family is actually equivariant with regards to another torus action. This torus action spreads out the Gorensteinness all over the place, which gives you that the universal cluster algebra, and enhance also A is also good. So, okay, so I'll stop now and let you guys all go to dinner.
