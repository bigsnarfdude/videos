Okay, thanks. Thanks, Jenny. Thanks for the invitation to be there. Sorry I'm not there. And it's a regular messy setup. I had booked at the tutorial where the camera didn't work and I found a room that was already booked. And anyway, I've been running around the building trying to find a temporary solution. Yeah, Zoom talks. So what I want to do is I'm going to So um what I wanted to do is to sort about the uh so homology and the uh the stability in the homology of classical groups and this is uh mostly what came out of uh my job work with uh David Spring. So this is what I'm confused. So and uh I start by I'll start by stating a theorem. This is about classical groups over a field F2. So I'll only be talking about this. And so here's the theorem. This is a theorem that is due to a good number of people. I'll say this more precisely afterwards. Afterwards, so let me just statement to begin with if I take G L N to be either G L N S or O N S or S P 2 N S U N S. Then the stabilization, so there's a map for each of these. So there's a map for each of these groups you can increase n by sort of doing the identity on the extra extra factor you added. So you have these natural stabilization maps and when you go in homology, HI DN, this with integer coefficients, so I'm taking field, you know, doing these workshop fields, but with integer coefficients when I do the homology, these graphs whether carbon is smaller than n. So this is one statement when f is a finite so when f is a finite Is a finite field F L to the R. I guess I could just write F to the R. So this, and we consider G L is GM of this field. And we are with, this was with coefficients, and we do this with coefficients F p coefficients, then this can be improved this improves to amount I small readily. If I don't look smaller equal, I'll scroll this up. n plus r times p minus 1 minus 3. So this is a second statement and then a third statement is going to be sort of like here. So then I would take f So, yeah, okay, there are two cases. Either, so I take Gn to be the group which is usually called O and F where F is not of characteristic 2 and I can write minus 1 as x 1. a squared plus b squared in f. So this is a function on f okay or we're gonna need a little bit of space so or what am I gonna write? To understand this I guess I can go I guess I can go sorry yes. I I I it sounds like the sun is going into a little producer a little bit more of the of the blackboard. Or g n is u and f now allowed to be of characteristic 2, but I want to be able to write minus 1 plus a bar a well b bar b. A rho p bar P in the field, then we also have a stability statement like this: h i g n t h i. So this is now again integer coefficients for i smaller equal to n minus 1. So so so this so three terms so I Um so I s they are due to uh a whole lot of people. So for GLN, this is the original same proof by Quillen. Uh long ago it's in his in his notebooks. I mean it's possible to find it in there, but David and I brought up the argument that that comes from there. If you go to the simplectic groups and these groups ONN and UNN then Then there's work of Esset and Sa and also with a different valve, with a stroke two of Mirzai and van de Canen. This improvement for finite fields and the characteristic is due to Galachius Cooper's random Williams. And this last statement here. This last statement here can most probably be extracted modulo, possibly a different bound from the work of Kerry Bogman. But the reason, so what David and I really did, what is new in this theorem is really actually for these three groups, the symplectic groups O and N and U and N in particular for finite fields. For finite fields where we improved what was known by used to be a slope two, when we improved it to a slope one. The reason I state them all is because basically one proof works for all of this. It follows from one proof for these groups, which is basically the same proof as what Quillen was doing for GLN. And yeah, and the rest will follow. Will you follow? So, what I want to do in this talk is to first say a little bit what are these groups, ONN, ON and so on, how do they all fit together? And then at the end of the talk, say a little bit about what are the ingredients and hopefully we will see the conditions in the bottom part of the statement. In the bottom part of the statement that show. Okay? Short question? Yes? P in the second statement, P is allowed to be 2, but R has to be bigger than 1, or is P equals to not allowed? Right, so P is equal to 2 is allowed. In what David and I do, we are not allowed to put, you know, F is still not allowed to put F2, but in Galedis group as well. In Galatius Cooper's Random Regens, they do actually also have a statement. It's a slightly different statement for GNF2. So that statement we could not get out of these techniques. So I'm going to erase all of this. So the main thing I'll talk about. The main thing I'll talk about is this sort of basic slope-an stability for this particular groups. And then I want to touch on how this improvement shows up and how these other groups, ON and Newham, also show up. Okay, so So so so so G n uh so so G L N G L and F is really the automorphism of F to the N, it's the isomorphisms of F to the N, the vector space. And these are the groups O, U and S P are of the form are of the forms or groups of a vector space with a form and so each of these OU and SP are different flavors so the simpletic and the symplectic case so a symplectic a symplectic form omega is a form so It's a form, so it plus V plus V to F, which is an alternating non-degenerate non-degenerate form by data source, by the error. So that's what is called a symplectic form. And sp2n would be the equator of F2n with such a form. Unitary you could have what is called a formation form. Um F uh which is omission means it's uh separate linear one assumes that the field has some evolution and on one side it's not exactly it's like a bilinear form but then but on one side it will uh speed up the I mean the involution will will show up. with Schwartz is squilinear and then skew symmetric, again symmetric but up to this involution and again number generate. So that would be what we call a Hermitian form and then the orthogonal groups would be the automobile group of a vector space. Atomismal group of vector space B equipped with what is called a quadratic form Q from D to F. So it's quadratic so Q of Q of A B is A square B and And then it has the property that if you define B V W as Q of V plus W, so it's not linear, it's obviously not linear, but if you look at the failure of the linear, so Q of V plus W minus Q V minus Q W, then this should be by QW, then this should be bilateral and non-degenerate. Okay, so these are three flavors of forms and these groups are in some sense are automorphism groups of vector spaces with these different flavors of four. Flavors or four. So, how do we sort of more precisely get to a definition of these more particular groups I talked about so far on sort of giving naive political things? Because as far as we first pick what we have achieved, right? We work over some field. And then if we want to talk about our mission. If we want to talk about ambition forms or unitary groups, we need also to pick an evolution. An evolution. Maybe we don't really need it. I mean, if we talk about simplistic groups or orthogonal groups, it's not there. So we could be allowed to take this to be the identity. So this is what I have in mind. Then we're going to pick an epsilon which is terminal number 5 such that such that uh epsilon epsilon power is uh is equal to one. What you should have in mind is epsilon is eigen plus or minus one. And then there is one more piece of data which is the subgroup of f so some lambda which sits in between 0 and f it will often be either 0 or f. be either zero or f or the invariance of the involution. So it satisfies some important skill tools. And you can think of this data, so we picked an involution and we picked this epsilon t plus or minus one and this subgroup lambda is you know this is our flav it's gonna be our flavour. It's going to be our flavor of what. That we say whether we are symplectic unitary or orthogonal. And once we have this, then a form on B is an equivalence class. It's a It's a it's a cis a little map from V plus V F up to a certain equivalence that I'll give in a second. So set screen again, so this is by generative the form if the if the inversion is the identity and otherwise the inversion twists the the That twists the linearity on one side. Okay? So that's the compounded definition of a form. How do we cover these types of forms I'm erasing that we just talked about? So given you know, given one of these cues, Given one of these Q's, I can produce two things. I can produce an omega Q, which will look more like what we just talked about, by saying omega Q of V W is Q of V W plus epsilon Q of W V bar. So I start with any Start with any test current map Q, and then I can make it where it is symmetric or skew-symmetric, depending on my choice of epsilon, by just, you know, bilinear. I mean, it's still going to be bilinear or susquilinear, you know, by sort of simply forcing it to be. So we can prosecute by one of these, and then we can define a q we can define a Q, one of these quadratic forms type of object, QQ of V. So this is now going to be a map from V to F lambda. This is where lambda shows up. And we define the QQ of V to V Q of in its equivalence class. equivalence class. And the equivalence relation Q is equivalent to Q prime precisely if when I produce these two maps, omega Q and Q Q, then I do the same maps. Annaly, you're off the edge of the board, I think. That's not so good. Sorry. So then I should be using that aspirin. I should have gone down in the basement. Sorry about this. It's a beautiful sunny day in the morning. Can you guys read or is this really useless? Should I run into the basement? It's only half reading. Okay. Um yeah. Yeah. Okay, so this is sort of, you know, this is a way to define form. So what we see when you what is the conclusion of this is if you want to get synthetic next table wait, okay, let me give an example first. So example We can take V in F2 and divide Q of V W vectors in F2 to be V1 times W2. So I take the first component of the first vector times the second component of the second vector. So so this is this is the form This is the form. So H, we usually call it H, this is what is known as the hyperbolic form. So F with this form is the hydrogen form. And then if you go through these definitions, if we take If we take sigma to be function to be the identity, if we take s naught to minus 1, then the automorphism group of n copies of this form is exactly going to be the group SP2N S. It gives you the it gives you the sequence uh n lambda is uh I think lambda is the whole I think lambda is the whole is the whole thing in this case. It doesn't really. Yeah, lambda is lambda is f in this case. So that gives you the symplectic group. If you want the unitary group, then you're going to take epsilon is equal to one. In this case, so sigma inclusion is not the identity, otherwise it's not for the a unitary group. And Unitary group and lambda in this case is going to be the fixed points of the involution. And onto one is a group of n copies of h is minus code u n u and then of the quantum. So again, it's epsilon is equal to 1. Sigma is the normal identity. In this case, lambda is 0. your tomato of h plus n is what is n. So this is important to note this lambda, lambda is equal to zero in this case. Remember that an orthogonal group I define as the automorphism group of this quadratic form. And the quadratic form The quadratic form is defined as landing in target F modulo lambda. So when lambda is the whole thing, the target is zero, this quadrature form says nothing, but when lambda is zero, then this is sort of as big a group as one gets in this situation. Okay, so this is So this is like the largest parts of the groups I talked about, and I also talked about ON and UN, so this is the two that are missing. There's some of the more classical groups O and UN, and this comes from the form uh the following form, so Q is that part of the board is not that readable. It's not that readable. Not that we have a so we're going. This is really, yeah, okay, to say it. I don't know anything, so is it so is this sort of visible here? No, really. Is it? As long as you stay to the left of it, you should throw a shadow on it, and that's equipped. You got Sorin to walk over to walk over the board? Only the shadow. Let me check where the shadow is. This is a list. In the three, you have the board sort of divided into three panels right now. And speaking for myself, I can see the UNN and ONN panel quite clearly. So I think if you just w continue to write on that half of the blackboard. Yes, yes, that's it. Okay. So here's another form, E. So I take my vector space V to be just F and I take Q to be the identity map, right? Q from F to F. No, that's no, nons nonsense. Yeah, you just getting me distracted goes from B prime to F. Equal to F is a product, right? Like Q of VW is equal to V times W. So this is another happy Sescrian map I could consider. And in this case, when I play, anyway, I need mostly these two parts. So what can happen here, so I can utilize unitary choices, so epsilon is 1, sigma is not the identity, and lambda is... then lambda is fixed points of the evolution, then this will give me the automorphism group. If I put this Euclidean with the Euclidean form, E, then automorphism group of E n times is the group U U n and automorphism group of E n time theta is the E n times sigma is the orthogonal rule choice, this kind of rule O n s. But here we might want to ask the characteristic of the field to not be true. And this is the characteristic field not true that showed up in the theorem. It's because when in characteristic two, this form, you know, when I do, when I associate When I associated this omega and this Q, right, this was the symmetrized version, and then this is the quadratic form associated. The symmetrized version in characteristic T2 is going to be zero. And so this is a little bit degenerate in characteristic zero, and our arguments don't work for the characteristic. So, this is the characteristic two. And then we can ask quite a way what happened to the symplectic groups, except for the fact that they have a certain number here, but they actually I mean in this case the form here is totally degenerate. It's zero. The Euclidean symplectic form is a trivial form, and therefore there's no interesting Euclidean form. Okay? But so um yeah, and so so the sort of the the theorem bringing from it uh is with it is uh self-esteem where we proved is if you have a vector space you have some A vector space, you have sort of, yeah, so you take some vector space with some form, and you can look at the automorphism group of this guy, and you can look at the automorphism groups of this guy with a bunch of copies what happens when you What happens when you add the hyperbolic functions? When you look at the watermark of this VQ, that will give you the homology of the Molten Group of VQ plus the company of the hyperbolic form, well then this is an isomorphism whenever. whenever I is smaller than roughly the genus, so it is just genus minus genus of E strictly smaller than genus of E. That's a great statement where the genus of E is something, so E is the same, right? The genus of V Q. Q where the genus is the max dimension of an isotropic subspace or subspace where the forms omega and and and and Q vanish minus what is Q radical. minus what is called the radical the radical of of the of the bold space, which is in a way that things are completely zero minimum. So they are completely zero apart and then you count the dimension of a maximum isotopic subspace. So if you take this so this there works regardless of the flavor of one you choose, You chooses, you choose, and yeah, so it directly specializes to the groups sp2n, on and un. And then, you know, so this, so the proof, the proof follows quite exactly strategy for GNN. In the case of GNN, GNN, you could say, well, it's the automorphism group of a vector space with a trivial form. But in this term, if my form is completely zero, then the genus is never going to grow because I'm going to remove the radical will be the whole thing. So the theorem doesn't cover GM. The theorem doesn't cover GNN as such, but the proof is really very, very similar. And then it gives these groups S P 2n O and U and N directly by just taking copies of H plus N and copies of the hyperbolic form to begin with, and then And also that these other words O N and U N so they come from O N and U N with these funny conditions ahead because under these conditions we have an isomorphism E plus N, this U cubed M4 N times is isomorphic to the hyperbolic form hypervert for 2n times under certain conditions on the field. So this is sort of how all of these groups fit in the theorem and then the improvement for GMN of finite fields and their characteristics is by sort of doing a slighter, slightly refined analysis that uses. Analysis that uses vanishing of homologous time work modules. I'll get back to this in a second. I still have some time to talk. I still have a few minutes to talk about the proof. Okay, so modulo, you know, this when modulo is saying how we prove this theorem and how the finite fields show up, I have sort of given you at least a reason why the groups are together. A bit the groups have to get one European APG groups, uh the hot seat. Okay. But they rate it. Okay, so what do I want to say about the proof? Yes, so so question. Yes, of course. How does is does this also recapture the GMN case? Is that also a special case of the integral theorem we just talked about? Of the literal theorem you just had? That's what I just said. So it does not recapture GLN as such, because if you put GLN as the automorphism group of V with a trailer form, then the theorem says nothing because the whole genus will always be zero because it's eaten up by the radical. The radical is the whole thing. So this has, you know, the vector space Vn with the trigger form has zero genus. Has zero genus. But the structure of the proof is the same. Somehow the structure of the proof for GLN works for all these other groups, but I have no explanation why. This is just something we found out by doing it. So And I am my boundar. My band, right? I mean, it's not really so much. Yes. So, you know, so the the we want to do a a slow one. Do a a slow one a slow one a slow one thing, right? Yeah, so I guess I mean Sando talked already quite a bit about stability yesterday, so but the sort of what is the idea coming in here is we used a standard proof of We used a standard proof of stability which would say which is you look at the concept of these groups is acting on some spaces and then that some simply certain type of objects and that gives you a spectral sequence that comes from a double complex coming from this action. So the spectral sequence is going to be something to images that. Let me just write this like this. It will look like this. The homology of, we will have some of the orbits of P simplicities or of the homology of the stabilizer of this P simplicity, possibly with some twisted coefficients. So a priori probably not. So a priority probably not, but in our situation we will have some twisted corrections. And typically out of this spectral sequence you can get a slope two argument. And if you want a slope one you need to do some extra work. But the first thing you need is you need a space, so the connectivity of the space will give you a vanishing meaning. Of this space will give you a vanishing in a range of the spectral sequence. And for this to be able to give you a strong problem, the first thing you need is that the extent is sort of one connective to already restricts you quite a bit because a lot of the complexes one would want to use are obviously of two connected. So this is one thing. Yeah. And then we need and then we need extra values in. We need to know something in the spectral sequence. Otherwise, in one component three, we need to know something in the spectral sequence. So these are the two things that we are known. And the solution is that one thing that solves Boeh's problem problem is solution is we work with is we work with the tip buildings, with the buildings of the vector space. So for the PSNs, we can just work with sort of what I would like the largest building would be we take all the subspaces, but including possibly V, so these are just subspaces, so this is a contractible, the possibility of subspaces. Of subspaces of your vector space. And for these other groups, the sort of symplectic and orthogonal immunity of groups, you work with these subspaces that are isotropic. So here, I mean, the whole I mean the whole vector space is never isentropic, so I never have the whole. I mean this is not a contractive, it's not going to be a contractible space, but otherwise, in some sense, I'm very much the same. And when you work with these, they're going to create a lot of problems because the stabilizer of one of these subspaces is going to be some sort of affine version of the group. It's going to be a miss. I mean, you have to give this stabilizer. I mean, you have to give these stabilizers. And the other thing is that these are postets, and so the way we get the spectra sequence is not by working directly with the norm of the posset, but by working with a chain complex you get out of the fact that it's a Coe-Michael posset and intervals are spheres. And so you can make a building that, you know, you can make a chain complex that also gives a spectral sequence, but that will give you here. I will give you here twisted notions by the Steinberg module of GLN. And here the Steinberg module of GLN is going to show up in both cases because they come from lower intervals. And if a subspace is isotropic, then subspace of this subspace are also isotropic. So you're going to get G and N Steinberg module coefficients here, and then Coefficients here, and then this is like, so this is sort of, we got a strong one connected thing because we chose these buildings, and then the extra vanishing is actually going to come up from exactly these two state coefficients because of the vanishing of the co-invariance of the Steinberg module. And then the improvement for GLN over finite fields comes from the fact that interest proof by Kalesis when interest proof by Kannada's friend Coopers and Reinhardt Williams that higher homology district coefficients either standby of GNN in these cases also vanish. So that's sort of the quick idea of what comes into this proof. I think I stopped here. Are there questions in in person first? In person first. I have a question. So the sort of non-formal part of what Sander and Peter and I did in the GLNZ case, I mean, the part that isn't copying what Sander and Oscar did earlier in the GLNZ case is this relative Steinberg coinvariance vanishing. If you knew that, If you knew that, given that, could you run your machine for GLNZ? Like, is that... It is a main ingredient. So that's definitely a really good start. Because we did not have that, we did not try to run... This is for GLN, right? I mean, GLN is not as bad. Like the other group. Like the other groups, the buildings are, I mean you get into, I mean it is more complicated, the proof of connectivity of the buildings, the relative pay is quite intricate. But probably GNN is, yeah, I would think that GNCs are good. Is there a similar thing for like if you wanted to prove slow instability for symplectic groups over the integers? Symplectic groups over the integers, you know, would there be a similar problem? Yeah, you would have to do, you know, maybe it's a lot of work for getting these, I mean, do you need conductivity and vanishing of coinvariance? That like both both aren't known in the, let's say, replacing a field with the integers? But even with the field we had to prove, in particular the relative version of this building, we had to prove it. So we found out, so Bachmann had an argument for ONN that turned out to generalize. But I mean it would be a lot of work to yeah, some amount of work to to check whether that can also be done in like for something like Like for something like zooms that are machine. Yeah. Yeah, I I don't know. I mean we didn't we didn't try. But certainly. Yeah. Any other in-person questions? Any questions of resume? Okay, let's thank Natalie again. People over Zoom are going to have their picture taken in three minutes or something. Is that the plan, Jenny? Yes, maybe in six minutes. Okay.
