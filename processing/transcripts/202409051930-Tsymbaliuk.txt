Today I will speak about quantum affine groups. So it is kind of a downgrade of the main subject of this workshop. Nonetheless, the tools are expected to be applied also to toroidal algebras. So this is a kind of pre-step to the bigger problem. So there will be two main two parts. The first will be about combinatorics of Linden words and various types of Schoffel algebras. Various types of shuffle algebras. And in the second shorter part, we'll discuss fused currents from shuffle perspective. So for start, we will be starting recording some combinatorical gadgets. So we will start with a finite ordered alphabet, x, and let x plus denote the set of finite length words in that alphabet. So basically you have a finite set of letters, but what we do start from the very beginning, we order the letters. We order the letters. And now we have the set of finite length words, and the original order on x gives you lexicographical order on x plus. And the first major definition for today's talk is the notion of a Linden word. So a finite length word is called Linden if it is smaller than any right suffix with respect to graphical ordering. And this notion comes with two basic results, but before going to them, let's do an example. Going to them, let's do an example. So, just consider an alphabet of two letters, one and two, and there are two different orders. I'll choose whether letter one is less than two. So, in that setup, one one two is Linden, but one two one one two is not, because you can see that the suffix of length three is actually smaller. And there are two things we will need to use later on. So, for one thing, every Indian word can be split up canonically. Can be split up canonically into two Linden words. There are more or less two different ways to do it. I will use the cost standard factorization. So if you start from a Linden word, you look at the maximal proper suffix, which is also Linden, L2. And as a matter of fact, then it turns out that L1 is also Linden. And so what that really gives you, it allows to construct a binary tree starting from a Linden word. You look at the suffix and prefix in canonic. you look at the suffix in prefix in canonical factorization and so on until you get to the endpoints just bin length one Linden words. And another thing is that every word in my finite alphabet can be canonically factorized as a concatenation of Linden words. So it allows to build up uniquely any word from those basic objects. And so those are cameratorical gadgets, but since we are interested in quantum groups or even interested in quantum groups or even before that in Lie algebras let's now see how those combinatorical objects give rise to some basices in Lie algebra so let's now assume that you have a Lie algebra generated by your alphabet so in other words for every letter x you have a generator of your Lie algebra and then the cost standard factorization allows for inductive procedure to define the so-called standard bracketing so if you have Break it in. So if you have a water consisting just of one letter, it gives you the generator x in ULE algebra. But now, if you take a Linden word which is of length bigger than one, take its cost standard factorization. By induction, we know what we associated to L1, L2, take the commutator inside G. So it gives you, it associates an element of Lie algebra to every Linden word. And the reason why we care. The reason why we care about those Linden words is an old result from the middle of the previous century due to Linden and Firshoff. Is that if you look at all Linden words and look at the corresponding bracketings, that gives you a basis of Free Lie algebra. And by nowadays, this is one of the most canonical ways to construct basices of Free Lie algebras. So that's a cool result, but how about other Lie algebras? Like most Lie algebras are not free, so what can be said in that setup? So what can be said in that setup when you have a finitely generated algebra? And surprisingly, it took people about a few decades to resolve this, even though the answer is more or less tautological from certain perspective. So let's go over that. So let G be a Lie algebra generated by the generators X, where for each generator we have the corresponding letter in my alphabet. But now we have, we impose some relations. So J is the ideal. So, j is the ideal by which we quotient. And to define the corresponding, to describe the corresponding basis, let's give the following definition. So, for every finite length word in my alphabet, we are going to consider the following element in universal synvelope. So, we just take for each letter, we have its corresponding generator in Lie algebra, and we take the product. So, the right-hand side over here is viewed as a degree k element in u of g. U of G. And now we call a word standard if the corresponding gadget is not a linear combination of similar gadgets for bigger words. So this kind of simple Grobner type construction. And let's just illustrate on the type A n, where n is at least two. So we saw on the first slide that 1, 1, 2 was indeed. But if we think about But if we think about this word with respect to my alphabet and Li algebra of type A n, then in fact it is not standard. And the reason for this is very simple. It is due to three relations, because you can express 112 in terms of such objects for 1, 2, 1 and 2, 1, 1. All right. And so the theorem that is relevant for our discussion is the result of La Londe Ram from the end of last century, which basically pinpoints the basically pinpoint the cominatorical description of those linen words whose bracketing will give you a basis of the finitely generated E algebra. So obviously you had a basis of the PD algebra, it gives you a Spaniard set, but the question was, can we canonically describe some subset which gives you a basis in this workshop? And the answer is that you look at all standard Linden works. And the major application both in the paper and for today's talk In and for today's talk, will be in the case when G is cut-moody algebra, and we will start from finite-dimensional simple L-algebra. So, let G be a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra. So it comes with associated Cartan matrix, Aij. It has a root systems. Positive roots will be denoted by delta plus. And for the rest of today, we are not going to be looking actually at the whole G. We will be considering only the positive part. So it is the subject. So it is the sub-algebra generated by EI, and the only relations are the classical seri relations written over here. So we take a quotient of 3D algebra by those serry relations. So what do we get in that case? So on one side, the result mentioned from the previous slide tells you that if you take the alphabet consisting of simple, of indexing sets for simple roots, choose any order, so the order is up to you, then the standard key in the north give you a base. The standard Linden nodes give you a basis of n plus. On the other side, n plus a canonical decomposition into one-dimensional subspaces with respect to root decomposition. And since you have two different velocities, but evoking that they are both can be equipped with a gradient by the root lattice, you immediately deduce that there is a bijection from delta plus to standard Linden words. So delta plus is a set of positive roots. Set of positive roots, the right-hand side nonetheless depends also on the choice of the order. So, choice of order is something you choose from the very starting point. All right, so this was the algebra context. So, let's now go to quantum group. That's since this is our major object for today. So, we will start from quantum finite group of Greenfield Jim presentation. So, UQG will be generated by will be generated by similar generators, EI, FI, and Cartan elements, in the most standard way. And when Q is sent to one at the limit, you recover back universality. And as before, we will look not at all quantum group, but only at positive sub-algebra. So we'll be looking at EI, and the only relations that are now imposed are quantum theory relations. And not only it is sub-algebra, but actually you can recover. but actually you can recover back the whole quantum group by Dreamfield double if you also insert Cartan part. All right, so that's the natural quantization of U of G and therefore it is desirable to have most of the analogs of basic results for classical algebras. And let's start from the PPW basis. Or maybe even before we go to PPW basis, let's start from combinatorical description. So Description. So, right away, just to contrast the presentation here, where UQN plus was defined as a quotient algebra, later on we will need also a different dual presentation where we rather embed UQN plus into some algebra. And the algebra is constructed as follows. So, as an ambience vector space, we are going to look at the vector space whose basis is again construct consisting of finite length words in my alphabet. But the But the product is going to be the Q deformation of the classical shuffle product. So you have two words of length scan L, and the product is going to be a sum of various shuffles of those letters, so that all letters from the first word are placed in the same order. All letters of the second word, J1, J2, JL, are placed over here with respect. Over here with respect to the same order, but between themselves, they are allowed to shuffle whatever they want. And if there was no coefficient in front, that would be just the most classical shuffle product from the middle of last century. But now we are inserting powers of Q. And the precise formula is that you count the sum of pairings of simple roots subject to those conditions. So I will not put emphasis on that because one can uniquely up to new. Up to mutual constant to rescale this so that the following holds. So, the power of Q is designed so that you have an embedding of positive part of quantum group to this shuttle at. And what it does on generators is very simple. Every generator EI is just sent to a word of length one. And that's how you can recover then all the powers. All right. So now back. So now back to the basic properties of quantum group. So for one thing we want a PBW basis. And at the later point of today's talk, we will be looking also at PBW basis of quantum affine algebras. But for right now, let's recall what happens for finite type. So Louistics construction gives you a family of basis of UQN plus, which kind of Q deform the usual point Karen Goff with basis. With basis. But there is a little bit of nuisance here. So, for one thing, the order is not arbitrary. And the order over here on the set of delta plus is only supposed to be convex. And what that means is that if you have two roots and their sum is again a root, it's placed in between. And it is well known by the old result of Patty that there is a bijection between such convex orders and reduced decompositions of W naught. So in Newstick's work, he starts. So in New 60s work, he starts from reduced decomposition of W naught, but for us we will better use this alternative description. And each root generator is constructed then by braid group action of listing. All right, so this gives you for every convex order, it gives you a basis of uqn plus. But in fact, it gives you a whole family of basices for various sub-algebras, which one can think as segmental sub-algebras. So if you pick two, if you So if you pick two, if you fix two roots, alpha and beta, you can generate sub-algebra by all those E gamma in between alpha and beta. And you can ask what are the basis for those sub-algebras. And this result simply follows from the following very important property, which was discovered first, I believe, by Lewandorsky Sobelmann in the 90s, which states the following. So if you take two roots, alpha and beta, and beta is bigger than alpha, and you look at this. An alpha, and you look at this q-commutator, then it must actually be a span not of all PDW bases, but only of those monomials which involve E gamma, strictly in between alpha and beta. And so what that property tells you is that now if you fix alpha and beta and you look at subalgebra of UQn plus generated by all E gammas in between alpha and beta, including both ends, then it will have In both ends, then it will have a similar TPW basis, but now again, the indices will be between alpha and beta. So it's a very strong, important property of those basices. And an important application of this is the following. So if you have two roots, alpha and beta, and alpha plus beta is again root, but moreover, there is no decomposition of this root, alpha plus beta, into the sum of alpha prime. plus beta into the sum of alpha prime plus beta prime strictly inside then in the right hand side there is only one term that survives and that will be e gamma and in front of it we will have some non-zero constant coefficient depending on q and so what that basically tells you that instead of using braid group action of heuristic one can start from convex order on the positive on the set of positive roots and then reconstruct up to constants reconstruct up to constants all root generators in very combinatorical way. Pick a minimal decomposition, find determine E gamma by the two commutator and keep going. And this can be done by induction, for example, on the height of roots. All right. So now to connect this back to the combinatorical construction, I'll review a couple of results from Leclerc's work. So Leclerc kind of generalized the work of Lavondram and applied this to the And he applied this to the quantum setup to describe the dual canonical basis in finite quantum groups. So he started with the following observation. So we had this bijection of La Longeram from the set of Ziff roots to the set of standard Linden works. And back in their paper, they did compute this for all simple algebras, but for very specific orderings of simple roots. And what La Clerk observed is that there is a very simple computable algorithm, which on computer gives you the outcome in a matter of seconds for all types and for all others. And what it does, it says that the standard Linden word corresponding to the root alpha is just a maximum of all possible concatenations. And the way they cooked us, they cooked out is the following. You take alpha, you split it as a sum of two roots, gamma one, gamma two. gamma one gamma two you by by induction you assume that you already know the associated standard lindenverse for those two and you concatenate in increasing order so l of gamma one is less than l of gamma two and you take the maximum of those concatenations and second observation which leclerc actually attributes to preprint of rosa is that if we now look at this bijection so we have bijection between positive rules and standard linear words one One important feature is that the right-hand side is naturally equipped with the order, which is just like a graphical order. And we can pull it back to the order on delta plus. And the claim that that order is convex. And what that gives you is that, according to the previous slide, it allows to construct root generators. Again, which up to constants will coincide with USIX root generators. And that's how Leclerc actually defaults. So if you have a lot of So if you have a word of length one, then the corresponding root generator is just my dream field gym board generator EI. If I now have a Linden word of length bigger than one, take cost standard factorization, L1, L2, take Q commutator. Again, by induction, we assume that we know those gadgets. Finally, if you have some word W, we know that it comes with canonical factorization into concatenation of Linden words in non-increasing order. In non-increasing order, and just take the product of those. So that's the definition of root generators over here and of their ordered products in quantum group. And to connect it back even to one more object from previous discussion, if you now look at this root generator associated to the root beta, and you look at the image in quantum shuffle algebra, so it is a finite sum of finite length numbers. Sum of finite length words and pick the largest one of those. And it turns out that it is the minimal among all largest words in the image. And its degree is exactly, and this word is exactly L of beta. So it connects different pieces from our previous discussion. So let's just see how it works in the simplest possible example. So I'll start from a n dinking diagram, and the order we choose is the simplest one. Alpha 1 less than alpha 2, dot dot dot less than alpha n. Alpha 2 dot dot dot less than alpha n. So it tells you that on your alphabet, you order from left to right, from 1 up to n. So the roots are going to be just the sum of alpha i plus alpha i plus 1 and so on, up to alpha j. What the corresponding bijection looks like is the most naive thing. So to such a root, it associates the words i, i plus 1, dot, dot, dot, up to j. So it puts all the letters consecutively from i to j and the corresponding. I to j and the corresponding root generator are actually those two commutators. And those, I believe, appeared first in one of Jimba's first papers on quantum groups when he constructed basic of type A quantum group. All right, so that concludes my previous overview of classical subject. So any questions on that? All right. If not, then we'll continue. If not, then we'll continue. So from now on, all the rest is going to be discussed based on joint works with Andrene Good. So let's start from the following question. So the previous was only about finite dimensional simply algebras. And one can wonder to what extent it can be generalized to more general Katzmuji algebras. So the next candidate after a simple algebra is the affine one, and it has two different radiations. So I can view L. Different realization. So I can view as central extension of loop symptoms, or I can view it as a Chevalier-C realization by from extended inkendieger or from extended Cartal metric. So I add to my vertex set I one more vertex zero, and I will be looking now in a way I can either follow that procedure. So if I view G hat as coming from I hat, it would be natural. Coming from IHET, it would be natural to consider the alphabet where I just added one more letter and go from here. But as we will see soon, we will rather look at the alternative loop realization. But for right now, let's observe the following. So we have those two realizations, and g hat has also root decomposition. And if I look at the positive roots, they can be described as follows. So the positive roots of a finite root system are either a finite root, A finite root and an integer, or just a multiple of imaginary root. And the major difference is that while the corresponding root subspaces for alpha n are all one-dimensional, the root subspaces for k delta are not, unless you started from SL2 and look at SL2O5. And for that reason, there will be a major obstacle if you try to generalize most of the previous results to I-hat discussion. Name here. So, for one thing, since this dimension is bigger than one, obviously Lalonde-Ram's bijection does not follow immediately. And also, because of Leclerc's description of this bijection, which was inductive, once it breaks down at data, it's not completely clear what happens at any root after, which is bigger than data. So it's not clear either about what happens at imaginary roots, nor what happens at real imaginary roots. Happens at real imaginary roots of high bigger than data. How about the Bacon and Damianis? Ah, you already explained. Okay. But what? What happened to the Bacon and Damianis PVW basis? We will get there. We'll get there. Okay. Thank you. So instead, we will look at the loop realization. And again, since we are mostly interested in quantum groups, again, quantum affine group. Again, quantum affine group has either Drinkfield-Jimbo regulation through extended Drinking diagram, or it has a loop regulation, which was first proposed by Drinkhield, and this isomorphism was carefully described later by Beck and Damiani. So, for that reason, we will focus on this loop realization. And as always in today's talk, we are only gonna look at the positive part. So, I'm not gonna look at Positive part. So I'm not going to look at all quantum affine algebra. I'm going to look only at the positive subalgebra. So in our case, this is subalgebra generated by all those EIDs. And so I can forget that there is a big quantum group behind. I can just look at the algebra generated by those guys with explicit relations. So they will be quadratic relations and they will be sort of quantum serry relations. And again, you can recover back UQG under suitable Grinfield double. Under suitable Dreenfield double construction. But one should be aware that even though we have this isomorphism, it doesn't intertwine positive parts. So the positive part of Dreenfield-Jim representation does not match under this identification with the positive part we are looking now. Okay? And so just as a reminder for what's going to happen next, the PPW basis for quantum affine groups was commonly known in Groups was commonly known in the context of Dreenfield-Gym polarization. So, Beck's construction was for UQN plus head and UQN head minus. And what we are going to discuss today is the different polarization. All right, so now we are kind of ready to continue to generalize all the results from finite setup to affine. So, the major counterpart is what? Once you have a generator, you associate a letter of your L. Associated letter of your alphabet. So, my generators were EID, so therefore we are now treating an infinite alphabet, I d, where I is an index of the Dinking diagram, of the finite Dinking diagram, and D is an integer. And again, as a quantum shuffle algebra, we will therefore look at the vector space, which consists of finite length squared in that alphabet. And the shuffle product is something not as easy as it was. Not as easy as it was in finite case. So I'm eating those coefficients. But what it essentially does is the following. So you have two finite length swords. You reshuffle the letters, preserving the relative order of I letters, the relative order of J letters. But now also the exponents can change. So those upper indices, which we'll call exponents, they do change. So you have an infinite sum, in fact, with some coefficients which I'm skipping for private. Which I'm skipping for brevity since it's not essential for today's talk. But again, the whole formula is designed so that you have an algebra embedding. And what an algebra embedding is always doing, it sends the generator to the most simple element. So generator EID, just send to letter one work ID. So now we have, so we have infinite alphabet, we have quantum suffer algebra, and now we can continue. So, but two. So, but to speak about Linden words or standard Linden words, one thing we start from, we impose some order. And this is very important. So in finite case, we had finite alphabet. There were finitely many choices to choose the order. And it was more or less irrelevant which one you choose. Now we have an infinite alphabet, which essentially has two different structures, the underlying finite set I and the infinite set of exponents D. Of exponents d. And there are a whole family of orders. And for most of today's talk, I'm going to look at the following order. So we have two letters. We are going to first compare the exponents. So if the exponent, if one exponent is bigger than another exponent, then we declare that i d is less than je. But in the case when exponents are the same, then we look at the order of the underlying i and j. So we kind of start from the order on the finite set i. The order on the finite set i and now introduce the order on the infinite alphabet. And it turns out that in that case, we again have a bijection from delta plus cross z to standard T indon words, to standard T indon loop words. So loop stands for the fact that we just have this big alphabet, id. And the bijection is coming for the same reason. The algebra of loops into n plus, on one hand, it has a basis corresponding coming just from Corresponding coming just from root space decomposition, which is where each subspace is one-dimensional. But on the other hand, it does have a basis coming from standard Klinden loop drawers. And for degree reason, they coincide up to scaling. So even though it looks very similar, but actually it's not completely tautological. So kind of some effort needs to be done to actually define standard indan loop works. And the reason is very simple. In the classical case, we had finite. Use in the classical case, we had finite alphabet. There was no problem with defining standard Linden loop words. Now we have infinite alphabet, and there are infinitely many words of the same degree which are bigger than my given one. And so some results need to be established, which will some of which will be recalled on the next slide, to actually define that nothing. And moreover, now if I look what happens when I, at the section data plus cross zero, so if I take alpha cross So if I take alpha, zero, and look at the corresponding standard Klein Dunlop work, it turns out that all exponents are zero. And if I erase those exponents, I just get the same word as in Lalonde deramps bijection. So this is kind of a fine version of what we started from today. All right. So now a few properties. So some of those properties are needed even to define standard Linden words. Some of the properties are now real properties of those. So for one. Those. So, for one thing, we have a bijection, and it seems like it amounts to given an infinite amount of data, but in fact, it suffices to give a finite piece of this bijection. So, what it suffices is to describe all those L beta G when integer G ranges from one up to the height of beta. And the reason is very simple. If you know the standard end and loop word corresponding to the pair beta comma d, then in fact you know the data. beta comma d, then in fact you know what happens when you increase this d by any multiple of the height of beta. And what you do, you just add the same integer to the exponents. And so for that reason, this problem becomes again computable even on computer once we have an algorithm. And what we need on the output is just a finite set of standard T independent dots. All right. The second property is. All right, the second property is that if I fix beta and I arrange letters d in integers d, then that sequence strictly decreases. So when I have a simple root, that's how our order on the alphabet was constructed. But now we claim that this holds for every beta. And again, a crucial property that now, if beta is any positive root and yields an integer, then in fact, all letters that will show up in the associated standard. In the associated standard Linden loop yard, will have exponents taking one of the two possible values. So you take the ratio, g divided by the height of beta, and you take the lower and upper integer parts. And in particular, if g was divisible, all exponents must be the same. And this property is actually crucial to define the notion of standard Lindenbergs in that affine setup. So basically, the idea is you have an infinite alphabet, you rather look at the Alphabet, you rather look at the increasing family of finite sub-alphabets. You define standard Linden words corresponding to each of them, and you use that property to show that this construction is compatible. And so as you extend, you get all standard Linden loop words. And just again, as a simplest example, let's look at type A and the same simplest order we had before, 1, less than 2, less than 3, and so on. So in that case, if I start from the root, if I look at the root alpha ij. the root if I look at the root alpha ij so i need to look at all d from one to the height which which is j minus i plus one and the word looks as follows so it starts from j minus d plus one with exponent one then it goes down up to i with all letters having exponent zero and then it goes up with all letters having exponent one all right so now as i said the first three points were more kind of properties needed to define standard Properties needed to define standard clean and loop words. Now, the properties that are actually important is that, first of all, that order is convex. And this is what that means is that if you start from a pair, alpha an integer, beta an integer, such that alpha plus beta is a root, then the sum of those pairs is sandwiched in between. Where again, we have a bijection, we have like psychographical ordering onwards, we pull it back on the set data plus. Pull it back on the set data plus crossy. And moreover, not only is this convex, but it actually matches more classical construction of back and the mieni, where you start from a reduced decomposition of some latest element in extended while group, in extended affine while group, and you build, you list all the, you construct periodic sequence and which allows to list all positive foods. All right. So now, since we have all those results, which Since we have all those results, which kind of a fine generalization of what we had in finite case, now it's not surprising that we have a fine generalization of PPW property. So what we get is that, again, just following Leclerc's idea, construct root vectors by iterated Q commutators. And the construction is canonical. You have your standard Linden loop for it. You take its cost standard factorization. By induction, you know, the corresponding generators for suffix and pressure. generators for suffix and prefix take your commutator and keep going and that way we construct e beta d for any pair of a positive root and an integer and then the claim is that the ordered product of such of such root generators gives you a basis of the positive part of quantum group and again just as before it this basis is not only a basis of uqln plus but it actually gives you a whole family of bases of various You a whole family of basic of various segmental sub-algebras. So if you take two pairs, alpha, comma, d, beta, comma, e, and you look at all at the sub-algebra generated by all generators in between, it again has such a base. And this construction, even though it is very similar, but it is actually kind of slightly different or even orthogonal to Beck's construction, because in his construction, he was looking at Rimfi-Jimbo radiation. And for that reason, in the classical construction, In the classical construction of PPW basis, you have kind of they're not as neatly stated as here, because you have imaginary roots in between. So you have some kind of quarter product on one side, then you have imaginary roots, and then you have another infinite quarter product. And the relation between those two is indeed coming from the fact that quantum group can be viewed from two different halves, whether it be dreamfield jimbo or midreinfield. New green field and each of them again splits into two halves. So, altogether, you have four quarter subalgebras, but they're kind of glued together differently. All right, so any questions on that? So, Beck's PP double basis is compatible with canonical basis. Do you have a similar property? Not at that point. So, for this, you need to generalize Leclerc's work for a way he applies this communatorial perspective to dual. This combinatorical perspective to dual canonical basis for quantum group in the present setup. This is not done yet. Okay. So let me just mention a subtle generalization of this. So this was a recent project with Ukrainian high school students. So basically, the idea was that we have infinite alphabet, and there are many different ways to introduce the order on that. And let's look at the following generalization. So I'll start from a family. So I'll start from a family of functions. So they're functions from integers to real numbers. They're unbounded on either side. They take zero at zero. And the intersection of images is again infinite set unbounded from either side. And given that data, we declare the following order on my alphabet. So first we compare those functions f id and fge. If they're not equal, we order accordingly. And if they're equal, then we compare the underlying. We compare the underlying finite letters i and j. So, when in the case when all those functions are just identical to x, then we recover the previous discussion, but this is more general. So, what happens and what fails in that case? So, obviously, the periodicity is going to fail because this is very general, unless I impose some other restrictions on fi, my bijection cannot be recovered from finite piece. So, the periodicity fails, but this. Predigit first, but this the property that was simple enough still holds. So, if I fix beta and arrange the center, the second index, then my sequence is strictly decreasing. And now, again, since monotonicity fails, we want some description of how to build up all words if I start from if I know the previous one. So if I know the word L alpha D, how can I construct all words with the same alpha? With the same alpha. And this is based on the following two properties. So, property one, exponent tightness, says that the first letter, which is actually the minimum of all letters in the Indian word, is actually bigger or equal than any other letter with exponent increased by one. And using that property actually comes the second bullet over here, which basically says that if you know a standard Linden word for alpha d, then as a multi-set of letters, at least, you know all other Linden standard words with Standard words with the same alpha. And what you do, you take all those letters, you increase the exponent by one, you pick the maximum out of those, and that will be the first letter of my word. And all other letters are the remaining letters of that word up to some permit X. We don't know how to describe it. Nonetheless, this allows us still to prove that the major two properties still hold. So, first of all, the order is still convex. This goes. This goes by the same argument without any changes. But the second part does need some changes. So, in the previous discussion, we were getting, we had creates it and we were saying that we have convex order, but it's coming from reduced decomposition of row check. And the idea was that you take reduced decomposition of some latest element and then you reiterate it to construct the infinite sequence. Now we don't have three dist. Now we don't have credit, but nonetheless we claim that the corresponding order still comes from an increasing sequences of reduced decompositions of various elements in PCHEC. So it's kind of, it's not periodical, but you can still build it up. And for this, exactly for this reason, it still gives you a PBW type basis of quantum group. So this is just a slight generalization where pre-distrib fails, but all other properties still hold. Properties still hold. All right, so now let's go to the next discussion. So, actually, all the previous was something we came up as a kind of tool to establish the main goal of our project. So, our first goal was to compare quantum affine groups and another type of Schuffle algebras, which are trigonometric degenerations of Feynman-Desky elliptic Schuffle algebras. So, I'm not saying elliptic. So, I'm not saying elliptic here, but in their work, they were all elliptic in nature. And the present discussion is coming to the works of Emeritus. So, let's get to the definition. So, the underlying vector space is now no longer going to be consisting of verts. It's going to be of very different nature. So, you now look at all the rational functions in a family of variables. The number of variables is not fixed, but each variable is colored. But each variable is colored in one of the colors from i. So I have index i, and I have several variables of that color. And what I want, I want those functions to be symmetric in each color. Nonetheless, if I take all such functions, this is too big space, so I will be looking only at very specific ones. So it will be a rational function whose poles are only on diagonals and whose numerator satisfies certain And whose numerator satisfies certain so-called view conditions. So, what does it mean? You take a numerator, and now under certain specialization, so you pick two variables, i not equal to two colors, i not equal to j, and you specialize a few variables of color i and one variable of color j to be all multiples of one variable. So, there is some variable w and all those z i one, z i two, and so on, and z. Vi1, Vi2, and so on, and Vj1, they're all Q powers times this W. And we require that this spectral leaf means zero. So, unless you saw this ever before, this looks a little bit mysterious, but it will be important for the main result. So, if you take that space, this is underlying vector space. What is the algebra structure? So, now if I have two rational functions, I can just combine the variables and multiply the functions and multiply by some. And multiply by some prefactors. So I take f, I take g, and I multiply by some prefactors. But what I get in that line is obviously some rational but not symmetric function. So if I want to get something symmetric, I better symmetrize. And at that point, zeta ij could be quite random rational functions. But to relate it to our quantum groups, I choose the specific choice. Zeta ij is this linear function divided by x minus 1. function divided by x minus 1. And again, this is designed exactly to have an algebra embedding, where the generator EID just goes to the simplest function of one variable, which is Zi1 to the power d. So this gives you, again, dual perspective rather than viewing UQLN plus as a quotient algebra. Now I'm embedding it to a different, completely different type of shuffle algebra, A plus. And let me remind that before we And let me remind that before we had a similar embedding to formal quantum loop shuffle algebra, which was built up from finite length works. And as we will see in a moment, those are connected. So we have this map. What can be said about it? So the theorem which goes to Andre's work almost a decade ago is that it is isomorphism in type A. And actually, Andre proved a much harder result. He proved that it is isomorphism in toroidal type. Isomorphism interoidal type. That's a big upgrade. But at the moment, we are looking just at a fine case. And the question was: is it always isomorphism or not? So some results were known, but it was always case-by-case discussion. So our main results from this work that was posted three years ago on archive, but published only this year, is that this map is always isomerism. And what that basically says is the following. says is the following. You have this embedding and at the moment I could view that you embed positive part of quantum loop group into all rational functions and the image is exactly described by those pole and Gil conditions. And the benefit of this is that if you start from a rational function which has poles as needed and which satisfies Guild conditions, that result means that it does come from some element in quantum group. It may be very complicated. It's expression in terms of generating Its expression in terms of generators EID can be very complicated, but we will know that it does exist. Okay, so let me briefly outsketch what was the main idea to prove this. And the idea was actually to connect the two shuffle algebras. So on one side, you have embedding from the trigonometric Hegel-Desky Shuffle algebra to this formal shuffle algebra, which is constructed as follows. You start from some rational function, and you want... Some rational function, and you want to cook out some linear combination of finite length swords. So you sum up all possible finite length swords, but the corresponding coefficients are certain residues. They're given by the residue of R divided by those data vectors, and the parameters d are coming up here. So it gives you actually an embedding from trigonometric kinetic supplement algebra to this kinetorical supple algebra. And moreover, if I now combine it. Moreover, if we now combine the embedding from positive quantum group to one-surface algebra with that embedding we just constructed, we actually recover the embedding that we saw 20 minutes ago from quantum, from positive part of quantum loop group to this formal shuffle algebra. And that actually. Where is Yota coming from? So, I mean, you have to find the formula is exactly cooked out to allow this. Out to allow this. Oh, okay. So basically, what is the main idea behind? So you have, in quantum group, we have PW basis that we already discussed. But in this trigonometric fitting and this piece of algebra, we don't have a basis. We don't know it yet. And we, so both algebras are infinitely dimensional, infinite dimensional. But the idea behind is that we want somehow to look at certain graded pieces which are finite dimensional, and we want to get Are finite dimensional, and we want to get an upper bound on the graded pieces of A plus. So A plus is a A plus is consisting consists of rational functions. We cannot easily describe such an upper bound. The only tool that was in literature was that specialization map that we will discuss in the last part of today's talk. But that perspective is actually very different. So we are embedding this A plus into quantum Suffolk algebra, which in turn Algebra, which in turn is described purely in kaminotorics of y. And that allows to get an upper bound. So, kind of dimension of graded pieces here is the same as upper bound for dimensions of graded pieces here. And therefore, since both maps are injective, you get that little isomorphism. That's the idea. All right. So, this allows to prove subjectivity. This allows to prove surjectivity. Injectivity is known, was known, but surjectivity was a wild open question. All right, so now let's get to the last part of my talk. So, as I said, the tools which were used before to discuss this map bin isomerthine were very different in nature. And they were used on specialization maps. So, for the last few slides, I will focus on addressing that question from a different perspective. So, let's look back in the look. Look back in the loop realization of quantum loop. So, we have a whole bunch of generators, EIK, Fik, and what people have been doing from the very origin of this topic, they were looking at generating series. So it's kind of insane to work with each generator individually, but from a mathematical physics perspective, you better want to look at those currents, EIX, FIX. And the question is very simple that one should ask a long time ago is Should ask a long time ago: Is can one define those generate those currents for any positive root? So i is corresponding to the root alpha i. Can I define E alpha x, f alpha x? So if I erase x everywhere, this is basically Loustix construction. Can I define root generators E alpha F alpha from greenfield gimbal generators EIF? But now we are looking at affinization. All right, so the literature. So, the literature on that question is not very sufficient. So, there is an old work of Dim Khorovsky, who kind of proposed what those gadgets should look like in AD types, and they didn't define them explicitly in certain completion of algebra. Rather, they were saying how those objects should act on certain representations. So, they were defining it on the suitable category of. Of graded representations which are restricted from above. So we don't have even a good, very good understanding of those objects. So they did show up actually in discussion of quantum toroidal algebras of type A, probably like seven years ago in the work of Seijin Jimbo Miwamuhin. But again, it was very kind of very specific feature of type A. And at the moment, Feature of type A. And at the moment, we want to address that question in full generality. And even if we define those, the two properties that we want to investigate is whether there is Leve-Dorsk-Terbihmann property and how to state it. And even a specific case of that Levendorski-Terbihmann property was this minimal pair property. So in the finite case, it was saying that if alpha and beta are a root, such that alpha plus beta is a root, but there is no other splitting in between, then my root. In between, then my root generator is a Q commutator of the other two. So, can we state something along those lines for those curves? So, those are major two questions we want to understand. So, in the ongoing work with Andre, at the moment, we have the following conjecture, which is supported by computer for all types, actually. I think for all types, and some, at least one ordering all types, the following. So, if I The following. So, if we define those f alpha f beta appropriately, that's something we'll discuss on the next slide, then the analog of this property two should be as follows. f alpha x, f beta y, you take the product one way, you take the product other way, but now you multiply by some rational prefactor. So those are two different products, and the difference is claimed to be the current corresponding to alpha plus beta with the spectral parameter shifted by some. a spectral parameter shifted by some power of q and with certain prefactor and what's even more important some data function so on the level of representation that will actually mean the following if you look at correlation functions of this between two vectors of this product and that product they will be the same rational functions but expanded in two different domains and that rational function is going to have a pole at the ratio x divided by y equal to that power of q y equal to that power of q. And that's where the new current leaves. So this is this kind of viewpoint that underlines this construction, but how much can we do there? And to discuss this, we will actually now provide a different relation to the same question from the Suffolk algebra description. So historically, people first in type A or some other types, people first constructed specifically those currents. Spitze those currents more or less or constructed dual to those and then established isomorphism. But now that we have isomorphism with shuttle algebra, we can reverse the argument. So let's reverse the argument as follows. So we have shuttle algebra, which we know to be isomorphic to UQLN plus, and we know that there is a non-degenerate pairing on UQLN plus and UQLN minus. So that means that we have a non-degenerate pairing between trigonometric Fegina-Desky-Shuffle algebra and negative... And negative part of the quantum affine group. And this pairing is basically coming to the recovering the whole quantum group from those two halves. And now, because of this pairing, we can really take the dual perspective. So if I have some current in x, whose coefficients are either elements of this negative sub-algebra or actually some elements incompletion of it, then I can look at the pairing those current. At the pairing, those currents define. So it gives me some linear map from trigonometric Fagina-desky software algebra just to run to series in xx inverse. And what it does, the way we define it, we just pair any rational function with my current f alpha x. And backwards. If we know those specialization maps, which we'll discuss next, then we can recover back those fuse currents and just define. Those fuse currents are just defining those specialization maps. And historically, those spectralization maps were discussed in the relation of quantum groups and also in the relation to integral forms, such as RTT form or Louisian form, in affine type, first in affine A type by Andre, in super N2 parameter A type by myself, in super type of exceptional C. Type of exceptional series G21 SETA by Fagin and Hu, and in classical B series and G2 series by Hu and myself. So, but those were very kind of case by case, very combinatorical, tedious computations. And it's not kind of doable in all full generality for all simple algebras for all possible orders. So, at the moment, we do have description of what they should be in all types and for at least one. In all types, and for at least one specific order, in any type, but we don't have a full machinery to prove this. So, for the last slide, I will discuss when we can prove it at the moment. And this is the recent work with Andre. So, it's about simply lace types. It is about the case when convex order is not arbitrary, but it refines a very combinatorical pre-order. And we will recall it now. So, we start from a simplest AG type. start from a simplest AD type Li-algebra gene. So we take Dinkin diagram and we choose any orientation. So Q is going to be orientation of Dinkin diagram of G. And with this data, I will now look at the following pairing. So given two vectors parameterized by I, we look at the product of corresponding coordinates term-wise, and we subtract the product where the sum is over all oriented edges. So this definition does depend on the choice of orientation. Does depend on the choice of orientation. And now the pre-order that we want to refine is constructed as follows. So, first, we look at all positive roots, delta plus, and we look at the following, and we draw the edges. So, we construct a graph whose vertices are delta plus, an arrow from alpha to beta is drawn if the roots are different, the pairing that we just defined is positive, and any root that pairs positively with alpha on the left or with beta on the right. alpha on the left or with beta on the right is alpha beta. So this is this defines you a graph on the finite set of delta plus. Now if you transitively complete this, so if you look, if you declare that alpha less than beta, if you can go by oriented paths, that will give you some pre-order. And this is commonly called Auslander right-hand partial order. That is transitive closure of relation where you just go by an edge. Go by an H. And now, all convex orders we will be looking at at the moment, they are refinements of those partial order. All right, so a technical lemma, which is kind of cute in the present setup, is that if alpha is less than beta, is a minimal pair, and alpha plus beta is a positive root, then it turns out that the pair in alpha beta and beta alpha must be the same, whatever minimal pair is. It is minus one for alpha beta. minus one for alpha beta and it is zero for opposite order and actually the proof is very kind of different in nature from what we saw so it does really use a categorification viewpoint where quantum positive part of quantum group of finite quantum group comes up as whole algebra and data plus comes up as indecomposable representations of quantum sorry indecomposable representations of the quiva all right and now we are ready to state And now we are ready to state to describe what specialization maps will be in the present setup. And actually one can define them not for not just for rules, but for any vector. So if I have a vector parameterized by i, what I will be doing is the following. We take a rational function of z degree, so it will have vi variables of color i, and it will just specialize those variables to the same, to exactly the same power of one variable. one variable and what those the the way the powers of q are defined is the following way so to each vertex we define an integer and the rule is that if two vertices are connected by an h then the difference of values is one so this definition is kind of unique up to simultaneous shift so we specialize all variables to the multiple q multiples of the same x and there is some prefactor which we know but it's not essential for today's talk so not essential for today's talk. So those specializations are exactly satisfying all needed properties. And when I say this, here is the main result, which confirms the conjecture from the previous two slides. And what it says is for, take those specialization maps, define fused currents as exactly dual to them. So f, alpha, x are dual, are now fused currents coming from those spectralization maps. And now the claim is that they do satisfy. is that they do satisfy the desired property. The product one way minus product other way multiplied by some rational factor is a delta function. There is no coefficient here actually. Delta function x divided by y times the fused currents for alpha plus beta. And so basically what that does, this is establishes this conjecture in the specific case for right now when G is of AD type and your convex order is just refinement of Is just a refinement of our slander right in partial order. And I think that's the end. Thank you.
