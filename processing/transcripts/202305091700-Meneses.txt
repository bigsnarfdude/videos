Just made it basically on time to give his talk today. He arrived very late in the night yesterday and he's leaving already like tonight. But thank you for coming anyway, Samilka, and tell us about your work. Thank you. I am very happy to stay here. First of all, let me apologize. My English is not really good. My English is not really good. I drink Mescal and then I'm going to speak fluid, but it doesn't mean that I'm going to speak well. So this work is the multidisciplinary project. We are from several institutions in Mexico, Simbestab, UNAM, Metropolitan University, University of Veracruz and Igalgo. I am also a computer science. I know chemical from the chemical department. So the name of this work is Tower Replacement to Glyphosate as Pesticides Using Data Mining and Artificial Intelligence. Or the alternative title is the Computer Science Fellows Also Cry. So, In Mexico, the use of agrochemicals in agriculture is very common. For example, glyphosate is an herbicide that is widely used. Glyphosite is an herbicide that has been used in 1974 and in 2015 the 2050, the World Health Organization classified IDs as probably human cancer. And of course, there is a publication in Answer with a student from United States, Canada, and Swiss, if I remember well. In February of this year, the Mexican government prohibited its use, and then they are looking for alternative for this herb. For this herbicide. So, there are several studies about the glyphosate, and we know that it's a pointed inhibitor of EPSPS and extends the negative effects on non-target plant. EPSP is an enzyme that is the help to the plants in the In the in-share developer, and the glyphosate poses an environmental risk because the residuals. There are several agrochemicals that are using, and we can classify, well, we can make a classification according to the chemical group. We have an insecticid, fungi seed, and herbicide. Herbicide. And there are several groups of molecules or corporates that they are working on insects, on pungus, on plants. And in this case, the green color, there are groups that we are also studying. And in yellow, we are starting to analyze the properties. The properties. So the residual from agrochemicals can interact well with the human body from the food chain. And to evaluate the toxicity, chemical compose, we are selecting the molecules that they have based on the little dose at the 50% with the percent with the but kill the the individual and in this case so this is why I am saying that this is the computer science fellows is crying and this is because we We also follow a methodology to try to work with another group. And in this case, we can use the KDD or CRISP-DA methodologies for data mining. And well, KDD, well, this has several steps, starting with data, with selection of data. We are selection. Data this we are selecting the subgroup of data that we are working on, and then we are analysis this data, and we have the pre-processing, and we build the tables to perform the data mining algorithms and so on. But for cases, the CRIS methodology is working very well. methodology is working very well this is work better than kdd methodology and this is um for example we're starting with the team id databases selecting the components that we are going to analyze and then okay we like the business understanding we are studying the um interaction Interaction between the toxic decompose and the humans. But we like to understand this interaction at level, the chemical level. So then if we use only this Chem ID data base, well, we can data preparation, modeling, and evaluation, and And the evaluation, and there is not just a full that all that we need. So we need to add some indicators from Dragon program and programs that they are used, the density functional theory. And with these indicators, we can add physical, chemicals, structural, and quantum indicators. Quantum indicators to this database. So taking this, we can have a lot of data mining techniques and we need to select what is the technique is better for us or what we are using. And then, of course, we are using regression prediction. We are using, well, quite using association rules and Using association rules and, of course, authors to the initial analysis of data. So, for example, let me show the result that we have with the carbamates group. And then we have the analysis of the chemical reactivity of carbamates from local and global DFT spectrum. This is the main thing in this work. We are using the functionality, the exchange correlation, to get this descriptor. And we add a model, QSTR, to describe the relationship between molecular descriptor and toxic. For this, we are using the docking process. process for the for a toxic molecule with a enzyme in the the well well the human is the enzyme um okay yeah we have made testing this with docking from as it till well this is the name this is why they This is the name. This is why the I mean the we are crying because to me it's impossible saying this kind of name. If you can, it's okay, very well. But we are using this docking with this enzyme. This enzyme is in the blood, red blood cells, and this is helping. And this is helping for several processes in the human body. And in this case, we are getting the two indicators, the OMO and LUMO. And the OMO is the highest occupied molecular orbital, and LUMO is the lowest occupied molecular orbital. This is the, for example, if we have the energy. Have the energy. The OMO is the highest that electrons are occupied, and LUMO is the level there are free customer to get new electrons. So why this is important? Because if we are going to study the docking, when we another is the Another is the molecule. With this, with OMO, we can get a link with another molecule. And in this case, we are getting electrons to another molecule. And in the lumen, it is going to receive electrons from the another compound. Compounds. So in this case, we can notice that there is the part of the molecule that we are going to interaction with another components. So if we, well, first, we analyze a lot of toxical compounds, well, carbamates, and then Carbamates and then we pound the homo and lumo we detect in the in the molecule. And for example, we can hear the structure and we can hear and notice the homo and lumo here. And for example, here, the homo and lumo in this region. Here are in this region, here are in this region. Here are in this low region, and so on. And we can notice that the homo and lumo are in the aromatic rings. See, this is the part of the where is the this effect is we can found. So the home orbitals is mainly located in the aromatic ring with the small contribution toward the adjacent oxygen and nitrogen atom. Oxygen and nitrogen atom of the carbonyl group. When the carbon metal exit they have in an aromatic ring, the OMO was mainly located in the oxygen, the adjacent atom in the carbonyl group of the carbon meth moiety. And the LUMO orbitals are mainly located on the conjugate carbon atoms on the carbon atoms on the carbon method. These sites are labeled to allow the nucleophilic. Label to allow the nucleophilic attack on the H and C. When we are saying nucleotides attack, we are talking about that we are receiving electron from another molecule. When we are attacking, we are still here. If we have lumens, we are going to get electrons, we are received attack. If we are having Receive the attack. If we are half human, we are in the possibility to attack to another model, to attack another molecule. So, well, to complete this, we are trying to get or to predict the toxicity level and. We use several indicators. So this is electroaffinity, and this is the and this is the global indicator, local indicator. This global indicator is associated to LUMO, LUMO indicator. And another is from structure indicator. Indicator and this is from Dragon and the original database. So we can get the model to predict the toxicity with 10 descriptors. And we meet this model using the genetic algorithms. So in these cases, the genetic algorithm, the L square is L square is this value, and we can show well we can see the correlation between all the indicators, well, that they are in the model. And well, we can see a few correlation, well, small correlations. So the model The model, what we can is the training is in the white dots. And the test is in the violet dots. And we can notice that more or less is the good. And to predict the charge, and this is charge. This log one and C is associated to level of toxic. To level of toxicity. So, okay. The interesting thing is to the docking, if we have the same H and we have the carbamate, we can able to localize the site where we have the interaction between this compose, toxic compose, and this. This engine. So, okay. In conclusion, the general STR model predicts the toxicity of carbamate composed contained in the scriptor from 2 from DFT and 8 from Dragon and GMD. And this said that DFT parameters play an important role to determine the toxicity. And we take several models for correlation, for example, right and lasso, and they get best results, but we have more description. LASO is have a 12 description and right is the found 14. And we have tested other methods like XBPost and SBR method. They have a good score, but they are a black hasty. But they are a black ST, black box ST consummate. Sorry, it's a black box model. And this is not help us to understand really that it's happening in the process. So what we like to do is extend the USTR model to another chemical groups we are working on. And the another thing is to apply the a priori algorithm. The a priori algorithm to approach to get a causality vertical. So we can get a or we can like to know which are the causality correlations between this attribute that we are using. In this sense, we are notice that this is a problem. That this approach is similar to use using the clustering clustering, because in the clustering, we have a cluster with records and the attributes, and we get set of a subset of data that they have, for example, attributes that they are in some range. So, and they have they can get They can get more the causality relationship. I mean, if several indicators have in the sum range, then it's going to happen some reaction. So this is all. I was very quickly. Sorry, this is that's all for and what is PDF. So, but that's all worked. So that's about Thanks for putting hours of work into a half an hour, but I don't is there a need to when you find your favorite compounds? You find your favorite compounds, diversify them or engineer them more? Or are you just trying to keep the analysis to known compounds? So do you also want to diversify the chemicals you find? Okay. Okay. For the compounds, we are working first from this database, ChemID. Chem ID. Okay. So, and then we select them. They compose that are complete in several attributes. I mean, you know, not always attributes, they are fields, and then you can lost a lot of record. And then, so we complement with another. Would complement with another programs to fill the other indicators that we like. Anyone else? Oh, sorry? Inamine real with an um inamine. In the minimum. In the middle. I think you're not. Ukrainian? Ukrainian? Is it Ukrainian? No. The UK or in Ukrainian? Okay, I think it's yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Easy welcome. See, yes. Oh, so we have no more questions, then thank you very much, Amirka. Okay, so I think we are done with the pro.
