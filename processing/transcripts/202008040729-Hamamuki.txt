I'm now Haman Mukiknom of Gaider University. First of all, I'd like to thank the organizers for kind invitation to this workshop. My talk is concerned with Lebel September Minkowski equations with discontinuity and the large-time behavior of Piscotti solutions. This is a joint work with my student, Kunya Smith, from Hokkaid University. So this research is motivated by a crystal growth problem called two-dimensional nucleation. This crystal growth is started by external supply of crystal molecules. We now suppose that crystal molecules are supplied at a uniform speed in this region omega. Such a region omega is often called step source. And we further And we further assume that once crystal molecules are supplied, it grows in the horizontal direction by some law. So by this horizontal growth and batch guard growth, due to the effect of steps, the crystal surface evolves like this. So we are interested in this evolution. So by the way, this model is So by the way, this model is also called bus and split. Bus means vertical glows and split means horizontal gloss. This is a picture of the two-dimensional nucleation growth on ice crystal. In this picture, we are looking at the crystal surface flow above, like this. And time develops in this order A, B, C, D. In this picture. In this picture, each circle represents a boundary of an island, which is slightly higher than the crystal surface around it. And we can see that each island spread as time develops. And moreover, there are step sources here and here. So because new islands appear from this point. The new islands appear from this point. And once new islands appear, they split in the horizontal direction. So, in this way, crystal evolves both in the vertical direction and horizontal direction. So, let me briefly explain how to derive the equation describing this phenomena. Let u of xt be the height function of a crystal surface. We now divide We now divide the Gross law into the vertical direction and horizontal direction. In the vertical direction, the Gross speed denoted by VB is equal to C in omega. Here, C is a supplying rate, which is a real constant, and zero elsewhere. On the other hand, in the horizontal direction, we assume that the speed is given by the That the speed is given by the sum of the curvature and some Lield constant. This constant is often called driving force. And this is a rather standard assumption in crystal gloss. By using the height function u, these evolution equations are written in this way. So combine these two equations, adding the time derivatives of these two equations. Derivatives of these two equations, we are led to this equation. So, this is a level set meaning Kaverja equation with driving force term and source term. Here, one Laplacian denotes this usual level set meaning Kaba-Jaflo operator. So, this is our equation, and we want to solve this equation with this initial data. Here, throughout this talk, I assume that you. This talk, I assume that U0 is bounded and uniformly continuous. So, this is our problem. So, but due to the discontinuity of the source term, viscosity solutions of these problems are not unique. So, this is a main difficulty of this problem. So, we have to overcome this uniqueness issue in some suitable way. Issue in some suitable way. When the source term is discontinuous, the problem is not trivial even for first order equations. Let us develop the curvature term. So then the equation becomes this first order Hamilton-Jacobi equation. For this equation, in my previous work with Professor Giga, we introduced a new notion of Viscosity solutions. Notion of viscosity solutions called envelope solutions. We proved that there is a unique envelope solution of this problem. Usual viscosity solutions are not unique, but the envelope solution is unique. And yes, in fact, this result holds for a more general Hamilton-Jacob equation of this form, when the Hamiltonian H is classical. And also, the large And also, the large-scale behavior is also studied in my previous work. So, this is a result for the first-order equation. So, let us come back to this second-order equation. Hereafter, we assume that C appears here, is a positive constant, and omega is the bounded and open set. Unfortunately, the method for the first order equation doesn't work. Equation doesn't work. In fact, in this paper, we needed some derivative estimates for approximate continuous problem. So for the second order case, we cannot expect such a derivative estimate. And I also mentioned that when the driving force is positive, then this equation is well studied by This equation is well studied by Giga Mitaketora and Otska. They study the asymptotic speed of the much more viscosity solution. Here, asymptotic speed means this limit. So today we consider the opposite case. We assume that the driving force is negative in what follows. So in this case, we can establish uniqueness in some weak sense. Some weak sense. So I will show it so. And then we discuss the asymptotic behavior, asymptotic shape of the solution. So this is our goal of this talk. So let us discuss the uniqueness. What we want to prove is this weak comparison principle. This is a property stated as follows. Let U be upper semi-containing species sub-solution. Semi-containing specific sub-solution and B be a lower semi-continuous super solution. If the sub-solution is less than or equal to the super solution at the initial time, so then these inequalities hold. Here, the lower star and the upper star represents the semi-continuous envelopes defined as the Limo info or Limo sub of the original function. Yes, in the U. Yes, in the usual comparison principle, we do not need to take these stars. So, this conclusion is weaker than the usual comparison principle. In this sense, I call this weak comparison. If this weak comparison principle holds, then one can show that semi-continuous viscosity solutions are unique. Viscosity solutions are not necessarily unique, but semi-continuous one is unique. So, this is a uniqueness. So, this is a uniqueness under weak comparison. And the statement of weak comparison is as follows. We need some geometrical assumption on omega. Let us assume that omega is star-shaped with respect to the origin. Namely, we assume that if we multiply omega by some constant lambda less than one, then its closure is included. Then its closure is included in the original omega. We further assume that both the sub-solution and the supersolution are zero at space infinity, like this figure. But then we compile the whole. Today, I don't mention the detail of the proof of this theorem, but a crucial idea is to change the scale of one of the solutions. The scaling is given. The scaling is given by this. This descaling matches our star-shapedness assumption. So this is a rough idea of the proof of comparison. So anyway, this is our uniqueness result. So let us turn to that asymptotic behavior, asymptotic shape. So first, under First, under some simplified situation, let us study what the expected solution is. Assume that the initial data is zero, and Manova assumes that omega is smooth, and the curvature of the boundary is strictly less than the absolute value of nu, which is now equal to minus nu, since nu is negative. So, if this holds, then as a whole. Then, the horizontal growth speed, which is given by the sum of kauvajar and nu, becomes zero. So, because it's hot. This suggests that the solution shrinks. So now on the set omega, a crystal molecules are supplied. And since the horizontal glow speed is negative, it shrinks along the boundary. So after Boundary. So after some time, the graph of the solution will be like this. And if this supply and shrinkings are repeated, the solution would behave like this. Finally, we expect that the solution becomes stable by the balance of vertical glow speed and horizontal glow speed. So this is a very very So, this is a very naive expectation, but we can prove that this is in fact true. So, let us consider the elliptic problem corresponding to our parabolic equation. We consider this elliptic problem in omega. In omega, our source term becomes C. So, the equation no longer has the discontinuity. So, this is a continuous equation. And on the boundary of omega, we impose this. Boundary of omega, we impose this zero-diction boundary condition. We impose this because we expect that the value of u would be zero on the boundary. So this is uniquely solvable. So if this is satisfied, this is a curvature condition in the previous slide, so then there is a unique continuous viscosity solution. A uniqueness follows from the comparison, usual comparison. The comparison, usual comparison principle. In the proof, we modify the crash card technique introduced by Professor Ishii for fast-order iron equation. For existence, we use this curvature conditions. More precisely, we use this to construct a barrier function, which is needed to carry out the Paydon's method for this Caucasian solution. Here, I'd like to remark that we can relax this cover char condition. In fact, this condition can be relaxed to this blue one. So, today, you don't need to see this condition. Instead, I'd like to give some sufficient condition of this. The first sufficient condition is equusteria-sophia condition. Condition. Here we assume that the radius of the exterior board is strictly less than 1 over r minus nu. So this corresponds to this curvature condition. But this is weaker than this one because this allows non-smoothness of omega. The second one is more general, which is the exterior parabola condition. We assume that at every point on the boundary of omega, Of omega, this parabola touches. Here, the radius of this board touching the parabola at the top is assumed to be equal to one over minus nu, the absolute value of nu. So, this condition allows the critical cover jar case. So, namely, if omega is smooth, the cover jar of the cover. Carver jar on the boundary can be equal to minus nu. So, which was excluded in the previous conditions. So, we have this sufficient condition. But in this talk, to simplify my presentation, I use this condition. So, this is a CLM on asymptotic shape. Assume that domain is star-shaped, and this condition holds. We furthermore assume that the initial. We furthermore assume that the initial data, the support of the initial data is included in omega and it is non-negative. So it is not necessarily zero. So then there is some time t0 such that any viscosity solution satisfy this when time t is greater than t0. So here capital U is a viscosity solution of our elliptic problem in omega. Outside omega we define Outside omega, we define it as zero. So Viscosity solution becomes stable in a finite time. And in the proof of this theorem, we construct a suitable sub-solution and a super solution and apply a weak comparison result to conclude this one. By the way, this theorem in particular implies that the asymptotic speed of any Biscosy solution is there. There. So this is a result on the symptotic behavior shape. So far, we have studied a bounded star-shaped omega. So if omega is not bounded, we have one interesting example. So in the last my talk, let me show the example. Let Umena be the complement of these two touches. Complement of these two touching boards. Here, the radius of each board is one over minus nu. So, this is a critical curvature case. So, in this case, the curvature and driving force are balanced. So, the horizontal growth speed is zero. This suggests that the solution grows only in the vertical direction. So, namely, So, namely, if the initial data is zero, a function u, which is ct in omega, and zero or elsewhere looks a solution. And in fact, this is a Piscosi solution. We can prove this by direct calculation. So, this is a natural solution of this problem. So, however, interestingly, there is another solution. In the paper, Solution. In the paper by Gigamitake-Tolan, they proved that the minimal solutions satisfied this. The asymptotic speed is strictly less than C. The asymptotic speed of this natural solution U is C, is equal to C in omega. So this result implies that there is another solution which is less than this natural solution C, solution U. Solution U. In our work, we improved this estimate. We proved that asymptotic speed is zero. We proved this theorem by considering a game-theoretic interpretation to our equation, which was originally introduced by Kong and Silfati. In this game interpretation, approximate solution u epsilon XT, here epsilon. u epsilon xt here epsilon is a positive parameter is defined by this so this is a value of this game so now today i i don't mention the precise load of this game but roughly speaking it is as follows this game starts from x x this one and there are in this game there are two players player one and player two and they change in the They change the game position following some loads. And the number of game steps is capital N, which is given by this T and epsilon. And player 1 aims to minimize the total cost, while player 2 aims to maximize it. Here, the cost of this game is defined as the sum of terminal cost and learning cost. The terminal cost is a value of The terminal cost is a value of the initial datum at the final position of this game, while the learning cost is a sum of the value of the source time at every game position. And it is known that this solution combines, this one combines the solution to our problem. So to prove this theorem, we gave an estimate of this u epsilon. This U epsilon. If this is sufficiently small, we can deduce this one. The point is that we can make the learning cost small. Here, note that this one is zero outside omega. So what we proved uh is that from any starting point omega, there is a game strategy such that the game position can exit omega. Position can exit omega, can enter the complement of omega and stay in this region. So if this is achieved, then the learning cost doesn't increase. So then we can conclude this one. So anyway, so we can conclude this. So we use a game-theoretic interpretation and game-theoretic formula to study this asymptotic shape. Yes, so this is a different asymptotic. Yes, so this is a definitive list, and this is the end of my talk. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, very much for this all. Are there questions or comments by the participants? Now we have time, normal five minutes time. Normal five minutes time. So I have a question about please. Please, Iroshi. Fu is asking, actually. So I have a question. Do you, Iroshi, yes. So you are game theoretical approach. You say that the idea is based on a work of Khan Serfati. Of corn selfati. Is it you just borrowed a rough idea, or is it very, very similar to what I did? In fact, in the paper by Constellufati, the equation doesn't have the source term. So, but in slight modification, we can prove that even if the equation has a source term, the body function, if we define the body function in this way, function in this way the convergence is still too so so this you mean source term you by by which by that you mean the running cost and there is an epsilon squared term in front of the running cost and so you let epsilon tend to zero at the end yes so so this is the right So, this is the right scaling for scaling. So, because the number of game steps tends to infinity when epsilon goes to zero. So, of course, this goes to zero, but this part in general goes to can go to infinity. So, you borrowed their. You borrowed their idea, but the techniques are different. Okay. Yes. Okay. So I have a question about this envelope solutions that you and so you don't use it. So you don't use them when you add the mean curvature term. So they are not meaningful in this case or what are they if you can give a rough idea of why you use it in the first order case and not in the other. So in the proof, the problem is comparison principle. So in the proof of comparison principle for envelope solution, we used Lippest continuity of Continuity of solutions. So appreciably, we have to know such regularity for solutions. But I think second order case, we cannot expect such regularity. And in fact, we have to know, we also need second-order estimate or solution in the second order case to. The case to put the comparison principle. So I think it seems to be difficult to carry out the same curve for second order equation. Thank you. Are there other questions or comments? So, if not, let's turn to the speaker again. Thank you. And we resume in five minutes.
