this workshop. So I I will talk about a bunch of examples that link this data to modeling approaches. And why I wanted to do like this strange talk is because when I started doing modeling for behavioral data, I quickly understand the fact that statisticians That statisticians are needed when the data is collected. So that brings some perspective on understanding the limitation of the data and understanding also what we are collecting, what we are measuring in the same way that the other scientists are doing the work. And it's also important when we are doing the modeling so that usually we just take the Usually, we just take the estimates, so those estimates we just based on some literature review. So, we don't know all the history behind all those parameters. So, it's really important that we do all the cycle in an interdisciplinary way. So, I started my behavior modeling work and And I'm a statistician, so like I'm not a mad person, or maybe I'm in the grey zone of math. But yeah, mad people don't think or start as mad. So, my first example when I started working with behavior. Working with behavioral modeling is I started doing some work just before being faculty at the University of Montreal in adaptation measures for flaw in Quebec. So like the organization that invited me in this work collected some data about what makes people adhere to adaptation measures for flow. Measures for floods. And they collected some bunch of information through service. And it was a very well done protocol and very robust survey that collected data about socio-economic factors, sense of belonging to a local community. So we have like a flaw. So what impacts the fact that I don't want my house to Don't want my house to be flooded, or I don't want to be impacted by the flood. It's the fact that I maybe want to keep my house that is the first answer. So if we have a sense of belonging to the community, so we have also the sense that, okay, I might do something that helped me with the adaptation. So also the fact that maybe I'm not. Maybe I'm not that rich, so I want also my house to not be impacted, so that can not impact other financial consequences on me and my family. And also, we can think about the fact that if we think that the flood will have like a severe impact on health, that also will. On health, that also will push us to adapt to adaptation measures for flood. And so what we did in collaboration with Pierre Valvo, who is at the University of Lava, and he is a social scientist. So we had a survey that all over Kube. All over Kybe, and we serve with people that are in flood zone. So, like, we have those parts of flood zones. So, we serve with people that are in the flood zone or are in the periphery of the flood zone. And if you know a little bit about flooding, so like the flood part can move every year or every six months, so it's not like very accurate. Very accurate estimates, so that can move and change a lot because, like, an area who had a flood can impact also the prediction of the flooding for the periphery areas. So, and then we have like adaptation measures. So, we have like a list of preventive behaviors. Of preventive behaviors that are composed of six non-structured behaviors, so which are related to knowledge and practice and attitude surveys, like if you used to do this kind of surveys, it can also be done in infectious disease, which are: do you know about the disease? Do you have some irritation? like do you have like some education and and so so it it is like a well established way to do to to survey the the knowledge and practice and attitude and we have some question about the structural behavior so are are people willing to modify the conception of their home or anything in their home so that's improved maybe if If we have a flaw, we improve the coin sequences on the house. And we use some statistical approach so that we can detect what is the potential predictors that lead to adaptation. So, this was like one of the questions, but another question. The question, but another question was: based on socio-economic factors, what are the best profiles for adaptation? So, if maybe I'm very attached to my house because I have been living in this community for 20 years, so I am taking the same profile to adaptation like someone who just buy a house like six months ago, or if I am not that. Or, if I am not that rich, so what is the profile that I will take for the adaptation? If I am very rich, do I care really about flooding or something like that? So, we had like a couple of profiles of adaptation depending on other factors. So, what we found, like I'm summarizing a little bit, Inhibit our results. We found that flooding experience and perceived risk and belief of living in flood-prone area are the best predictor to adaptation. So people tend to adapt if they have a flooding experience, which is like a very also well-known concept in literature. It's also had like animals. It also has like anniversary concepts. So, like, people who get flooded sometimes they tend to even hear like the precipitation, like we have like rain, and they tend to be traumatized by that because they feel like they will get frauded again. So, if we have like some experience, we tend also to have some knowledge about the fraud. About the flow. So we tend also to modify some specific things on how to manage the flow so that we adapt more. So the perceived risk was also one of the predictors and it is also one of the predictors that we can saw in other surveys, in infectious disease. We always get like this kind of. We always get like this kind of predictors for adaptation, and the belief of living in the broad front area also was one of the predictors. But in the survey, we had like a very low percentage of people who knows that they are living in a flood from an area, which was very surprising. So, there are also like some lessons from that. lesson from that that the public health or even the government needs like to put like some intervention to instruct people that you know you are in a flood from area you need to do this and that so this is what one of the the key elements and recommendation to government to do is like it's not only the citizen but maybe there are something some knowledge Some knowledge translation that needs to be shared with the public. I still have time. So I'm jumping to another topic. So we do the same thing with the adaptation for public health measures and I'm talking about a survey that was run by the Peat Institute. By the Fifth Institute and by leading by Kumar Martin, and it was about the information, so how the information impacts future adherence to restrictive measures after COVID-19. So they surveyed the people from 11 countries using online surveys. Using online survey platform. And then we got this data, and I have like a small graph that shows the future compliance and the primary COVID info source and the personal compliance during the COVID. So we want to know our future compliance, how it will be impacted by the sources of information that we Information that we are taking from our information. So we have like a couple of other variables that impact these relationships, which is like the future compliance with the primary code data info source. And some of those variables are related to the community compliance, if we trust doctors and the political. Doctors and the political communication, and the education, and other socio-economic factors, and also where we are living. Are we living in rehabilitation or which area we are living in? So we had like some some descriptive statistics that follow. Statistics that follow from this relationship, but we are still analyzing the data because we got the data like a couple of months ago. So we had like seventy three percent of the people that we surveyed followed all or most guidelines, which is a lot. Guidelines, which is a lot. So, it's like a self-reporting compliance, like people say if they adhere or not to the public health measures. So, 71% they think they will do the same in the future. And for the primary COVID information sources, so we have like twenty-five percent Like 25% that they were using a sure information source, which means like scientific papers, WHO, and so. And the other people was like using medium or low information sources, which means like radio, podcast, social media, and so on. So, what we found in some preliminary results, like the team of Kumar, found that people who use medium and low information sources tend to have a different compliance, like it divides. like it it divides from people who it divides from people who are using other other type of of the media sources. 45 seconds. Okay. Okay. So then I have like a term uh element where we can get Element where we can get other data to adherence from the public health measures is social media. So, social media tend to be a rich source about adherence and compliance to public health measures. So, what we do is we scrape all the data from social media and do text mining, and then you can gather information. And then you can gather information from that around if people are happy, not happy, if they are willing to take vaccine, not willing to take vaccine. But this comes with the fact that we need other data, not just like analyzing text to understand their behavior, we need also to analyze if people who are using those social media have certain characteristics which Characteristic, which we did after by survey, so to understand the differences between people who use social media and the non-users of social media, so that we understand if those estimates are accurate or not. We also did a survey that understanded the profile of people who were talking about COVID in social media. In social media, if this is different from the people who are not using social media. So it tends that there are a difference between those two profiles. So also taking those estimates and modeling will impact the fact that it's maybe biased by the people who are talking in social media, which can be different from using social media for surveillance, for example. Or surveillance, for example, potential cases or early warning system. So it needs some deeper thinking when we are using it for behavior. So this is all. Thank you.
