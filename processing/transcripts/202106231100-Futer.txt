Pleasure to be here and a little bit of a bummer that we couldn't all actually physically be there in Oaxaca. I've been to Oaxaca exactly once in my life, but not for math. It was approximately 20 years ago as a tourist, and I loved it. I got to see Adia de los Muertos and participate in the celebration, and it was a wonderful visit. And maybe one day soon, you know. You know, maybe one day soon, you know, we'll all gather there for math as well. Um, everything that I'm speaking about today is joint work with Salsch Leimer and Jessica Bursel. We're both at this workshop, at least in some fashion, although time zones might prevent them from being here right now. I think it's still the middle of the night in Australia where Jessica is, but we'll see her later today. So, this is joint work with them. And as you'll see in the Work with them. And as you'll see in a moment, it's about a topology problem involving knots on three manifolds, not so much surfaces. And this topology problem can be approached from all sorts of different directions. And that's part of the fun of it for me is that all, you know, bringing all the different points of view together. So let me set up the problem. I guess throughout the talk, M is going to be a compact-oriented three-manifold with torus boundary. If you like, Taurus boundary. If you like, it's a not complement in the three-sphere. That's a common context, but that doesn't have to be the only context. We're going to be doing Dane surgery or Dane filling on this manifold. So we're going to pick a slope. We're going to pick an isotopic class of simple closed curve on the boundary torus. And we're going to fill along it. So that means that we're going to glue a solid torus to that slope. So here's a So here's an example. And maybe the most basic example is if you start with a solid torus, which is the complement of the unknot in the three-sphere, and you look at the slope S exactly as drawn, that's a slope that goes three times around the meridian and once around the longitude. And you do 3-1 filling on it, then you're going to get a lens space. You get the lens space L31. If you pick a If you pick a slightly different slope, in this example, I want to consider slope 3, 4, well, then, you know, following the same breadcrumbs, you get the lens space L3, 4, but that turns out to be homeomorphic. In fact, orientation preservingly homeomorphic to L3, 1, because the second coordinate only matters modulo the first coordinate. So they're actually two different Dane fillings that give you or. Dane fillings that give you orientation preservingly homeomorphic three-manifolds. That is exactly what we call cosmetic surgery, where you do two different Dane fillings along different slopes, but you end up with the same three-manifold and in fact the same oriented three-manifold. And a provocative conjecture posed by Cameron Gordon in his ICM talk in 1990 is that this shouldn't happen except for the one example that you Except for the one example that you see here, that as long as you start with an irreducible three-manifold that's not the complement of the unknown, this should never ever happen. If you do two different Dane fillings, you should get two different three manifolds, at least with orientation. The main subject of Cameron's talk at the ICM that year was the solution with John Lucy of the not complement problem, and the not complement problem can be referred. And the not complement problem can be rephrased as saying that you can't possibly have cosmetic surgeries yielding the three sphere. So the cosmetic surgery conjecture, you can think of it as the not complement problem in other three manifolds. So you shouldn't be able to do two different Dane fillings and get the same manifold out. And if you did get that, then you would, then in that manifold, you would have two distinct knots, namely the two distinct cores of the Dane filling that. Of the Dane filling that would have the same complement. So these are two equivalent ways of phrasing the conjecture. I'm being slightly sloppy about the non-solid torus hypothesis in the equivalent reformulation. But I think even in length spaces, you're okay. So it turns out that ever since he posed that conjecture, it's been studied by a lot. Studied by a lot of different invariants of both knots and three manifolds. In fact, part of the fun is watching your favorite knot invariant come up as one of the obstructions to cosmetic surgery. One of the first results in that vein was a result by Steve Boyer and Daniel Lines right around the same time. And they observed that the Cassan invariant, which can be characterized as the second derivative of the Alexander polynomial, Alexander polynomial evaluated at the number one gives you an obstruction to cosmetic surgery. So if you start with a not complement in the three-sphere and you do two different Dane fillings, they give you the same three manifold out, well, then the second derivative of the Alexander polynomial had better be zero. And this invariant by itself obstructs something like 90% of knots that you throw at it. Much more recent. Um, much more recently, this century, there were a lot of obstructions that were born in Hagar fluorhomology and not fluorhomology. And the work of Wang in 2006 was the first example of that. He noticed that if you have cosmetic surgeries, then the genus of the knot had to be one, or equivalently, sorry, the genus had to be bigger than one. Equivalently, if the genus was one, then Then these surgeries couldn't possibly be cosmetic. Ni and Wu, also using Hagar fluoromology and using tau, which is a certain concordance invariant coming out of Hagar fluorhormology, show that if you have cosmetic surgeries, then the tau invariant has to be zero. I know how to repeat the words. I don't know how to work with these invariants directly, but if you're a geometric topologist, But if you're a geometric topologist, then for instance, think Taurus knots. Taurus knots all have non-zero tau invariants, so that means that they can't have cosmetic surgeries. In the same paper, they proved a result about slopes, that if you have two different slopes giving you the same oriented three manifold out, well, then in the standard meridian longitude framing in the three sphere, the slopes actually had to be negatives of each other. Actually, they had to be negatives of each other as rational numbers. And there's also a number theoretic or modular arithmetic criterion, which is that the numerator has to divide, you know, denominator squared plus one. So right away, that tells you that every slope only has, you know, one other potential evil twin that gives you the same manifold out. But it doesn't tell you that there are only finitely many slopes to consider. That there are only finitely many slopes to consider, so it's not quite enough to check the conjecture by computer. And as you'll see soon, we're about to see some results that are strong enough to actually check the conjecture by computer for any knot that you choose to throw at it. So you do get a result of that form from the much more recent work of Jonathan Hanselman from about two years ago, where the invariant was the thickness. invariant was the thickness of Hagar fluorhomology. And the way to think about thickness is that you could think of Hagar fluorhomology as a bunch of abelian groups arranged on a grid. The grid is Z cross Z. These are the two different gradings in the homology theory. And they're arranged at points. I'm just sort of schematically sketching them. They're arranged at points. Sketching them, they're arranged at points that fit on a small number of diagonals, a finite number of diagonals. And the thickness of that strip of diagonals is the Hagar-Fleur thickness. So if the knot is alternating, it has thickness zero, which means that they're all on one line. So that's a rough idea of what thickness is. You already know what knot genus is. Genus is and then Hanselman proved that if you have two different slopes giving you the same manifold, then you do get a finiteness result for what those slopes are. You either get the slope 2, and that can happen only if the genus is equal to 2 itself, or else the slope is 1 over an integer, and that integer is bounded by a quantity involving the thing. Is bounded by a quantity involving the thickness of the genus. And you can play with that expression a little bit. And you can notice that the top is linear in the genus, but the bottom is quadratic in the genus. So it gets, you know, it goes to zero very, very quickly as the genus increases. So when genus is bigger than two, it obstructs a lot of things. So this was a nice paper that had a lot of downstream corollaries that you'll see. Downstream corollaries that you'll see in a moment. Around the same time, I guess the one type of invariant that's common and well studied that hasn't really come into the story yet is the Jones polynomial, but here it is. Around the same time, Ichihari and Wu proved that if you have two different slopes giving you the same three manifolds, if you have a knot giving you cosmetic surgeries, then the third derivative of the Jones polynomial had to be zero. Zero. And then, in a really, really fantastic result earlier this year, building upon Hanselman's theorem, Renaud de Chavet proved another Jones polynomial obstruction, which is that for any knot with cosmetic surgeries, one of two things had to happen, both of which are good and both of which are very restrictive. Either the Jones polynomial evaluated at the fifth root of unity is one, which is something that happens very, very rarely. Which is something that happens very, very rarely. Or else the slopes, well, you already knew from Hanselman's theorem that the slopes had to come from this type of restricted list, but he restricts it even further and says that the slope does have to be one over an integer. In fact, it has to be one over five times an integer. And if this number Q is at least five, then that gives you further constraints on thickness and genus. So combining that with Hanselman's work. Combining that with Hanselman's work says that the thickness has to be pretty large. It has to be at least 16. And to give you a sense of how large that is, all the enumerated knots have thickness of most two. So basically, for any moderately sized knot that you choose to play with, this never happens, which means that the Jones polynomial evaluated at the fifth root of unity has to be just one. And that's something that happens very rarely. And that's something that happens very rarely. So, when you combine all of these restrictions, all of these obstructions together, they're actually enough to rule out all of the almost 10 million knots up to 17 crossings. So if you like, a computational corollary of all this is that knots up to 17 crossings have no cosmetic surgeries. Some of these invariants are better than. Some of these invariants are better than others. The Casson invariant knocks out about 90%. The Jones polynomial, the third derivative, knocks about 90%. But the results by Hanselman and Deshery are the ones that are doing the bulk of the work there. I think Hanselman will get you down to some number of hundreds of knots all by itself from the 10 million. And this one will get you down to some number of tens of knots all by itself down from 10 million. So they're very, very effective. So, they're very, very effective. So, there's going to be a computational component later in the talk where we check some other finite families. Questions? So far, this is sort of the survey portion of the talk, but we're going to transition to more hyperbolic results and more new results. Please do not hesitate to interrupt me if you have questions. How is it easy to compute the thickness or bound the thickness? Ah, very good question. It is quite easy. So here are two different bounds on the thickness. So, first of all, the thickness is always at most the crossing number over two. Number over two, which tells you right away that big thickness implies really big crossing number. But it's also, so this is more or less immediate from, I guess, how the stuff is set up. But a less immediate result, but also quite strong, is that this is less than or equal to something called the Torayev genus. That's a theorem of Adam Lawrence. And the Turaiv genus, your question, Joav, was how easy? So the Turaiv genus is a certain diagrammatic invariant that is spiritually related to the Jones polynomial. And to compute the Turayev genus of a diagram, all you have to do is look at the two extreme Kaufman states, the all-plus resolution and the all-minus resolution. Resolution and the L-minus resolution. So it's in practice, it's very, very fast to compute. It's much faster than computing the Jones model. And so, in practice, yeah, I mean, in practice, this will often, or almost always, I guess, rule out the thickness greater than or equal to 16. Exactly, exactly. I mean, the easy criterion already rules it out for knots of, you know, at most 31 crossings, but this is a But this is a much stronger bound that in practice will almost always work. The catch, though, to spoil a punchline that's coming later, almost all of these invariants, with the exception of the Alexander polynomial, require having access to a diagram. And if you don't have access to a diagram, but you happen to know that it's a non-complement in the three-sphere, then this doesn't quite work as well. So, yes. So, yeah, so in practice, this all works very well, and it can knock out millions of knots. You could also knock out certain infinite families. So the result by me and Wu about the Tao variant rules out cosmetic surgeries on torus knots. A result by a mathematician named Tao, not Terry Tao or Jing Tao, I think Ron Tao, proved that connected Prove that connected sums of knots and non-trivial cables can't have cosmetic surgeries. This is very close to saying that the only things you have to worry about are hyperbolic knots, but it's not quite 100% there. Also, one corollary of Hanselman's theorem is because alternating knots have thickness zero, for thickness zero, the only possible value of genus you have to care about. You have to care about is genus two. So, if you know that it's alternating, you know the genus is not two, then you can't have cosmetic surgeries. And then since Hansomlin's paper appeared, several other people proved restrictions on various familiar families, two bridge knots, three braids, pretzel knots. All of these results use Hanselman's work. So, those are some interesting. So, those are some infinite families of knots. I want to proceed to talking about hyperbolic invariance because, well, I'm a hyperbolic geometer. But also, one of the interesting things here is that this conjecture is worth studying for manifolds that are not just non-confluence in the three-sphere. So, then you might want to use things that aren't just invariants of non-confluence in the three-sphere. And you might want to do something with the geometry. With the geometry of a manifold with a cusp. So, if you are a hyperbolic geometer, then this is what a manifold with torus boundary looks like, or it has this infinite non-compact end called a cusp, where the compact part is what happens when you chop off that cusp. And you might want to use the geometry of this manifold to say something about this interesting topological problem. In particular, there's a folklore result that I'll tell you about on the next slide. It's basically a combination of Thurston's Dane surgery and Mostaur rigidity that says that if you do really, really long Dane fillings, if you have two different slopes and they're both long in terms of just the length of a geodesic measured on the scuspatorus, then you can't possibly have cosmetic surgeries. So, this is a focus. So, this is a folklore theorem, but one place where it's written down is a survey paper by Bleiler, Hodgson, and Weeks that says that if you take a hyperbolic manifold with a cusp and you pick two different Dane-filling slopes, then you do Dane-filling along those two slopes and you get the same manifold out. Then they actually had to be the same slope. In other words, you can't have cosmetic surgeries. So let's go over the proof of that because it's not. Uh, go over the proof of that because it's not actually very hard, and also because the proof of this theorem motivates what's coming later in the new work. So you do your long Dane surgery, and Thurston's Dane surgery theorem says that you know some things about the resulting manifold. First of all, you know that it's hyperbolic. Second, the core of the Dane surgery solitaurus, so the core curve. So, the core curve of that solitaurus is going to be very short. And in fact, it's the shortest geodesic in the resulting closed three manifold. So here's my schematic for what the closed three manifold will look like. The geometry didn't really change much in the compact part. It changed maybe a little bit, but you deformed it a small amount. And then you attached this very, very deep solid torus. So it's still topologically a solid torus, but geometrically. Solitaurus, but geometrically, it looks something like this: where the core is very, very far away from the boundary, and the core curve is very short. And then there's this really, really thick collar about it. So that's true in the one filling along a long slope. And it's also true. The same thing is also true for the filling S prime that gives you the other slope. So you have two different manifolds. By hypothesis, they're homeomorphic. They're homeomorphic. Most star rigidity says that they're actually isometric. And you know that the unique closed geodesic in one, well, then has to have the same length as the unique closed geodesic in the other. In fact, it has to be the same curve. The homeomorphism has to carry the one curve to the other curve, or at least the isometry homotopic to the homeomorphism has to carry the one curve to the other curve. But that means you can restrict to the complement and restricting to the complement. Complement and restricting to the complement is exactly the self-homeomorphism of the manifold M that you were looking at. And that self-homeomorphism has to send the one slope to the other slope. Okay, at this point, you're almost done, but then you remember that this is an orientation-preserving homeomorphism. You apply Maastow rigidity, or I guess Maastau-Prasad rigidity, to the cusp manifold, and say that the only isometry Geometry that sends the one slope to the other slope. It has to preserve a homological longitude. Even if you're not a knot complement, you have some homological longitude. And that really pins it down to sending the same slope back to the same slope. So, this is maybe a good place to pause for questions because we're going to generalize that argument. I want to ask: is it hard? I want to ask: Is it hard to compute how long sufficiently long for a fixed hyperbolic manifold? Tali, I owe you a beer or a falafel or something because that is an excellent question, and that is exactly what the rest of the talk is about. So your check is in the mail. I couldn't have, you know, if I had planted a question, I couldn't have planted a better one. That's exactly where we're going next, right? So, this result is both satisfying and not. It's satisfying because it's a finiteness theorem, but it's unsatisfying because it's not an effective finiteness theorem. You don't know how long is long enough, right? So, I had a basic question. So, if I just use VanCampen for different SNS prime and calculate the fundamental group of MS after the dain filling, isn't there some simple criteria which you tell me when the fundamental group is still the same for different S and S prime? So, good question. It's not so, I'm not aware of any work. So, I'm not aware of any work in that direction. Part of the issue is that it's very hard to compare group presentations. I hand you two different group presentations of the same non-abelian group. Go ahead and tell me whether they're the same group. That problem is theoretically decidable in the world of hyperbolic groups, but it's not practical. Or at least for three manifolds, the most practical way is go find the three. Practical way is to go find the three-manifold that this is the fundamental group of and solve the isomorphism problem. There is an easier criterion that I left out in that survey on the previous slide, which is instead of the fundamental group, you could use homology. And instead of vancampen, you could use Maya Vietaurus. And there, yes, there is a really easy criterion. The two slopes have to intersect the homological longitude the same number of times. Or equivalently, the Or equivalently, I guess the denominator has to be the same in the usual framing. So the homology does give you an easy criterion, but the fundamental group, not so much. Okay, so good question. All right, let's go ahead and answer Tali's question. How long is long enough to ensure that the core is the shortest geodesic? There's two parts to that. You want to estimate the length of the core and you want to estimate the length of everything else. The length of everything else, you want to make sure that nothing else gets short. So, when it comes to estimating the length of the core, uh-oh, what happened here? There we go. When it comes to estimating the length of the core, turns out that what you need to use as input is the length of the slope that you're filling and not the length in the usual sense. The usual sense is you take a, you know, you take your horospherical. Take your horospherical torus representing the cusp. You take a horospherical cross-section of the cusp, and you take a Euclidean geodesic on it in the isotopic class of that curve, and you measure the length of that geodesic. That's what I'm calling ordinary length. The normalized length takes that and divides it by the square root of the area of the torus. And one way to think about that is it's a scaling invariant quantity. If you increase the If you increase every direction by 2, then the length will get twice as big and the area will get four times as big. So length over the square root of area will cancel out. So then it doesn't matter which cross-section you take. And the classical work of Neumann and Zagye from, gosh, 36 years ago, tells you that the length of the core is approximately equal to one over normalized length squared. 1 over normalized length squared, or 2 pi over normalized length squared. This is the same paper where they have a bunch of results about the volume of hyperbolic 3 manifolds. But they also have results about the length of the core. So this tells you approximately the right quantity. The issue is that you have this error term and the error term, we don't know, or at least at the time, we didn't know how to quantify the, you know. To quantify the big O, how to quantify the implicit constant in the error term. So we've gone from an ineffective result to a sort of effective asymptotic, but that's still not yet a result that you can program into a computer. So now let's answer Tali's question for real. Thank you again, Tali, for asking such an excellent question. Here are actual hard estimates. And this most And this mostly comes out of the work of Hotchin and Kirchhoff around the turn of the century. And then this was formalized and developed a bit further by Aaron Maggott. And then in our work, we bring it into this form, which is a lot easier to use than what was previously known, that if your normalized length is not too tiny, if it's, let's say, bigger than 10, well, then the manifold you get is hyperbolic. That's really Hotchin and Kirchhoff. And you do have a two. And you do have a two-sided estimate on the length of the core. Yes, it's approximately 2π over normalized length squared, but in fact, instead of being an asymptotic, this is an actual hard two-sided estimate. So you know that the length of the core is pretty short. And you also know that nothing else is too, too short, or in order to know that nothing else is too, too short, you sort of have to know as in. You sort of have to know as input the system, the length of the shortest geodesic in the manifold that you're filling. So here's how that goes. Here's our actual theorem. If you have a slope with pretty big normalized length, first it has to be bigger than the same constant 10.1, and then it also has to be bigger than this quantity involving the systole. So when the systole is small, the So when the systole is small, the length cutoff is pretty big, but when the systole is big, the length cutoff is just 10.1. Then every closed geodesic other than the core of the solitaurus actually has length that's pretty chunky. It's something involving the systal, in fact, it's strictly less than the systal because the denominator is bigger than one. But you can Bigger than one, but you can think of it as saying that the shortest curve after filling, apart from the core, is not really much shorter than the systole was before filling. And then you can take this quantity and you can massage it, just divide top and bottom by the systole and apply some numerical estimates for pi. And the number 42, also known as the meaning of life, mysteriously shows up. Shows up. And then, if you play with this quantity some more, or you say, hi, you know, 2π over the systole plus 42 is kind of similar to 2 pi over the systole plus 58. And you can bring this back to the length of the normalized slope at your filling. So, when you put it all together, you know that the core is short. You know that the core is shorter than this quantity, and everything else is longer than this quantity. That means that the core is the unique shortest. So that's the actual answer to Tali's question, or at least that's the best answer we can give. You could ask about how sharp these hypotheses are, but this applies to almost every slope. The rough way to think about it. The rough way to think about it in your head is that the number of slopes shorter than a certain normalized length is you have to take the normalized length and square it. So take 10.1 and square it and you get 102. So there should be approximately 102, or for various cute reasons, you have to round up to the nearest prime. There's at most 103 slopes that are shorter than that. But for all but that set of 103. But that set of 103, you can get the desired result. And the relation to cosmetic surgeries, of course, is that if you can do this for slope S, and you could also do this for the alternate slope S prime, the evil twin, then you know that they can't possibly be the same three-manifold out. Let's see, more. I can see more questions so far. All right, then let me tell you a little bit, just the most sort of top-level cartoon of how this result is proved, and then we can get back to cosmetic surgery applications. So the way that this is proved, that the core is the unique shortest and that nothing else is all that short. Nothing else is all that short is you use a pretty complicated machine that Hotchin and Kirchhoff developed. They developed some analytic machine that gives you a continuous interpolation between the manifold that you started with and the closed manifold that you get as a result. And you interpolate via a family of singular manifolds. So they're really hyperbolic manifolds with singularities that Uh, singularities that look like a cone. So, to talk you through it, initially, in the manifold you started with, you have a cusp. And in the upper half space model of hyperbolic space, you could think of a fundamental domain for this cusp as being this very, very tall, infinite chimney. This is everything about a horizontal horosphere. So, you glue it together by gluing the front to the back. To the back, and by gluing the left to the right, you glue it all up, and you get the storus cross interval infinite cusp. And the vertical geodesic rays that go out that cusp, I should have actually parameterized them the other way with my pen, they're going up out the cusp. They never actually meet, but they're asymptotic, those two geodesics, they're asymptotic to each other. Their distance is going to get closer and closer and closer. Is going to get closer and closer and closer, and we can think of that as meeting at infinity. They're going to meet at an ideal vertex at infinity at angle zero. So we can think of this cusp manifold as having a cone singularity of cone angle zero. When you deform a little bit away from this complete hyperbolic structure that's non-compact, you get something that actually is compact, but has a cone singularity. But has a con singularity of a very, very, very small angle. So you went from angle zero to angle non-zero but small. But you take this wedge and you still glue it up in exactly the same way. The front gets glued to the back, the left gets glued to the right. But now instead of these rays being asymptotic at infinity, they do actually meet. And when you do those gluings, you're going to get something that's topologically a solid torus. A solid torus, but it's a solid torus with a singularity. So a cross-section of it is going to be an actual cone with a small cone angle. And then you push further away from cone angle very small to cone angle slightly larger and cone angle slightly larger until you get all the way to cone angle 2 pi. So you still have a solid torus, but now instead of drawing a fundamental domain, I actually drew a tube. You get an actual number. You get an actual non-singular solitaurus with an angle of 2π about the core geodesic, and you found yourself the complete hyperbolic metric on the Deinfield manifold. Of course, this cartoon is really just what you want to have happen. And the hard part is actually proving that it does happen, that nothing goes wrong, that you can keep deforming. That's where all the hard analytic work happens. And over the course of three papers, And over the course of three papers, they developed a theory. They do a fair bit of hard analysis. They do Hodge theory. In fact, okay, I guess I'm just throwing buzzwords at you. They're doing Hodge theory in the bundle of infinitesimal isometries over your manifold. They have to parametrize the change in metric using a certain harmonic representative for the infinitesimal change in metric. There's some fairly involved analysis in their papers, but there's Analysis in their papers, but there's also analysis in the form of estimates. There are certain quantities that you have to prove never actually degenerate. One of the quantities that you have to prove does not degenerate is the radius of an embedded tube about your singular geodesic. But they prove that nothing goes wrong, and along the way, they estimate the various quantities involved in the change in metric. What we actually do is What we actually do is we take their work as almost a black box. We have to work with the names of their analytic quantities, but we don't need to do hard analysis with them. We have to do more soft analysis with them. By that, I mean calculus plus estimates. They say that, you know, here's a certain tensorial quantity and it expresses the derivative of the change in metric. And you know that it's bounded by the same sort of thing. We say, okay, great. The same sort of thing. We say, okay, great, it's bounded by this sort of thing. Let's estimate that thing. And we go and we estimate that thing. And if you look at our paper, it is on the archive. It's available, but it is 73 pages worth of some slightly involved estimates. I guess maybe to get to the cosmetic surgery part, you only need to read the first 50 of the 73 pages. But you know, there's soft but tedious analysis in the sense. But tedious analysis in the sense of calculus plus estimates. The derivative of the thing you want is estimated by a certain quantity. Let's go estimate that quantity, but that's the derivative. So let's go integrate the derivative. There are a lot of integrals and derivatives in the paper. And it took a whole lot of blood, sweat, and tears to actually get it to work. But there's some good estimates that come out of it, and you get to prove information about what isn't, isn't the. Information about what isn't, isn't the shortest. More generally, I guess the paper, the title of the paper starts with effective bilips. We get to control how much the metric changes. I mean, that's maybe the headline. Geometric result is we estimate just how much the metric changes in the other parts of the manifold. And that has other applications as well. You could say something about the Margulis constant from that point of view. That point of view. But one of the things that certainly comes out of it is estimates on the length of the core. Okay, should I bring it back to cosmetic surgeries? All right, so bringing back to cosmetic surgeries, apologies for those of you who are not big fans of either hyperbolic geometry or analysis. The topology is coming back right now. Here's the Here's the corollary that you get when you combine our result from with the work of Ni and Wu back to the context of not complements in the three sphere. So suppose you have two slopes that are purely cosmetic, that says that you get the same oriented three manifold out. Then after possibly relabeling which one you call S and which one you call S prime, you get the following things. First of all, Following things. First of all, one of them, let's call that slope S, has to be relatively short. In particular, it's shorter than this quantity in our theorem. So it's shorter than the larger of 10.1 or 2 pi over the system plus blah blah blah. And if you don't want to deal with the blah, blah, blah, you could say that this is, uh-oh, this is larger. If the systole is bigger than 0.15, so as long as your systole is not too tiny, then the just the constant term is larger. And the second thing you get, which is really Nien Wu's theorem restated, is that you do know that the one slope is the negative of the other slope as a rational number. Well, and furthermore, Rational number, well, and furthermore, you get this modular arithmetic criterion. So, this really tells you that there are finitely many values for s, and every s has only one evil twin, or at most one evil twin that you have to check. And that makes it feasible to that makes it feasible to actually check any given NOT complement or a large finite set of not complements on a computer. And we've written a computer program that does that. Program that does that. And using, you know, really your favorite proper subset of the invariants that I listed on that first slide, you can check the cosmetic surgery conjecture up to a respectable number of crossings. I think we did it up to 15 crossings using no invariance at all besides hyperbolic geometry. After that, you sort of have to restrict the set of knots you check because, well, because the exponential growth gets pretty large. Exponential growth gets pretty large, or you need a really, really fast computer. So there's any number of ways to get it up to 17 crossings. Remember the bit about all those other invariants require diagrams. On the other hand, this theorem does not really require having any access to the diagram at all. You just need to know that you're not complementing the three-sphere, and you need to know the meridian and longitude framing, which are things that you could figure out. Which are things that you could figure out relatively quickly from the complement with computational tools. So, something that you could do using our theorem that doesn't really work so easily from with any of the other invariants is you can check all the knot complements in the SNAPI census. There's about 1200 of them, and some of them are very, very large in terms of diagrams. I believe I could be mistaken. Maybe Nathan can correct me. Maybe there's even a handful of them for which we don't know. For which we don't know a good diagram, but there are some for which the best diagram known is some twisted torus knot with a massive, massive number of crossings. So things like even the Jones polynomial or the Haker floor homology would be very hard to compute, but this still works. In addition to doing it for not complements without having access to a diagram, you could also To a diagram, you could also check the cosmetic surgery conjecture on manifolds that are not complements at all. It's not really obvious going back to the theorem. Okay, I won't attempt to go all the way back there. It's not obvious from the theorem that a surgery slope involved in cosmetic surgery has to be short, that you can get a finite set of pairs. Finite set of pairs, but in fact, you can just get a finite set of pairs of slopes to check, which reduces the verification of the cosmetic surgery conjecture on this manifold to, again, a feasible, manageably sized computational problem. So here's how you get that finite set of pairs. The theorem that you already saw says that one of the two slopes has to be relatively short. So the first Short. So the first set involved is just the set of slopes that are shorter than this criterion. So once you build that set, you can calculate the volume of every manifold in it. Or if you happen to get a non-hyperbolic manifold, you just record the number zero. You don't have to do anything fancy with simplicial volumes. And you take the largest volume of all the manifolds in the set. At least one of them will have to be hyperbolic because the cutoff is pretty. Because the cutoff is pretty big. So this lets you define this number of V sub m, which is the largest volume of any manifold in this finite set. Gromov and Thurston tell you that that's strictly less than the volume of the hyperbolic manifold that you started with. And using that strict inequality, you can define your new set of slopes to be everything, all the slopes whose length is shorter. Well, Length is shorter well than a certain massaged version of that volume equality. The relevant bit is that over here, that quantity that you're raising to the two-thirds power and subtracting from one is strictly less than one itself, because the top is less than the bottom. You're taking something that's less than one and subtracting it from one. So, in fact, you can all actually do this. This is a legitimate thing to do with real numbers. Real numbers, and there's going to be a finite list of slopes that are that short. And then, gosh, an old theorem that I proved with Ephical Fagiani and Jessica Purcell. I never thought I would live to the stage of my career when I get to refer to something I did as a postdoc as an old theorem, but here we are. An old theorem of ours says that if the volume of the That if the volume of the filled manifold is no bigger than this maximum cutoff, in other words, if it is a plausible evil twin for the slope S, well, then the second slope has to be a member of this finite set as well. So that means that it really just does suffice to check pairs of slopes or drawn from that finite set. So that makes it pretty feasible. Makes it pretty feasible. And we already have a good working program that can check any knot you throw at it. We're still working in development on a program that will basically implement this and check any CUSP3 manifold you throw at it. So in the time that's left, I'm happy to take your questions about anything that transpired, but I'm also happy to hear the name. To hear the name of your favorite knot, and I'll show you the program that checks that conjecture in your favorite knot. Thanks. I will clap for everybody. Thank you, David, for a very nice talk. Is there any question for David? Just one question. Yes. So, what is normal was satellite? Satellite knots and these cosmetic surgery. Ah, good question. I'm pretty sure that all that's known is this theorem of Rantal. Let me go back and find it. So for satellite knots, we know something about cables and we know about the type of satellites that you get from connect summing knots together, but not more general satellites. If you were able to somehow leverage all of the topological invariants to rule it out for satellite knots, then of course all that would be left as hyperbolic. Yeah, I think I had the same question as Mario. So when you say that you have a program, So, when you say that you have a program for any node, I mean you can if you hand me a Dow Thistlewick code, I'll check the program. Yeah, the program will compute the complement and do it for you. I'm happy to demo it. I sort of would have to share a different window, but I'm happy to do that. Yeah, that will be nice. But I don't know if there is any other questions before David shares the program. Chairs the program. Maybe just in terms of the question about satellite knots, related to that would be maybe thinking about hyperbolic knots with two boundary components, right? Ah, ah, ah, good question. Hyperbolic, yeah, hyperbolic links with two boundary components. Yeah, let me take you to the relevant theorem or the relevant. irrelevant uh so let's say that we are here okay um so this result about slopes of decent normalized length and the conclusion being that the core is the unique shortest that actually works for multiple boundary components the only catch is that you have Only catch is that you have to define normalized length in the appropriate way for things of multiple components. So here's the right definition. That's a very good question. So suppose that you have slopes S1 up to Snow normalized lengths are L of L. L of S1 up to L S n. Then I'm going to combine those lengths in the following slightly non-standard way. I'm going to define a new global normalized length via the formula 1 over L squared is the sum of 1 over L of S i squared. I squared. It's sort of a weird way to combine them, but it's not too, too weird because, after all, one over length squared is, if you like, the length of the resulting core curve after surgery. So basically, I am summing together all of the lengths of the core curves after surgery is morally the way to think about this. So it turns out that if you do a Dane filling on a link complement or any hyperbolic manifold with multiple cuts, Any hyperbolic manifold with multiple cusps and the normalized length of that tuple of slopes, if that whole combined quantity is pretty big, which forces all of the individual ones to be big, then you get to know that the core is, or sorry, you don't, you have more than one core, then you get to know that the tuple, of course, is the end tuple of. The n-tuple of shortest closed geodesics. If you fill the manifold with seven cusps, then you know that the seven shortest geodesics are the ones you're staring at and not any others. So that part works very well. The unfortunate thing is that this is no longer a finances theorem because there are now infinitely many tuples of slopes where at least one quarter. Where at least one coordinate is short for each of them, even with a pair of slopes. There are infinitely many pairs where the first coordinate is small and the second is arbitrary, or the second coordinate is small and the first is arbitrary. And unfortunately, this formula, in order for the whole thing, in order for the whole normalized length to be big, that means. Normalized length to be big, that means you know the inverse has to be small. That means each of these things has to be small. So the individual lengths have to be big in order for the combined quantity to be big. But otherwise, it works. Yes. Since you summoned me earlier by your question about whether you have not diagrams for all those sort of small. For all those sort of small tetrahedral complement knots, the answer is, I think, is about 500. We don't actually have explicit diagrams for the nine tetrahedral ones. I'm actually currently working on a project with my students, Cameron Rudd and Malik Obedin, where we're working on this sort of inverse problem where you go from a triangulation of the exterior to a knot diagram. And so we can at this point do some like 15 crossing knots sort of backwards. And I'm hopeful this. And I'm hopeful this will basically work on examples of almost any size. So it should be possible to take just a triangulation of the exterior and kind of the abstract knowledge that you fill along this curve, you get S3 and output. Here's a diagram, probably very redundant, much higher crossings than you need that gives you that. Okay, thanks. That's very helpful, and that sounds like fascinating work. Fascinating work, but of course, some of those diagrams are going to be way, way, way too large in order to practically compute diagrammatic invariance. Maybe I should chime in on this. So we, and by we, I mean maybe mostly Mark Kago, but we've actually gotten diagrams for all the snappy census knots just by devising surgery descriptions of them first and then translating that into actual knot diagrams. Opton tetrahedra? Oh, yeah, I'll in this next one. That's very cool. Fantastic. Fantastic. Oh, yes, Ken, I should have also mentioned you and Mark Tagel because you guys had emailed us about the thing that was one of the corollaries that was mentioned in here. So I guess you had independently re-verified that corollary. Yeah, it was using your work, though. I mean, yeah. All right. Does anyone have a favorite knot that you want? Does anyone have a favorite knot that you want checked for cosmetic surgeries? Or have we beaten this to death? Yes, Nathan. 15N12345. Okay, so let's see. Let me start by sharing a different screen.
