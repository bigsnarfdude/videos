Let's start again. The next speaker is Jaslov Bruckner, that we speak about quantum reference frames and Einstein's equivalent principle. Please, Jaslov. Great. Thank you. I would like to start by thanking Chlaminia, Robin, Lucien for organizing this workshop. It's one of these rare workshops where you really want to be at every talk, but now you can't. At every talk, but now you can't because of different time zones, usually it's the other way around. And so, I'm very happy to be here. I announced that I'm going to talk about quantum reference frames and weak and Einstein sequenced principle, but I realized that the time will not permit this, so I concentrate on a more fundamental of the two principles. And this is the work that was done together with Flaminia. Some of you have heard this either from her or from me. Heard this either from her or from me on some other occasions, but I hope to give one or the other kind of insight that is new as my own interpretation of some of the results also evolved. So, okay, here is the outline of my talk. First, I will try to say why we consider quantum reference frames for these purposes in general. Then I will move to Then I will move to introduce classical local inertial frame, which is the basis basically for the ordinary Einstein equivalence principle. Then to the notion of quantum locally inertial frame. And finally, with the help of this frame, I will argue for the validity of what we call quantum Einstein sequenced principle in the specific regime that I will specify. Regime that I will specify. And finally, I will come to the conclusions. So let me start with the kind of experimental viewpoint. And we heard a nice talk by Kevin and later, I think tomorrow, Marcus will talk about their experiments. And here I borrowed a photo of us from my group, where they recently published result of measuring the gravitational field of a milligram mass. Field of a milligram mass. And so this is the smallest mass ever measured for which the gravitational force was measured. And so if we take the understanding of general relativity that the gravitational force is change of space-time geometry, then one can say that they measure the smallest change of space-time geometry, which was produced by this milligram mass. Produced by this milligram mass. And of course, the long-term goal of many experimental groups is to create a superposition of such milligram mass objects. In case of the Asmumey group, this is really like a golden spheres. So if we would like to make a cartoon of that, what they want to do is something like that, to really bring this golden sphere into two positions. Into two positions. And if you press them, they think about a time scale of five to ten years. Now, if already now, for the localized golden sphere, they can identify the gravitational force, and this gravitational force, according to the general relativity, should be understood as a space-time geometry. Then one can ask oneself whether bringing the smash in a Whether bringing the SMAS in a spatial superposition will indeed create a superposition of space-times. And this is something which we have been discussing also during the discussions in the previous days. Now, one, from the theoretical point, maybe a justified objection would be that these two configurations are related to a translation, or to be more specific, by a diffomorphism. And so the Deformorphism. And so the question is: are the two space-times equivalent maybe, since they are related to each other through diffromorphism? And then, not only that the two are maybe equivalent, but then if one follows this argumentation, also the superposition of them will be not different than anyone produced by a single localized mass. Now, the main point here, and I think this is the resolution of this kind of issue, is that what they will do in the lab. What they will do in the lab is not translation of everything, it's the rest of the laboratory is not translated. So, if you imagine that there is a wall of a lab or even measurement devices that are somehow fixed to the laboratory frame, then only what is actually translated or put into the superposition is the single mass, addressed not. And so, it's very important that in this kind of a regime, what they aim for. Regime, what they aim for, we do have a kind of implicitly a reference frame that from now on, also for the theoretical kind of purposes of the talk, I will denote by R as a reference frame. And moreover, I will consider the regime in which the gravitational fields produced by one or the other amplitude. One or the other amplitude in these superpositions are orthogonal to each other. And when I write the cat G1, what I mean with this is that they can be, that this state can be specified by the gravitational, by the source of gravitational field, or more precisely, by the position of the mass sourcing this gravitation. And I will also assume that these positions are macroscopically distinguishable and therefore. Distinguishable and therefore that they are orthogonal to each other. In more words and more specifically and more detailed, the regime which we consider is based on three assumptions. The first one is that which I mentioned is the gravitational fields produced by distinguishable mass distributions correspond to orthogonal quantum states. And this is a formal correspondence between distinguishability as a physical. Distinguishability as a physical feature and orthogonality as a mathematical description of the vectors associated to these configurations. The second point is that each well-defined gravitational field is described by general relativity, so we don't have any modification with this transport. And finally, the last point is that quantum superposition principle holds for such gravitational fields. Holds for such gravitational fields. And this is arguably the most critical assumption. And here we take a more conservative approach that really the quantum superposition can be extended to these macroscopic configurations. Although we know that there are also other approaches, modifications of quantum theory in this domain, like Piergy-Panros model, which will exclude the 0.3. And so, interesting. And so, interestingly, we can say something meaningful in this regime without going into the details of any theory of quantum gravity. If, of course, in approximate, maybe we can call it semi-classical limit, they satisfied the three points. And it seems that this limit would be relevant in the domain when the distinguishability between the states is much larger than any quantum fluctuations that can be associated to individual. That can be associated to individual states in this superposition. More precisely, if we think about these states as some coherent states, then coherent states have some uncertainty. But the distinguishability between these two states is much larger than any uncertainty that can be associated to a single state. Now, I move to the Einstein equivalence principle and I move to the formulation. To the formulation, this is given in the textbook by Wiesner, Thorne, and Wheeler, which says that in any and every local Rollins frame, anywhere and anytime in the universe, all the non-gravitational laws of physics must take on their familiar special relativistic form. Now, physically, this implies that we can define local frames. Uh, frames, uh, infinite is in small frames, which would be, for example, free-falling frames in the gravitational field of our, let's say, golden sphere. And the statement is that observers in such local frames will perceive the physics around them, which will be specialistic, have a specialistic form, or in other way, that they are in an inertial frame. Now, what our paper suggests. Suggest is a slight extension of that, quantizing, in a sense, this statement. And in words, it says in every and any and every quantum local inertial frame, anywhere and any time in the universe, all the non-gravitational laws of physics must take on their familiar special optimistic form. As you see, it was only a change of one word when we added the quantum local inertial frame, and this is something which I need still to define. Is something which I need still to define. What we mean there, what we think as a physical consequence of this principle to be that we can address the following physical situation. In the first one, the frame itself is considered as a quantum mechanical frame. So I can think about a particle, a quantum particle that can even be very non-locally distributed and is a particle that is freely for. Is a particle that is freely falling in the well-defined gravitational field of a golden sphere. And very sometimes in the literature, in these cases, people claim that even the weak and Einstein equivalence principle both are violated because the quantum particle doesn't have a well-defined trajectory and so we cannot define the geodesics. However, in the way how we understand this principle in a more general terms as stated here. In the more general terms, as stated here, we believe that still we can associate with such a quantum particle or quantum laboratory freely falling, we can identify with the inertial frame. The second situation that can be addressed with this principle is the opposite of the first one, where the particle could be maybe localized, but it falls freely in a superposition of space-times. times and the idea of this principle is that an observer in such a frame would not know would not notice whether it falls in the superposition of gravitational fields or in well-defined gravitational field still the local physics will be that of inertial frame of course one can combine these two situations and that's the most general case now at that point i should mention that the formulation of this principle The formulation of this principle was very much motivated and influenced by the whole program by Lucien Hardy, which he specified in these two papers, like conceptual roads to quantum gravity. And he himself identified what he called quantum equivalence principle. There are some conceptual similarity between these two principles, but also differences. And I cannot, in the time of the talk, go into these differences, but I am happy to discuss that early in the discussion. Happy to discuss that either in the discussion or in question time. Now, let us move to the classical local inertial frame. The idea is that in every curved space-time, locally, we can straighten the metric. So, in this case, we want to choose appropriate coordinate around the point P. So, we center the first, we center the origin in P and then we. And then we change the coordinates in such a way that to keep up to the linear term the change of the coordinates. And we change such that using the gauge freedom, we can choose the functions f, which is a partial derivatives all after the new coordinates, such to straighten the metric in the vicinity of the point P. And this is a mathematical statement of Einstein. Statement of Einstein equivalence principle, this allows us to locally create a Minkowski metric up to the second order. And so the idea technical is somehow to quantize this procedure. And that's what I want to tell you next. But for that, I first have to introduce some concepts. And first concept is how Concept is how I want to represent the gravitational field. Now, for these purposes, I need an additional particle, I will call particle M, which defines a physical point at which the metric field will be evaluated. So when I say that the metric field has certain value, what I mean is that it has a certain value at the position of particle m, where this particle can be given by some kind of wave function. Given by some kind of wave function across the space-time. And this wave function doesn't need to be localized, it could be over large support, non-local. So the main mathematical object that would correspond to this operation, looking at the gravitational field at the location of particle m will be given by this state. This is the main mathematical object. All statements that I will make about the gravitational field will be made. Of the field will be made with respect to such objects. And what we see here is certain correlation, correlation between the metric field at position X, where the position X is actually the position of particle A. It has a form of an entangled state and will mean really that we look the value of the metric field wherever the particle is. Wherever the particle is, even though we may not know as an observer where the particle is. I also like to understand this as a kind of a small lab or measurement device, such that we have this lab that is non-locally distributed over space-time. But in this lab, maybe I am equipped with certain devices that can locally send light. May light pulses in the neighboring points and therefore measure the metric that is associated with the point where the lab is. So particle M maybe can be also understood as a quantum coordinate. This is something to be discussed or as a small lab. And from now on, I will call a small lab this particle or we'll say particle M. Now imagine that we have a space-time and we have the Have a space-time, and we have this particle lab M. But in addition to this lab, we have maybe additional particle P, and we want somehow to evaluate the gravitational field at the position of particle P. How should we do this? Now we have three subsystems. We have a particle P, then we have these mathematical objects that connect the Mathematical objects that connect the gravitational field with our lab M, but we want somehow to look at the gravitational field not where the lab is, but where the particle is. And so there are two steps to do it. We first need to center the origin in P. That means that the relative coordinates in M become, the absolute coordinate in M becomes a relative coordinate with respect to where the particle P is. The particle P is. And a second step, we project lab at the position where the particle P is, meaning that the relative coordinates needs to be zero. And what we get is again a mathematical object of the same form as in the previous slide, but now the gravitational field is evaluated at the position where the particle P is. So that will be the methodological step to look. Step to look at the gravitational field where the particle P is, which could be a pro particle, maybe a freely falling proparticle. Now, the next what I want to introduce, and this is the most technical slide at the point, is a quantum local inertial frame. Now, the methodological step will be very similar to those that are maybe. Very similar to those that are maybe familiar with some of the works of the quantum reference frames, we will jump on the particle P and in the vicinity of the particle P, we will choose the coordinate such that it looks Minkowskian. And so this is the transformation to the quantum local inertial frame because particle P could be a quantum particle. So at the beginning, we have a transformation that includes an external reference frame like R. A reference frame like R, like the wall of the laboratory, then we have a particle P, and we also have this object that evaluates the gradational field at the lab M, at the small lab M. Okay, so this will be given in several steps. In the first step, we again center the origin in the P. So that's why we have now the absolute coordinate of M, again, the relative coordinate. Coordinate of M, again, the relative coordinate with respect to where the particle P is. The second one is the straightened metric around particle P. What we mean is that we apply a transformation, a coordinate transformation that we introduce in the case of a classical local emission frame, namely that from the x-coordinates, we go to the xi-coordinates, and we choose these psi coordinates such that the metric is flattened. And it can be shown that this. And it can be shown that this transformation itself is a unitary transformation. Then the next step is to swap the old and the new reference frames. That's the methodological step that is very common in the quantum reference frames. So we jump on the particle P and therefore we jump on the new reference frame such that the old reference frame. Such that the old reference frame takes the opposite coordinate with respect to the new reference frame. So 0x will be transformed in 0 minus x, where 0 is always there where the particle is, and depend on which quantum reference frames we are. I should also mention that this zero is just here as a kind of additional notation. It's a not degree of freedom from the point. Degree of freedom from the point of view of the reference frame where we are is not the degree of freedom for this reference frame. So, here in this at the beginning, the zero was the external reference frame. It doesn't evolve, but and the same happens when we jump on the particle P. Now we have these three operations, and we can make a composition of these three unitary operations. And of course, this is a unitary and Of course, this is a unitary and reversible map. And the last point where we want to find out what is the gravitational field exactly at the position of particle P. For this last step, we need again to measure the relative degrees of freedom. And when we obtain the zero, we actually identified and put the laboratory at the point of the particle P. And what we obtain then is our 20 minutes. 20 minutes. Great, yeah, that's fine. And then again, we get a state which is our mathematical object from which we make any statement. But what is very important here, that in the vicinity of the point where the particle is, the field is locally Minkowskian and it states can factorize out. So no matter where the particle is, there is a way of jumping on this particle. Of jumping on this particle and proving that we can choose correspondingly local coordinate system such that the metric is Minkowski. Now, what I said is that we can go beyond that, and actually that we can consider also not only a non-local quantum particle falling in a well-defined gravitational field, but we can also think about transformation to local inertial frames for. Transformation to local initial frames for a family of space-times. Here is not still quantized anything. I'm just thinking about a family of space-times for which I can associate different metrics G1, G2, and G3. They can correspond to the different mass configuration from our slide at the very beginning, depending on the position of the golden spheres. And we have here three different manifolds corresponding to this family. Corresponding to this family of metrics. Now, the idea is that we still can find local inertial frame transformation, not only within each space-time, as I have done it in the previous slide, but also across different space-time metrics, where we identify the points across different space-times with the position of the particle. So, if I would measure the pro-particle P, this position will then identify the physical point. Identify the physical point in all three cases. Now, if we want to do and find local inertial frames, not only at each spacetime, but across different spacetimes, then at each point, and I now is indexed for different manifolds, in each space-time GI needs to be such that we locally flatten the space-time. So, this will depend on the position of a particle, but also where. A particle, but also where in which space-time we are. And now we can indeed consider the superposition of space-times. And this picture here is one such superposition where we have external reference frame R, the wall, it's not the preferred, it's just the one in which we write this thing. And then we have a superposition of space-times, and CI are just complex numbers. Are just complex numbers and amplitudes in this superposition where we sum over different manifolds and a different metrics Gi and different states of the particles. Now, again, we can do the same what we have done. Now, this time I will not go into detail. We center the origin in P for each manifold, Mi. We straighten the matrix around P for each manifold Mi. We swap P and R for each manifold Mi. And what we get. Manifold MI. And what we get then is a certain unitary transformation that is depending on which manifold VR acts differently. So this could be a controlled unitary depending in which space-time we are. And finally, everything is unitary. But the last step, like last time, we need to project M at the position of P to evaluate also the metric field at the position P. And when we do that, P and when we do that, the situation is very similar as in the previous case. That locally the field is Minkowski and its state factor is out. The rest could be still in some superposition. And now I'm coming to the conclusions for today's talk. Given what I said, we can actually give a more technical maybe formulation of the quantum Einstein equivalence principle. And I read it for you for every question. And I read it for you: for every quantum state of a system P living in a superposition of classical spacetimes, one can find a quantum local inertial frame transformation to the quantum reference frame of P, such that the metric is locally Minkowski at the origin of the quantum reference frame. I didn't have the time, and this is things to actually, which we don't discuss in great details in the paper, how to test this principle, and I think it will be a very fascinating research directory. Very fascinating research direction. And I didn't talk about other aspect that we shown in the paper that one can use the quantum fermion normal coordinates, where we attach the quantum reference frame in the full freely falling object, and the state can be seen then that arise from that as an infinite sum over all possible classical trajectories. And with this, I would like to thank you for your attention. I would like to thank you for your attention. Thank you very much, Asla, for the very nice talk. And let's open for the questions. And we have already a first question from Anupam. Please, Anupam. Very nice, Dr. Jeslau. So I wanted to understand one thing which was not clear. So you are using the Galilean transformation. Am I correct? Or are you using the general covariant transformation? We are using the general, not the... We are using the general, not that's not Gallier, not we are not, we are not restricted on Gallier. So then I got confused because the Hamiltonian, which you were using, the Hamiltonian evolution, I was confused because in the gravity and general relativity, the Hamiltonian is quite involved quantity. You define it through the ADM formalism. So this is what I could not get it. Maybe you could point me. Which Hamiltonian are there? That's some point you are evolving your state. At some point, you are evolving your state, so you must be using some Hamiltonian. We are evolving at the state of the quantum particle. Here we adopt in the paper we are evolving and we take, for example, the Klein-Gordon equation or constraint on the space-time. But here at today, I didn't talk about Hamilton at all. So I didn't talk about dynamics. I was talking. Talk about dynamics. I was talking only at a moment when a choice, a momental choice of the coordinate system. So not evolving, but in the paper indeed, we use a relativistic particle on a curved space-time. And this gives us the last statement that I made in the conclusions: that in the quantum fermion on equalness, the state is an infinite sum over all possible classical trajectories. Trajectories of this quantum particle on the curved space-time or on the superposition of space-times. Thanks. Welcome. Okay, we have now a question from Jeremy Butterfield. Please, Jeremy. Well, thank you, but Alessio, could we hear Marcus's question first? Sure, sure, sure. No problem. Marcus, go ahead. Okay. Hi, Chatlov. Thanks for my talk. Hi, Chancellor. Thanks for the great talk. I hear it for the second time, and I'm still very fascinated. I wonder if there's an alternative way to understand what you're doing. And I just want to see if that holds up. So could we say that what you do is you first look at the classical situation, you have one classical space-time and then classical particles. And you're very carefully looking operationally how you would then go into the locally flat inertial. Go into the locally flat inertial frame. And then you basically unitarize that. So you take a kind of unitary extension, which you can do according to the assumptions that you make in the beginning. Is that correct? Or do you need something like additional ingredients or extra steps of care that would not classically be visible when you just start classically? No, I think this is correct. I think judging from the assumptions, we really Judging from the assumptions, we really rely on GR solution plus extension of superposition. What, of course, what is here, non-maybe trivial part is how we jump on a particle such to see that we can flatten everything. So, this coherence and jumping on a particle, no matter where the particle is, no matter in which space-times you are, is Each space-time zero is maybe a new element, but from the conceptual point of view, this element is allowed by the fact that we know how to do it in general relativity, and we allow this to make in a superposition of that so that we have some kind of a controlled unitary. Okay, great. This is also the limitation, then, of the program. Sorry, yeah. Can I have a very quick follow-up? Yes, yes. So, I wonder if then. So, I wonder if then there's some kind of additional assumption that's going in here. So, say you transform to the Minkowski state in different space-times. Is this assuming that there's basically a single underlying quantum state that would give rise to something like a flat space-time? Or could the, you know, because if you could have orthogonal microscopic quantum states that would look after coarse graining like Minkowski, then. Then you couldn't really factor out the state in the end like you do it. So, is that an additional assumption? I don't think so. Okay, so there are two things to say about that. I think this is a highly non-perturbative regime, although it's a semi-classical. So, in a sense, one can even consider the superposition of two black holes. And obviously, one solution is not a perturbation of the other. Perturbation of the other. So highly non-perturbable. Yet, of course, we don't say anything about fluctuations, like maybe the causal sets could say something about fluctuations on the top of the GR solution. And about the kind of factorization, there is also something which appears very often as a question that you have these two solutions, let's say two black holes, and they have identical. And they have identical solution only in the infinities. They are the same. And so the people then may object that, well, how can you even write this state in the beginning? Because it stretches unto the infinity. So if I write from the external reference frame, this external reference frame at the beginning should be factorized out, but it cannot maybe be factorized out in any finite distance. And I think this is wrong. And it's wrong because it's not operational enough. Wrong because it's not operational enough, this argument. And if you're writing these states far away, you can actually calculate how far you can go such that your local clock, with which you write down the coordinate time, for example, will not get entangled with the two mass, the mass in the superposition. Only what is needed is that the pointer of this clock has certain uncertainty such that for the duration. That for the duration of the experiment, it will not get entangled. And so, even if they are not fully on the top of each other, the two metrics, operationally, this doesn't need to matter. Excellent. Thank you. Thank you for the questions. Very good questions. Now, please, Jeremy, go on. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Chasla, for the excellent talk. A very quick question from a complete novice. Question from a complete novice in this. It's about the summation over the manifolds in the last third of the talk, labeled by little I. From the philosophy viewpoint, we're very preoccupied by identifying one point in a manifold with another point as the same physical point. There's a whole literature about the so-called whole argument, and isometries, or if you have matter fields, isomorphisms also. Matter fields, isomorphisms also of the matter fields are often used to drag along. And I think that that is too restricted, actually, as a way of identifying points. And can you comment on what your formalism does? Clearly, you go from gold to gold, like Vienna always goes from gold to gold, in its researches. But what's the mathematics of the fiber-like vertical line in this slide? How do I identify? Yes. So I think, as Vienna always does, it's a take operational approach. So what identifies these points is other field. In our case, it's a particle. Case is a particle. And so imagine that it's very localized particle. If you really want to identify the points. And so you measure and you hear the click at some point. Then this point will be identified across the manifolds as the same physical point that might have different coordinates in different manifolds, but it's the same physical point. Now, what is interesting, I think, in this approach, we do not incessant. We do not insist that a particle is localized. It doesn't need to be localized, but once it's measured, it will be localized, and then it will be identifying the points across the manifolds. Okay. Thank you. The usual approach is that you have sufficiently classical thing that you can identify, like a scalar field and coincidences. And I think we go a little bit beyond that. But and this is what you meant by jump on. But and this is what you meant by jump on the particle. That's what I mean, jump on the particles. Okay, thank you. So, something like approximate isomorphism of the matter fields under the drag along from one to another. Thank you. Thank you very much for the great discussion. We have still a question from Sugato, but I would like to ask Sugato to hold it for the discussion section because we It for the discussion section because we are a bit over time. Then let's thank Shasdav again for the nice talk.
