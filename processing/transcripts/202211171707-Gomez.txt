And I ask to present this mainly because then I have the opportunity to thank everybody here. For me, this has been a great workshop. I want to thank the participants. I'm not entitled to thank the organizers because I belong to the organizers, but I want to thank the main organizer, Niklos Bona. He's done a question. I'm thankful very much. I think you're very different to talk about the product 3D song because some music is going on. This is Scale Ator. Scale Ator is a program that classifies musical scales using two methods. One of them is the easy model. And as you can see, this is a screenshot video of ScaleTor. Video of Scale Tor, and there's a lot of things going on in it. So I need to explain what's going on. So give me five minutes for the explanation. So what is a musical scale? It's a rooted set of pitch classes. So a pitch class, say a C or a DO, are all the DOS in your keyboard. So that's a pitch class. So that's a pitch class. So a musical scale is nothing but a rooted set of pitch classes. Say that D is the root, and then you just choose a subset of the rest of the pitch classes. You have 12 notes, right? For example, this is the monotonic scale, because you're just playing D D D D. Ah, no, C. You can change the wood for something else. You can change the wood for something else, right? Or this is the chromatic scale. You choose all of them, right? You can represent them in several ways in a keyboard or saying a musical notation. And you can also do that with a sequence of numbers. For example, the major scale, it's a dollar vivazola zido, right? And you can pick You can picture it in a clock, like that one, with 12 vertices. You always put the root at 12 o'clock, and then you choose some other times, right? So, for example, from C to D, there are, you jump twice, then you put a two, from D to E, there are what kind of one? What kind of one? That's the other two, yes. And the other two, yes. And then from E to F, there's one, and so forth. If you add this, you get 12. And for any other scale, like the minor scale, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, you also get 12. The pentatonic scale, you get 12. So it's pretty easy to observe that the scales are nothing but compositions of 12. If you divide the octave in n parts instead of 12, you can. NEN parts instead of 12, you get the N10 tuning system, right? And then you would have 2 to the N scales. So it's very simple. The thing is that when you're doing your show and playing, you're not using only one scale, but a subset of scales that makes the music richer. So, well, we said that the scales are integer compositions, you know, all the generations. Compositions, you know all the generating functions. Here, the compositions are arranged according to the number of sumants or the number of notes. And in music, there is an important concept which are the modes. So you take your scale and you rotate the polygon in such a way that there's always a vertex at 12 o'clock and then you get the Clock, and then you get all these other scales associated to this. And these are the modes of the major scale, for example. So, these are the modes, equivalence classes. So, in analytic combinatorics, these are called wheels, right? And we know the generating functions too. And what we want to do is to build subsets of skills, right? And those that are loads. And there are lots of them, two to the 200, well, that number, and that's bigger than the number of atoms in the universe. So, Scalator, it's like a... I first called it Scalescope because it's like a telescope, but for scales. But I changed the name to Scalator because it some it has more power. And it burns your machine after using it a lot, I believe. Using it a lot, I believe. So you will hear my machine some of you talking like when we see the program. So, so let me. So, it produces subsets of scales in two ways. Two methods is symbolic dynamical scales, and the other one is a random field of scales, which is the easy model thing. So, let me explain very quickly the first one. You pick a sequence of symbols, whatever, like Symbols, whatever, like XH pepper, picker, picks a pair of peppers, and open a window of size 12, like that one. Look at the first symbol and see when it repeats. Think of Poincar√© currents, and then you have your scale. Your scale. This is 226. So dominant pentatonic omit 5 is a pepper, picks a pair of pickled pepper scales. You know what I mean, right? This is another one, okay? But instead of choosing silly sequences like that one, for example, you can look at the two more sequences. And these sequences produce sequences. Sequences produce subshifts which are minimal and they have zero entropy. So there are just a few numbers of words of length 12. And these are the scales that you can obtain from the two modes, from the Fibonacci, from other sequences, or just pick your favorite sequence from the online encyclopedia of integer sequences. In particular, two Morse produces lots of. Two moles produces lots of scales, raga scales that are used in Indian music. The Fibonacci scales produce the classical scales like the major, pentatonic, etc. You can, for example, take a graph and walk the graph that produces a sequence of vertices, and then you can find the formulas for the generating functions given the graph. Generating functions given the graph, that's technicality, but you can verify your result with scalability. And the other model is the easing model. So let me just say a few words about the easing model. Remember, you have a lattice, you put the pluses and minuses, and there is a Hamiltonian, right? And then the Hamiltonian produces the Gibbs measure, which is the Boltzmann distribution. Which is the Boltzmann distribution. And the idea is that you are one side, you are positive, and then you look at your first neighbors. There are three negatives and one positive, then the Hamiltonian energy function tells you if you are surrounded by negatives, you better become negative. That's why I try to hang out with. I try to hang out with you guys because you are pretty clever. And I apply to myself the easing model. Okay, so that's and how do you, and in the easing model you can tweak it and have the frozen regions in your in the sites, right? How do you model the you can simulate the Boltzmann distribution with Glauer dynamics? With Glauer dynamics, and that's the algorithm in Skeletor, right? So you choose a site at random, and then you compute energies, and it's globular dynamics. And here is, this was my first exercise. I programmed the AC model, and you see that quickly you start looking having islands of Looking having islands of pluses and minuses. So, for the scales, the scales are the sides, and on each side we're going to put a plus. The scale is on or minus is off. So, we construct the compositions recursively. You start with one, then you append the one, or add one, and then you add one, you append the one. You append the one or add one to the entry, and you get this. And for two, the same thing. And so we need the adjacencies between the scales. The adjacencies can be either by size. You put an edge if two scales have the same size, or if one is mode of the other, or if one interpolates into other. That means that you add or subtract a pitch class. And then, is it clear? All right, so the Hamiltonian in scale torque has this form, and these are the, so it's a sum of two Hamiltonians, right? So the delta is the on-off switch in each module. There is a temperature controlling the whole module. Actually, there are some Actually, there are some another temperature for the positive. It's kind of like it gets kind of like crazy and there. And there is an equalizer that can influence on scales at a specific size. So that's before, for example, this song that you're hearing here right now utilizes one. Utilizes one scale, one two more scale. So you're hearing a scale that comes from the two Morse sequence. We use all this material in Mexico for giving conferences, with concerts, with music mainly in high schools, and with the idea of motivating young people to study mathematics. To study mathematics. So, what's that? We have a band. It's called Los Symbolicos Dynamicos. So, here is the scale ator. So, let me show you how. So, this is the this is the Gaussian. This is these are the all the scales. And here you can see it's zoomed. You can see it's zoomed. So, for example, if I'm moving here, you see how it moves here. No, this is the part that you're seeing. This is clear, but yeah, all of them are on right now, right? All of them are on. You can change the root. Right now, I have selected the monotonic scale. It's green. The green, the monotonic scale interpolates in all the scales. That's why the blue square are the scales on which the green scale interpolates. So for example, if I choose this one, this doesn't interpolate in all of them, just in this subset, right, you see. These are all the modules of energy, right? Here are all the scales. Right? Here are all the scales that you can see. For example, this one. This interraga. These are the modes. These are the interpolations. This one results from this by inserting one note or two or three. And you can see all of all the ones that interpolate. There are thirty-five scales that result from this one by interpolating three. This one by interpolating three notes. So, for example, if you press symbolic, Skeletor reads a file called symbolic.text. In this case, here is the two more sequence. So you press symbolic and automatically reads the sequences and computes all the scales from the first simple rule that I Scales from the first simple rule that I explained before. These are all of them. You can freeze configurations. Let's freeze this, for example. And then I can start running Lauber dynamics. I press start. Everything starts vibrating with a Bernoulli one half, one half, except the ones that I froze. You cannot see them, but they are always on. So, for example, if I want, if I want... If I want all the modes of all the two modes scales, I go to the modes module. Here, I can... The equalizer determines in which column the module is affecting. You know what I mean? So I'm gonna turn all of them on. To turn them all of them on to find all the modes, I increase the temperature and I turn on the main temperature to turn this on. And I'm sorry, the other way around. So I quickly find 49 scales, which are all the modes of the 18 scales. And this, the scale letter finds them by random, right? Random, right? So, in general, the Gibbs measure associated to the Hamiltonians here are Feuntman's measures. So, they produce just one single subset. Is that clear? What else? For example, another example, the major scale has five twos and two ones. Remember? So, I can go to the, I turn this off. Go to the, I turn this on, I start the thing, I release the soft shift. I can also freeze by columns, you see, and consider subspace by columns or everything. So let's find the major scale. The major scale has five twos. So I go to the module of twos, I ask for five twos, I increase the I increase the temperature, I turn on the energy, and quickly Skeletor finds all the scales with five tools or more. One, two, three, four, five. If I want four, I get more, four, s five, six. For example, how many skills with six tools are? There's only this one, right? Are there's only this one, right? What's the name of that one? Oh, that one? Well, this is the what was it? I don't know. Alton scale. It's a sexatonic, because, yeah, yeah, yeah. All these I did, the most part of the program I did it while the lockdown. And writing the names, I did that in five days when I got sick of COVID and I had to be in my bedroom for five days. Yes. So in writing the names, did you have choices or did you have some rule that actually just generates names for all these scales that don't? No, in fact, okay, so there is something called the Universal Encyclopedia of Scales. It's a commercial. It's a commercial encyclopedia, and in their website, they have a video because I haven't bought the encyclopedia, but in their website, they have a video that lasts for like two minutes where they just play. Play all of them like very fast. So, those five days I was just like, I took a screenshot video. The video is somewhere there, I can show it to you. Yeah, it was a lot of fun. So for example, and also, you can, for example, say you say you like, this is the positive temperature. If you make it negative, what do you get? Bam! Now then it goes and you get the complement, right? You get the complement. And then, for example, you make a subspace here, turn off your module, or maybe let's do something that is clear. For example, this of the service. So these are the scales with four or more scales. So I press subspace and release. So I just vibrate here. So you can make subsets. Can make subsets and keep on running your algorithm, right? And make further searches. Kind of the idea of this is a proof of concept that you can use these thermodynamic models as search engines. Think for example that in a university, the schedule for courses. So define your thing and So define your thing and do do move it here and there and it gives you a pops up the optimal arrangement for. Or think of making a portfolio in Wall Street or things like that, right? I think that's enough because we all want to go to have some food, maybe some wine, because this is the last day. This is the last day, and if there's any questions, two minutes at the end. Yeah, please. I'm done. I'm done with this. Mark will make an announcement. Yeah, this should be quick. I don't have any cool music. The recording? Oh, here. Oh, here. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.
