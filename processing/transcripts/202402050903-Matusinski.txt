Uh, so the sort of exponential fields I have in mind are the one connected with all the fields. The exponential would be total on the field, and that might be a derivation. So, we the interesting context will be in the non-Archimedean case in the Archimedean case. We have in mind the real swift exponential. I won't speak about the prime model or none of the number theoretic concerns about these themes. This would have been the occasion to give a big talk on that. There will be talks also on the exponential, the complex exponential. I won't say a word on that. Word on that. I will stay with these two classes of objects: exponential hardy fields on the functional side and exponential subfields of generalized series on the formal side. And both of them will be encompassed by the Conway's field of serving numbers. So let's get started. I will on each things give the very basic definition. Things give the very basic definitions, the proposition, the main results, and hopefully the more recent achievements. So let me recall that a Hardy field is just a differential subfield of the ring of germs at the infinity of Louis functions. By definition, this means that the germs are non-oscillating in a very strong way. Oscillating in a very strong way. Indeed, any non-zero germ has to be invertible, so cannot ultimately oscillate. But neither can do the repeated derivatives. What you should have in mind is the usual, well, non-oscillating real functions like logarithm. Like logarithm, exponential, the polynomials or real analytic functions locally. And the historical example, which was foundational, was given by Hardy in logarithmico-exponential functions, which are built iteratively using real algebraic functions, logarithm, and exponential. And exponential. Another main source of examples are in the context of o-minimal structures, the expansions of the field of reals. In fact, the set of definable functions in one variable always consists of a hardy field. This is a fact, a consequence of the smooth monotonicity. Smooth monotonic CV theorem. So we'll have, of course, in mind the RD field of the theory of R-XP or R-N-EXP, which are the main examples. So just keep in mind that in a hardy field, we have the usual comparison behavior at the limit at infinity of the usual functions. This can be This can be expressed in terms of evaluation, in particular the natural evaluation, which is the one with evaluation ring the convex hull of the rationals. This consists of the Archimedean equivalence classes of the field. The residual field is always Archimedean, and an important invariant will be the rank, which is the Archimedean. The Archimedean equivalence classes of the value group itself. And you can also use in an equivalent way the language of dominance relation as defined by Hardy himself in order to describe the growth rate of free functions. The important properties of hardy field that made them very interesting also is the fact that they are very robust through several extension process. So you can give a hardy feel, you can pass to the real closure, but you can also pass to the real powers of the member of the The germs in the field, you will still have a hardy field. More generally, you might add many solutions of differential equation, but not all of them. Of course, you cannot add sine and cosine, for instance, which are order two solutions, or the two linear differential equations. But you can But you can take the integral, you can take the logarithmic integral. This leads to the notion of UV closure. And of course, this means that you can add an exponential always in a Hardy field. Exponential and logarithm, I mean a total exponential. Sorry. As I just said, in an order two context, you have to be careful, but there are also results, and especially very recent results on higher order differential equations. I will come back to this later with the differential intermediate value property. I will talk about this later. Later. There are also other ways to have extended Hardy fields, as I said, with ominum expansions and some important examples. More recently, in the context of Hilbert 16 problems, Patrick Spiceger and other Tobias Kaiser. Tobias Kaiser, have obtained quasi-analytic Ilyashenko algebras and showed that they provide, well, they in fact provide new hardy fields. Other interesting example is a trans-exponential one, which has been given by Boscher-Nitson. And I will say a bit. And I will say a bit more about that. This trans-exponential function appears in the context of what is called maximal hardy fields, namely hardy fields that have no proper hardy field extensions. Well, I've been talking about the derivation. The important topic here is that the derivation. Is that the derivation of real functions in a Hardy field interacts a lot with the valuation, the natural valuation? So, this can be summarized with this notion that we called RD type derivation, or Rosenlisch speaked about differential valuation. Important one is the L'Hopital's rule. L'Hopital's rule, which expresses, well, it's a strong version of L'Hopital's rule, which says that derivation preserves valuation as soon as you are not asymptotic to the constants. And there is also an important property concerning the logarithmic derivative that encodes the rank of the valuation. Of the evaluation, so the values of the logarithmic derivatives. Matthias and Lao axiomatize the notion of H field, which is connect, well, which connects the valuation, but also the ordering on the field to the derivation. We'll also come to this a bit later. To this a bit later. So, as I mentioned, the valuative properties are important because they help you to view the elements in hardy fields in terms of asymptotic expansions a la point caré. This is very vague because you might have difficulties in expanding. Have difficulties in expanding things with many orders of growth. It be well, expansions of expansions of expansions, nested expansions. Well, this has to be clarified. So in order to clarify, you might use different notions of rank, not only the valuative rank, there is also a notion of exponential rank. Also, a notion of exponential rank and a finer one, which is the notion of levels, which I won't define but help to, for instance, have a precise notion of principal part, which encodes properties of the germs in an exponential hardy field. The link between exponential and Link between exponential and differential. Of course, as I said right away, both have to be compatible. This is the definition, so to say, of the exponential in a differential context. But we might be interested in stronger, I would say, analytic properties, even if they are not precise. Not precise, namely strong morphism in the sense that the exponential of a formal sum, you might want it to be a formal product and vice versa with the log. This is connected with the topic of composition, which is important in the Hardy field, since, for instance, the Hardy field of a nominal structure is closed under composition. Now, let me switch to the generalized series context. In this case, well, generalized power series are by definition, and this definition goes back to Han, are well, functions from an order Debelian group to a field.  Because it's just taking the minimum of the support of your formal power series. The exponent will be the value of your evaluation. What we call the leading exponent. As before, the ring. As before, the rank of the valuation here is the rank of the value group. These objects are fundamental in commutative algebra since they provide us with a universal domain for valued fields unconditionally in characteristic zero with some conditions in positive characteristic. So, in this context, in order to deal with exponential and with derivation, we have to define what we want as a derivation in this context. So, the point of view we had with Salma, but that is generally taken, is to have a derivation which is compatible at each level. Compatible at each level. So you want a derivation at the level of series which is well behaved with respect to the summation, even if it's a formal summation that commutes with this big sigma. At the level of the value group, well, the value group is isomorphic to the monomials. Well, you want the derivative of a monomial to behave. Yeah, yeah, that's really okay. Miguel, can you hear us? Okay, so there's been a few issues, technological issues. For a while, you completely froze, and this was all on our side, so we couldn't see a few of the slides that you were presenting, unfortunately. Sorry, I could not hear very well what you said. Yeah, we've had a few problems with the technology. Problems with the technology with the Zoom on our side, so that means that we couldn't see you for a while. I think we've missed five of your slides. Oh, okay. Let me go back. I'm now going back. Can you see what I'm doing? So, this way this one we saw. This one we saw. The last one now. Yes. Yes. So I should. Yes. So I should start here now? Yes. Yeah, sorry. Okay, sorry for that. Yes, I see that there are some messages in the chat that I could not read them right away. Oh, yes. The minimality of RNX is due to van de Dries and Chris Miller. Sure. Sorry for that. I was. Okay. Was okay. Uh, so concerning generalized power series, so I was just introducing what is a generalized series by definition from Hahn, 1907. It's a function from a value, another Labelian group that we will call the exponents of the series to the coefficients that are here. That are here taken to be the reels. The reels, the support has to be well ordered in order for this to be a field. So the usual notation is to denote this function as a sum, a formal sum of the a gamma t to the gamma. And which could be construed as a sort of hyper-asymptotic expansion, but with no restriction. So, the natural valuation here is just defined as the minimum of the support of the series, the leading exponent. And this in this this in this context then gamma is of course the value group and the rank is the well the rank of the group ordered abelian group gamma these objects are fundamental in commutative algebra since they provide us with a universal domain for valued fields unconditionally in character six zero so in particular Stage is zero, so in particular, in this context of ordered field. We might be interested in order to stick to this, well, to have an exponential, we might be interested also to have a derivation. So, the process I want to present is sort of heuristic principle that That a well-behaved derivation, well, what can we expect for a series with respect to the series structure for a derivation? We want it to commute with sums. Here, we will allow it to commute with infinite sums, transfinite sums. At the level of the monomials, which are elements of the field of series, we also Field of series. We also want the derivation to follow a nature rule. So a generalization of the Leibniz rule. So this is a bit less obvious, but this generalizes the Leibniz rule. On the left side, I naturally wrote T to the gamma as a transfinite product using Hahn embedding theorem. Using Hahn embedding theorem. This is also a way to view another Rabelian group. And this helps us to go back to, let's say, the fundamental level of the rank. If you take the good hypothesis on the rank for the derivation, you might have a formal derivative that works well. Derivative that works well in an analytic sense. If we want to have exponentiation, we would like an exponential also to behave well, in particular with respect to this formal power series structure. So a power series always splits nature. Always split naturally into what we call its purely infinite part. Oh, sorry for that. Don't write very well. Well, purely infinite, constant, and infinitesimal. So, this one less than one. And we want. And we want the exponential to respect this splitting by sending purely infinite to monomials, constants to constants, and infinitesimal to units. Okay, so for the bounded part, let's say constant plus infinitesimals, it works always just by using. Just by using the usual analytic formulas. This is a consequence of Neumann's lemma for the summability to works in full generality. But what can we do now in order to get a formula for the purely infinite part? Well, it was a it's a It's a fact from the paper of Kuhlmann, Kuhlmann, Scheller in 1997 that it's not possible to have such an isomorphism. Hence, none of the generalized power series field can be made to be an exponential field. So, what can we do? Well, none of them can be, but there might be subfields. But there might be subfields of extended power series field that may be an exponential field. This was an idea originated from Dan and Guring and which has been exploited in different ways. So under the name of X block series or kappa bounded series by Salma and others. In the terms of logarithmico exponential series by Algorithmico-exponential series by Andreas McIntyre marker, and trans series in a more analytic context by Ecal and the Hovan. Well, I won't explain all of them, but I just want to give a flavor of that. So this exponential way to get, well, this way to get an exponential series field is two. Is a two-step procedure. On one hand, you might want to get filled with a pre-logarithm, namely a logarithm which is not a full logarithm. This can be done, for instance, by if you have a derivation, by taking an integral, the integral of the logarithm. The integral of the logarithmic derivatives. This is possible if you have a situation where you have asymptotic integration and by repeated asymptotic integration using a neurotranetric fixed point theorem, you might get finally a logarithm for elements in the field. But the problem is that you won't be able to get full. You won't be able to get full logarithm for everybody. There are special elements that you cannot integrate always. For this, you will need to go to some extensions of your field, what we call exponential extensions. The archetype of this extension is to, for instance, you start with a power. A power series field at the base level, take an embedding of the monomials into the purely infinite, and then well, you complete, you extend your group of monomials by an isomorphic copy of this image on the right. Of this image on the right. Isomorphic as an order multiplicative group. You just consider the reduct on the additive reduct on the right. And then do it again. By doing this, you will get an inductive procedure. And by passing to the limit, this provides you with a full With a full exponential field, well, a total logarithm which has an inverse, which is an exponential. Now we have this picture with on one side exponential hardy fields, on the other side, differential exponential subfield of series. So the question. Question might be how far these formal objects are really formal counterparts of the functional objects. For instance, it has been proven by Andreis McIntyre Marker that the field, the Hardy field of RNEXP, embeds as an ordered differential field into Exponential field into, well, I wrote capital T. At that time, it was called the logarithmic exponential series field, but now I think that everybody agrees to call it trans series, the field of trans-series. However, we have a much bigger field which helps us to encompass. Help us to encompass all of these, well, the both classes of structures, both classes of objects. This is what is called the survey numbers. Well, the definition goes back to Conway in the context of combinatorial games. Sorry numbers have been. The surreal numbers have been well defined in, you can define them in three equivalent ways. This gives a powerful way of understanding all this. So there will be talks on this during the week. So just in a few words, the first way, as the word defined, is a very Fundamental way, a procedure alla the kin Feinuman, encompassing at the same time the construction of the reals, but also the construction of ordinal numbers. So, right away, we can say that serving numbers are not even a set, but a proper class, that absolutely huge. Absolutely huge. But still, they will consist of a field, and even better than that, a real closed exponential field. Well, I will say more of this. Gonshore gave another definition just by considering another way of construing them, which was already given in Conway. Even in Conway, has a full binary tree with ordinal number length. So you can translate this into a well-ordered sequence of two signs. Here I denote it by plus and minus these signs, which corresponds to a sort of dyadic expansion of number. But here you will have numbers. But here you will have numbers that are, as I just said, that might be real numbers, but also infinitely large and infinitesimals in any growth rate. And the third way to construe these numbers, which can also be said to be functions, is to view them as generalized series. Generalized series, but here you have to be careful that these are generalized power series with real coefficients, but with exponents that are themselves surreal numbers. So the only restriction is to have a support that is an ordinal. So in this sense, this is a sense, this corresponds to what I called without explaining before kappa bounded series field. And this explains, well, explains, I mean, believe me, this shows that you can get a full exponential on this field. Feel like you, like Kuhlman and Shellag got on their kappa-bounded series fields. As analytic exponential fields, there have been results from several authors, in particular. Andreas Erlich and Eliot Kaplan that, well, I tried to put them all together under one statement that serving numbers with this Gonshar exponential is an elementary extension of the field of race with the exponential. And moreover, NO is what I wrote. Is what I wrote to be a canonical monster model. What I meant by that is to say, of course, it's a monster model because it's kappa saturated for any kappa, any cardinal kappa. But you can also view the well, you can embed any exponential real, well, any model of the real exponential field. Real exponential field in an initial way, whatever that means, in also in a canonical way. This is important. So in a truncation close way, it's in a sense. Maybe Elliot Kaplan will talk about this during his talk. Just roughly speaking, there is a same kind of statement for the theory. Of the statement for the theory of RNX. So, this is for the analytic exponential fields. So, what do I mean by analytic in this sense? As I said, is in the sense of Norman Alling, that you can take with Neumann's lemma the formula for exponential or analytic, bounded analytic functions. You can interpret them. Interpret them on the infinitesimals. So, in particular, any exponential Hardy field or any differential exponential Surfitoff series, which is a model of Rx will embed in this field of serving numbers. We in pushed We pushed recently with Alessandro Berarducci, Vincenzo Mantora, and Salma Kuhlman. We investigated a bit further the structure of surreal numbers with what is called an omega map. Omega map is a well, it has connection with the exponential, but I won't be able But I won't be able to explain this in two sentences. Just keep in mind that an omega map, which exists on several numbers, is an isomorphism of the field itself, well, the reduct, additive reduct of the field, with the multiplicative reduct of the field. And this is well, this exists, I'm sorry, number. Well, this exists on several numbers, but we also prove that you might find examples of this in the context of kappa-bounded series and also the field of trans series that's been proven recently by Berarducci and Fremi. To be, well, investigation to be continued. Now, as order-value differential fields, the Well, there have been important results by Matthias, Lau, and Joris. First of all, on the model theory of the Tron series. Well, just trying again to give a quick summary that, well, the theory of the trans-series model complete. The trans-series model complete, and it's the theory of what is called the H-closed fields. H-close for H-fields. And in particular, NO, the cereal numbers endowed, I should have wrote it, endowed with the Berarducci-Mantova derivation is a model of Is a model of the theory of the trans series in this differential-valued ordered field language. In particular, this says that you can embed any RD field into several numbers as order value differential fields. More recently, they studied Studied what is called maximal hardy fields. So I said again that these are hard effects that have no proper hard difficult extensions. They were introduced by Baucher-Nitzon, and in a very recent preprint, they proved that maximal Hardy fields are also models of the theory of T. Theory of t and the key property that's been proven is this differential intermediate value property. Well, this is not the way things are directly proven, but it's equivalent to the main, the key properties verified by this field that here p is meant to be a differential polynomial. differential polynomial so a polynomial in y y prime y double prime and so on that you can evaluate in any well in in a hardy field if you find two elements a and b such that p is that there is a change of sign A change of sign, but then you might find a C in between A and B, but in an extension of the Audi field you are working with, which is a root of your differential polynomial. So, whenever you take a maximal Hardy field, well, you will find this root already in it. This is a This is a well, no, this is a key property of maximal artifacts, which make them well, since the model theory is model complete, they are all elementary equivalent, the one to the other, even if they are non-isomorphic. I would say just non-compatible as Hardy fields. Well, I think I still have some minutes, so I will just finish by introducing some questions to my knowledge that are open and that might be addressed in some of the In some of the talks, things anyway that some participants are working on. So, now that we have a good knowledge on the model theory of real exponential fields, on differential non-Arcumian fields, an important question is to understand what are the What are the good properties of the model theory of differential exponential fields, which here is illustrated by T, by NO, and all the other fields I've been talking about. Another important question is to understand what is the situation with a trans-exponential function because it function because it exists in any, for instance, in any maximal hardy field, you have a trans-exponential function. So this is a function that grows faster than any iterative exponential. This, well, it is still open to know if there is any o-minimal structure which is non-exponentially bounded. There have been There have been several formal constructions recently under the name of hyperseries by Bacayoko and van der Hoven, or some model theoretic studies by Adele and Paget and Salma and Sebastian Kopp. I well, we are working also on giving a precise Giving a precise version of what we call differential Kaplansky embedding theorem for Hardyfield. So, this is more on the differential level. Kaplansky embedding was the result I cited at the very beginning, this universality of generalized power series. Do we have a precise version of 54? Differential valued fields. There is also a question: like, are there Hardy Omega fields? So, Hardy fields with this omega map property? This is to be studied, and of course, the problem. Of course, the problem of endowing serene numbers with a compatible composition, compatible derivation. I didn't say it before, but we Arducci and Mantova defined a partial composition function, which has been extended in a certain direction by Bakayoko and van der Hoeven in this hyper. In this hyperseries flavor work. But so still, we are missing a global composition for certain numbers, as far as I know, and which would be compatible with well-behaved derivation and to give well maybe this will help to understand better the transponate. Better the trans-exponential structure at this very abstract and well, not abstract, very general level. Voila, this was so. I will stop here. Thank you for your attention. And if you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer. Any questions for the speaker? Here, Francois? No, I cannot hear. Sorry, could you repeat, please? Just my ignorance, but I was asking whether you could say a little more about this omega path. Ah, okay, so. So yes, an omega map by definition is just such an isomorphism of a field in the field itself. So the way, well, in surreal numbers, the way it's defined is to Put isomorphism onto the value group. Yes, wait a second. I'm afraid to be a bit confused what I wrote here. Yes, well, the omega map. Well, the omega map by definition in certain numbers is to send the let me go back to the what I introduced here. So the notation here, I was a bit cheating that the notation for several numbers is the following one: that you use R alpha. R alpha omega to A alpha. Omega here is really meant to be the ordinal omega at the level of at his so a generalization of omega exponentiation in the ordinance. But the way Conway defined it, in fact, gives you encodes you the Encodes you the Archimedean equivalence classes of the surreal numbers. So the way you obtain this kind of expansion with omega is just as you do an Poincaré asymptotic expansion. You say that A at the first step is equivalent to R0 omega to some alpha zero. Zero. And then you say, okay, at the next step, you take the following one, and you say this one is equivalent to R1 omega A1 and so on. But I mean, and so on, you can do it transfinitely many times. This will always give you a surreal number. And this is a Real number, and this is a theorem here is just to say that this asymptotic expansion will end at some ordinal length. You cannot go to the whole ordinal class. So, well, this is a way you have an omega. This is a way you have an omega map here. So the omega map is just the value, well, multiplicative version of the valuation, the natural valuation. But as you, well, as you guess in this very saturated structure like the serving numbers, the first exponent that you have here is itself Is itself a sorry number, then the map that sends well you can write it like this alpha zero No A zero, sorry, why did I put? Why did I put an alpha? Is a map from well, here, from the field to the field. Well, if you use omega, omega is multiplicative, so this is why you have a morphism from the additive. Have a morphism from the additive structure on the left. So instead of plugging of sending A to A zero, you will send well. Sorry for that. You will encode these values of the natural evaluation by taking. Evaluation by taking well powers of some O A0 and this map which sends NO plus order two NO multiplicatively, or in fact, it's not NO itself here, it's omega to NO. Omega to NO times the order Well, and this is how the omega. How the omega map works here. But this is isomorphic to NO multiplicatively. Okay. I hope this clarifies a bit what happens on the NO at the several numbers level, even if it's not Francoise? Okay, that's yes. Just to give a quick hint. So Give a quick hint. So, in order to do the same thing on kappa-bounded series, you might do a bit of what I explained before: the same kind of procedure here that you do for the exponential extension. You just twist it, and instead of taking here an embedding into the purely infinite, you take an embedding into the field. Well, the Field, well, the reduct, the additive reduct of the field, and you do this inductive limit procedure omega times, you will get an omega map, sorry, for this double omega. This is idea how we built on certain specific kappa-bounded series fields, an omega map. So, not all the kappa-bounded series are. All the Gappa bound series are omega fields. They have to verify specific properties, a sort of saturation property, like exponential fields. And we investigate the connection between those that are omega fields and the sort of exponential you might have connected to this, like in Gonshore, well, Conway Gonshow. Like in Conway-Gonshore construction, you have connections between this omega map and the exponential, Gonshore exponential map. So maybe I can add an explanation to this. So the formal definition of non-Archimedean-ordered field that is an omega field is a field where the additive reducts, which is a group that. Which is a group, the additive reduct of the field is all the Lebanon group, should be isomorphic to the value group. Now, in general, if you just have exponentiation alone, what you get from exponentiation for free, well, after some considerations, is that the additive reduct of the ring of purely infinite elements. Infinite elements, so that's a sub-ring of the field, is isomorphic to the value. So, for every exponential field, you already have that the ring, the additive reduct of the ring of purely integrated elements is isomorphic to the ordered abelian group written additively, which is the value group. But for omega field, we ask for more. We ask that the whole additive be done of the field. So, that means. So that means the additive reduct of the purely infinite, the ring of purely infinite, direct sum with the additive reduct of the valuation rate, that this whole bunch is isomorphic to the value. And that's a phenomenon that doesn't occur automatically out of exponentiation, but does occur typically in fields that admit more than just exponentiation, such as the prototype. Well, such as the prototype being the filter, sorry, not any last questions. So, you talked about quality fields that are omega shields. There are no nodes. No, well, it's just meant to be a question. It's not meant to be an assertion. An assertion. So I don't know. There might be one. I think it's pretty believable that maximal Hardy field could be construed as omega fields. But this is just a guess on my part. Can I say something here? Can anybody hear me? Yes. The answer to the question that you raised is yes, there are fighting fields. There are height fields which are omega fields in your sense, at least if you assume the continuum hypothesis, because Ashenbrenner, Vandengriesen, and Vandenhoe recently showed that assuming the continuum hypothesis, all maximal Hardy fields are isomorphic to the, as exponential order fields, they're isomorphic to the initial subfield of the Subfield of the surreals up to the all countable levels. And back in 2001, Lau and I showed that if you take the initial subfield less than any epsilon number, that is an omega field in your sense. When you're dealing with initial subfields of the surreals, an easy way of capturing the idea of an omega field is that x is in the field if and only if omega to the x is in the field. Field, if and only if omega through the x is in the field. As I say, Lau and I showed back in 2001, that's true for every initial subfield, where you consisting of all of these surreals having tree ranks less than a given epsilon number. And since for every uncountable cardinal, those are epsilon numbers, the result you want holds at least for, as I say, assuming the continuum hypothesis. Okay, well, let's thank Miguel Sissies again. Thank you. Now we have a coffee break, we'll receive top break. Thank you very much again. Thanks to you. Have a good conference workshop. Enjoy. Conference workshop. Enjoy. Thank you.
