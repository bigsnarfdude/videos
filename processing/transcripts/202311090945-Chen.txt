So Kuran Institute, who will talk about functional inequalities related to similarity information in incompressible products. Thanks. Personal purpose for the organizer to invite me to the panel. It's my first time here and also like done a lot of geometry and units. So today I will talk about my recent job with Trumphao or something related to synthetic formation of PGR. So here is the So here is the recorded video on combustible water equation and first thanks how we basically lay down many foundation for this talk. So u is the velocity and where p is the pressure, where this is the free condition. And we can consider the vorticity formulation. It appears also many times in this workshop. And vorticity is a great, the curve of the velocity. And then on the right side, we have this so-called vortex structure turn. And given the Water structure term. And given the votes three omega, we can recover the velocity by this Vias of a law. The domain we consider is simply connected domain, so there's no issue about this promoting this swirl. And the major problem, one of the major problems for feed order equation is to prove local well-positors or final blow-up for smooth energy data. And now the more evidence is like layer on this direction. It can blow up for smooth data. And the celebrated Biakadomaeda critique states that the solution blows up in this sense. States that the solution broke up in this sense, that the autisticity of V normal broke up. What is the criteria? And there's some important progress. I should say that there are many recent progress on singularity formation of $3, and basically it has been inspired by this Howard scenario. It suggests that the $3 equation can go. I give more details to talk about this scenario because it's something we are trying to study. So, Toward and Golo, they do this simulation. Townham Golo, they do this simulation in this domain, and they consider a solution with this as a symmetry. So, this is a symmetry, let me say you have both getting this symmetry. And in addition to that, they further consider the solution have this refraction symmetry with respect to these z bow zero plane. And then for the data, they consider the data is the vorticity is odd, the angle of vorticity is odd, and then the sword is angular velocity is rotating, the upper half is in this direction, and the lower half is in another direction. And the lower half is another direction. And then, if you think about the cross-section of this cylinder, then this is a cross-section, if you cut this cylinder, and then what you find is that the flow along the boundary will first move down along the boundary and then move away toward the origin. So, then due to the symmetry, you create this hyperbolic structure near the boundary. And then, what they have reported is that the singularity occurs at this cross-section between this boundary and this symmetry plane. This is the singularity they report. Then default. And later on, there's some quite important progress of signal formation for Fidel. And already how we mentioned this result by Al Guindi and for the C1 L bar velocity. So this is slightly better than the still the strong solution is better than C1. And we dropped some methods by Auguindi and proved that the Boussenay and Final equation with Steven Lafayette velocity can blow up with small boundary. And there this result can be seen as a Steven Alpha version. Can be seen as a steven-alpha version of our previous hours in Nevada. And then one by Harvey and Barmaster, they construct this approximate block profile for Pusenek mentioned in his last talk. So here she emphasized that this is the progress move. Something is different from the result. And recently with Tom, we proved that using a complete system and many analysis tool to justify this how well scenario with smooth data and boundary. And in the last And bounding. And in the last two or three months, there also a lot of advances in this singular formation of Silver Euler equation, including two papers by Kodobaum, Montenegro, Sola, and Sun. And this gives another proof of Silver blow-up of V-Euler. And later they can see the force of E-Euler. And by introducing a force, they can do this blow-up with a better regularity. And there's some other results. Due to time constraint, I will not. I do time constraint, I will not have time to talk about that. So, here the talk will focus on the smooth data. So, I should emphasize some discussion difficulties for smooth data. First of all, there's the locality for the velocity. So, this part depends on the vorticity and the local way. And in addition to that, there's a competing effect. There's something is not that obvious. These effects have been the This effect has been the one when we try to use this water extraction term, this looks like omega squared that can generate the blow-up. However, this advection term has some amazing recognization effect. So if you want to prove blow-up, then you want to find some scenario that can kill to minimize the effect of this abduction term. And this effect has been studied earlier by Constantine in 1986 and also in more details by Howley and Haulei. And so far, the only normal. So far, the only known mechanism to weaken this advection turn in the case of smooth data is at the boundary. So, in the boundary, that's quite easy to understand this mechanism. So, near the boundary, due to the low-flow boundary connection, maybe I can draw a picture. The flow is something like this. And near the boundary, the advanced turn basically is zero near the boundary because due to the boundary connection. However, the volume shift intern is all the one. So, there is the Order one. So there is basically the quantitative understanding about this mechanism. However, if you want to use this mechanism, you need to quantify this effect. Because away from the boundary interval, this part is the verbion time is not zero. So another difficulty is the zero-order single-rimming operator in this equation. So gradient U is given by the reach transform of vorticity. So this is a zero-order operator. And this difficulty is captured by some model problem in the fluid community. Model problem in the Fluorid communities, the so-called 2D concerning maxima. So, in this equation, this problem is proposed by Konstantin in 2012 and also by Kiselab raised as open problem. So, the problem is phrased as the following. So, suppose that you try to model the real Fourier equation. Omega is the scalar vorticity, looks like scalar vorticity, and on the right-hand side you have the water structure in terms that may make this part. And for Fourier equation that's most relevant, operator, this is 0k sums. Operator, this case some zero of operator is this rich transform. And this operator is related to the 2D Euler or 3D Busenek and even the IPM, the integral cross-median equation. And the last one is related to SQG. So this operator, both of them are zero order. And for this equation, it's still so far there's no proof of finite blowout of this equation from smooth data, but if you use computer system, then you can see more. Assistant, then you can see more. But without the middle system, so far this is still open. And there's an additional difficulty. Another difficulty is the multi-dimensional structure due to the incompressible flow. So in this, because the flow is incompressible, suppose I want to push all the velocity move toward the origin, that's impossible unless you have a TV flow. It must escape from another direction. So we have learned something from, already see something from Steve's talk. So for some equation, the first thing you want to do is to first look. The first thing you want to do is to first look at the impose some very good symmetry so that you reduce the problem. So, for compressible fluid and some geometric equation, you can assume radiosymmetric. And then, once you assume radiosymmetric, then the equation becomes 1D in some sense. But for incompressible flows, unless you think about some rough data, in general for smooth data, the flow is generic 2D. So, in the previous Stephen Lafayette Graph result, including Tau Rex to Excel and our result by Tom Howe. We started by with Tom Howe. The profile we studied something, this is a vorticity profile, but retain some polar coordinate. In some polar coordinate, this is a radial component and this is angular component. And the angle component is roughly this. It's some sine power, cosine power. And now, but this exponent is part of alpha. Now, if you send alpha to zero, that is, indeed, is did in this work, and then this angle proba is basically one. So somehow the By basic one. So somehow the profile roughly looks like one P, and this helps to simplify the analysis a lot. But for smooth data, we need to handle this differently. So this is the result I recently obtained with Tong Hao. So the equation already also appears in Howie's talk. This is the 2D Bolson equation. And there's a strong connection between 2D Bolson equation and the 3D assistiment equation in this single. Our equation is singular rank. So this is singularity, Rz, near this one, zero. So near this point. So what we managed to do is to justify this hollow scenario to construct a small initial data with finite energy, and this blob is close to some self-similar profile. So that is what we mean by nearly self-similar in finite term. And then uh to pass to Free De Orley equation we uh we indeed use the connection between 2D Boost and Free Deula equation. Booster and 3D Euler equation. So if you look at the 3D Euler equation and zoom into this localized to this point one zero into very small scale and then we rotate this picture a little bit, they obtain this 2D Business. So that is how we can study the Fourier equation. And the good thing about 2D Business is that in the upper space that the domain is scaling invariance. So you can have some scaling symmetry, but the Fourier equation is somehow you need to localize this setting locally. So that's something I relate to the class point. Related to the class question sometime two few days ago. So, for this, if you can construct this cells of blow-up and it's focusing weight, then by localizing the construction, the blow-up, you do not rely too much on the geometry. So, in locally, it's basically flat. But the only difference is that we need a boundary, and we somehow need to, the domain should be have some reflection symmetry with respect to this symmetric plane. Okay, so but due to the time constraint, I only Okay, so but due to time constraint, I'll only talk about some outline, some ideas and efforts, and we'll focus on specific aspects too in this whole proof. So here I write down the equation in a more compact way. So n is some non-linear operator, this quadratic. This is, we can write a Free Daudley equation or the 2D Business equation in this compact way. And the idea is now in this Selsum approach is to show that the vorticity, which must blow up in finite terms, can be decomposed into the Finite term can be decomposed into the amplitude and the profile. The first part, this amplitude will grow up as little t converted to capital T. And in the profile, there are two parts. The first part is omega bar, which can be seen as the approximate block profile. It's the main part. And the second part is the perturbation, omega. And the idea is now to show that if you do not have this perturbation, then this will be a self-ima solution, a self-ma block solution. Now, but we do not have the exact self-male. But we do not have the exact self-semisolution, so that's why we need to have a small perturbation. And the idea is to show this perturbation remains small compared to the main part up to the bottom. So this is the answer to run this self-semal argument. And the reason why we try to attack, use this approach is basically inspired by early remote evidence obtained by Hao Ro and Liu. This is before I was the starmatist at Caltech. So then what Caltech. So then what they report is that in their 2014 paper, they report that the block flow the solutions of potential is locally source and so that's captured this answer captured this structure. And secondly, Lil, so Lil is a Townhouse former student, it showed that the block profile is stable. It performs some Linux computation to try to compute a spectrum of a Linux operator, but you need to use some places. And what he found is that there's some spectral gaps from this operator. From the soft label. So that's why we try to outline base our approach will be based on this remote evidence. But we need to adjust it. So the approach consists of several steps. The first step is construct approximate block profile. So the approach we use is somehow different from how we use the approach based on the physical info neural network. What we use is like from a point of view, the point of view is like more classical. It's based on how More classical. It's based on a high-order Fara-American scheme. And what we use is like piece-wise polynomial to construct the basis to approximate the block profile. And we have to first try to test this idea on some model problem. This includes the Gregarloh model and the Hau-Roh model, in John, Tom Howe, and Zhou Hong in 2019 and 21st. And then the second step is to do a rigorous stability analysis of the profile. So we perform analysis in So, we perform analysis in the Stella Simmer equation. So, here we can derive the equation instead of an original physical equation, we can derive the equation of the profile using the Stellar Semmel transform. And then we linearize the equation in the Stellar Semer equation around this profile, this profile omega, and this block exponent. And then we obtain the linearized operator. And for a linearized operator, because this equation is local, we're going to decompose the linearized operator into some local part, this part. Part, this part capture more singular term involving greater u, and this some like a more regular part L U. It can be seen as something like compact. And then the first step is to understand why it's stable. To get the stable, we need to perform some energy estimate, and we need to understand this where the stable stability comes from. And that is basically comes from the local part of this Linux operator. And we perform this estimate using some weighted infinity and sigma power. Using some weighted infinity and single-power estimates with some single weights. And this type of a chance for estimate allows us to close this estimate with a lower, lot of higher logarithm of the estimate. And that's quite important because if you perform higher estimate, then you need to construct profile that's more likely. And then the later part is that we want to show, argue that this novel file some file can be cheated at perturbation to these damping terms. So for the most single novel. So for the most single and noble term, what we find is that for this gradient of view, we can derive some sharp hold estimate based on optical transport. And then we can argue that for this part, gradient of u, it can be indeed cheat as perturbation to this damping term. Now, however, for the remaining part, this molecular part is LU, involving a molecular part. We cannot argue that you do not have enough room to kill this term, this term. So if a former final developer LU, So, if a former final developer unfinished based final perturbation to estimate this more regularly. So, in some sense, this approach will handle this more regular part, and then we can combine this to obtain this linear stability. And for the linear stability, this is somehow, in some sense, more standard. It's based on a Bullshit argument. And in the whole approach, due to the difficulties I mentioned in the previous slide, we need to use a computer system for the profile. In some sense, In some sense, it's hard to construct a profile specifically. But if you want to use more details about a profile, then you need to construct it mnemonically. And to justify this, I will use quantum mnemonic analysis, analytical ideas, of course, interval formatic to justify this mnemonics. And for this workshop and for the audience, I will talk about focus on this point C, which is more related to this workshop, because it basically has something to do with optimal transport. Transform. Okay, so one of the difficulty I mentioned in the earlier slide is that to estimate the local term in an effective way. So this Lundlocal term is given by weight and u is a zero-order SIO. And from harmonic analysis, we know that this operator has some short estimate. It's bounded in C alpha space and bounded in L P space. However, in recent years, so experts actually try very hard to understand this operator in a more quantitative way. This operator in a more quantitative way. So, the first important estimate is obtained by Keys and Swabler in 2014. They obtained this so-called key lemma for the decomposition of the velocity. For the velocity, they can show that they can decompose into this main part and this lower turn. And for 2D order, we know that the vorticity is transported, so it's bounded A priority. So, this L turn is bounded A priority. But now, for the main turn, it somehow is very Main term is somehow very integrable. So, for this turn, it's somehow logarithm bigger than this term. And based on this important lemma, they managed to prove that the gradient of vorticity can grow double exponential fast. So, for 2D Euler equation, this is fastest possible growth rate for this quantity. And the important thing is that they need to use the boundary. And this boundary is actually inspired by the computation of Hao and Wong. And this results suggest that if you This result suggests that if you make this equation slightly more singular, then you can construct a blower. And this is proved rigorously by Kisel Richard Yards-Routers. They studied a modified SQG patch equation with boundary. The same, you need a boundary. And here you make this BS of law relation more singular. Beta is bigger than zero, so this is more singular than to the order. And this ratus pushed this exponent to one-fourth. But he also showed that if you push. this but he also showed that if you push beyond one fourth the equation becomes impulse so this is the in this story but one fourth is still uh cannot reach sqg the solution is like still like one fourth away the sqg so there's there's another important estimate obtained by tara or gindi we also use this estimate in our work and it showed that the gradient of view can be decomposed into two parts this is the main part he font and this is the error turn the error turn has size Error turn. The error term has size all to one relative to the vorticity. And now you see that if alpha is very small, then this part becomes the main term because this is have size one over alpha, which alpha goes to infinity. But however, if you want to study this equation for smooth data, we cannot use this because alpha will be roughly only one. And in that setting, these two terms are balanced, and we can argue that this term is small compared to this mid term. So we are here outline. So we are here, outline in the previous slide, we want to argue that to estimate this local term, we decompose greater du as the seismic profile part and some this like the main turn and we try to argue that this part is small compared to the main part. That's the related stability and that's a we want to obtain a sharp estimate for this more regular part for the perturbation. And this upload if you write down more And this DSA block, if you write down more carefully in 2D, this PSA block, they have this integral representation. So this is a re-transform associated with this kernel. This kernel has some nice symmetry. So what we have finally estimated for this operator is the following. So we can localize this kernel, this convolution kernel, we can localize it with this size, window size A and B. And for this kernel, we can obtain the For this kernel, we can obtain a sharp estimate, the hold estimate. So L infinity across C1 half weighted estimates is the estimate we use to study stability. So in the top world, this will be a C1 half estimate. And somehow the most important estimate is in the horizontal direction. And for this estimate, we can obtain, after localizing, we can obtain this uniform estimate by this constant C1. And this T1 is given by a specific formula. And once we Formula. And once we localize this kernel, and for given x and z, these two points, you need to estimate the difference between these two points. But if this distance becomes larger, then this value, this estimate actually increases. So if x and z, they're far apart, we actually have that estimate for the holder estimate. And we can also derive a similar estimate for other components, for other part of the gradient of velocity, and obtain hold estimate y. Velocity and obtain a whole estimate y direction. And combining x and y direction, we can recover the whole zero and half estimate. Or principal value? Principal value, yes. Because it's zero order, so you cannot, it's locally integral. And we can generalize this estimate to the weighted order estimate. We call that our estimate is based on the weighted type estimate. So to generalize this estimate to the weighted version, we use the fact that We use the fact that the commutator between the Lamoco operator and the weight is more like a up to some more regular part we can generalize this estimate. And for a more regular part, we use the L-infinite base vanilla validation to handle the molecular part. But I will not talk about that in this talk. So we found a quite important connection between this hold estimate with optimal transport. For this horizontal hold estimate, due to this convolution corner, it's satisfied. Convolution corner is satisfied by scaling symmetry and translation symmetry. So we're going to assume without loss of generatic in our estimate of this difference. We just assume that x and z, this is given by this two point. And then the whole estimate is basically to estimate this integral in terms of the holder estimate long. And this integral, this kernel k is given explicitly associated with the kernel and will satisfy this mean zero condition. And to see the connection between And to see the connection between this hold estimate and optimal transport, so here I'd focus on a simpler model. So K, instead of this complicated kernel, this K is just given by for derived mass. And this derived mass, in this setting, in this model problem, you can write down this estimate very easily. And the best estimate you can do, you do not have too much choice, is just given by this estimate. And they bound it by the Holosimalum F. And while we found another understanding about this estimate, so all this About this estimate. So, what this estimate really do is to move the mass from this point 2 to 3 and from 1 to 4. And for each unit, you move this point, you take this cost function associated with the holder summer law. This x minus 1, 1 half times this norm. And more generally, you can reframe this holder estimate as the optimal transport problem. So, the idea is that you perform the estimate of this integral. The idea is you just want to find a map t. You just want to find a map T to move the mass from this positive region to a negative region. So, this colour k is going to associate the rich transform. And for each unit you move, you pay this cost function. It's given by x minus one half times this quantity. And this method, the idea of using optimal transport to prove some sharp function inequalities, actually has been developed quite rapidly in the last 20 years. And a very good task for it is the Bernardi-Lohn effect. The very good test book is the Bernardi Loha Very Good Testbook for graduate students in 2012, 20 years ago. And also I talk about some ideas about optimal transport. So now the idea is that now the problem is due to in order to obtain a very good estimate about this holder estimate, then you only need to construct a map. That's associated with the kernel. And what we find is that for 1D, this problem can be basically solved quite explicitly. Solved quite explicitly. So here we assume that this kernel, we want to estimate this integral, and g is some arbitrary C of a function, and f is given explicitly. So here we assume that f is negative in A and C and positively in another region. Now to construct this map T, we basically just move the mass from the red point to here and the green part from here to here and the blue part from here to here. So it's a greedy algorithm. And the idea of Algorithm and the idea why this greedy algorithm makes sense is that if you look at this another model problem, if you want to move this two-point AB from AB to C D, then what you want, the best plan is that you move B to C and A to D. And this is the reason is that this map is concave. It's concave, then you have satisfied this inequality, which says that T must be decreasing, or this map is decreasing. And now you translate this plan to this equation for T, the T will satisfy this equation. Satisfy this equation. So, somehow you can, if f is given expressly, then you have the equation for t. So, the difference here is that the cost is concave, it's not convex. If the cost is convex, you want to construct an optimal transform map, then you need to solve a modern pair, a linear modern pair equation. But here is 1D, so in 1D, the life is much easier. So, here is an example. Again, this appears in Elvis' talk and Havi's talk. Now, we are trying to apply this to first to test this. To apply this to first to test this method on Hilbert transform is given by this convolution kernel. And for in this setting, the kernel can be written down explicitly. This k after you derive the difference, this case given explicitly, given by this quantity, it satisfies the mean zero connection. Now, if you solve the equation for this map t, then it's given by explicit by one of x. So now everything is explicit, and then you can plug in this map to compute the constant, and this gives you the constant logo. So if you can improve. You obtain. So, if you can improve this plan a little bit, then of course you can obtain better constants. But it seems that this is the optimal estimate you can obtain. So, that's why we said this is a sharp estimate, at least in 1D. And this map T is independent of the C alpha, the exponent alpha. For all alpha, you have the same map. And now we want to generalize this method to the rich transform. This is the object we care about. And now, the first step again, you need to first write. And now the first step again, you need to first write down the positive part of the cone and the negative part of the conode. And the conode, this connoisseur is single at two points, minus one half and one half, where the mass is basically concentrated near this two point. And if you localize to zoom into that point, it's basically the sign distribution is the 4, 4, minus, plus, plus, minus. So that's why then we just apply this transportation lemma in the horizontal direction because it's just flat near this in the Because it's just flat near this point, it's satisfied this perfect symmetry. We apply this transportation in the horizontal direction for each fixed s2 or y2. And then by gluing them together, by integrating them together, we can construct the whole map. And then we can obtain the constant. And by the way, so the map is, because this kernel has some nice symmetry, the map T is that it solves a cube equation. So we can obtain actually the explicit formula for this T. For this T. And it's quite important that we here we can see this horizontal derivation. So that is, if you consider general hold estimate for two points, X and C, then the difference in this colour will actually destroy this symmetry. So here, if you put these two points on the same line, then you have this nice symmetry, we can apply much better estimate. So the generalized to this holder localized holder estimate. Localized total estimate. So, recall that we can also localize this kernel. And then, for localized estimate, we have some nice homotonicity. So, the idea is that if you localize this kernel, the mass becomes smaller and the transportation distance becomes smaller. So, if you move the positive to negative, the positive regions become smaller, and for each point you move a shorter distance. So, you have a quite nice monotonicity formula for in this estimate, so that we can generalize this estimate. So, that we can generalize this estimate to the local evolution. We can obtain some point-wise estimate for that. So, let me summarize this talk. I only talk about one aspect in the whole proof. But in general, if you want to study the broad problem for the smooth data, this one needs to overcome a difficulty about this zero-order operator. And the approach we talk in this proof is to use the cells decomposed in the cell similar part and the perturbation. And for the perturbation, Perturbation and for the perturbation, we want to obtain a very good estimate for that. But now, the difficulty to attack this control this gradient U is that we need both to control the size of this quantity gradient U and more importantly to control the sign. So that give you the correct direction for growth. And there are other possibilities to explore. The one is to have a quantitative understanding about this quantity, beyond the shorter current sigma estimates. A shadow calorseman estimates, and maybe the optimal transfer can give you some more freedom and more tools. And there's all the possibilities based on self-improvement blow-up, and which are already outlined in how this talk. That's all I want to talk about. Thank you for our attention. Thank you very much for this very interesting talk in time. So we have time for questions. How much are you using symmetries on the operator? Symmetries on the operator. Suppose that I give you. I think for this equation, this symmetry is quite important. It's somehow justified that if it is a set symmetry is exactly this one, that means that the 1D plan, if you glue them together, is the best plan you can obtain. So that's why we do not need to construct 2D plan. Yes. Well, of course, if you can construct 2D plan, you'll get a better estimate. But this improvement in minor because due to the symmetry. But in general, let's say if I give you another operator that doesn't have If I give you another operator that doesn't have this, yeah, it doesn't have this, then maybe you need to construct this. Yeah, higher dimension map, yeah. But I think the observation is that holder estimates exactly translate to optimal transport level. If you think about the 1D example that you showed before, so for how general kernels could you do something similar, is this I think this for 1D is basically for all this kernel you can do something. All this kernel you can do to some SME. It's basically, but now if the sign is somewhat simpler, then it's captured by this lemma. But well, of course, one want to understand something like have more sign pattern, but well, they may be decomposed into several question. Oh, by the way, so this, because the cost is concave, so maybe it's easier than convex cost to construct the map. So so in 1D I perfectly understood the use of optimal transport and concave this is a concave cost and you construct by hand and in larger dimension you propose to project the lines yeah that depends on symmetry for example for if this the symmetry is satisfied in this case then this one needs to make a lot of sense but generally for that of course for higher dimensions In general, that of course for higher dimension is much more difficult. For higher dimension, what? So far, we do not have studied that problem, more general problem. But maybe you need to, the map may not be explicit, but maybe there's some remote method to control the map. But if the colon has some good fair good symmetry, then you expect that this the map will also have some symmetry and the map will expect that not that difficult. But of course, if a higher dimension, But of course if you're higher dimension there is the problem is much more difficult. Yeah, that depends on what kind of things we want to prove. Like for example, peer goal is to prove the problem actually stable blower. So we want to categorize the size of that concept. But that depends on our problem. But I think this side, the connection between optimum transport holder estimates. So, how important do you think the boundary is for getting all this to work? Well, it's crucial. Yeah, so that's I think there's a maybe other geometry can come into play in this to help to understand this block problem. And so far, if you do remote simulation, I'm not sure how we find something new, but if you use remote combination, then But if you use devicing combination, then what we have tried is that without boundary, the solution just like vanishes after some time. And also for all the SQG blowout, and there's also like you need a boundary. It's very crucial. And it's to like somehow to parallelize this point. It's crucial. Don't view the boundary as just a mirror and then just have like a reflection. Yeah, that's a good point. Yes, because the base of law for this velocity here is just given by this. For this velocity, here is just given by this minimal, plus and minus. So that's how you can derive this BSA law in 2D. And there's a solution will be, if you have a boundary, the solution near the boundary will be something like, it's indeed a mirror, but more importantly, the solution does not zero on the boundary. But if you look for the boundary, if you have a jump, then the solution must be smooth. So this is quite important. The solution can remain not zero. So then this part is size one, this part is zero. So there's a although this looks like quite trivial, but this is so far our only understanding about how can we dispatch for smooth data. So you can't view this as just to a domain without boundary or without boundary, if you want to have smooth data, then the solution must must vanish. Oh. Yeah, so then we will you cannot by then the the vel uh this uti velocity will push the flow will push the your motivation away. Push them. They will not see. Yeah, so people have searched for singularities in a way by looking at interacting vortex rings. Yeah, yeah. I'm wondering if one of the rings is following up on what you were saying could be acting as the boundary. Oh, yeah, that may be a good question. But I think this maybe this early work by forget that maybe a curl, they do the anti-water spray, they want to like hit them together. They want to like them together. There are all kinds of brain. Oh, yeah. And people try. Yeah, so far, it does not seem to work. Because now, in the case with our boundary, I think so far that still the best remote evidence that can obtain is obtained by Tom Howe two years ago, in the last two years. What he finds is that there's actually some remote evidence that the singularity can form near the essays. But that, so far, there's not too much theoretical understanding about the mechanism. Maybe there's something more. So maybe there's something more to understand. So is it is it easy to get uh raw rate just for uh dimensional analysis? No, no, no, this uh this does not depend determined by the uh uh dimensional analysis. So what you determine from the BROP is that the somehow the vorticity will give them by like one of the key minus T because you have the project and analogy, but now in the internal scale, so that this Bob scale, you don't know the But there's something also appearing in Howie stock. So you have some lambda in the blob rate. And well, maybe you expect that the ground state, even the ground state, you don't know that explicitly. But maybe there's an other family of the rate. So it's not determined equality. So how can we get it done? To solve the thousand equation using the your family devoted method. This is this is the thing that kind of replaces the ray scale. No, no, the the scaling is uh exponential is uh is fixed. I think this exponent is fixed. It will be fixed. It's a free parameter. It's a free parameter. So maybe there's a whole range of solutions. So you have one degree of freedom via that parameter. Which is good and bad. Well, the good thing is that maybe this exponent is some satisfies some actually that's something good. It satisfies some sort of exponent is that you can, if the order blow up, this one project is order blow up, then you can. One approach is all up blow up, they can show that for some exponent, they can cheat the Laura star as perturbation. For some exponent, the diffusion term will be asymptotic. But that's not my original idea, so I think I should say some natural idea we can, how to use the Euler block to study the strong blow. If this explodes, I think, below one half, then you have a chance to study no extra. But we can go on is a long coffee break until 11. As always, maybe you can solve the problem. Collaboration. Maybe just thank you. So what the thing that we have is to talk about something else in the project.
