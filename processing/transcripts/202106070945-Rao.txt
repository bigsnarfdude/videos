Well, thank you very much for the invitation to present at this workshop. I remember several of these workshops fondly, especially the one we had in Santa Fe, New Mexico, just about an hour from my house. So today I'll be talking about computational models and experimental studies of mold filling in thin channels with yield stress. Channels with heel stress. And this is work done primarily by my postdoc, Josh McConnell, at Sandia, and experimentalist Anne Grie. And we also have collaboration with the University of Utah, Vikash Day and Panya Newell, as well as Western Ortiz at the University of New Mexico. So I probably don't have to show this slide, but I always This slide, but I always think it's so exciting to kind of hear about where we see yield stress. We see them all over in food processing, in geological flows, in manufacturing, and everyday processes such as burning a candle. Primarily in this talk, I'll be studying carbapol, but the kind of general motivation for this work is to Motivation for this work is to use yield stress as a way of understanding manufacturing flows, especially when you get these transitions from fluid to solid, and a way of kind of initiating the computational mechanics of the solid when you're in the fluid session. So that's kind of the overview, but we've been focusing on trying to model these mold filling geometries. And so why is this needed? Well, we really want This needed? Well, we really want to have accurate predictions of surface profiles. What is a part shape in additive manufacturing, direct ink write, or welding? We'd like to understand accurate predictions of like spreading dynamics. Several years ago, we had a project looking at nuclear accidents, and this is called core on the floor. So the core melts and it produces this corium, which is a suspension of ceramic. Suspension of ceramic and liquid metal that will flow. And then just trying to understand those flows can help us mitigate against accidents. So in production codes, the current state of the art with solidification is just to kind of arbitrarily increase the viscosity and then set the velocity to zero or the shear it to zero in those areas. We really want to understand what's happening to the stress. What's happening to the stress state before we can birth a solid and call it the stress-free state? Because we know there are stresses in the solid, sorry, in the liquid that will affect the solid. Let's see. Seem to be quite stuck. Okay, ah, there, finally. So we have a kind of a mold filling geometry in a thin channel. And here you can see the actual geometry on the left. It's about six inches wide and about a quarter of an inch thick. And this is a nice geometry because it's a clear geometry. And with carbapole, we're able to add particles to do particle tracking. Particles to do particle tracking fellasimmetry and to be able to understand not only what the shape of the meniscus is, but also how the flow changes in different areas in the flow field. And so the top shows a neonian fluid. It's been injected from that center area, and we get this kind of triangular shape to the meniscus. To the meniscus. And then we also looked at three different types of carbapole at three concentrations. And we see the transition from this kind of triangular shape to a more mound-like shape. And we also can see that in the carbapole, we have regions where there is flow very near the just very near the inflow, but elsewhere we're just getting solid body motion. It's just being pushed out. It's just being pushed out, and we have unyielded material. And so we can take all these images and digitize them and look at height versus time as well as width versus time and give us some very nice sets of validation data. So Anne's data is a very important thing. Anne collected a bunch of different data on the shapes of these materials, and that she found that there was this transition between triangular shapes for the lower yield stress materials to this mounding shape. And this can be characterized by an aspect ratio. And these shapes tend to be with time. And so the mounding shape. And so the mounding shape stays kind of with the same aspect ratio, but it just gets bigger as time andor the volume increases. And so we could actually collapse a lot of our data in terms of different concentrations and different flow rates into this chart. We're still looking for another parameter to try to collapse it onto one graph, but we think that has to do with a We think that has to do with a time scale or a volume scale as well. But one of the important dimensionless groups for this flow is the total stress versus the gravitational stress. And that gives us this change in morphology from the triangle shape to the mound shape. So I mentioned that we can also look at areas where the At areas where the flow is arrested, where we have unyielded material, and regions where it's yielded. And so here we have three different flow rates for the 1% carbapole. And at the slow flow, there's only a slightly unyielded region near the inflow. We see this kind of trend in the other flow rates, but there are more. But there are more areas where we actually have flowing material. And just near the free surface, do we see this kind of unyielded state? So we want to try to model this. And we were very attracted to the Saramedo model to do this because it gives us some information about the stress in the unyielded state and it describes it as a neo-hookian solid as well as. As well as understanding the flowing areas as a viscoelastic liquid. And so we implemented this into our code, which already had a viscoelastic formulation using DVSS. And we started with a two-dimensional case where we could use finite elements with an LBV compliant element. And so we just did simple model values. And so we just did simple model validation, but since it is a flow between thin plates, we wanted to make sure we had an analytical solution for the POSOI flow, and we could match that with the code. And we looked at a model validation from the literature from Chidati et al., which was flow of a wet floam with kind of a small but non-zero yield stress and a time constant. And a time constant, and just compared to the data. So we could compare the ulderoid B fluid, which is kind of the baseline without the serumino yield stress function, to a yielding fluid. And let's see quite remarkable differences. We no longer have 4-ass symmetry for flow past a cylinder. A cylinder when we add these yielding terms, and we see results very similar to the experiment. So the yield stress is very important in this flow field. And we can actually look at the data. And most of the data matches pretty well with the experiment, much better than just a viscoelastic fluid. The only place we kind of deviate is kind of the area. Kind of the area that bisects the cylinder. We think this might be because this is a quasi-2D flow and we're maybe missing some of the 3D effects. And we were also able to capture the vortex that was observed experimentally in the reference frame of the cylinder. So we're interested in carbapole in various different formulations. Formulations. In this work, we've kind of focused on the 0.3% carbapol. And we've characterized it using both the Saramito-Oldroid B as well as a Bingham-Kuro Yasuda model, which is kind of a Kuro Yasuda model, which also has a yield stress. And this is kind of a nice model because it's well behaved numerically in the sense that, you know, a lot of the power. Sense that a lot of the power law, Herschel-Bulkley-type models for the very low shear rates or high shear rates don't necessarily have a bounded value. So we started looking at just the 2D filling of this mold. One of the things that Anne noticed experimentally is for the yield stress fluid, we see Stress fluid, we see almost no parabolic flow in the thickness direction. So this seemed like a good place to start because we have a very kind of plug flow profile because of the thin mold filling geometry. And so this ended up being kind of a complicated flow to try to solve. Flow to try to solve just because we have issues with the dynamic contact line. Trying to create the flow that you see experimentally, which is almost like a rolling motion condition in a numerical code is always tricky. Meshes don't like rolling motion, and so you have to capture this with a subgrid model. So in this case, Model. So in this case, we used some slip at this dynamic contact line along with a Blake wetting model. And we looked at several different flow rates. And so when we did look at the Saramito model, we found there are regions of parabolic flow. These are just very close to the walls, whereas you kind of have a sharper gradient. Gradient right at the walls, if you add in the shear thinning terms as well. But so we started this with just looking at the 2D, and then we realized that we were really missing the 3D effects. So we decided to add this in with a drag model since we kind of understand fairly well what's going on with the flow between these plates. And so we just added it in. Added it in in terms of a drag model that we parametrized with the simulations for different velocities. And then we can fit this in terms of the velocity local velocity. And we add that in with our other source terms. And so we found that this was actually very important to have a draft. To have a drag model for certain of the flow rates. So these are some comparisons between the height versus width with the Bingham-Kuro Yasuda model and the Saramino model. And you see, even though these models are very different, one has a stress and it has a Von Meese stress criteria. Criteria in case of the Saramino model, and it doesn't have any shear thinning. Whereas the Bingham-Kuro-Yasuda model, we implement just as a general form. It has shear thinning as well as yield stress. They don't give terribly different answers, which is, I think, kind of an interesting test case. We do see that the Newtonian fluid. The Newtonian fluid for the 0.3 case has a much different shape, so there would be no way we could use a Newtonian model to capture some of these flow fields. Let me just go ahead and play the video. And we have the right kind of shape compared to experiment. And we can look at where the fluid is yielded over time. So, here's just some videos kind of showing what the drop shapes look like. And it also shows like the highest areas of motion in terms of velocity. And so, a lot of the highest shear rates occur near the walls. Occur near the walls and as the flow goes into the geometry, and we have more quiescent flow outside, but it gets pushed forward with this rolling motion condition. And so, I guess the Newtonian shape is very different, but in this case, the Bingham model does fairly well. Model does fairly well compared. And so we can add in the with and without the drag model. So for the five milliliter per minute, the slow flow rate, we actually don't see much change with the drag model and it doesn't seem to help much. In fact, it seems to go in the wrong direction. But at the higher flow rates, it was very important to have the drag model to be able to. To be able to capture the shape as it evolved over time. And so this is kind of a better way to see it. You can kind of see the images and with the drag and without the drag. And so what happens, especially at the higher flow rates, is that the fluid moves much too quickly at the dynamic contact line and then it flattens itself out. It flattens itself out as a drop. And this isn't something that we're seeing experimentally. So, the drag model does help to slow down the motion at the dynamic contact line. And it kind of makes us wonder if we do need some special dynamic contact line conditions just for yield stress fluids. So we can also. So, we can also look at this yield parameter. And so, this is where we have this change of type of the Saramito model from a viscoelastic model to a neo-Hookian solid model solved kind of in a Larian framework. And the gray line shows us where that yield surface is. And so, I think similar to experiment. I think similar to experiments, we see that we have unyielded fluid right on kind of along the side of the meniscus. There's still quite a bit of shear because of the no-slip boundary, and there's a lot of shear from the inflow and the fluid going upwards. So we can look at the normal stresses. The normal stresses. We did just put together a paper on this and we submitted it to the Journal of Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics. And my manager, when he was reviewing the manuscript, one thing he said was, well, you know, the Bingham model looks okay to me. And so we had to go back and say, look, we have normal stresses. They are significant. They're just not necessarily changing the shape of the meniscus. Changing the shape of the meniscus as much as the fact that this fluid has a yield stress. And so we can look at the normal stress in the XX direction as well as the XY direction and kind of correlate that with where we see the yield surface for three different times and three different flow rates. And we can also look at the shear stress and where we're really seeing a lot of. Where we're really seeing a lot of shear is as this fluid is pushing out along the bottom boundaries. That seems to be a very important effect. And then if you think about trying to do a dimensional analysis, the fact that there's a Reynolds number is important, as well as the effect of gravity and surface tension is only really important at the early times when the drop is very small. When the drop is very small. So we also kind of looked at this idea of sort of it's kind of a first normal stress difference, something kind of akin to a Weisenberg number where we look at the difference between the XX and the YY stresses and normalize it by the shear stress. And we can break this up into regions where the Weisenberg number is high. Weisenberg number is high, and then where the Weisenberg number is low. Again, I think one of the main features of the flow that we see is this kind of upward high velocity flow just because of the inlet. And then we see these regions of low shear rate where the shear stress, sorry, high shear rate where the High shear rate where the shear stress dominates along the walls. But there's a very complicated kind of change in behavior between these regions. And so it's kind of interesting. I'm not sure I've analyzed all of it, but we also see there's a high degree of elasticity kind of near this wetting line as well. And we also get very sharp. And we also get very sharp stress gradients, which can be a problem as you look to higher Weisenberg number and more elastic fluids. So right now, one of our extensions to this work is to do this with a level set model instead of using an Ale moving mesh. And here I'm just showing the same 0.3% carbapole, but looking at it with With the level set. So here we have the carbapole and the air. And so we thought this would be an easier way to extend it to 3D. So we've just gotten to the point of getting our wedding line model working fairly well. And I think we have good agreement with the shape from the experiment. And so then we're hoping to do the full 3D as well as extend. 3D, as well as extending it to the Saramino model. So we do have a viscoelastic level set formulation, which I'm just showing in the bottom, that we've used fairly successfully for low to moderate Weisenberg numbers. And we are thinking we might couple that with the log confirmation tensor version of the code. So, for future work and conclusions, we have used the SERMITO stress model and compared it with analytical solutions and published data. So we were fairly convinced of our implementation. We've demonstrated this capability to simulate resurface flows, a mold filling actually in a thin channel. Our meniscus shape. Our meniscus shape predictions were improved by adding a drag term for this third dimension. Though the drag model did worsen the predictions at the lowest flow rate, considered possibly due to over predicting the viscosity there. We're currently working on computations over a range of fluid properties for the mold filling scenarios. We'd like to look at some of the other We'd like to look at some of the other carbopole concentrations and see if we can discern anything about the most important dimensionless groups and come up with kind of an understanding of when we get this shape change from the triangular Newtonian shape to this kind of bulbous yield stress. Yield stress shape. We'd also like to have some coupling of the yield stress to local structure, either through a fixotropic term, a strain hardening term. So we're working on that as well as looking at shear-thinning versions of the Saramito model. And our postdoc is now extending the model to three dimensions. So hopefully. Dimensions. So, hopefully, we can understand more about what that drag term does and have kind of a specific wetting model for yield stress fluids. So, our goal is to really try to couple simulations of fluid and solid at the same time. Kind of one of the motivations for this is I work on a lot of multiphysics foam curing and filling simulations. Curing and filling simulations, and usually, when you say, Oh, everything solidifies at the same time, which when polymerization isn't actually true, you'll have regions that are polymerized and others that aren't. And so, we'd like to be able to solve for these different regions evolving stress at the same time. So, with that, thank you all for your attention, and I'd be happy to answer any questions. Thank you, Rika. Thanks very much. So, we have a few questions in the chat. I'll invite Ian if you want to start. I think one is related to the geometry and one deriving from that. Okay, thanks, Monica. Thanks, Direka, for the nice talk. I think I got confused in the beginning because it wasn't clear until later that you were doing a sort of heady-short geometry. I think the difficulty there, if I understood you're doing 2D computations in the plane of the cell. And that just seems odd to me in the sense that, you know, whenever you're doing these narrow gap geometries, the principal shear stress is in the cross, you know, comes from the cross channel. And am I right? So later, you Am I right? So later, you're adding in the friction term to account for that, but you still want to do the 2D simulation ignoring that? No, we don't do any ignoring that. We just started with the 2D geometry and we added in the drag term kind of as a Healy-Shaw model. But now we're going to test that against the full 3D model. Right, okay. Right, okay. Yeah, it's just like, I guess when you're doing that with a, you know, with any of these generalized Newtonian ones, I mean, it seems like you throw away the principal shear. Yeah, it's the principal shear, but it's kind of a known form. And I guess because we did have particle tracking velocimetry, you could see that we had a very flat interface, right? I mean, it was that the velocity was very flat because we didn't have. Because we didn't have so in the Newtonian fluid, you kind of see you can see the gradients of velocity because you have these particle tracking. Right, but the main shear thinning is coming from that stress-in the cross-channel direction, isn't it? I mean, the main shear thinning effect is coming from that. So, the reason our model is. Yes, but our model was mostly Saramito, so we didn't have a shear thinning in that one because it was an olderoid B with the yield stress. There's nothing. I'll let others talk because I talk too much. Thank you. Oh, no, that's fine. That's a good question. It just kind of sort of evolved this way because we began with the experiments and where we saw the flow and the And and the
