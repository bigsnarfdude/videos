There will be a special issue to support this workshop. So, if you'd like to know more, speak to Ian. I don't know if the other guest editors know that they've agreed to be guest editors on this one. And so, before I start, I'm just going to do a couple of big disclaimers. You can see on my clock that it's actually half past midnight for me, so if this is a bit low energy, I apologise. Gwynne said you might be the only person who falls asleep in their own talk, so the second big discretion really. And the second big disclaimer is: I would say I know a little bit about this, physical elastic fluid flow, and many, many people in the audience will know much more about me than me about microport media. So I've got to thank the speakers this morning, Arzu and Vidat, who did a very good job of introducing the topic. So I'm not going to repeat that. I'm just going to talk a little bit about my motivation. So this was done in a collaboration with a former colleague. A former colleague David Donnis, who's now left for Liverpool, and a student, Victor Ribberson, who did basically all the work. You know, unfortunately, to answer the question, so I'll do my best to try and answer them. So let me just tell you where I came from this. I had a colleague in the department who'd invented this approach to create micro-porous metals. It's called the lost carbonate sintering process. And he patented it, and there was a company, a spin-out company, that was looking to use these. Spin-out company that was looking to use these to invent enhance heat transfer. And so he was running some very simple experiments, measuring pressure drop across these and trying to calculate heat transfer coefficients. And he came to myself and David and wanted to understand a little bit more about what was going on inside the porous media from a fluid mechanics perspective. So, David did a first paper with him on Newtonian fluids, and then I came in as the kind. And then I came in as the kind of polymer guy when we moved across to polymer solutions. So he first of all proposed a transparent porous media analogue of this process he'd developed. So if you kind of see, well, why they created your porous media in that way, in the way that we have, it was to try and mimic the procedure that you'd done in that way, but in a transparent way so we could get optical access and trait some velocity measurements. In the first part of the work, we basically Part of the work, we basically didn't make use of the fact that it was transparent. We did pressure drop, flow rate, and spent a lot of time characterizing the rheology of the solutions and trying to figure out what material properties you could measure from the polymer solutions, which would collapse things. And then following that, there was some micro-PIV work done to try and make sense of the enhanced pressure drop that we always observe for these fluids. I'd say this is. Through it. I'd say this is a very personal, subjective viewpoint. There's many people who made really nice contributions on this topic already, and we've heard some of those talks today. So I'm just going to talk about the experimental work that I've done, not really place it into context with what other people have seen, although there is lots of overlap. And one of these is published in January 10, going to be more soon. Okay, so this is how we created the porous media. So we took some glass powder, which was meant to mimic the Powder, which was made to mimic the metal powders, and then we basically take some sodium chloride, which is much bigger. So, glass powder, we've got particle size distribution of both of these. It's about 30-40 microns, and the sodium chloride is basically the space holder. So, we mix these to create a homogeneous mixture as far as possible. We put them in between two glass cover sides, we then compact that under force, and then basically. And then basically we heat it up so we sinter the glass powder together and then we wash away the sodium chloride. So this is going to be what's the solid matrix and then the holes that are left behind were where the 500 micron on average sodium chloride granules were that you've been washed away. This kind of limits the porosities that we could get to, but we've done a range, so 67. To, but we've done a range, so 67 to 84%. This is some SEM images. So, this is kind of looking from above. So, we basically had a square. So, we had basically, we'll put this in a flow channel, which is rectangular in cross-section. We look above. So, the depth direction as we're looking down is about 1.6 microns there, so that's the glass cover slide in each side. This is the SEM. The SEM image, and for those of you who can't see this tiny rotating, that's 500 microns. So these circles are meant to represent approximately where the sodium chloride granules were sitting, which were approximately spherical. And then these smaller little things you see here are the class beads which have sintered together to form the solid matrix. So we set this up. This up, we the polymer solutions that we were driving through this, some were water-based, but some were also in more viscous fluids to reduce the influence of shear thinning. We had pressure drops of up to a few bars, so we decided to run this off a pressure vessel, and then we measured the mass flow out just using a mass balance. We measured the pressure drop across the sample, and at the same time, we could do PIV. This just gives you an approximate look of what the flow says. Gives you an approximate look of what the flow cell looks like. So we have an inlet comes in here, it turns around by 90 degrees and comes along a channel. There's a long development length, but the Reynolds numbers are always lower than about 20 or 30 at maximum, I think. And so these develop pretty quickly. And so we're looking in a kind of rectangular cross-section like this, where the full height is 1.5 millimetres. The sideballs are plain as small effect. It's not approximating a slight slip flow exactly, but we did. Slip flow exactly, but we did check that it was in agreement with analytical solution for new turning through it in the flow upstream. So, this is just a zoom in of here. So, here's our porous media. We designed this such that the glass slide sits flush with the incoming channel flow as best as possible. So, basically, it sees a channel flow and then the porous media. We have a little bit of development length upstream and downstream where we measure the pressure. So, the pressure includes just a little bit in the channel here. Just a little bit in the channel here. We made no attempt to try and separate that out, but it's in there for all the results. We'll normalise our lot of results by the equivalent Newtonian pressure drop at the same scale using the discuss scaling at the same answer, but should take care of that. That's what it looks like physically, but it's probably not that useful. Okay, so first of all, we started with a Newtonian benchmark. The student used this. The student used this very strange in retrospect notation that water alone was called glycerin zero because we're just using water-glycerin mintages. That should have made sense to him. But so glycerol 20 means 20% glycerol, 80% water, glycerol 30 means 30% glycerol, 70% water, and this means 100% water. We varied the superficial velocity and we measured the pressure drop per unit length. This is for one particular porosity of 71% and these are different species. 71%, and these are different viscosities. So, you can see as the viscosity goes up, you require a bigger pressure drop to get the same superficial velocity. Absolutely no surprise to anybody in this audience. We then characterise that by a permeability. Also, we're not just in the creeping flow limit, so we've got some effective inertia. So, we've also got the Borsheimer coefficient there. And then, what we wanted to do. And then, what we wanted to do, because we want to, one of the difficulties when you work with viscoelastic fluids is when you do a model, it's very nice. You can say, pick this model, we're going to specify these properties. But actually, when you have a real fluid, you have to create that from a polymeric solution. And when you do that, you don't just have good control of one property, everything varies. So, as you change the concentration of the polymer, for example, it might get more shear thinning as it gets more elastic, and it also might get more. More elastic, and it also might get more viscous. So, what we wanted to do in the first instance was try and have a way that we could scale away purely viscous effects so we could try and separate that out from effects due to elasticity. So, we're going to normalize this pressure drop unit length with a viscous scaling, again using the superficial velocity, and just D is the 500 microns, which was the size of the sodium chloride component. If we do that and plot against If we do that and plot against Reynolds number, we see a very nice collapse of our data. So we can see at low Reynolds number, you basically get to a constant. So quite fortuitously, this falls at Reynolds number less than one, we fall on that regime. But you can see there's quite a significant effect of inertia with all of these fluids. Obviously, the final Reynolds number that we get to depends upon the viscosity of the fluid, but it all Upon the viscosity of the fluid, but it all seems to collapse quite nicely. So there's the inertial effect. And then we came up with a very simple empirical relationship for this. So for a given porous media, we would flow Newtonian fluids through it to determine what C naught was. And basically, that would be what the pressure drop will go to when the Reynolds number is equal to zero. You can think about that. That's related basically to the probability. Okay, but a non-dimensional measure of that. A non-dimensional measure of that. And then this C1 parameter is related to the Forsheimer. And then this alpha parameter just gives you a nice transition between this linear scaling here and this regime here. But that basically doesn't have any theoretical meaning. So, in this manner, we would hope that if our polymer increases Polymer increases viscosity but isn't very long, so it doesn't give us very much elasticity, so it has a short relaxation time. Then this scaling should basically, if we normalize by the Newtonian value at the same Reynolds number, just give us, just drop on to what. So we'll normalize things by delta P Newtonian, which we get from this figure. So we did a huge, what I thought was a huge variation of different physical elastic. Visible elastic fluids. The common thing that we were trying to use linear flexible polymers. Okay, so primarily the workhorse was a high molecular high molecular weight polyacrylamide. This is used often in enhanced soil recovery or as a flocculant. The molecular weight that we estimated from specific viscosity, intrinsic viscosity measurements, is about 20 million, so very long. So this means we've got a very long backbone. We should get large relaxation times. We estimated the so-called critical. Estimated the so-called critical overlap concentration. So, approximately when the concentration is below this, we can treat the polymers as being far enough apart that they don't interact. This is determined in shear. So, actually, the real C star when the molecules are extended may be significantly below that. We can see we're scanning, we're going from 12.5 parts per million to 200 parts per million. So, we're going from the truly dilute, what we call the semi-dilute. We then wanted to try and separate out these effects. And separate out these effects of shear thinning from elasticity. So, we tried to separate out the effect of purely viscous effects by normalizing by the Newtonian, and then you still, for all of these fluids, got some finite shear thinning and elasticity. So, to check that, what we can do is take the same concentration of the polyacrylamide and increase the viscosity of the solvent, so either water, water glycerin, or polyethylene. Glycerin or polyethylene glycol. Polyethylene glycol is basically the same monomer that's in PEO. When it's a small molecular weight, it's called polyethylene glycol. So when it's a few thousand grams per mole, it's called PEG. When it gets up to a high molecular weight, it's called PEO. So in this way, we can change, we can reduce the effect of shear thinning and try to see what the effect is. And then we also went back to And then we also went back to a well-known kind of drag reducer, which is polyethylene oxide, and we altered the molecular weight. Now, when you first get into these fields, there's a kind of wealth of measurements that you can do to characterize the fluid. And when I first started out, quite naively, I assumed: well, if I measure the shear viscosity with shear rate, the steady shear viscosity, and I measure, say, the steady first normal stress difference with shear rate, this Difference with shear rate. This will give me how the shear viscosity varies. This will give me some measurement of the anomaly of this velocity. But I also do small amplitude oscillator shear where I basically wobble the fluid and I could look at the lag between the stress and the strain. I could split up storage and a loss modulus. That will give me some information on the linear viscelasticity. That should be enough, and then I should go away. The longer I've been in the field, the more you realise the less you know, and actually, you can really be fooling. You can really be fooling yourself with just steady measurements for a viscoelastic fluid that you've correctly characterized the flow. So, one of the things that we've done, not only shear, we also did a transient extensional rheometry measurement, which is called capillary thinning, so the capillary break of the extension rheometer. You basically get a little bit of fluid between your thumb and your four fingers, but not your thumb and your forefingers, an expensive instrument. And then you set up an unstable filament that circuits. Filament that surface tension is trying to squeeze off, that creates an extensional flow like this. That stretches out the polymer molecules, they want to resist that stretching, and so it slows down the rate of change of diameter of time. And from that, you can extract what's called a relaxation time for the polymer. But it's actually not a relaxation time because, as you're squeezing, the stresses are growing, so it should really be a characteristic time for extensional stress growth. So, it's kind of a transient measurement. Kind of a transient measurement about how quickly or slowly the molecule responds to the changing flow field. And that's because really in this porous medium, this is where, I think this is just kind of my way I'm coming at this. So I would say there's quite a lot of talks this morning about the flow type parameter. So although it's a mixed flow, you've got both shear and extension. I'll explain what I mean by that just by doing a very By that, just by doing a very noddy diagram down here, I think in the main, it's shear-dominated, and there's regions of extension, but in the extension, it's always transient. Okay, so you'll come through a poor constriction. The flow will have to accelerate because I'm just dealing with incompressible materials, so it'll get stretched, okay, but only for a finite time because then it will come back here and relax. Okay, so it really is stretch, relax, stretch, relax. If you try to do a steady-state extensional measure. Do a steady-state extensional measurement, it might not be useful for you. That's because even though the flow may be Eulerian steady, when you go to viscoelastic materials, you have to think about the history of the fluid element itself. And so, for this to truly be a steady flow, it has to be called what's rheologically steady. So, it has to be Eulerian and Lagrangian steady. So, as it goes through a porous media, it's inherently an unsteady flow for a viscoelastic fluid, unless you're at a Fluid, unless you're at a really, really, very, very small Deborah number. And so I would say there are two important effects. There's a Debra number effect, which is the ratio of this relaxation time or a characteristic time for extensional stress growth to a kind of residence time or a characteristic time in the pore. And so if the relaxation time is very small in comparison to this, then you're going to basically get a Newtonian light response. Light response. This is a measure of the time dependence, but there's also another measure which is the Weisenberg number. And you'll see on some, when you start in some papers, you'll see Deborah number on one plot and Weisenberg number on the other plot. They actually tell you different things. But if you just have a single length scale within the flow, actually, from a dimensional analysis argument, you get that the Deborah number is basically equal to the Weisenberg number. But that's because the resonance time you might approximate as V over D and the shear rate you might approximate as V over D. might approximate as V over D. And so they supposedly simplify to the same thing. The Weisenberg number we often say is the ratio of elastic stresses to viscous stresses. It's only actually, this is N1, that first normal stress difference. It's only that actually for a model which has no solvent viscosity and which obeys the upper convective maximum model. We're actually going to quantify the Weisenberg number using the else lambda C, which is the cable relaxation time. Relaxation time and a nominal shear rate based on the overdue form. So, let me just do this. So, imagine this is a streamline as the flow goes through there. It's all Larry and steady. Let's just take a fluid element, it goes through the gap here, it gets stretched, so it experiences some extension and then some compression as it comes back through here. This is meant to indicate that it may have rotated a bit as it comes back through here, and then as it comes, as it comes close into contact with. comes close into contact with the cylinder because we've got, we assume no slip and impenetrability, we've got the no-slip condition here, there'll always be shearing near this solid surface. And so there's a bit of transient extension, but if you don't develop enough strain, it may not be important. And that's why I'd characterize this potentially as more of a shear-dominated flow. But we did find that the cable relaxation time was very helpful. So although it's measured in an extensional flow, it may be a good measure. An extensional flow, it may be a good measure of the transient response to deformation. Let me just show you, and I said you have to be really careful about using just steady rheological properties. So, these are two different constituent equations. We've heard a lot today about the FEE V, developed for dilute polymer solutions from molecular theory. And we've also got, and I've worked a lot with this model, it hasn't been talked about, but it's called the simplified Gametian Tanner model. Simplified Fam Tien Tama model. This was developed for polymeric melts and concentrated solutions using network theory. And you look at these equations, they look really complicated, very different. If you restrict your attention to steady and homogeneous flows, those of you will recognise that this term immediately goes. And then also, if your polymer's quite long, so L squared has just got to be significantly bigger than 3, all of this simplifies, that goes to 1. All of this simplifies, that goes to one, this simplifies to this, okay, and they're actually identical under this transformation that the non-linear parameter in the Phinepi model is 1 over L squared. So you could fit steady data and get exactly the same parameters, but when you go to a complex flow, the Phine P will give you a different result because of this transient term here. Okay? So I'd say if you're working So, I'd say if you're working in this field and you're doing experiments, I think it's important to try and get transient measurements for that. Another thing, and I just added in this this morning, I've done this myself, but we kind of present the Phi P as a kind of gospel model, like this is a great model for polymer solutions, off we go. We do that because it predicts some physically complicated phenomena really well. It can predict turbulent drag reduction, for example. If you've got a steady, fully developed flow in a pipe, it will give you the right pressure drop in the laminar flow. But actually, Up in the laminar flow, but actually, we've known for a long time fails in some really simple flows. So, if we could imagine the simplest proxy for a porous media, from my point of view, might be a contraction-expansion in a pipe. So, you go from a large diameter, you contract down, and you come back up. So, a simple analogue of a poor constriction, maybe. Rostin and McGinley, 25 years ago, now measured the dimensionless pressure drop against the Debra number for a couple of different contraction ratios, and they observed. Contraction ratios, and they observe this: that although they remember this is a Newtonian result, you've got a particular pressure drop, these are different contraction ratios, which depends on the contraction ratio. You get a significant enhancement in the pressure drop, but the flow remains steady. Okay, so you can see that the pressure drop increases by a factor two. So, this is Reynolds number zero, I should say. So, this is inertialous flow of a very well defined dilute poromellic solution, single molecular. Solution, single molecular weight load is poly dispersity, extremely well characterized. Pressure drop goes up by a factor two before you get this first instability. If you try and model this with a FiniP model, you take the parameters that exactly fit the shear and extensional data that these guys did such a good job at presenting, and you get these pink symbols here. But as you increase, I've called this a whisperbread number just to confuse you. You actually get You actually get a decrease in the pressure drop. So, not only is it wrong, it's qualitatively wrong. So, it's saying this is a Newtonian result here. This is just the coefficient, which is a way of normalizing this pressure, which subtracts off the upstream and downstream length. Okay, so basically, you get this, and so it's qualitatively wrong. In a simple, simple flow, it doesn't get the dissipation rate. So, always, always bear that in mind. That we always, I think, have to compare to experimental data to see how these viscoelastic constituents are. To see how these viscoelastic constituent equations do. But it does, the Finney P is probably about as good as this can be. Okay, here's the rheological data with all the different fluids. So we do get some various amounts of shear thinning. So we're going to something that's water-like thin, so this is one millipascal second, up to something that's seven times more viscous. We fit these to accrue pseudo. We use the nominal shear rate about each flow rate to determine the viscosity, which then goes into. Determine the viscosity which then goes into the Razon, but again, you could argue about whether that's a good one or not, but that's what we do. Okay, this is what happens with that capillary thinning. So, this is my thumb and my forefinger pulled apart very rapidly. You can see this thins down. You get, this is a login plot, you get an exponential region for these, and then you can relate that to this relaxation time. So, we can measure the relaxation time going down to some values where it's pretty difficult to measure that how repeatable and believable is that. I'm not too sure. We can see. I'm not too sure. We can see when I said when it was dilute, basically the polymolecules shouldn't interact and there should be no effect of concentration. You can see in here, because in this flow, the polymorphs are getting stretched out, they're taking up much more space, they interact at much lower concentrations. And all the way down here, there's still some weak dependence of the concentration. So they're not truly dilute in that sense. They will be overlapping potentially when they're fully stretched out. When I've already stretched out, here's that raw data normalized now. Okay, so this is the raw data, I think. Let me just check that. Yeah, okay. So we've normalized by the Newtonian pressure drop, and so that can't be because that wouldn't be going to one. This is the raw gate. You can see the very low values of the reactation time, we characterize this using. Reactation time, we characterize this using the so-called elasticity number just to confuse you still further to another non-dimensional group. The beauty of the elasticity number is it doesn't contain anything about the velocity, it just tells you something about the fluid and the size of the geometry. But you can see as you increase the concentration, basically this is peeling up earlier. It's nearly always above, except for some concentrations here where the concentration is higher and we saw a bigger geothermal effect. So, we're pretty confident that. Shear thinning effect. So we're pretty confident the slight decrease here was due to shear thinning, but the rest they can get a pretty significant increase. And it's pretty consistent across all the different fluids groups that we looked at. So that was the polyoprimidine water, that was the different solvents, there's the PEO. Basic message: it costs you much more pressure drop to drive the flow through. If we take all of that data now and we normalise it by the Newtonian. And we normalize it by the Newtonian. For low Weisenberg numbers, it starts off at one. We've got large uncertainty bars here, we're just getting very close to the resolution of our pressure sensor. And then we work out the Weisenberg number based on the relaxation time we determined from the extensional measurement. It seems to work pretty good. So that collapse is pretty good given all that we've got. So, first key conclusion is we can reasonably collapse the data if we can measure. If we can measure the Newtonian fluid in the porous media and then we can estimate its relaxation time from Kebr, we can give you a reasonable estimate. But what you can see here is we're getting up to a factor five, the also even higher factors of increase of the pressure bulb. Effective porosity, there's a small effect maybe within the noise. Instead of maybe using the nominal shear rate in the Weisenberg number, you can see we're seeing. Shear rate in the Weisenberg number. You can see we're seeing elastic effects, elastic effects at very, very low nominal Weisenberg numbers. That's because the shear rates and the actual pores are significantly higher than the nominal estimate of the ODD. Okay, so we could re-estimate that with a shear rate that we'd measured locally. We can also, following the literature, we could try and estimate using this, using the permeability. That seems to give a reasonable collapse, and we start to see increases now at the right order of Weisenberg numbers. This was a correlation that. This was a correlation that was proposed in the literature, and you can see that that seems to massively overpredict what we observe in the same region. Caveat, theirs was based on creeping flow alone, whereas we have some inertia in some of our experiments, which we try to account for by normalizing by the Newtonian. And this is interesting that the fluid degrades as it goes through, so you always have to flow away and go again. This is the number of passes that go through, so as you degrade, you're Of passes that go through, so as you degrade, you're basically causing polymer scissors. The polymer molecule is breaking halfway. We can capture that, it's even captured in the cable relaxation time. If we plot in all the, you can see actually a lovely collapse. So, they're normally the same fluid, you're just flowing it more times through. That could have important implications if your porous media is very long. But the fluid that you put in halfway along, it's no longer the polymer that you thought it was. So let's try and now relate in the last couple of minutes, because I don't want to keep you too long for you dinner, where this very large enhancement in pressure drop is coming from for the viscoelastic fluids. Now, Arzu very kindly cited one of my works in her second slide. I'd worked a lot on purely elastic instabilities, and I was like, yeah, this will be probably an instability which is driving this. And we'll see that large increase, and certainly some of Chris's work has also. Some of Chris's work has also shown that this large pressure drop in large part will be driven by time-dependent instabilities, which are purely elastic in nature. We characterise the PIV, make sure everything goes okay. So, these are our experimental results. Red dashed line is the unleashable solution, taking the finite aspect ratio of the tunnel into account. We looked at a whole different number of cores, but this is kind of a raw image that we've got. It's about two and a half millimetres. Um it's about two and a half millimetres by one point six seven. Unfortunately, we're just doing plainer PIV measurements, and as you might expect, given the way that we've created the porous media, it's very three-dimensional. One way that we tried to understand how three-dimensional was because we got access to the 2D velocity field and we know it's incompressible, we can make use of that it should be divergent-free. And so, if it was two-dimensional, when we calculate this from these two fields, it should be identical zero. It's not, you can see closely identical. It's not, you can see close to the edges, we get some large numerical error, but even far away from there, we're getting the same order of magnitude of this as this. So it's significant out-of-plane flow. So you have to bear that in mind. We've only got a partial characterization of the flow. The force can become less active at higher flow rates. So this is normalized by the average velocity, so this is increasing the voltage. Increasing the bulk velocity. So, this seams has got some high flow rates, some high velocities at a lower flow rate, and as we increase this pore, maybe the flow has been diverted elsewhere. If we look at the time, get some time-dependent information. So, what we did for each pore, so each one of these is an individual pore for an individual fluid at a particular flow rate, we did a space and time average, and then see how. And time average, and then see how that varied as we vary the basic of this as the ball velocity or the flow rate. For this particular fluid, it just looks linear. For this one, at some critical value, we get a change in the slopes, and we could potentially find a similar change in the slopes there. If we look at the fluctuation data, fortunately the data is quite noisy, but this is normalised by the so this is the floor the noise level that we've got in the Newtonian channel flow. In the Newtonian channel flow. And so you can see for the green fluid, for the pressure drop, the pressure drop goes up by a factor of three, but basically, our fluctuation levels are so small they're within the Newtonian noise. Where we get a consistent increase above this is significantly above the critical Weisenberg number that we determined from pressure drop. So much like Rossley and McGinley saw, they saw an increase in the pressure drop which was steady and then there was an unsteady instability which drove it still further. Instability, which drove it still further. We're seeing something similar, we believe, here. That there's a first kind of critical Weisberg number, which where the pressure drop starts to rise significantly above the Newtonian. This is on a logarithmic scale now. But then there's a large region, so that green fluid, that was where the fluctuation levels were below the Newtonian, where we see significant amplitude in pressure. And that seems to be a steady or a mean flow effect. And then at higher flow rates, we then do get a time instability. Time instability. So I'm on the hour there. I'll finish there. Thanks very much. Yeah, actually, just a very simple question. So, you saw there was a lot of three dimensionalities, but I didn't get what was the gift of it. Sorry, yeah, so the depth of the entire corridometer is 1.5 millimetres. We believe we're about in the mid plane, so we're about halfway from each side wall, so about 750 microns from the sidewall, but the depth is about 1.5 microns. What's compared to the length? So the length was like 26%. Right quite wrong. So yeah, maybe a general question. Define the relaxation time. So for any uh realistic material in the lab, you have a spectrum of relaxation. And then we can define mean relaxation time, largest relaxation time. There are many methods, so what's the way? Yeah, that's one of the difficulties, right? So you're like, oh, you've got viscolastic fluid, plenty of relaxation time. You go to literature about 50 different ways, and you're like, if it's polydys and spurs, And you're like, if it's polygys dispersed, you've got to get a mean value. You know, you must fit a small amplitude accelerator shear, and it won't fit well with a single mode. We found with this that caber, which is probably related to the longest relaxation time, seems to do well. Okay, so if you've got a flexible linear polymer, note I'm giving you quite a lot, I'm not saying a general fluid, in that sense, the Kaiba relaxation time seems to correlate the data quite well. Even though I think this is more of a shear-dominated flow. I think this is more of a shear-dominated flow. I think it also captures that transient shear and transient nature of the stretch, relax, stretch, relax, whatnot. Question here. Thanks, Rob. That was very interesting. So you're seeing, like what's down with Kimmy, this steady increase in the pressure control initially. Yeah. Is there a clear, clean explanation for why there should be like physics-based explanation? Like probably the URL level? Well, it's difficult, I would say. So, some people point to it being a coil-stretch hysteresis of polar molecules, which is one of the things that the Phine P model doesn't capture and put together that precipitative mechanism. Even in the flow through a single constriction, the flow is actually very complicated. Close to the constriction, you get a lip vortice growing, you get a corner vortice and mophaeddy, as you would in the Newtonian flow. Those can grow and merge, and they can form a very And merge, and they can form a very large recirculation region. So the actual streamlines are not following the flow, as you might imagine. You can even see, because of along that centre line, you have got transient stretching, you've got pure extension, the viscosity goes up there, so the fluid tends not to want to go there, so it kind of diverges out. So there's many mechanisms which could be causing extra dissipation. The kind of prime contender was this kind of cause-stretch hysteresis, and that paper I showed, we tried to capture that with the adaptive. Paper I showed, we tried to capture that with the adaptive led scale model. Incredibly, incredibly complicated, years to get working, and it got like a 20% increase rather than a 200% increase. So, yeah. I think the problem is it's not easy, and so that's why we're still falling back to the PhD P, even though we know it's not right. Last question again. Hi, Rob. Wedward. So, passing contractions, contraction expansion with power fluids, do you want this kind of relationship between extension? Kind of relationships between extensional viscosity increasing protocol anomalous versus decreasing perfect bro. Have you seen any signal alike in this model? Well, I mean we're experimental so we can't measure anything apart from the velocity field. And I should have said there's models that Estevan has helped develop which can perhaps run out special docs. I should have been that capitalist pointing out. There are methods that seem to be able to do that, but they've not been widely adopted, I would say. People are still using them. I would say, you know, people are still using them. So, yeah, I mean, the good thing about simulations, you have access to all that. The experiments here, you're relying on either average measurements or dissipation or trying to infer things from velocity. So, that's why Arzu's nice work of trying to measure stretching relating that to stress. I would say you still need a constituent equation, so you've still got to have some kind of faith to then transfer the stretching field to the stress field in a quantitative sense. Question? No, we asked the question. Okay, we should go. Okay, who is it? Espawn. Part of the ratchet? Oh, okay, probably okay. Sorry to bother you before dinner. Can you give me your thoughts on anything for sizes? Thoughts on, let me think the four size is quite small. Your range, you have a huge range of molecules weights, which means you have a range of radius or duration and your former molecules. Some of them are well below the TV limit, but some of them are quite close to the limit, in which you might have non-local effects. Can you give me a did you see that strategy that those effects as you change from one program? So, yeah, I'm always coming at from a continuum hypothesis and always quite worried that, okay, when do you get down to quite a small scale, whether it's going to break or not? So, we tried to look at that by looking at different molecular weights, and things seem to collapse quite well on that. I mean, the pore size is actually 500 microns, so people have done, and yourself have done myocritic experiments down to that kind of size with similar molecular weights. So, I think we're okay. I think we're okay, but I can't 100% safe as a misunderstood. So your port size is 500 microns. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah, you're pretty good. Yeah, okay. We're in agreement. Thanks, God. Okay, um, I guess we close this stage for a second. So So it was not really any plan, okay? As Mariana said, we need time to understand one another, and so we could reconvene.
