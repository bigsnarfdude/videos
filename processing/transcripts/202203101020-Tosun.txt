I want you to take that one with you can call it that you don't want to put it in the end of the time. So, our next presentation is Pulin Tosa. He's going to be telling us about free method holds and vetting information. Thank you very much. So, let me try to share my screen. Hans, can you confirm? Can you guys see what I share? Film, can you guys see what I shared? Yeah, and can you hear me just fine? Okay, well, thank you very much for the invitation. And thanks also to Burst for supporting this event. I guess I will start by taking the opportunity to advertise another Burst conference, which will take place next April. This will be organized by This will be organized by Laura Starkston, Tom Mark, and myself. And the title will be syncretic and holomorphic convexity in four dimensions. So anyways, today I'd like to tell you about some embedding problems for three manifolds in four space. And most of everything I will talk about is joint work with Tom Mark, who is in the audience. Feel free to give him hard time. Hard time. So, and one other thing is an apology. I have talked about this result in a couple of places and I can definitely see some faces, names who are there. I'm sorry that there'll be a significant overlap between the talk you listened earlier and this talk. Anyhow, so let me start. As I said, the talk is about one set. Is about one set of questions and conjectures that broadly sits at the intersection of symplectic contact topology on one side, complex function theory on the other, and long-dimensional topology. And in particular, I would like to make sense of these various implications listed here. So here, Y will be a closed oriented three-manifold, and we'll be asking various properties they might have. Properties they might have in each of these boxes. Some of them are about the smooth topology, some are about the symplectic topology, and some about the more like complex function theory, complex geometry. Okay, and I also want to mention some names who were, you know, who also done quite important work for the, in particular, is this implications on the This implications on the symplectic and complex geometric side, and their work was also quite influential for us. Okay, so what I would like to do first now, I'd like to kind of start with some motivations. And for that, I will remind you this question which can be found in Kirby's list, which asks which closed-oriented three manifolds embed in R4. Embedding R4, and in this case, it doesn't matter either it is R4 or S4. The question is already too general because many such don't embed and it is just for simple first homology reasons. For example, it applies to say that land spaces cannot be embedded in R4. So, for those reasons, we will focus on class of interactions. Focused on a class of integer homology spheres, those that have the same integer homology as S3. And when you put this restriction in place, suddenly there is a very good news at this in topological category. In this case, any such three manifold indeed does embed in R4 topology. This is work of Friedman. On the other hand, in smooth category, the question is very complicated and largely open. So, what we would like to do: So, what we would like to do in this talk is impose additional geometric conditions to get somehow more uniform results and progress on this question. We have two goals in mind. One of them is short-term and it is essentially listed here. We want to get maybe do some actual progress or get more uniform results. And in this talk, I will tell you about that concrete results. And there's also a bit more long-term goal in doing this. Goal in doing this, which is, as you all know, this contrast between topological and smooth category has resulted many new kind of important information, in particular about smooth form manifolds. For example, using this contrast between topological and smooth category, you obtain closed form manifolds without smooth structures. And hopefully, the goal with this kind of enhanced With this kind of enhanced three-manifold embedding questions, contrasting that with the either smooth category or the contrast between different geometric structures we'll put on the either three-manifold or the target four-manifold, we might kind of obtain further results about the smooth four-manifolds. Okay, but let me go ahead maybe a little bit more talk about this smooth category. In particular, let me start with maybe a toy example. And maybe a toy example. So let's consider this so-called maser manifold. It's a four-manifold given by a single one-handle, single two-handle. And that is important feature, but this framing n on two-handle will not be important. What we can say about this Xn, which is a contractible formula, has a homologous sphere boundary, not just the boundary, but even the formula itself smoothly embeds in R4. Embeds in R4. This is a, for simple reasons, it's kind of due to what's called maser's trick. What you do essentially, you thicken your four manifold. This doesn't change the handle structure, but it causes kind of the critical change. Namely, now the two handle is attached, two handle is a five-dimensional two-handle, it attached along a knot in S1 cross S3. And in that sense, we can undo this crossing and hence, indeed, the And hence, indeed, the algebraic one intersection becomes geometric one intersection between two handle and one handle. They cancel each other. In other words, this thickened Xn is nothing but the five ball. And in particular, the Xn sits in boundary, its boundary, which is which is S4. So you can kind of change this attaching circle. It doesn't have to be this particular knot. And when you do that, you get many. That you get many kinds of homologous spheres, often they are hyperbolic, but you can also get in various cases for many infinite families cipher fibric manifolds. And of course, this process automatically says that they smoothly sit inside after. Okay, so now I would like to introduce some of our key players for this talk. This will be so-called risk on spheres. Briscon homologous sphere, they are the link of this particular singularity, this so-called Briscan singularity. And here, PQR are integers, positive integers, and we assume that they are pairwise relatively prime. That is the one that makes this three mapple to be a homolog. And they have this surgery picture. They are ciphered fiber space. In this particular case, they are ciphered fiber space over S23 singular. Fiber space over S2 with three singular fibers. But, and this cipher invariants here are, you can choose this P prime, Q prime, R prime arbitrary as long as they satisfy this condition. You can, of course, also talk about more general Brisk conference, which notation would be sigma A1 through AN. Same thing, you just have now n singular fibers, and similarly, there'll be a single equation. And similarly, there'll be a single equation between this a1 to a n and the new denominators. So, the good thing about this Briskon spheres, they are ciphert manifolds, but also indeed they constitute for all ciphert homology spheres up to orientation. So, here in our case, we will fix the orientation, which will be the one that comes from the singularity. Okay, so now I would like to go back to the smooth question: like thinking a homologous three spheres, and one it could bound the homology ball, or when it could embed in R4 smoothie. I want to revisit a little bit more. So for that, I would like to talk about this various constraints. So if you have a homologous sphere embassing R4, then it necessarily bounds an integer homology. Homologible, and in particular, you might kind of use your favorite homology cobordism invariant to obstruct that. And this is an old history, has been going on for more than 70 years. For example, you can use Rotten invariant, which is quite powerful. For example, it tells you that Poincar√© sphere cannot embed in R4 smoothly. There are newer invariants coming from gauge theory, floor theory. Gait theory, floor theory. For example, there's an integer lift of Rocklin invariant by Manodovsku. There is so-called integers-Stern R-invariant, which is very powerful for and specifically for Briscombe spheres. And also an interesting conjecture, if you focus on Briscombe spheres, there is this conjecture of Fintra Stern, clearly written by Kohler and connected to some other interesting questions. Do some other interesting questions in algebraic geometry is that it's kind of hard to think about a response sphere that has four or more singular fibers that bound a homology bulk and indeed the conjecture that it will never happen. As far as I know, this conjecture is kind of completely open. There is no partial progress. So, anyhow, maybe this slide is just to give this message that, I'm sorry, there is also a typo. I'm sorry, there is also a typo. The situation in the Samud case is really complicated. And that is the case even if you restrict this nice class of ciphered manicurals. Okay, so now we're going to kind of to this more enhanced situation. So we will kind of, I guess, constrain the problem. And the idea is the following one. So we will ask embeddings in R4, but we will ask that, okay, they satisfy. Ask that okay, they satisfy some sort of some version of convexity. On the first type of convexity, we'll think about this holomorphic convexity. For that, we will identify R4 with C2, think about it as a complex manifold, and ask that y inside C2 bonds a stein domain. And the other type of convexity we will require is symplectic convexity. Now we will say that, well, our Now we will say that well, R4 can also be considered as a symplectic manifold if you equip it with the standard symplectic structure. And this time we'll require that y to be a contact type hypersurface, or equivalently, y is the boundary of a symplectically convex domain in R4 with the standard symplectic structures. So of course we know that the concept of stein manifolds and symplectic manifolds. And symplectic manifolds are closely related and hence this kind of notions of convexity. But we will see that indeed they are different, and indeed the stein condition is more flexible than the symplectic one. Okay, so now I would like to a little bit say something about each of these convexity. So on holomorphic convexity side, as we all know in complex function theory literature, Complex function theory literature: the main notion of convexity is pseudo-convexity or holomorphic convexity, and um, I would really kind of keep things more like you know, just targeted to an topology audience. So, for us, the most important thing would be this characterization of a L Yashbach for stein manifolds, which is that if you are given a smooth 2M manifold for To a manifold for it to admit a spine structure is kind of the completely given, essentially just a kind of the rather mild restriction on the topology of the manifold. And this works in any complex dimension three and above, but when you are in the case of four manifolds, you don't need the almost complex structure restriction actually, but you need now an additional frame condition. And this the case of four manifolds is. And this, the case of four manifolds is in detail explained, and in particular in the presence of one handles by Gomp. And I think we all learned from that mainly from him. So, but here is a criteria. When can you put a spine structure abstractly on a given 2M dimensional smooth manifold? So, this is good. And if you want to think about an example, think about S2 cross D2 for various reasons. Too for various reasons, but in particular gauge theory reasons, you cannot make it stein in the sense of this geishberg's result. We will be, however, interested more at these stein domains sitting inside a complex manifold and specifically C2. And for that, I will state a result due to GON. I call it GON flexibility. I think he's in the audience. And if you have any objections, I'm happy to change the name, Bob. But anyhow, here is a very kind of Anyhow, here is a very kind of specific case of that flexibility, which is that if you have an integer homology bulb, and then two things about it, it admits a stein structure, abstractly, some stein structure. You might not have control on that, but that it satisfies, in other words, satisfies this Eliasberg's criteria, and that this domain sits inside R4 smoothly as a smooth integer ball. Then Then we can make it actually a stein domain in C2. You can istop it to be a stein subdomain in C2. What that means, that means that you could find the neighborhood of this domain and an I-convex function on it in programs as I refers to this usual complex structure on C2. So this is a complexable. Um, so this is ground flexibility. Let me give an example of this conflexibility. So, consider this maze manifold from the couple slides ago. So, as we just learned about it, this Xn being a maser-type manifold, it can be embedded in R4 smoothie. Moreover, if you quickly check this attaching circle for this two handle here, you can put it in the login. Uh, you can put it in the Legendre position and show that its Thurston-Beneken number is actually equal to minus one. Um, so uh, if you remember, I mentioned a framing condition in Eliasberg's criteria, that is that is important here. And for those reasons, as long as you choose this framing for the two handle to be less than minus one, you can actually make this x n stein. And in particular, Gong flexibility result applies, and it says that in Flexibility result applies, and it says that indeed this boundary of Xn, whatever that homologous sphere, will embed in C2 as a stein boundary. So, and then this is the criteria that Gonf used to find many stein domains in C2, but often the embedding will come from four manifold ways and hence maybe less control on the boundary. Boundary. But I want to point out something. In the case of n is equal to minus one, this Elyashburst criteria doesn't apply directly. And the boundary in that case actually is a familiar brisk constant here. It is sigma 2, 3, 13, which is also minus 1 over 2 surgery on trephoid, if you wish. And you might wonder, I mean, maybe this could still be made stein and is equal to minus one case. n is equal to minus one case. An earlier theorem of myself and Tamark, we proved that indeed this particular contractual manifold when n is equal to minus one cannot be given a fine structure. So you might think that this might be just an accident, but indeed a very kind of remarkable conjecture of Gonov says that indeed if you have a brisk conhomoisphere Sphere, it cannot be embedded in CO2 as a stein boundary. And indeed, this has to be the case with either orientation. So this conjecture was the main motivation for us to think about this enhanced three-manifold embedding questions. And the conjecture is still by large open. The only concrete progress is the case of 2T13 that I just mentioned in the previous slide. Mentioned in the previous slide. And it also holds for an infinite family sigma 2, 3, 12, and plus 1, but with its opposite orientation. I also want to mention that you can also find examples of hyperbolic three manifolds, hyperbolic three manifolds, which are homologous spheres, bonding contractable maser-type manifold, but cannot be given stein structure. But in that case, orientation actually does matter. Orientation actually does matter. So, this kind of with idol orientation case really has to be specific to cycle fiber spaces. And moreover, Briskon homologous here, this homologous here restriction is very important. If you relax that, you can indeed find examples of cipher-relational homoispheres that do embed in C2SS stein boundary. Okay, so this is Gong conjecture. So now So now I'd like to move on to the next convexity for us, which is the symplectic convexity. So remember, that is where you think about this three-man code inside R4, but R4 can be given this standard symplectic structure. And you ask that this actually Y bounds a simple convex domain, or equivalently Y being a contact-type hypersurface. What does this mean? This means that, well, you have this. mean that, well, you have this symplectic manifold, but you have to have some dynamics going on near the boundary, namely that you have a vector field, so-called Liebold vector field, that defined near the boundary and it's pointing outward. So there are examples of simple active convex domains in R4 or contact-type hypersurfaces. S3 is one example, S1 cross S2, and various disk bundles studied. And there is this bundle studied by Neverowsky and Siegel. So now I briefly introduced this holomorphic convexity and symplated convexity, or if you wish, pseudo-convexity and symplatic convexity. So these are related to each other. So let me a little bit talk about that. So this cartoon picture you see here is essentially a Stein manifold. And in it, I also have a Stein subdomain, if you wish, given by W. Domain, if you wish, given by W. So here are a couple of the commands. As we all know, stein domains are Keller. And in particular, I can talk about this syntactic form or Keller form on W. And if you look at the complex tendencies on the boundary, they actually make the boundary contact. And this being Keller, we also actually have a metric. We can talk about this gradient of f, which is a Liouville vector field for omega f. And in particular, w is simplectic convex with respect to this Keller form omega f. But here is a warning that even if you are in C2, namely if you take x to be C2, this form omega f doesn't have to agree with the standard symplectic structure on the. Standard symplectic structure on the on R4. In particular, boundary of W doesn't have to be compact type hypersurface in R4 with this standard symplectic structure. So this is quite important. And indeed, being able to extend the symplectic structure to this standard one in a controlled way has its own name. This is exactly the notion of rational convexity. That is quite studied in complex function theory literature. And their interest in such domain, racially convex domains, is that on such domains, any holomorphic function can be approximated by a rational function. And that in turn is a useful thing to do. But for us, it is this theorem that I will use as, if you wish, as a definition for rational convexity, which is due to Dual-Suboni, but in Dwarf Suboni, but improved that works better for maybe let's say syntactic topology by Nemorowski and Silibak by Yashbrak. And what it says is that being cratially convex is exactly that, that you know, that omega we have mentioned earlier, that can extend to a caliform on CM. And indeed, it will be standard outside of a compact set. So this is all to say that hopefully now we have all. Hopefully, now we have all these implications in place. So, we started with this closed-oriented three-manifold. These implications really kind of make sense for any closed three-manifold, although we will mainly focus on y being an integral homoisphere. And the goal now is that we define each of this kind of concept in each box. And what we would like to do then want to understand which Ys kind of satisfy this property, which closed three manifolds in particular. Three manifolds in particular homology spheres, and maybe the other thing is that maybe we want to think about whether each of these implications can be reversed, maybe this one, maybe this one, various others, and in particular, maybe how these two are related. Okay, these are the various questions one can ask. And maybe now it is time to give some results. So it turns out that if you impose this. If you impose this condition of symplectic convexity, you can actually progress quite a bit. And here's the result. Indeed, no Briskon homologous sphere admits an orientation preserving embedding in standard R4 as a contact type hypersurface. And because of the previous implications I just mentioned, that in particular says that no brisk and moist sphere. No brisk on moist sphere bonds are rationally convex domain in C2. This can be seen as a partial evidence for conjectures of colour and gonpite I mentioned earlier. And again, let me just kind of emphasize here. So if you think about even the case of three singular fiber case brisk homoisphere, in the smooth case, the answer to this question is completely open. It's completely unclear when such. Completely unclear when such a three-manifold embeds in R4 smoothly and when it doesn't. So this is good. I would like to say a couple more results, just to put this result in context. So you can actually study the same kind of as mentioned from the beginning, you can study the notion of symplectic convexity, relational convexity in higher dimensions as well. And this actually already studied and it is a Studied, and there is a flexibility result in this direction. Recent result of Silibach-El-Yasberg says that if you're in complex dimension three and above, indeed the notions of holomorphic generation convexity are same. And in particular, once you set the topology, namely once you have Eliasbach's criteria for putting abstracted span structure on a 2M dimensional manifold is set, then the boundary will be a contact-type hypersurface. Will be a contact-type hypersurface in the standard simplex structures on R2M. On the other hand, again, as expected, maybe in four dimensions, there is actually rigidity, namely that there are domains in C2 which are homomorphically convex, but not relationally convex. So, the first examples of this were given by Nemerovsky and Siegel. They studied and obtained some examples. Studied and obtained some examples in the case of disk bundles over surfaces. And we also, out of their examples, they have two examples, which are rational homology spheres. And myself and Tom, we gave an infinite family of examples. These are exactly those. This is an example of Nemirovsky-Siegel. What you see here is a rational ball spawn with a ciphered fiber. Is bound with a cipher-fiber space, it's a rational moist sphere, and that can that is holomorphically convex in C2, but it is not rationally convex. And this is an infinite family of contractible form manifolds. Their boundaries is actually homologous spheres, and they also, although they are homomorphically convex in C2, they are not rationally convex. And the interesting thing, our technique for obstruction does not apply to theirs, but they To theirs, but theirs is very, very specific, like one example that some nice structure hidden there that helps you to kind of get this result. And I think at some point I saw Angela Wu is in the audience. I want to give her credit. In her recent work, she actually captured another proof for this particular example. But by studying Laglangian concordance for tribrates, she can show that this is indeed not. Show that this is indeed not a contact-type hypersurface, or it cannot be, its boundary cannot be, it cannot be rationally convex in C2. But maybe a corollary, which I'm stating for our infinite family, but the same is true for Nemirovsky-Siegel example. What this in particular says that is that you cannot find a compatible Weinstein structure on Wn that embeds simplify. WN that embeds symplectically in standard artwork, although it embeds was called in a Stein fashion. Okay, so these are results. And okay, I what time I started 11.20. Okay, it's going really well. Okay, so I think I'll have time. So now I'd like to maybe tell a little bit about the proof, how it goes, how do you do that? So the proof will have. So, the proof will have an obstruction in place. It will come rather easy, but then we will see that how, for the case of arbitrary Briskan Homoispheres, we can make that obstruction to work, okay, or it applies to them. So here is the steps of proof. First, obstruction. And for that, our input will come from floor theory. And it's really floor theory, not just a floor theory. But anyhow, for a three-manifold, you can associate so-called the You can associate so-called the Hagar floor groups. And then to a contact structure and a three-manico, you can associate so-called the contact structure. And if W is simple bit convex, it kind of induces a contact structure on the boundary, thus call it size sub W. And in this case, we know that contact class has to be non-zero. So, and the theorem here is the following one. The theorem here is the following: one: if you have a simplically convex domain in R4, namely this boundary is contact-type hypersurface, then there is a strong restriction on this contact class, which is that it has to lie in this image, or in other words, this contact class has to be zero in the reduced part of the hecker flow homology. Okay, so how do we prove this? So, I mean, this will give So, I mean, this will give us the obstruction we want, but how do we prove this? So, here it is. So, suppose W is synthetically convex. So now take a large ball around this domain, W here, and look at the region from the boundary of W, Y, to S3. This is a smooth cobordism. If you equip it with the, if you restrict the standard syntactic structure on R4 to this. R4 to this region, that is indeed a strong cobordism. So the vector field you take the near the minus boundary is given by this W, which is synced to convex, and near the S3 boundary, it is just the standard radial field. So it's a strong symplectic cobordism, and that's really key. And when that is the case, now we need to do a little detour, go outside of Hagar-Loren and go to monopole. Flow real and go to monopole site in that context. There is a strong cobordism. If there is a strong cobordism, then there is a neutrality property, namely that the contact loss is preserved. But then using some internal structure of, you know, in particular of the monopole homology for S3, tells us that this algebraic property that the monopole contact loss has to be zero in the reduced part of the monopoly homology. Post-floor homology. Now we want to go back to the heger-fluoroside just because it is easier to do calculations there and to proceed with our strategy. And for that, we will use this result of Komo-Ngijini Honda, or Kutlohan Li Tabs. It's possible that maybe we need to use the first one. I'm not sure if the second one uses the, that the contact class is preserved. But anyhow, that kind of helped us to move to the hegel of. Move to the Hegelfillor psi. So this is how the obstruction works. So now, okay, the goal now is clear for any feedible structure psi on Briskland homoisphere, we will prove that this contact loss fails to satisfy the condition on the previous slide. And if you do that, then we are done. And it is enough to just focus on fillable structures because if it is going to be Structures because if it is going to be a contact-type hypersurface, it better at the boundary of a separate manifold. Okay, so maybe a couple facts. So, as we all know, Hagar floor homology has this splitting, which is that you have a tower and you have this finite dimensional piece, so-called the reduced part. And also, because contact class in the plus version is the kind of the image of the contact class. Kind of the image of the contact class in the head version necessarily has to lie in the kernel of the UMAP. This is an endomorphism on HF. And moreover, if you look at the button generator of this power, if you call it theta plus, then contact type embedding forces that, okay, then indeed the contact loss and then this particular generator, they have to be the same. Okay. Be same, okay. Again, assuming that we have a contact type embedding, so then now our strategy. So, for what will be the strategy? First, like a little bit information. So, for any class in HF plus, you can look at a particular nut invariant denoted by this, tau x, y, k, where k is the nut in three manifold. This is developed by Oshwat, Zabo, and independent Rossmussen. And as we all know, in the case of YS3. All know in the case of ys3 for a knot in s3, so this is so-called the tau invariant. And now, here is the strategy. So, what we're going to do, we will exhibit a knot in this cipher fiber space in this Briskon sphere for which indeed calculating tau with respect to contact invariant, if you take the clause to be contact invariant or theta plus, we will prove that for this particular nut, these two, this not invariance will not be equal. And that will imply that. And that will imply that contact loss is not equal to theta plus, and hence there cannot be contact embedding, contact type embedding. Okay, this is the strategy. And now we need to do some work towards that. So, okay, so first of all, what is our not is actually quite easy to describe. So let me. I'm sorry, kind of I'm already in. So maybe let me. Maybe let me do this. So, this is our cipher-fiber space. This is zero, and we have, I don't know, a1 over some a1 prime, and it goes like this: some a n over a n prime, and then our naught will be exactly this, the so-called regular fiber. This is our k, okay? Or in, I recently learned that it's also called cipher loop, so this is our k. And for this k, um, we would like to prove that how tau coming from the contact clause and tau coming from the tax. From the contact clause and tau coming from theta plus, they are different. So, and to do that, we would like to look at their difference and get an estimate for that difference and prove that that difference is always strictly positive. So, okay, so for such an K, once you make it Legendre, there is an upper bound coming from some earlier work of Hedden, which is that this says here it is a bound on TB. But in our context, we will. Context, we will need a slightly different type of quantity that kind of replaces Turston-Banekin number. That is the so-called maximum twisting number. So this is what we're going to use. So we will appropriately go from Tursten-Beneken to Twisting number, which we can. But once we do that, we get a lower bound on the tau invariant coming for the contact class. So this one is quick. One is quick. And we also have an estimate coming from the tau of theta plus, and this is combining some earlier work of catching rao and head and rau. And that is this result. Here, so not k is in the boundary of a three-manifold, where it is y is the boundary of a negative definite four-manifold. In our case, in the case of Briscoe-Human. In our case, in the case of Brisko-Humer Spears, we look at the underlying plumbing diagram, and that's negative definite if you choose the orientation to be the correct one. In particular, for people who might know, we want the central curve eventually after normalizing Saturn invariance to be minus one. Anyhow, this is some sort of adjunction formula they give. Here, T, the spin C structure is wanted to be sharp spin C. Is wanted to be sharp spin C structure. So, in our case, R naught, our regular fiber will be soloist in the negative definite point I just talked about it. And using this, we get an upper bound for yes. Can you remind me, please, what sharp means? Oh, I think in this context, if you puncture this negative definite manifold and look at it as a cobordism from S3 to Cobordism from S3 to boundary Y. So sharp is that this degree has to be the D invariant. So normally degree is less than or equal to, you want it to be exactly equal. Okay, thank you. You are. Okay, so from this, we get an upper bound on the tau for the, if you wish, for the smooth tau. So, okay, and then you do some work by identifying. And then you do some work by identifying various kinds of quantities here. You do some work and you get that indeed the difference between tau coming from contact plus and tau coming from smooth theta plus here is a lower bound on that. Okay, it involves twisting number, it involves the quantities a1 through a n. So if you can prove that this kind of the quantity here is actually positive, then we'll be done. And that is exactly the content of this theorem, which is that indeed for Which is that indeed for any contact structure on Brisk and homoispheres, you can find this lower bound on the twisting number. So this twisting number, if you actually choose a particular homology sphere, Briskan sphere, actually can be much, much better. But our goal is not to kind of find the most kind of, you know, increase the twisting number the best way we can, but rather have. Best way we can, but rather have one lower bond that works for all contact structures. And in this case, we can do this, and that is good enough to obtain what we need. So, this is the essentially summary of the proof. So, maybe in the last few minutes, I want to kind of give some final remark. If you remember, at the very beginning, I talked about various implications. I talked about various implications. We had something about a three-manifold bonding homology ball or being embedded in R4 smoothly or being contact type, being pseudo-convex or rationally convex. But there was also something called polynomial convexity. And that is just very similar to rational convexity, a refiner version of convexity studied in complex geometry, complex function theory. And the key there is that it is like now instead of having a kind of extending symplectic structure from the domain to the symplatic structure on the Keller structure on the ambient manifold, you even want to control the J-convex function involved or I-convex function involved. Or equante, this polynomial convex domain are those in Cn at least that you can attach to them kind of handles. Kind of handles a half-dimension or smaller and reach four, I guess, two m-ball or four-ball in this case. Anyhow, so for this polynomial convex domains, there is a conjecture of syllaba-Kaliasbrak, which says that if the domain is simply connected, then it has to be sub-critical. And indeed, Eliasberg, in not Uh, Ali Ashberg, in not in a paper but in a talk, says that possibly in the case of domains in C2, you don't even need simply connectedness assumption. If you have a polynomial convex domain, then they have to be subcritical. And that essentially will say that, yeah, symplectic topology of such domains is completely pinned down. So I just want to mention that if you're in complex dimension three and above, Cedar Baker Kaliasberg, they provide Sidabaka Yashberg, they provide an example of a non-simply connected point convex domain, which is not subcritical. So it's really unclear. But I just want to point out that this is really more like a remark because what I will say here really more or less follows from the existing literature. But I just want to put it in context because later on, when I pose a question, this will be useful. But anyhow, what we can prove is But anyhow, what we can prove: if you have a polynomial convex domain in C2, if it is either simply connected or the boundary is a rational moisture, then indeed the domain is not just subcritical, but indeed it has to be for both. So again, it's possible that maybe for any such domain, this will be the case, but then of course, potentially it could be a one-handle or connected sum of or bounded sum of one handles. In other words, they In other words, there is a room that it is subcritical, but we don't know how to prove it in general. Okay, I think I'm very close to the end. I just want to maybe state some questions. So what I could prove here for you is that what could be proved is that for brisk conhomoised spheres, they cannot be contact-type hypersurface in R4. And the question is that. For and the question is: are there any? I mean, how about looking at hyperlic homology spheres? And there's a conjecture of Wei Min Chen. Indeed, the only contact type hypersurface in R4 must be S3. So, of course, we can ask the same question in the case of some other sympathetic manifolds, for example, CP2. There is some relevant work that done by. There is some relevant work that done by Raymond Chan and also by Evan Smith in the case of Lens spaces. You might also be kind of asking similar questions for Stein manifolds other than Cn or in our case C2. This is somewhat studied in Elyashbrak Silvak's recent paper from 2015. And if you remember, I mentioned about these various implications and implications and it is still a question that okay to look at to what extent some of the debt implications could be could be reversed. In our paper, we kind of to comment about this quite a bit, provide examples, we understand some of the kind of the implications and whether that can be reversed or not, but not all of it. And maybe a kind of the interesting angle on all of this research is this kind of interesting Uh, kind of interesting question pops up, which is that this uh Leuville cobordism versus Stein or Weinstein cobordism in the mention four, this is kind of poorly understood, but it's quite important. And it is, it also plays somehow in the background plays a role. In particular, this distinction between rational convex domains and polynomial convex domain is exactly equivalent to whether a new cobordism can be upgraded to. Can be upgraded to a win-stink cobordism. And of course, I mean, we know that this cannot be done in the context of the rational homology spheres. And of course, finally, we still don't have an answer to Gomes' problem. It is, if he is right, which I like to believe that he's right, indeed, Briesko's fears will not even embed a stein domain, the most basic sense, holomorphically convex way. Sense solomorphically convex way in C2. Okay, I think this is all I have. Thank you. I have a maybe slightly out to lunch. Out to lunch, question related to the sort of the theme of the talk. Am I being heard? I can't tell. Okay, fine. So one of the old sources for people wondering about embeddings of closed three manifolds in the four-sphere was the idea of doubly, you know, doubly sliced knots. If you have a doubly sliced knot in the three-sphere, then by taking a branch cover over. By taking a branch cover over this sort of unknotted two-sphere, you get an embedding, a smooth embedding in S4. So any cyclic. So does this, do your results sort of say if you, I don't know, you know, sort of pile some more symplectic geometry on sort of the nature of the two slices for your knot, does that tell you something about restricting what doubly slices? What some doubly sliced knots might look like. In other words, that would produce one of these symplectic embeddings or convex embeddings or something like this. Is there any hope of doing that? In effect, one of the domain W that you're getting would then acquire some kind of nice structure. Are there any results of that sort? I don't know any, but you may remember we had the conversation about that. I mean, as we know, land spaces, they don't embed in our forest mootly. But if you do this kind of the trick of what you explained about using double-sliced NOS, you can actually see how for certain land spaces, like those that LPQ swear P is even, I guess, if you connect the summit. I guess if you connect the summit with its reverse orientation reversal, then it does embed in R4 actually smoothly. And they're exactly those indeed. And for those, you might ask that, do they embed, I guess, symplectically or in a stein fashion? I mean, I wrote a paper about that with John Etnyer. We proved that that's not possible. But I guess that is not quite an answer to your question. So it has been so far preventing. has been so far preventing for such embeddings to happen but less so about providing such i will only say that like in our paper we give many infinite examples for example generalizing nemirovsky siegel's example to prove provide many stein domains in c2 and indeed we actually don't know if they are nicer than that but nothing in true what you described and maybe other people know Maybe other people know I'm happy to hear if someone else has to say has something to say. Thanks. So I have a question. This is Olga. So maybe I just first want to confirm that I understood the condition correctly in your theory where you work with the contact invariant and prove certain properties. So is this condition equivalent to saying that this contact invariant in H? In HF is not in the image of U of the U map on HF plus. Is it something different? So the contact condition just say that if, sorry, the so if you have a contact type hypersurface embedding, that what it says, as long as you have that embedding, then you have a contact structure. Have a contact structure, it is either fillable or it's contact non-zero, then indeed it says that it has to be non-zero in the reduced part. But assuming you have a contact type embedding, if that does not imply it has to be zero in the reduced part. Yeah. It's the same condition on the contact structure as for a plainer open book. The contact type embedding implies the same condition. Type embedding implies the same condition as having a planar open book does. Okay, so I don't know if it's relevant, but I wanted to mention that we had a theorem with Kyoto Butnar about looking at contact manifolds, which are contact structures and link of a complex surface singularity. And then you can prove that unless this is a NL space, unless this is a Russian singularity, then the contact element will not be in the image of you. Be in the image of you. If that's the condition you're looking for, maybe I need more time to understand if this is related, then I think you have a wider fame, your result might be applicable to a wider family of manifolds. So the only comment I have, so this is, so in the case you're considering, are you focusing on the mineral feedable contact structure? Yes. So is your result for an arbitrary universe to look at arbitrary. for an arbitrary you need to look at arbitrary exactly yeah okay i see okay that makes sense so that that's kind of the that kind of the makes this is why you need to really kind of understand the kind of the general um i guess like the the the twisting calculation for for arbitrary filibustration on on the baseline thank you i have a comment on thomson uh comment on the fact that you get the same obstruction as having a planar open book decomposition A planar open book decomposition. And I think because those contour structures are planar, so more or less it should work like you compactify R4 to CP2, you take the line at infinity, you start propagating inside, and then you stretch the neck. It's sort of what, I mean, often I did that for S3, but it should probably work also in your situation. And that's what you get in the. What you get in the contact manifold is a plan is something like, well, it's not really probably a planar open book, but it should be something similar. So my guess is that you can use some simpletic stuff to prove that it's a planar. But I don't know if you get exactly the same or something. Exactly the same, or something, it was something slightly weaker. So it's that's more a question for Chris Wendell. But I mean, what was saying the relation is geometric. I mean, the reason why you get the same invariant is because there is a geometric relation between the two constants. Okay, well, if there's no more questions, then And thank you for your talk. So we'll resume at 2.30. And thanks to the virtual participants. We really appreciate this hybrid workshop as worked out. Thanks in great part to your participation and your questions. Well, for the non-virtual participants, this For the non-virtual participants, this is a part of the weather, it is wonderful for people out there. The weather here in BayF is wonderful. But people here who have to go back to the U.S., you have to think about your COVID test. And I guess it's go rapid on 220 Bear Street in Lamall. Apparently, you pay online and then you through just as quickly. If you're disorganized or just habitually late as I am, the fallback. The fallback is you can get a test at the Calgary Airport with Switch L. I think you have John Baldwin did the one in town yesterday and I certified it was a total 10-day process. And I'm not commenting on John. He hasn't made it across the board yet. I saw his name with Catcher on his phone in about 20 minutes, but that might be a testy feature. It's a different video. Yeah, that's a different feature. You have to pay more for that. And for so we'll use the room so you guys can chat as long as you want.
