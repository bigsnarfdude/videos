Of the electron diffusion system and its symmetry, I mainly consider a fissure KPP equation. Sorry. In fact, we always use reaction diffusion systems in unbounded domain to consider the biological invasion and the spatial propagation of epidemic. When we consider these models, we have two questions. These models, we have two questions. The first one is kind of propagation happening in every direction. The second is which direction is the propagation fastest in? In other words, can we compare the propagation speed in different directions? So we want to consider these two questions. Mainly for facial KPP. mainly for facial kpp the accent diffusion and the with the vocation equations the following the following one this is a classical facial kpb equations where we always assume our parameter a b c are almost periodic functions and of course we assume the diffusion diffusion rate a is larger than zero and we also suppose And we also suppose the birth rate C is also larger than zero, is a positive. And here we have some simple examples of almost periodic functions. In fact, it's the almost periodic functions are the extension of periodic functions. The simplest example is. Example is sine x, the one periodic functions. And then the following example: sine x plus sine pi x, since there are two different frequencies. So this is almost a periodic function. In fact, it's also called a quasi-periodic function. And we also can consider the following examples that are it's the sum of sine lambda n x over the square of n and there are infinitely many frequents and we also And we also can give a process definition of the almost periodic functions in the following. f is called almost periodic functions if and only if the whole of f is compact compact in l infinity topology in fact if the whole of f is compact then the whole the whole is just the torus the The torus, the finite dimensional torus, and all the infinity dimensional torus. And then the basic propagation phenomena of the phased RKPP equation can be described by the surviving speed. We give a process definition in what follows. In fact, this definition is well known. Everything is well known. And since here, one is stable steady states, and the zero is unstable steady states. So we use these two limits to define the spider speed. And here we also another condition, another have seen the omega we use omega plus. Omega plus is the propagation speed. Propagation speed in the positive directions and the omega minus is the span speed in the negative directions. Here we always assume that omega minus plus omega plus is less than zero. That means in mathematical biology, it means the habitat of the biological habitat of the the habitat of the of the species is larger and larger and larger and increase in the speed of omega minus and omega plus omega plus and in fact we can prove the following theorem the spanish Theorem, the spread speed omega plus and omega minus of the phase KP equation in almost the periodic media always exists. And we also can then in this case for facial KPP equations, the general questions, can the propagation hypothesis every every direction become at the spread speed? Spread speed omega plus and omega minus always positive. On the second question: question: which direction is the propagation facility tested in become becomes which is large, the omega minus or omega plus? Then here we want to give a complete answer to the question two. This is our main result. The sine of omega minus plus minus. Minus omega plus is equal to the sign of this value of B over A R. And based on these results, we also can show some possible answer to question one. And we, in fact, we give some sufficient conditions and give some simple Give some simple counter examples. In fact, that means we can see the omega general, generally, omega plus or omega minus may not always be positive, but we can give some sufficient conditions to guarantee omega plus and omega minus are positive. And to prove our main results, we need the variational discrepancy of the speed in the positive and negative directions. In fact, it is known that the dynamics and the propagation phenomena of the phase RKPP equation is linear determined. To consider its spinning speeds, we only need to consider the linear radar equation. linear right equation near zero. This is the following equation. Ut is equal to r u here r is a operator, the linear related operator of the physical KPP equations. And here we also want to consider the respective principle and value problem of this operator. And this is the following theorem. The following theorem is a well-known result. In fact, at least in a lot of cases, in homogeneous case, specially periodic case, time periodic case, and many other cases. That's omega minus is equal to the minimum of gamma minus p over p and omega plus is equal to the minimum of. is equal to the minimum of gamma p over p, where we have the definition. The following is the definition of the gamma p. Gamma p is the info shape of the this L on the on the E minus PX times the L. minus px times pi and over e minus px times pi here psi is in the following space possib is a c1 sorry is a c2 is a c2 function and the less than zero and the possib prime over pi is infinity Psi is infinity functions. And we also have suppose the line of pi over x is limited is equal to zero. In fact, such a definition was given by Professor Bertake and others. They call this gamma P, the generalized. gamma p, the generalized principle at value of L. I will explain why this gamma p is called the generalized principle argue value of value later. And here, since we have such a variational formula of omega minus and omega plus, then we can say if gamma p is larger than gamma minus p for all Gamma minus p for all p larger than zero. Then omega plus is larger than omega minus. Then this is our one lemma to consider the which is large, omega plus and omega minus. And then we consider the operator, the linear operator L and its When A, B, C are constants, it's easy to check that for NAP and phi P equal to E P X as a positive egg function and the corresponding egg value is equal to lambda is lambda p is equal to is equal to A times the square of P plus B P plus C. And we also categorize this function as this. And it's easy to see if A, B, C are constants, then lambda is a symmetry in P with a symmetric axis P is equal to minus B over 2A. And our question is, how about And our question is: How about the periodic case and the almost periodic case? And here for periodic case, that we suppose ABC are one periodic smooth functions and A is larger than zero. And then we can we define the A0 is all one periodic functions, the space of all one periodic functions. And AP is A p is equal to e minus px times one periodical function. And then it is known the principal argument of lambda of l with the positive argument functions in the space AP exists. In fact, with such a norm, AP is. AP is a Banach space and other Banach Banach space. And in fact, in fact, this case, Piodik case, Lambda also has the variational formula, the following variation formula. And then that's why in this case, lambda is equal to gamma p has zero positive argument functions. Positive argument functions. And then in this case, we also can prove, we can prove the following lemma. Lambda P, lambda is equal to gamma p is symmetric in p with the symmetric axis p zero is equal to the variance value of minus b over 2 to a and then we can And then we can extend this lemma to the more general, almost periodic case. If ABC are almost periodic case, then we can also consider the principle, the generalized principal value lambda equal to gamma p. Then we can show this gamma p is also symmetric in p with the symmetric access it access p0 is we where p0 is also the average value of b over to a minus b over to a and this is our main lemma from this lemma if then from this lemma we can Sorry, the following lemma is also another useful lemma, which is posed in many cases already. If ABC are almost periodic and A is larger than zero, then gamma P is also convex in the parameter P. From this two lemma, we can see that the shape of the gamma P is similar with the parabolic curve. Hyperbolic curve. And then we also have some simple properties. The Pz is a unique minimum point of gamma P and gamma P is in fact is strictly decreasing from minus infinity to P0 and strictly increasing in increasing in P0 to plus infinity. And then we can use gamma gamma inverse plus be the inverse of gamma p on p0 to plus infinity and the gamma minus inverse be the inverse of the gamma p on the minus infinity to p0. And then in with the about in with the above two about two lemmas we can get this lemma the fact that gamma equal to gamma p is a symmetric in p with the symmetric axis period is equivalent to that the gamma plus inverse and the plus gamma minus inverse is equal to two times is equal to two times two P0 for NAP is larger than or equal to gamma P0. Finally, from this result, we can get if P0 is less than 0, then gamma P is larger than gamma minus P and then omega plus the spreading speed in the positive directions. In the positive direction, it is larger than the speed in the negative direction. This is our result. Then, last, we want to prove our main lemma. That means what we need to show is that the gamma plus inverse and plus gamma minus inverse is equal to 2 times p z. Why would we want? Why would we want to consider the inverse functions of gamma p that is the motivation of ours? In our classical point of view on the eigenvalue problem of R associated with the propagation phenomena, we always first give the potential decay rate P and then consider the generalized principal egg value and principle egg value. Principal arg value all generalize the principal value of L in the space of functions with potential decrease rates p. But we also have another point of view, point of view from the dynamical system on the spectral problem of L. Here L can be considered a Schedinger operator or John the Jacobin operates if we consider Schedinger operator If we consider jading operator B is always equal to zero, but in general case, if B is not equal to zero, then we call the operator Jacobian operate. First, you know, dynamical system point of view, we first give a spectral point, Lambda. Lambda is also. Lambda is also considered as the energy of L. Then the gamma plus inverse of lambda and gamma minus inverse of lambda are the abnormal exponents of L with n lambda as x goes to plus or minus infinity respectively. And use this point of view. this point of view we can show our idea of proof to of the gamma plus this equility this equity we only only show the idea of our proof for lambda larger than lambda zero which is enough to get our main results in fact first we can prove the following linear problem has a problem has a unique positive solution and the following two problems and the fun we also can show the solution has the following properties phi gamma prime primary time over phi gamma and the per site gamma prime over per side gamma are almost periodic and then we can And then we can define, we can show the gamma plus inverse is just the Lyapunov function in the following definition, which is larger than zero. And the gamma minus inverse is also the output function in the as x goes to minus infinity, and which is less than zero. And then And then let Q equal to has the following definition and we can get ordinary differential equation of Q gamma. And then we by show this equation, we can get that the following equality. In the following equality, we can find that in the first part, this part, the large Part, the learned part is almost a periodic functions. And this part is just the Lyapunov exponent as x equals to infinity. And this part is Lyapunov exponent as x goes to minus infinity. And that x goes to goes to infinity. We can see this. To infinity, we can see this pattern is good to zero, and this pattern is Lyapunov exponential function gamma plus infinite plus inverse, and this pattern is gamma minus inverse, and we got our conclusion, this limit. This is the member of our result. And we have also have some remark that the first one is the existence under the formula of. The formula of the swan speed in almost periodic media was first showed by Bartike and Nadin in 2012, but with additional condition. And with this condition, they also saw the omega plus and omega minus, both of them are larger than zero. Our probe is just a small modifier. The small modification of this in this part. I guess in that paper, they just consider the speed that should be positive energy under these conditions. However, when we consider a model with the vacation, for example, the river, the phenomena that the spread speed in some directions is negative can appear. So that's why we show their They are additional conditions. Then I want to see the symmetry of publication were first noticed in the paper of Professor Xia Chenzhou and myself for facial KP equation in periodic case. In fact, it's there we show that if there are no advances and the A is a constant, then the spread speed in the positive and the negative speed. In the positive and the negative speeds directions are always equal, we never see a symmetric or not up to a reflection. And then another remark is here we showed that if there are no advanced, then the propagation phenomenon of one dependent official KPP equation is symmetric. However, the symmetry does not always hold for other kinds of non-linearity. For example, For example, V-V and the tombstones, this contract bestable equations without advaccines for this equations. The unique leftward traveling wave and the rightward traveling wave has different speeds. And We D and myself also extend the result to two species competition system. Finally, I want to see the existence of the uniqueness of the Or the uniqueness of the positive solution of the following problem was first proved Zalatos with the condition gamma is larger than gamma zero. And here, the gamma z in his paper has the following definition. Here, our condition is gamma is larger than gamma gamma z. His condition is gamma is His condition is gamma is less than lambda z. May our condition is gamma is large than gamma z. In fact, we can show that gamma z is less than or equal to lambda z. And we also can give some examples where gamma z is just strictly larger than lambda z. Okay, that's my talk. Thank you very much. Have you worked on the existence of almost periodic traveling ways for this kind of OKP? We have a work with the Wagner DAP, but we use similar. But we use similar techniques and we face similar problems, but in the end, what we are able to get is a case of quite a very clearly, sorry. Can you hear me now better? I can hear, but not clearly. So I was asking about the existence of traveling waves. Of traveling waves, almost periodic traveling waves. If I talk about that, because we have a result with Greguarna done, where in the end we are able to get the waves in the Pisi periodic case with some layer of condition, but not in the general almost periodic case. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because instance of traveling waves in almost the periodic cases either more. Is either more thorough conditions in the, I think, in the paper of Nadine and Rossi. Here, I just talk about the spreading speed, not traveling waves. In fact, we don't need such solid conditions. I'm not sure if I I'm not sure if I answered your question since I cannot hear you questions clearly. Sorry. Maybe we can talk later. Can you extend to the higher dimensional team? Oh, sorry. High dimensional is much more difficult. Uh much more difficult. We will have we are considering how they make the case, but for phase RKPP equations, but it's more complicated. In many cases, first we consider the test space RN, and we also want to consider the case in Saland, but both of the cases are very difficult. Very difficult. I will quiet.
