Of all I would like to thank Miroslav and Agnishka for really taking the hard job to organize this workshop under such conditions like we have now. And I would like to proceed with my lecture. First of all, I would like to dedicate this talk to Professor Karajakopal, who was born Who was born on November 24, 1950 in Madras. It is in the south of India, which is 70 years, so the period is just 70 years long. And it's for me great pleasure that more than half of his life he was my teacher, educator, and mentor, and he also helped me significantly. He also helped me significantly to build the group in our alma mater in Charles University in Prague. So we met for the first time in 1992 and he basically brought me to the field of non-Newtonian fluid mechanics, then to the theory of mixtures, viscoelasticity. I was also since the beginning seeing his development of the His development of the implicit constitutive theory. And I also enjoyed his research concerning the modeling of biomaterials, in particular the flows in Aortas in HART. So if you know him, so I put his email address here, and I think that he would be happy for any greetings, of course, in case that. Of course, in case that you know. So, as I mentioned, the implicit constitutive models were here in the place for many, many decades, maybe centuries. But the systematic study was starting around the years 2001. And the first article which Professor Rajakopal wrote on this topic was published in the journal, which is published in the. In the journal which is published in the Institute of Mathematics of Czech Academy of Sciences. The journal is called Application of Mathematics. And I had the pleasure somehow to see the developments of this research area since the beginning. And I like this field very much. And my lecture will also focus on it. The lecture will reflect the joint work, which is somehow in preparation, but Somehow in preparation, but I hope it will be completed before Christmas. And it is joined by this Miroslav Bulicek and my former master's student David Rushka. And it is also linked to the it can be even viewed as the continuation of the research or research result which we obtained with Lisa Beck, Miroslav, Buricek, and Andreas Sili, and which were published in archive in 2017 and which consent some of And which concerns somehow slightly different topics. It is focused in the elasticity field. Okay, and it is also reflecting in some sense also the classification of the incompressible fluids which we did with Jan Brechta and Cara Jacopa in recent papers published in the same journal on mathematical analysis. I will not talk about fluids, in fact. About fluids, in fact, and I will explain why later. But I will talk about the generalization of the scalar heat equation. And you see the equation written here. And I will even simplify it and consider it in spatial periodic setting. And it is not, everybody knows this equation. You can also write in a so-called mixed form. In a so-called mixed form, so when the equation for the motion is du/dt minus divergence of flux is equal to zero, and flux is related to the gradient of the u in linear way. And somehow one can go on with this implicit relation, and instead of considering linear relation, one can consider the implicit relation which relates to the flux and gradient of u. And the gradient of U. And the topic will be focused in one of the models which belong to this class of implicit relations. So let me discuss few of them, which will be related to the topic which I want to discuss. So this implicit relations include two explicit classes. One, when a Q is somehow Is somehow related in non-linear way to the gradient of u, and another one when gradient u is related to the flux in a non-linear way. And the classical examples are so-called power law models or P-Laplacian models when flux is just given in this way. And it can be easily inverted and written in the following equivalent way: that gradient u is just q. is just q in power p prime minus 2 q when p prime is just the dual exponent to p where p is the parameter which is in in the range one infinity one can also generalize it and avoid the degeneracy and singularity singular behavior and one can have these type of models for q and these types of models for for gradient of u what you can see here uh what you can see here that uh that if you if you look in this case for the for the for the limiting case when p goes to one so what you will obtain is the following following model yeah so so if p goes to one you will obtain the following relation while here if p prime goes goes to one so it means that p goes to infinity you obtain the following following response Response. And so this response corresponds somehow when P' goes to 1, it corresponds to the case when P goes to infinity. So I will be talking about the models or about the situation when you somehow have some regularization of the infinity Laplacian. So, and why? Because I will be talking about a model which fits when the special case is the following one, when P prime, when one when p prime when you know in in this range i can take p prime any number for this type of models and if p prime will be equal to one so i will i will get the the model when gradient of the u will be a priori bounded so this is what i am interested so you you can see if you go from here and consider the that that case when p is equal to one you will obtain uh and you can actually Obtain and you can extend it by parameter B. So in this special case, when B is equal to 2, you would obtain the following model. So this is the model when you basically approximate that response, which is related to that, like ideal plasticity. And in this situation, that gradient U is L1 function and Q is. L one function and q is in L infinity. In my case, I will be interested in the following models when I also introduce the parameter A. And in these models, the gradient of U is a priori bounded. So it stays in L infinity. On the other hand, the flux is just L1 quantity. So here you can see the responses for this case. See the responses for this case. Okay, so this is the response of the model for which I'm interested. What is the connection to complex fluid or to the topic of the conference? So I will just describe it by words. So one can look for similar responses between the shear stress and the symmetric part of the velocity gradient and consider the incompressible fluids. So these types Fluids. So these types of responses are like limiting cases of shear-thickening fluids or rapidly shear-thickening fluids, which were, for example, studied using different approach by Agnishka and Pyotr Vyazda, and which also were corresponding to certain experimental data. So there are materials which exhibits for increasing shear rates, very rapid increase of the Very rapid increase of the stresses. So, in certain cases, this can be really described also by this type of response because there are missing basically data what happens for the large shear rates. Okay, so you would obtain this model for incompressible fluids with this type of responses. And if you would consider unsteady simple shear flow, so it means the flow between two parallel plates, you would obtain a You would obtain just that parabolic equations for the one component of the velocity in that shear rate flow. So, exactly the model which I'm interested in discussing today. So, this is again the model which we want to talk about. So, if we look again at the a priori estimates and multiply by u, so this is this is what we get. Of course, here I We get of course, here I am omitting in this estimate the right-hand side, but this can be easily treated if G is in L2 or even more general. And somehow, if we use the constantification here for the response, so what we obtain is the following information, and this just gives the information that Q. That Q is just L1 function, while gradient U is, in addition, quite nice function, it is a bounded function. But this fact that flux is L1 function is a significant drawback or significant problem for the analysis of this type of equation. Okay, so I will give the definition of the weak solution. Still, it likes motivates. So, basically, this setting which comes from these first a priori estimates suggests that L1 Lebesgue space for the flux is somehow natural space. So, we ask the question: can we construct a solution so that Q for That Q for that solution will be L1 function. And we would like to answer this question positively for all values of parameter A. Okay, so this is the question which I am asking. Is it possible? So here is the definition of the weak solution. So as I said, the gradient U, we know that it is a priori bounded. We may show that in this setting that time derivative is L2 function. That time derivative is L2 function. We would like to have q1 function. We would like to meet this relation pointwise almost everywhere. And we would like to show some of the fulfillment of the weak formulations of the governing equation. So here is the main troublemaker to show that really we can have the q as the l1 function in our weak formulation. Why? Because L1 is not reflexive. There is, however, additional new problem with this system of equation, and this is somehow the loss of information. We have the problem in that limiting cases. So similar situation happens if p is equal to 1. Here we are having the model when p is somehow going to infinity, p prime is equal to 1. And so this. So, this loss of information is somehow of two kinds. Yes, so first one is written here, and this is that if you look at some of this information, so this is that quadratic product when here we have the derivative of our nonlinear function. So, Fq is defined here, so this is the non-linear function. This is that non-linear function. We take the yeah, Jacobian with respect to Q, we create this quadratic matrix, and when we look for the upper and lower bound, so what we see that the weights are not the same. So this will not happen for the P La plus operator. But even more, if you go with P to one or P P prime to going one, so you will have more better. better information and suddenly for p p p prime equal to one there is a drop of the of the power of course this this drop can be just somehow safe by a if a goes to zero so there is like continuation with with a equal to zero you will get uh you you have these different powers but if you would for example take a equal to two you would get less information due to the where's weight Due to the worst weight, which would drop with the exponent 2. Okay, this I think. On the other hand, yes, from the formula for the inequalities which are in the boxed formula, so you can see that one can check it also from taking this derivative, that this expression represents. Represents the scalar product in Rd, which is somehow equivalent to the classical scalar product generated by Euclidean norm in Rd. Okay, so this is written here in some with different notation. So if we introduce the matrix A, which is exactly this matrix. Exactly, this matrix. And if we build some of the scale product Zu or ZZ with this weight and denote it by Z square, and this is exactly that form which we have here. So we see that from this inequality that it is equivalent to the Euclidean norm. And this somehow will be exploited in the analysis at least in two steps. Steps. Okay, so here is the result, which really took some time. So this result has its history, almost decade years. And the result is the following one. I mean, not for this problem, but the whole development for this limiting strain models, etc. So, if the initial data is such that it should be less or equal than one in order to. Less or equal than one in order to somehow be compatible with the constant equation. But we require something which can be analog of the safe log condition that the gradient u0 in L infinity is strictly below one. And g is L2 function, then independently of A, so for any A, we can show that there exist unique weak solutions to this problem in the sense of. To this problem, in the sense of above definition. And this is somehow the main and the most interesting result. There is also some regularity statement, and this corresponds to the fact that, as I mentioned, that if A is small, and in particular, if A is in the interval 0, 2 over D plus 1, and if data are smoother, so then one can show that even the flux is in better space. In better space than L1. So, in this range, the analysis is somehow simple. So, basically, it finally one can get certain differentiability, high differentiability, and you can do not have problem to pass to the limit. So, I will mainly focus on the remaining three minutes on these main ideas of this proof. So, of course, one So, of course, one needs to start with certain approximations. I will introduce them. And then somehow the tool is, since we do not know the first a priori estimate how to use them to handle this problem, so we try to use higher differentiable techniques. But due to that loss of information, this higher differentiability technique does not provide any apparently higher differentiability for flux. Differentiability for flux. But what one can use is that one can get the second derivative control of the second derivative of the U. The next step can be done in several ways. We have two. So one can show that for this approximation, we have almost every convergence of the fluxes. So we also get via FA2 lemma that Q will be The Q will be L1 function. But still, even this information almost everywhere, convergence and belonging to L1 is not sufficient to take the limit in the governing equation. It is good for the attainment of that Q-gradient U relation. So the constitutive implicit relation is met, or this relation for Q and gradient U. So what we use is. What we use is and also like historical procedure that one can establish the existence of a renormalized solution. But there is like surprise that one can really pass to the limit with the renormalization and conclude that when parameter k in this renormalization goes to infinity, one obtains this governing equation for u and q. And q so this is the approximation. So the additional term is just here in the constitutive equation. This is the first estimates. This is the same. So instead of L infinity estimates, we have that gradient u is just L1 function due to this is the consequence of that. On the other hand, Q is epsilon is in L two, but In L2, but with this information is loss if epsilon goes to zero. So here are the higher differentiability estimates. So we have the time derivative in L2 and we have the following information. So this is like key points for the analysis. So that we have the gradient of the flux bounded Bounded in L2, but with this weight, yes, with not very good weight. In fact, if we just want, and one needs to really work with exactly with this norm. One could directly get from here that this quantity is somehow bounded. But if one only works with this quantity, so it's not clear how to really. It's not clear how to really prove the results. So, that information, which is somehow a little lost here. So, this is important that this somehow plays a key role. If one has this information, which is in the circle, which I copied here again, so from here one can conclude this regularity estimates, and I will skip them. Okay, this is just some because it's for the time derivative. It's for the time derivative, and it is also for the spatial derivative with a certain weight. So it gives this information. So it gives a restriction that A has to be smaller than one. But if one use the embedding theorem, so one will get this even stronger bounds, this bound in order to get some improvement for the flux. So this is basically that second part. I think my time is. I think my time is probably over. So I have two slides, which contains the key information. So almost at least I want to show how one can play with this equivalent norm. So if one has this information, so one can get the information. One can get the information about the second derivative of u or u epsilon. Yes, it should be everywhere u epsilon. So one can use that second derivative of u. So one can use this constitutive equation and due to that relation between the gradient u and q, one will obtain from one of these terms this expression. So this by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, This by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality can be estimated in that weighted norm. And if one use that fact that this weighted norm is equivalent with the classical Euclidian norm, so one will get that estimates for the second derivative directly using this. And from this, one can get almost everywhere convergence for the gradients, which by Yegorovsk gives uniform convergence on On the set Q delta up to small measure. Similarly, by Shekun-Biting lemma, one will get that Q epsilon converge weakly to Q in L1 on Q delta. And using some of the fact that the operator is strictly monotone, so one can get almost everywhere convergence for Q. So the last thing is to show how the governing equation is met. Governing equation mismatch. And this is done by this truncation function when this TKQ delta are just approximating one. Okay, so and I put right-hand side to be equal to zero. So we see that here we can easily pass to the limit. This is L2 function, and this we can go to the one. We have a gradient of this test function, which is smooth, and this. Test function, which is smooth, and this truncation function, which we can split it into two parts. One is good one, so when the gradient psi is here and take on this truncation function goes to one, and the rest. And the rest is shown to go to zero. And this is the last thing which I would like to show. It is just some play with you extended this expression by the same quantity and. The same quantity, and you can rewrite it into this form. So, this form when this function g, it should be like this, has linear growth. And it is due to the derivative, it has the support only from certain k up to the infinity. And you can again integrate back. Can again integrate back to these two functions, you will get two terms. One is again good one or easy to treat, but the another ones can be again estimated using this Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, working with these weighted norms, and you will obtain these two terms. This is exactly that for which we have this uniform bounds, and the second one, luckily. As I mentioned above, this has linear growth, so it goes quadratically, but the weight is such that it reduces one of these powers. So, totally, this grows linearly, and again it vanishes for k going to infinity. So, this was the proof of the theorem. Thank you very much, and thank you for taking more time than I was supposed to take. I took all time. I took all time for my questions.
