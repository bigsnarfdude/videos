Structures. So, the example that will be very interesting for most of the talk, and only at the end, you will see other examples, is of course the example of three-dimensional cubic, which let me briefly remind you, as shown by Griffith and Clemens. 50 years ago, is generic smooth one, and actually smooth ones are not rational just because if you look at their intermediate Jacobian and its theta divisor, the co-dimension of singularities, as this is the theta divisor, is equal to five, and as it falls from Andriotti-Meyer theory, this This, I mean, this was a Jacobian, the codimension is at most four. So, as a result, this cannot be a Jacobian of a smooth curve. Therefore, the corresponding three-dimensional cubic is not rational. So, now I have been talking for Talking for quite some time about these new invariants, which come from splitting of the homology using the eigenvalues of the quantum multiplication by k. But what I would like to do in this talk is to upgrade this invariance and basically reduce the calculation of the rationality of some of these funnels that we are going to. Of some of these funnels that we are going to considering just to a single number. You compute a number and then depending of its value, you decide if your variety is rational or not. So, in fact, there are many numbers and many invariants in such a way, but I'll mainly talk about one of them and then, of course, outline some procedures. Outline some procedures for getting colors. So let me basically start with something that I have been looking for quite some time. And this is the cubic, but this time on its mirror side. So the Wando-Ginsburg model of this cubic is a function W on On C3 C star to the third, given by the following equation W or F. So now obviously this is a family of open K3 surfaces and after you clear denominator you get a surface, so you have a generic fiber depending Generic fiber depending on V to be surfaces of degree 4. And if you analyze what this family looks like, it's a family of open catered surfaces at the central fiber, meaning cover zero. You have a very complicated open curve, which is three-rational surfaces. Is three-directional surfaces intersecting in one triple line. And so I've been staring at this picture for quite some time, trying to actually analyze what this means and how can I actually get a virational invariant out of this situation. And so the first attempt was to look at the monogram of this family of K-3 surfaces. This family of K-3 surfaces acting on the transcendental part of this family of K-3 surfaces after some compactification. And so this monodromy, so the transcendental part is rank 3 in this case, looks like this matrix 1, epsilon, and epsilon square. So when epsilon is a third root of unity. So in fact, it was observed by Brzezolkovsky and myself. By Przelkovsky and myself, that actually for all funnels of rank one, these funnels are rational if and only if this monodromy on the acting on this transcendental part is strictly unipotent. So this one is not strictly unipotent as a result. This is not a rational surface. But this theorem actually was proven in a very stupid Proven in a very stupid way, mainly we did know from Miskovsky's classification what are the funnels with Picar1, and then we just computed this monodromis. And so it just by observing what the result is, we make this connection. But it has been a goal of mine to really understand what is this reason for this fact that these things are actually. Things are actually not rational if this monodromy is of this type, and today I'll actually give the answer to this question. So the answer, of course, is categorical, but you don't need to compute any categories or anything like that in order to really get to this. So once again, make variational invariance out of the Lando-Ginsburg model of its singularities. Of its singularities, and so, in fact, in the process of doing so, we will just get many numbers, not just one number, basically utilizing all theory of multiplier ideal shifts and all new developments by Poppe and Mustaza. And in fact, many And in fact, many of these things could lead to symplectic invariants as well. In fact, so all these braid factorizations that we did with Donaldson and Dini some time ago enter the game quite naturally due to the fact that Steenbrick, Saito, and company have developed the theory of spectra of mixed cost structure quite deeply. So, what one can actually notice, and we know this from Kuznetsov's work, that if you consider the category association model, or if you like, if you consider the category of the three-dimensional cubic, it has a semorthogonal decomposition of the following form. Position of the following form. And of course, in this case, this category C is a fractional collabial category which has a surf functor satisfying the following equation. So this observation will play an important role in our further considerations. Considerations. So, once again, is get the information out of this singularity theory of the Lando-Ginsburg model. And in fact, as I mentioned, I'm not so sure I'll be able to go into detail today into this. So, this is pretty much related to the fact that we have the Frobenius manifolds, and then there is a monodrome reaction of Reaction of certain twists by ample line bundle, and that gives you additional filtration, which is in a way the filtration which I'll be describing more or less in this talk. Can I interrupt you for a minute? Yep. Should I think about the Landau-Gins model as the mirror of the as the A model version of the B model, which is the funnel? The funnel, or do I think about the B model, which is the fun, or do I think about which one is the B model? Which one is the A model? B model is the smooth projective funnel. Okay. And on the so I mean, I wrote here the splitting or db of x, but of course, this is equivalent to the Foucault sidel category of this potential W. So W over C star to the t. Okay. Thank you. And of course, as I said, so this phenomenon can be taught as a symplectic manifold, and it has a symplectic structure and ground width and theory, which leads to the Frobenius manifold associated. The Frobenius manifold associated with this three-dimensional funnel. So, all of these are considered on the same smooth projective funnel, considered first as a smooth projective variety, and then, of course, as a symplectic manifold. So, you don't need mirror symmetry in order to make these considerations, but indeed. But indeed, when it comes to thinking about it, and maybe to when it comes to calculations, so you sorry to interrupt, Lumel. Also, when you're saying this equivalence, right, I think, I don't know if you mentioned, but this fiber you have is actually C, right, and this equivalence. Say it again? This fiber corresponds to just the. Just the admissible category C with the serf functor, right? Yeah, yeah. So, this correct corresponds to this category C. So, this is, as I mentioned, a fractional collaborator, which satisfies this property. So, now, as I have mentioned, As I have mentioned before, so I mean, I will not go in detail toward this, but so the quantum multiplication by k defines splitting of the homology of my quantum variety. And so, this splitting is done by the eigenvalues of the quantum multiplication. The eigenvalues of the quantum multiplication by k. So, in fact, this indeed corresponds to the Hochshuk homology of the corresponding categories, but this is not the way we think about this. So this is H lambda 0, H lambda 1, and H lambda 2. So, but everything can be taught as a splitting of the homology of x with respect of the eigenvalues of the quantum multiplication by lambda i. And so, using blob formulas for Gromo-Wittlen theory, one can show. Grown-witten theory, one can show that this splitting is a virational invariant, meaning that if you blow up something, then what you add is just additional pieces in co-dimension two and third, which do not interact with the pieces which you already have in this printing. So now, as I said, in this Lando-Ginsburg model, we have a monodromy which acts on this cohomology. And what we want to do is get some invariance out of this action. So, but before I do that, I want to recall some classical theory of isolated and non-isolated singularities, which we will be trying to implement in this case of Lando-Ginsburg model. So, So let me start with a simple example of the AK singularity Z0 to power K plus 1 plus Z1 in power 2 and so on plus Zn in power 2. So now this in this situation if you go to the classical theory of Arnold, Varchenko, then Seitel, Cyto, steam bring, another side to, and so on. So, to this singularity, they defined the following number, the spectrum of this singularity, which is a number described as follows. And so, it's some between zero and to n of one over k plus. uh of one over k plus sorry uh sorry k is from uh zero to n one over k plus one plus n over two minus one and so this number uh is so-called mixed force structure spectrum associated with this singularity and so the So the interest that of us are going to be this number one over k plus one, which we are going to try to study. So this has been developed further. And in fact, if you have a function f with noise-related singularity, you can add to it some linear. Some linear polynomial in power k. So we get sort of a pencil in this form. And then for each k, you can define additional spectrum associated with this configuration f plus l in power k. So as you can see, for each choice of k, you actually define a actually define additional series of additional numbers like that, or you can think about this as a series of numbers. So out of one singularities defined by f, you define many others and topologically these numbers are obtained as false. So in this family given by F, you have a monodromy around the singular fiber. Around the singular fiber, but then if you add this L in power K, so you have some intersections with this L K. And so it defines as, I mean, a perversion of vanishing cycles associated with your singular fiber. And then, so, with this perversion of vanishing cycles, you define the high. For vanishing cycles, you define the hyperhomologies, and so we have a monodromy action on this hyperchomology. And then these spectrums are nothing else but the eigenvalues of the monodromy acting on these homologies. And the spectrum is just a way to collect all this information in one number, or you can actually form a series. Form a series, and so on, and so on. So, this spectrum is an invariant of this singularity, although, of course, there is not really a theorem, it's much weaker than the singularity itself. So, what we'll be trying to do is basically take this classical theory of perversive of vanishing cycles, and of course, try to replace it by perversive of categories. Of categories and get the maximum out of this by getting all these invariants from perversion of vanishing cycles to developed by many people. I mean, actually Budur, Saito, and then recently Popo and Nostaza. And so what we will try to do is basically To do is basically mimic this in the case of categories, but instead of working with the perversion of vanishing cycle associated with these singularities, we are going to work with perversion of categories. And in fact, this already can be done in the example of AK, which I gave here. So you can think of this as a category of vanishing. Category of vanishing cycle and vanishing cycles, and then so you can try to think of these numbers or the spectrum that appears there as things that are related to this category of vanishing cycles. So that's what I'll try to suggest actually on a very simple example, and so that's Just one of these numbers. So basically, what I would like to propose is what is the analog of this one over k plus one. I mean, in a way, the smallest number in the considerations of Lando-Ginsburg models, or if you like, in the considerations of categories. And so And so the connection between this number lambda, which is equal to, in this case, one over k plus one, one over k and so on and so on, and the number that I'm going to introduce in the categorical situation is that this is delta new number, which we defined like dimension of the edge. Which we defined like the dimension of the x, the space over which my function is defined, minus 2 lambda, where lambda is the smallest number in the sum of the spectrum. And so from this perspective, if I just look at the function f, which is sum of square, so dimension in this case is m, so the lambda in this case is m over 2, so the number that they get in. So, the number that they get in such a way is just zero. And if this is just one variable, so zero to the n, so the number that I'm getting, delta, using this is one minus twon. So, many of these calculations and many of these interpretations can be found in the book of singularities by Arnold. Arnold Varchenko and Boussé Zadeh. So, I mean, I passed an exam with Varchenko in 1987. I didn't do very well, and probably that already can be noticed here. So now, what Steambring proved. Timbering proved, it was a conjecture of Arnold, so the smallest number which appears in the spectrum, not only for dissingularity, but in general, is super semi-continuous. And so this is actually a very hard theorem, which is proven using the theory of mixed core structures. But what I'll do is basically prove for you, well, at least give you an idea why. Give you an idea why this number delta is upper semi-continuous, and we use this fact in order to define the variational invariant of what we already have. So, now how do we think about these numbers in terms of them coming from the Them coming from the differential equations. In other words, how do we think about them avoiding mirror symmetry? So, I mean, of course, we imitate the classical Magran story here, that you have D modules, and so we have these differential equations, and so we have their solutions. And then these numbers that we are trying to compute are not. Are trying to compute are nothing else but the asymptotics of the solutions of these differential equations. So, once again, so we're on X as a funnel, some projective variety, but we enhance it with this Rubinio structure. And so, I mean, as described in KKP, so this Frobenius structure is Structure is nothing else but a differential equation of this form, and so the solutions of these differential equations are basically vector space, which actually they are having asymptotic expansions, which depends on delta j. J these are rational numbers, and then you have logarithms in power k which are I mean also I mean so these integers so I mean uh it is believed that all of these numbers in the case we are considering have categorical meaning. Categorical meaning. And so they are actually all defined by rational invariance. But today I'll be concerned mainly with the smallest one and I'll define what the categorical meaning is for it. In fact, I already indicated what that could possibly be. So this first number, the smallest one, is going to be related to the degree of the surfactor acting. Of the surfactor acting on this category C, which I got in this semi-orthogonal decomposition, so-called Griffiths-Kuznitsov component. So, assuming this splitting of the homology, which I have mentioned, so one has the following turret. So, one has the following theorem. That the first number in this asymptotic expansion coming from the Fubinian structure on our funnel X is a variation invariant. And so, actually, all numbers, and in fact, the model that you have here. The module that you have here could be an irregular module, and so the irregular part is also a vibrational invariant. And maybe, well, if I survive, I'll be giving you more examples of that. But today, we just concentrate on the first number because I have a formula for it, which is easy to compute. But I mean, so the whole expansion here, first, this irregular part of the corresponding demo. Regular part of the corresponding D module that you get out of this equation, as well as also numbers delta i and k, they are by rational invariant, and with some work, you can actually construct interesting examples. So far, so in this talk, I'll be just concentrating on the first one. And so, the question is how to compute this number. So, I'll explain why this number. I'll explain why this number is operationally invariant. I'll give you an outline of the proof of that in a little bit later today. Of course, assuming a star, assuming it's splitting. But let me first tell you how to compute this number. So let's consider x to be a complete intersection in p, sorry, should be p and minus one. And so then the formula which you get for this number delta one is as false. So it's the dimension of x minus two times n minus d total, where this is the sum of all powers, divided by the maximal power. So now this number Number is vibrationally invariant, and in fact, the theorem assuming star is that if this number n minus d total over d max is less than one, then the variety x is not rational. Well, so let's look at Our example we have started with. So, in this case, we get that this number is two-thirds. It's certainly less than one. And this number delta is equal to five-thirds. And so, this is precisely the This is precisely the degree of the surfactor of this category C. And so that's the theorem: that delta one is the degree of the surfactor for this category C, which we get in the same orthogonal. C, which we get in the same orthogonal decompositions of the funnel. So, in other words, so you can compute it in such a way, or you can just forget about the fact that it's a cell functor and just do this arithmetics without thinking about the surf functor. And if this n minus the total degree over the maximum is less than one, or the whole number is bigger, bigger. Or the whole number is bigger than dimension of x minus 2, then this is not going to be rational. So observe that this is not a statement about very general. This is for all smooth varieties in this modulus space. As soon as this number n minus d totem over dmax is less than one, then these funnels are not rational. So, I mean, of course. So, I mean, of course, this definitely is stronger result than many of known examples. And so let me just, so I give a conjecture here. So I'm afraid to say what the function for, but the second one is dimension of x minus 4 and then some function of n, the total degree and the maximum, and so on, in a similar way. And so, in a similar way, but I mean, I am afraid to say what it is now. So, let's look at some other examples. So, if you take the intersection of Padrekin cubic and p6, so this number is two-thirds, and therefore, this funnel is not rational. And so, there are many other tons of examples. There are many other tons of examples of funnels which are not understood, which could be was it was that two, three case? Was that known? I mean, this is four-dimensional and I mean, I no, no, I apologize. I don't know if this is known or not, but uh Is known or not, but uh, it's certainly not ration according to this. So, I mean, um, I haven't checked. Uh, can I ask, are those statements for the generic member of the family? Yeah, yeah, but so that means that your invariants can they distinguish special members of a family where you have a family where some are unirational and some are honestly rational? Honestly rational? Yeah, we will get to that. Okay. So one other example that I wanted to consider is showing some other examples. This is an intersection of four paddocks in PA. And so in this case, the number is. And so, in this case, the number is one half, so nothing is not rational. I mean, I don't know if this was normal. And of course, the intersection of three quadratics in P6 that is bouillothesis, if I'm not mistaken, that it's not rational, but just because it's a conic bundle and you get. You get the prime variety of dimension 14 to be the intermediate Jacobian of this three-dimensional Kohling bundle. And so when the dimension of this prime variety is so big and it's not hyper-elliptical trigonal curve, then the prime variety cannot be Jacobian. Prime variety cannot be Jacobian, so that's the way we will analyze this question. So, in this case, basically, you just compute the number and see that this is not rational. So, now here is the case where the number is equal to one, and so then. Then, of course, the number delta is equal to dimension of x minus 2 in this case. So, we don't know if this is rational or not by just looking at delta. So, in order to analyze what's happening, we actually need to do more work. More work. And so, what one can do is introduce the sorry, that's a mistake. So, we introduced the Kudair ring. Of these are the homes between the identity functor of this category C and its circuit. And so the approach of this in this case actually defines a surface of general type with horse diamond, if I remember correctly. If I remember correctly, and then basically, what one can actually show is that there is a non-trivial Zumaya algebra associated with this category C, and so that's why this thing is not rational. But we still want to keep things. Keep things on the level of numbers, so to avoid all this, we actually return to this number spfk, which I introduced. And so in this case, if you compute this delta one three, which means that you added powers in means that you added powers in of L to be three. So this number is less than one and so that's why I mean that really depends on the geometry of your manifold and so that's why actually for some of them this is going to be not rational. Not rational. So the case that you could in one family have things which are rational or not is the case when you get this number to be equal to one or the other to be equal to dimension of x minus two. So in this case, you can have in a family some which are national and some which are not. So you need to In order to decide traditionality or not, you need to look at char structures. So now this spectra can be enhanced in many ways. So, and in fact, using the correspondence between perovschief of categories and perochief of vanishing sites. Categories and peroch for vanishing cycles, you can introduce other filtrations. So, using the classical V-filtration introduced by Cashiwara and Shapira, and then the extension that was done by Popo and Mustaza, you can actually Can actually enhance this spectrum and get many other numbers in such a way. And so, I mean, using the correspondence between vanishing cycles and perovshift of categories, you can introduce a series of subcategories of this C, and so obtain a filtration by perversion of categories, and then the corresponding spectrum. And then the corresponding spectrum, which for some reason decided to call Sturina spectrum, I mean, actually gives you additional numbers and you can analyze if they are giving you variational invariance or not. So now, I mean, similarly, One can define a symplectic invariant outside of this, so you just change the category and still analyze the singularity of the Lando-Ginsburg model, but in this case you work with DB-Sync. And so using these ideas of Steambrick and Cyto, faring these powers of Of linear functions. So you pretty much come to something that on bread factorizations, which we did with Donaldson and Rue some time ago, and Tyoto, but this time on the categorical side. And in fact, this was a starting point for me, but Me, but so I guess I'll return to this some other time. So now let's look why is this a virational invariant? I mean, so why is this number delta operational invariant? So this is really a, I mean, the idea of the proof is like idea from I mean, calculus, first-year calculus. So let me demonstrate this if I can. So I start with a very simple example. So when this potential of the Lando-Ginsburg model, or the potential which f which participates in the equation which I wrote, is x to the n. And so, what I'm going to do is to, I mean, the idea besides this is to show that when I deform a little bit my potential, this function f, so the number delta is super semi-continuous. So, if it's the dimension of x minus 2 and i deform, it can only go up. So and so if I already have the difference, I mean, so if my number is, if my variety is rational, so for I mean, dimension that I get for non-rational one is less than One is less than the dimension of x minus two. So if I deform, it's only going to go up, but my number is already smaller than the dimension of x minus two. Then, I mean, it stays away from this number delta for the national variety if I deform after that. After that, so let's look at these integrals to try to convince you that this number actually lambda, which participate here, under the formations can only go up. So I may compute this integral for the, I mean, if you like, the solution of the equation which I just wrote for the function x to the n. And so the solution is you. So the solution is u in power 1 over n some constant. And then for the deformation here is u in power 1/2 some constant as well. And so the first one is for t not equal to zero. And the second is for t equal to zero. I'm just writing this for the smallest term. And of course there are different forms which we can integrate against. We can integrate against. So I'm integrating for the form dx here. I mean, it will have similar things for the other forms, but the integrals become more complicated. And so we see that the number lambda goes up under these deformations. So for t equal to 0, it's 1 over n, and then becomes 1/2. And so this is the property. And so, this is the property that these numbers of the spectrum are upper semi-continuous. I mean, the simplest become the singularities, the numbers go up, which was conjectured by Arnold and then proven by Varchenko and Stimbring in the case of singularities a long time ago. So, now in fact you can use the mixed host. You can use the mixed cost structure associated with this Rubinius structure, which I have mentioned. So, I mean, here is the picture. So, I have t equal to 0, lambda is 1 over n, and then these complicated singularities, but they are deformed, so it becomes several singularities, x squared and then some others. But the number goes up. But the difference. So, namely, delta under this deformation goes down. And so, I mean, to return to our situation, so Our situation. So, if something is rational, then this number is equal to the dimension of x minus 2. And if I start deforming, so it can only go up, but so I already have something which is not rational, namely, delta is more than dimension of x minus 2, so I cannot bring it closer to something which is smaller than the dimension of x minus 2. Which is smaller than the dimension of x minus 2. So that is the idea of proving that if you assume the splitting of the Coumoji, then this number is a variation of invariant. Of course, in general, you don't use this by, you don't prove this by these integrals. I mean, this is just an example to give you an idea where this comes from. So the argument that one can actually mimic in this situation is an argument using Argument using mixed horse non-commutative structures in the same way as Timbrink and Varchank could do it for the case of usual mixed-horse structures. So it's a little bit more involved, but I mean, after the end of the day, I mean, so I mean, it's indeed playing with the symptomic expression of this integral as noticed. Of this integral as noticed a long time ago by Maul Grams. So, once again, I mean, you can think of Vandal-Ginsburg model as something that allows you to do calculations. But all we are doing is just studying the asymptotics of the solutions of this. Solutions of this string equation, I mean, this Fubenius manifold equation, which I have mentioned at the beginning. So the equation that we considered in the this KKP paper in 2000. In 2008. So everything is on the manifold x, you don't really need mirror symmetry in order to define this invariant. So you take the equation, you consider the solution of this equation, you consider the asymptotics, and then the asymptotics are directional invariants. So let me book it one more example with this number. One more example where this number is equal to two to dimension of x minus two, in fact, equal to two. And so this is the example of four-dimensional cubic. And so, I mean, so how do we consider how we approach four-dimensional cubics? Let's say that this is a general one, and so the corresponding And so the corresponding host diabolic splitting, as I mentioned before, is a combination of these four pieces. One of them is this piece with 1,1211 and then we have three other ones. And then so this piece, which looks like one, one, twenty, one, one, has a 20-dimensional space of deformations and actually, sorry. And the actually, sorry, the form and intersection form on the corresponding piece of Hoshuk homology happen to be symmetric. So the fact that it has 20-dimensional spatial deformations tells you that this cannot be a K-trace surface. So the fact that this is symmetric. This is a symmetric form, tells you that this cannot be a general type, and of course, you do know what other possibilities are, so this is how you show that generic four-dimensional cubic is not rational, but you can try to apply this to method with the numbers with. This numbers coming from the spectrum to this case. Well, I mean, of course, if we compute what's happening with the cubic in P5, so you get the number 2. And so this doesn't help you in this way. But actually, this delta 3, which I have mentioned, when you add to the potential, some To the potential, some third powers of linear form is actually less than two. And so even in the case when this cubic contains a plane, so that it's conjectural, yet so that will be a different approach to prove that a cubic which can. A cubic which contains one plane is not rational. So, I mean, I think that this is probably equivalent to showing that this Kudair ring actually is connected with something which leads to a non-trivial Zumai algebra associated with this k this. Associated with this K-T surface. So, I mean, I have other calculations with other numbers, but at the moment, they are just a little bit of guesses. And so, I don't have a good explanation which categories these numbers are connected with, namely, what is the meaning. It with namely, what is the meaning of these numbers when it comes to the corresponding splitting of the horse structures, or if you like, splitting of the corresponding semotogonal decomposition. So I mean, this has to wait a little bit, I guess. So once again, I mean, so that invariance, meaning Variants, meaning that different types of spectrum, and also looking deeply at the singularities of the Lando-Ginsburg models is a theory which definitely is very developed. I mean, so, I mean, there are tons of examples that are computed by people from the classical singularity theory to very recent ones. Theory to very recent ones by Saito and company, then Poppa and Mustaza. And so, I mean, all these numbers, one way or another, would define variational invariance. So, I mean, one this is settled, I mean, that would be a relatively easy way to compute some of these numbers and get new rationality examples. Once again, no. Examples, once again, not a very general point, but as I mentioned, you know, many of these examples for all varieties in these modules spaces. I'll stop here. So let's also thank Ludmill in the chat. But do we have any questions for Ludmill? I have a question. I think maybe you said this at the start, but how do you see that this number is related to the degree of the ser functor? Degree of the seraphim So, I mean the serf anta is I mean the corresponding Van der Giensberg model or for the corresponding non-community structure sort of I mean you can think of it Of, I mean, you can think of its action on the homology, and so on. When the surf, I mean, this is basically the monodromy around the corresponding fiber of the Lando-Ginsburg model. And the degree of the surfactor can be computed if you know what are the eigenvalues of the monodlomy of the Acting on the homoji around this fiber. So, once again, classically, there is a statement like that: that these numbers, which are actually the thresholds for certain multiplier ideal shift associated with this function f. So, the thresholds, and what you are computing here is the, in a way, the canonical thresholds, they correspond to the eigenvalues of the monodromy. So, this is directly connecting between the first, like the smallest number, and the eigenvalues of the monodrome, which is the cell factor in this case. Okay, yeah, thanks. Uh, Lydmil, I had a question, uh, Andre, here. Um, do you know so what I could not So, what I could not read off at the very end of your talk is this, how much of it is a theorem that the generic cubic fourfold is non-rational? I mean, if this, if, you know, I mean, this, so we're writing the proof of this star. So, one this is written, is it is a theorem? Which one is star? The fact that the composition, the decomposition. The decomposition being by rational invariant. Aha, okay. I understand. That's a clinching factor. I see. Okay. Yeah, this one. So, but this is at the level of the A model, this is just the different Hochschild homologies of the various fibers over the various critical points. Correct. I see. Thank you. But I mean, it's all defined on, I mean, A and B are on the same X, but indeed, if you like, you can think about this in such a way. Yeah. Sorry. So for the cubic fourfold, right, this number was one, wasn't it? So let me. Wasn't it so? Yeah, yeah, so n minus, yeah, yeah. So this number is delta number is two, and the number n minus delta total over, I'm sorry, d total over d maximum is one, yes. So so was it one of these other numbers that? Yes, yes, yes. So delta three. Okay. I wanted to ask one more thing. To ask one more thing, um, what you call the Codaira ring, um, which appears in one of my papers from 20 years ago. Uh, I used it to prove that the Codaira dimension is a birational. In fact, why don't you send me a yeah, but I wanted to ask you the special thing is this Codaira ring has got a very strange duality around the degree one piece. Yeah, Max told me about this, but uh, I need to learn, so that's why it has any significant. So that's why it has any significance in what you're doing. I'll write to you a little bit. Repeat the question. If this duality that the Codaira ring has plays any role in what you are doing. Yeah, I mean, so if this, I mean, so, I mean, one other way to approach more rationalities is to indeed to study this Kudaira ring. And so, I mean, there could be several cases. The first is Could be several cases. The first is: I mean, you know, if it has a growth which doesn't behave like a canonical ring, then you know that this is not rational. Then the second is if it's non-commutative, then you know that it's rational. And then the third thing is that if the approach defines some variety, let's say of general type, then you need to do something else. Okay. But let me send me this paper that you have made. But I mean, send me this paper that you have mentioned, please. Okay, do we have other questions for Ludmal? All right, let's thank Ludmal again. And Ludmel, you're being thanked silently, so I hope you look at the chat. I hope you look at the chat, and many people were very happy to hear your talk. So, with that, that concludes our lectures for today, and we'll resume tomorrow at 9 a.m. And also, tomorrow there's the group photo was recently added to the schedule. That will be tomorrow after the second talk. Tomorrow after the second talk. So, tomorrow at 11 will be the BERS group photo. Wait, so are you in BIRS? I mean, I no, nobody's in BERS, but the group photo is everybody puts on their camera. Yeah, I understand. I understand. So, you are in Edmonton now? Yeah, I'm in my basement. So, what's the temperature like there? Actually, it's Actually, it's really hot today, but it was.
