So Bruce Kleiner from Kron Institute who will speak to us today about RicciFlow through singularities and applications. Please. Okay. Well, thanks to the organizers for the invitation. So let me just start by giving you a pick overview of what the talk is about. So this is going to be an overview of some work that I've been doing with John Lott and Richard Bemler. John Lott and Richard Bemler over a period of several years. And actually, this is intended to be an introductory talk, so it's not really aimed at the experts in the audience. Also, I know many of you have already heard me speak on this topic or pieces of it at least once, and I'm sure many of you have heard me talk on pieces on multiple occasions. Anyway, so I will try to make. Anyway, so I will try to make it as accessible as possible. Please interrupt me with questions as they arise. And I'll try to say something about open questions that are adjacent to the narrative. Okay. All right, so let's start at the beginning, right, with Hamilton's existence result, right? So if you have a smooth metric H on some compact manifold M, then there's a unique Ricci flow. Uh, then there's a unique Ricci flow, right? So that's a unique family of metrics defined on some time interval with initial condition h, which satisfies this the Ricci flow equation, okay? And so this is defined on this maximal time interval. If the right endpoint capital T is finite, then curvature blows up as you approach that right endpoint. Okay, so examples, right? So if you start with the time zero with the standard metric on Time zero with the standard metric on the n-sphere. Okay, so then the time t metric and the Ricci flow is just the original metric scaled by this linear function of time. So of course that goes to zero and the curvature blows up. More generally, if you have an Einstein metric, so reach equals lambda h. Sorry, question, comment. Then the metric of time t is the metric of time zero scaled by this linear function of time. Okay, now if you want to look at a more general situation, the simplest case is the case of Ricci flow on surfaces. So there, there's a beautiful result of Hamilton and Chow, right? If you have a Ricci flow on any compact surface, M. Ricci flow on any compact surface M, well, then you can look at the volume normalized metric. So, G bar here is just the metric G of T rescaled. Okay, you just rescale it to normalize the volume to be equal to one. Okay, so this G bar will then converge to a constant curvature metric as you approach the time capital T, which could be, which will be finite if you're on S2 or RP2. Two or RP2, uh, and it will be infinite otherwise. Okay, so that's very nice. Um, if you go to dimension three, um, and this was covered in Hamilton's original paper, right? So there, if you assume the initial metric has positive Ricci, well, then a similar thing holds. Okay. On the other hand, life is not that simple if you look at a general metric in dimensions. General metric in dimension three, then things get much more complicated. All right, so this if you have an initial metric G0, which is a kind of a barbell metric on the three-sphere, well, then the Ricci flood develops a neckbench singularity. Okay, so the cartoon is as follows. So this diagram is borrowed from Richard. So you imagine a metric on the three-sphere. Imagine a metric on the three-sphere, it has sort of two spherical regions of radio radio R1 and R3, respectively, and that's a next neck region with radius R2. Okay, so if they're roughly comparable, then the Ricci flow will maybe round things off. You'll end up with a metric with positive curvature, which will then shrink down as before, becomes asymptotically rounded lower. If the neck region If the neck region is tighter, well, then what will tend to happen is that that will pinch faster than the metric does elsewhere. Okay, there's an instability. And what you'll see is a finite time singularity where at certain points, I mean, if you do a rescaling, what you see is a Ricci flow that looks more and more like Ricci flow on Ricci flow of a round, so shrinking round metric on. So, shrinking round metric on S2 crossed with R. Okay, and so this thing goes singular in finite time. And what happens is there will be an open subset of the manifold on which the metric G of T has a smooth limit as a smooth limit locally as the time approaches the blow-up time capital G. And then the complementary closed set, things are going haywire. Set things are going haywire, right? But the crucial difference is that from what we saw before is now the Ricci flow kind of still exists on part of the manifold, even though it blew up on part of the manifold, right? So over here, it blew up, but it blew up everywhere at once. And modular rescaling, the behavior is extremely simple. Okay, so this raises the question: okay, you still have some manifold left. You still have some manifold left. Can you do something with it? And that's that leads to the notion of surgery. Okay, so that's due to Hamilton and was further developed by Perelman. And the cartoon is the following. We start with some, again, our Riemannian three manifold. We run the Ricci flow until a singularity forms or maybe stop just before. Then we locate neck regions, so regions where the metric looks like around. metric looks like a round S2 cross R. And then in there, we take some cross-sectional two-sphere, maybe take two of them in this depicted in this schematic diagram. You cut the manifold there and you throw away this part with large curvature, maybe the part where also the metric is blown up. That leaves you with a manifold with spherical boundary components. You cap those off with three balls. That gives you a compact manifold. And then you can restart the You can restart the Ricci flow. Okay, so then maybe another neck forms, the singularity forms, you do surgery again, and this is the Ricci flow surgery. Okay, so this is, although this was envisioned by Hamilton in the 80s, and he worked for many years on this and developed many tools for implementing this vision. It was Perelund who completed this project. Who completed this project in his preprints in the early naughties? Okay, so okay, so this was a very successful project. So it has the implication that the implies that Thurston's geometrization conjecture, in particular, implies the three-dimensional Poincare conjecture, which was the central open problem in topology for 100 years, which had resisted essentially. Had resisted essentially all other attacks. I mean, every other approach had broken down. This is the only one that's worked, and it's the only one that's known to date. Okay, so that's very satisfying from the point of view of topology. You might note, however, that Ricci flow is not, Ricci flow in surgery is not a canonical process. It involves a number of choices, right? You can see that in the cartoon, right? Because you have to decide where you're going. You have to decide where you're going to do the cutting with the two spheres, and then you have to decide how you're going to put the caps on there. So that leads to some further questions. In fact, Perelman commented on this in both of his RicciFlow preprints, right? So in the first one, he says it's likely that by passing to the limit in this construction, one gets a canonically defined Ricci flow through singularities. Okay. Okay, and in the second one, he says something similar. He wants to get a canonical Ricci flow defined in the largest possible subset of space-time. So, what he means here, right, is that you want to start with some fixed compact Riemannian three-manifold and then run the Ricci flow with surgery infinitely many times. So, you want to have a sequence of Ricci flows with surgery where the scale at which the surgery is performed. The scale at which the surgery is performed goes to zero as the index goes to infinity. Okay, so there's some specific parameter in this process that you want to send to zero. But so the idea is that when you do that, you'll get the sequence of Ricci flows with surgery. And then he's saying that you can somehow pass to a limit and you get some flow through singularities. Okay, so the cartoon for that looks like this. Looks like this. Okay, we start with our manifold, we flow forward in time, and next starts to form. But then, rather than performing surgery, you pass to the limit. So you have this moment when things are singular. And then instantly, this resolves. So these two, this singularity splits the manifold into connected components. One of them is going to have, each of them is going to have some kind of fingertip region that's rounding off, which will kind of. That's rounding off, which will kind of resolve as you go forward in time. Maybe later on, you'll see another neck pinch occur, and so on. Okay, so this is supposed to give you an idea for what this reaching flow through singularities might look like on the heuristic level. So let me mention some further motivation for considering this. So, from the point of view of PDEs, the From the point of view of PDEs, Ricci flow surgery is a regularization. Okay, it's a regularization of the Ricci flow equation. If you're interested in understanding Ricci flow, you'd like to understand solutions to the PDE itself, not some modification of it. Okay, so in particular, you know, in PDE, this is of course a common situation in PDE. You start off You start off with looking at classical solutions, and then you realize that you're going to have to deal with singularities. And so you need to introduce some notion of a generalized solution to the PDE, and then you study the solutions to the generalized solutions to the equation. Okay, so a generalized solution to the Ricci flow equation in this context could be taken as being synonymous with the Ricci flow through singularities. And then a restatement or variation on parameters. Variation on Periman's question would be: Is there a canonical Ricci flow through singularities? Okay, um, and there's a there's an independent motivation for thinking about this problem, and that's that there are applications of Ricci flow, which involve looking at a family of Riemannian metrics and then trying to apply Ricci flow to each of them and studying a whole family of Ricci flows, okay? Reaching flows. Okay. So, in order for that to really make sense at all, you pretty much need to have a canonical process. Okay, so this was a project that I was working on with John Lawton and Richard Bemler. So, we managed to carry this out. And that has a number of pieces to it. Has a number of pieces to it, which break down as false. So, first of all, there's the question of defining this Ricci flow through singularities. Okay, I have put up a cartoon there, but that's not a definition. And there was no discussion of how to define this in Perelman's work. And in fact, it had been an open problem for a while, how to make sense of this in a useful way. And then, when you have a definition, once you've chosen When you have a definition, once you've chosen the definition, you want to prove that there exists solutions, that they're unique. And then returning to Perelman's version, you want to show that the Ricci flow with surgery converges in an appropriate sense to this notion of generalized solution. Okay. And finally, we discussed the dependence of this process on the This process on the initial data. I want to show that it depends continuously. Okay, so let me, for the next segment of my talk, I'll be describing this work. So I'll begin with the definition. So the first idea is to use a space-time approach. So to motivate this, I mean, let's start with just a traditional or conventional Ricci flow on some manifold M. Manifold M, well, you can construct a space-time object in a trivial way. You just take the product of the manifold with the time interval, and then you have a time function, which is just the projection onto the second factor, right? And you have a vector field, which corresponds to the unit vector field on this factor. Now, the Riemannian metric, which is a time-dependent metric on the original manifold M, can be naturally transplanted to this spacetime by taking G atom. This space-time by taking g at time t and putting it on this sort of height t time slice in the product. So you get a Riemannian metric on this foliation by the level sets of the time function or the time slices. And then this satisfies the Ricci flow in the natural sense of that says that the lead derivative of the metric with respect to the time vector field is minus twice Ricci. Okay, so more generally, Ricci flow spacetime is a tuple for Time is a tuple, four things. Okay, so you have a smooth four-manifold with boundary. Okay, you have a time function, so this is a smooth function. Then there's a time vector field. So there's a smooth vector field that satisfies this condition. You apply the vector field, take the derivative of the time function with respect to this vector field, you get one, which means that if you take a trajectory of the time vector field, then the time function increases at rate one. Time function increases at rate one. In particular, the time function is the submersion. And that, so you get a nice foliation by level sets. And then G will be the Riemannian metric along with leaves of that foliation or a family of Riemannian metrics, one for each time slice. And then you require that this satisfies the Rucci flow equation. Okay. So this is almost. So, this is almost identical to the product case. And locally, this is really the same thing. If you just take locally a flow box for the time vector field, then you can see that up diffeomorphism. This is the same thing that we saw in the previous slide with a product. But what's important here is that we don't have any global topological assumption. So, this could look very far from a product. And in particular, that allows for the possibility that different time slices have different. That different time slices have different topology, okay, which is an important uh flexibility that one needs, okay. Um, so a little notation for time slices, um, and I'll often use this M as a shorthand for the whole tuple. Uh, okay, so the Ricci flow spacetime by itself is not really a useful notion or useful object because it's too weak, it's they're too passive. They're too pathological. So we need to impose some additional conditions. And there are two conditions: there's a completeness condition, completeness type condition, we call zero completeness, and then there's a canonical neighbor assumption. So let me first talk about the completeness assumption. So let's come back to this cartoon. Let's look at this time slice here. Okay. So remember, we're working. So remember, we're working with a Ricci-flow spacetime as a smooth manifold. So if you think about this time slice, you should think of this singularity as not being there, right? We're only looking at a smooth object. So by sort of by convention, this point isn't there. In other words, you should think of this time slice as being a union of two connected components, namely this one and this one. They're both non-compact, and they each have an N. So here's an N there. Each have an N. So here's an N there, an N there for the other connected component. And those N's are diffeomorphic to S2 across the non-negative reals. Okay. And if you take a, and for generic neck pinch, there will be a Cauchy sequence going out the end, which is, which has no limit. Okay, so these will be incomplete. Notice the diameter here is finite. So that's spatial incompleteness of a time slice. Now, if you look at the trajectories of the time vector. The trajectories of the time vector field, okay. Like, let's suppose you're standing roughly at this point in the manifold. As you go forward in time, okay, the next starts to form, starts to shrink, and if you choose the point properly, you'll go right into the singularity. Okay, and what that means is that that trajectory of the time vector field is inextendable or incomplete. Okay, so in other words, we have both time and spatial incompleteness. And completeness in the examples that we want to include in our story. Okay, so we need to, so that's on the one hand, on the other, we have to have some sort of notion of completeness, okay? And that's the notion of zero completeness. So the rough idea is that the space-time should be complete. The space-time should be complete as long as you stay away from large curvature. Okay? So, more precisely, the requirement is as false. You take some curve gamma, let's say a smooth curve, it's either an integral curve of the plus minus time vector field, or it's a unit speed curve confined to some time slice of the space-time. Okay, and so the requirement is as long as the norm of the curvature tensor. The norm of the curvature tensor remains bounded along gamma, then the limit exists. Okay, so in other words, it stays complete as long, it's complete as long as you stay in the part of the space-time with controlled curvature, all right. So that's the zero completeness. The other condition is the canonical neighborhood assumption. This is borrowed straight from Perelman's work. So this says that informally, it says. This says that informally, it says that near points of large curvature, the geometry is well approximated by a model flow. Okay. And the model flows, the model flows are kappa solutions. So examples are shrinking around spherical space forms, so S3 or RP3 or other quotients of S3. You could have shrinking around cylinders or quotients, or the quotient, D2 quotients. Quotients, or the quotient d2 quotient. And then there's also the Bryant soliton, which I don't think I need to define since it's come up in multiple talks. And these will model different parts of the space-time. So for example, here it looks like we have something that's going to be well approximated by a shrinking round spherical space form. Here we have a shrink, something that's going to be, I mean, a point in space-time well approximated. I mean, a point in space-time well approximated by a shrinking round cylinder. And then, here, after the neck pinch occurs, and we have this sort of cusp-like thing rounding off, then there'll be this kind of fingertip region, which we modeled on a brown. Okay. So, okay, so the definition. So, I'm not going to define kappa solution. I mean, there's a short. A short, not very technical definition, but in this context, it would not, I don't think it would be useful to give it. But you have some examples of what they are. So the definition of the canonical neighborhood assumption is as follows. So you pick some positive epsilon and some function r, think of that as a time-dependent scale. Well, then the space-time satisfies this, so the epsilon r canonical neighborhood assumption. Assumption, if the following holds, if you have a point in space-time, so x, a point in some time slash mt, which satisfies this condition. So the curvature, the curvature tensor, the norm of the curvature tensor at x is bigger than this threshold, right? So r you think of as having the dimensions of distance. This has the dimensions of curvature. So this is just saying that as long as the curvature at the point x exceeds this. At the point x exceeds this threshold depending on time, then the time slice with a base point at x is close to a kappa solution, modular rescaling to normalize the curvature. Okay, so now the definition is singular, is this. So, singular Ricci flow is The Ricci flow is a Ricci flow space-time such that the time zero slice is compact, so that corresponds to a compact Riwani manifold, and then it satisfies the zero completeness and canonical assumptions. Okay, so just for emphasis, the singular Ricci flow is a smooth object, right? We've kind of, in spite of the name, we're deliberately denying. Denying in denial about the existence of singularities. We're just kind of pretending they're not there and looking only at the smooth part. But because we're doing that, then we have to deal with this possibility of incompleteness. And you can view these two conditions here, the zero completeness and the canonical neighborhood assumption, somehow they're asymptotic boundaries. Somehow, they're asymptotic boundary conditions, okay, on this non-compact object, the Ricci flow spacetime. Okay. So the theorem in the first paper with John is existence. So for any compact Riemannian manifold, you get a singular Rucci flow M with the given initial condition. Given initial condition. Okay. And this will, for any epsilon bigger than zero, this satisfies the epsilon R canonical neighborhood assumption. Okay. For some scale function R. Now, let me just mention the sketch of proof. So you pick a sequence of scale factors. Some a sequence of scale factors tending to zero, delta i. And then for each i, you construct a Ricci flow of surgery, okay, with surgery parameter delta i. And well, then so that means that, right, for each, you get the sequence of ordinary Ricci flows that are defined on a sequence of consecutive time intervals. And then for each of those ordinary Ricci flows, you can form kind of a product space-time. Of a product space-time, okay. And basically, you take those product space-times, you stack them together, and then you glue them together appropriately, and you have to shave off a little bit of them, and you end up with the Ricci flow space-time for each eye. Okay. And then the last step, so you have this sequence of Ricci flow space-times that was emerged from the Ricci flow surgery, and then you extract some sort of convergent sub-sequence. Okay, so this involves. Convergent subsequence. Okay, so this involves some sort of applying some compactness result, which was a result in this paper here. Okay, so that gives you existence. And in fact, this is a very weak version of Perelman's original statement. It really says that, I mean, says that Ricci-Flobus surgery converges subsequentially to this kind of object. Okay? All right. So then in the paper with Richard. With Richard. In the paper with Richard, we prove uniqueness. So if you have two singular Ricci flows satisfying a canonical neighborhood assumption, the epsilon here has to be below some universal threshold. But as long as it is, then an isometry between the initial conditions extends to an isometry between the space-times. Okay, so you get a unique object. So an isometry between the space-times is a diffeomorphism. Between the space-times, the diffeomorphism which respects all the structure. Okay, so that gives you the uniqueness assertion. We also show that this depends continuously on the initial time slice in a natural sense. And Perelman's original convergence conjecture holds. So there, okay, so let me just mention a question here. Just mention a question here, which is quite perfectly natural. So now we have a good notion of Ricci flow through singularities in dimension three. What about higher dimensions? So the answer is yes, under some, if you make some assumptions on the initial geometry. So if the initial metric is Kayler, so I, you know, there's a lot of literature on this. You can look at the papers by Song and Tian. And so on. If you assume the initial metric has positive isotropic curvature, then there's a recent paper by Bob Hasselhoffer, where this situation is discussed. So that uses earlier work of Hamilton, Shenzhu, John, and myself, and some others. So if you're interested in that, you can look at his preprint. But in the general But in the general case, this looks very, really quite challenging. So, I mean, there's some very interesting recent work by Richard Bemler, but it looks quite challenging even in dimension four. Let me just mention that one should not expect the same kind of statement in higher dimensions, at least in dimensions five and higher. And higher, so I'm going to come off. I've shown that unique scales and dimensions five and higher. Okay, all right. Let me also draw attention to the parallel story with mean curvature flow. And of course, there have been some lectures already which are related to this. So you could ask the mean curvature flow version of this question. And it's not a new question, right? I mean, this is in some sense. New question, right? I mean, this is in some sense more than 40 years old. It goes back to the book of Brocky in 1978, where he introduced the idea of a Brocky flow. So that was an attempt to come up with a notion of generalized mean curvature flow. And there have been subsequent definitions. So there was the level set flow notion around 1990. Around 1990. Tom Emmanuel has a notion of enhanced motion. And then it was shown around 2000 in Poisk and Senastari and White that there is a good answer to this question, at least for if you assume that the initial condition has positive mean curvature, mean convex. But outside that case, the problem I think is to The problem, I think, is still wide open. So, particularly for general initial conditions, I believe the best-known result is Brocky's original result, which produces an object such that for almost every time, the time slice is a rectifiable verifiable. If somebody knows a better result, they should correct me. However, the uniqueness assertion, right? So, there are examples of element in white showing that one should not expect uniqueness even for compact smooth surfaces in R3. However, you could ask this for their examples of hygiene. You could ask about the case of a two-sphere. In fact, this was conjectured by Brian White that levels at flow starting from a two-sphere. Level set flow starting from a two-sphere is non-patterning. Okay, so I think it's very interesting to compare these parallel developments between Ricci flow and mean curvature flow. On a technical level, some ideas carry over, but many don't. And the narratives also have overlap with divergent and interesting ways. Okay, sorry. There's an editorial remark there that you can ignore. Mark there that you can ignore. So, let me just talk about the some of the properties of singular Ricci flows before I mention applications. The okay, so this is these are this shows up in the papers by John and Richard. So, so first of all, if you look at a time slice and see Time slice and C is a connected component of some time slice, then it can be non-compact, but it's going to be diffeomorphic to a compact manifold with finitely many points removed, right? So if you look at the picture here, so here you see a compact manifold punctured at a point, right? And same thing here. So that, so you can have finitely many ends, but it doesn't get worse than that, okay? So talk. Okay, so time slices are compact manifolds with finite punctures. Now, if you take a time t slice, you fill in the punctures, and then you throw away the copies of S3 that you end up with. So you get rid of the part that's topologically trivial. Then you're left with finitely many components. And then you look at the prime decomposition of that compact manifold. Of that compact manifold. So, in other words, you take every compact three manifold, you can decompose under connected sum, and you keep decomposing until you end up with the prime sum n. And that's the prime decomposition, which is unique. So the prime decomposition of this thing is part of the prime decomposition of the original manifold, M0. Now we also know something about this. Something about this, you can think of this kind of a weak partial regularity statement. If you look at the set of times where the time slice is non-compact, that has Minkowski dimension at most one half. Okay, so that's some information. So maybe it looks like this for some times, but it can't happen for all times or for an interval of times. Of times. On the other hand, so as far as we know, the time slices could have infinitely many connected components. And as far as we know, there could be uncountably many non-compact time slices. So if that happens, so if there are uncountably many non-compact time slices, then we do know that what would have to be occurring is the following phenomenon. Say you have a neck pinch like this, which Which then resolves, you start getting this Bryant tip that forms, it starts to resolve, but then it could change its mind and start to go singular again and become non-compact, right? Then it could resolve again and so on. You could have this, say, even a cant, say, in principle, a canter set of times where the time slice is non-compact. Where the time slice is non-compact, and we don't know how to rule that out at present. So, but conjecturally, the picture looks much better. So the conjecture is that the set of times, set of non-compact time slices is finite. And if you have such a non-compact time slice, then as you approach that time from below, okay, so nearby times will be give you compact time slices. So you just see. Give you compact time slices so you just see a finite collection of ordinary Ricci flows, then each component will either go entirely extinct or it will experience only finitely many possibly degenerate neck pinch singularities. Okay, so all right, so let me mention, so I think that there's of course a similar conjecture about mean curvature flow, at least to say in the mean convex sort of mean convex. Convex mean convex case, or even in general for mean curvature flow in part three. So let me mention an interesting feature of world line. So if you have a singular Ricci flow, world line is just an integral curve of the time vector field. Okay, so a typical behavior for a world line is to be incomplete as you go forward in time. So if you start here on the manifold, you go forward. You start here on the manifold, you go forward in time, the neck starts to pinch, right? And then, if you choose that point correctly, it'll go right into the singularity, right? So, that's the kind of incompleteness that I alluded to earlier in the talk. That's the forward incompleteness. I'll say a word line is bad if it's backward incomplete. Okay, so if you try to go backward, of course, you could get stuck when you get back to time zero because that's when the singular Ruchi flow starts. But if you get stuck before that, then you say. Get stuck before that, then you say that's a bad world. Okay, so the theorem is that there aren't so many of these. So, if you have a connected component C of a time slice, then there are only finitely many bad rule lines passing through this C. Okay, and this has the following kind of meaning. So, let's look at an example of that. So, let's look at this, say, or maybe here, look at the look at the Look at this singular time. If you go slightly forward in time, then you see this fingertip region here, which is going to be modeled on a Bryant. If you imagine staying, trying to stay close to the tip of that as you go backward in time, go back toward the singular time, it's going to get more and more singular, right? And maybe if you choose that point just right, okay, then you follow the world line backward in time, it's going to go singular, okay? That would be an example of a bad world line. That would be an example of a bad world line, and there would be a similar one up here as well. Okay, so the theorem says that if you choose any connected component, then there are only finitely many, at most finitely many points in that component, which experience that kind of behavior. And all the others manage to slip past and go all the way to the time zero slice. Okay. Okay. So now let me discuss shift gears. Discuss shift gears and discuss some topological applications. So let's come back to this Ricci flow on surfaces result that I mentioned earlier. So if you have an arbitrary initial metric on a surface, then the normalized metric converges to a metric of constant curvature. metric of constant curvature okay as you approach the the time capital T. So a reinterpretation of this is as follows. Ricci flow defines a deformation, it's a natural deformation process, and defines a deformation retraction of the space of all metrics to the subspace of constant curvature metrics. Okay, so this is the, I mean, I'm skating over something a little bit here because I mean, of course, this, well, let me first. Well, let me first make this a bit more precise. So you can look at net X, this is a set of smooth Riemannian metrics, okay, with a C infinity topology. And then let's say met K identically C, this will be the metrics with constant sectional curvature C. So in the case of the two-sphere, what we're saying is Ricci flow will allow you to take an arbitrary metric and deform it to a metric with curvature. Curvature one. Okay, so of course there's a little bit of fine print here. To construct such a different deformation, it's a deformation that starts at time zero, goes to time one. I mean, when you talk about home top equivalence, so there has to be some time reparameterization here, and you need to check the things very continuously. But that's that follows readily from standard results here. Okay. Okay, so a similar result holds for the space of positively curved metrics on the two-sphere because that condition is preserved by Ricci flow. And so the conclusion is, so this space of metrics here, right, is contractible because it's a convex subset of an affine space. So this is contractible, and that means that this and this are also contractible. Also contractible. Now, this has an interesting implication for diffeomorphisms. So, if so, diff x will be the set of smooth diffeomorphisms with the C infinity to poly. So a corollary of this assertion that I just mentioned is that the inclusion, you look at the diffeomorphisms of the two-sphere, think of that sitting in R3. The orthogonal group acts by symmetries, in particular by diffeomorphisms, so it defines a nice So, it defines a nice Lie subgroup sitting inside here. And the claim is that carries all the topology of diff. So, it's a homotopy equivalence. And the conclusion is this corollary follows from the previous statement as follows. You look at this vibration, okay? So, you let the diffeomorphism group of the two-sphere act on the space of curvature one metrics on the two-sphere. That's a transitive action. That's a transitive action. So you can think of this as a set of cosets of diff S2 with, I mean, sorry, the cosets of this O3 inside diff S2. So you get a natural vibration corresponding to this homogeneous space. I mean, things are infinite dimensional, but this is fairly standard stuff. So we have this vibration. So, we have this vibration, and we just saw that this space is contractible. So, we have a fibration with contractible base, which means this is a product. And in particular, the inclusion of the fiber O3 into the total space is going to be homotopy equivalence. And that's what's being asserted here. Okay, so you can try to imitate this in dimension three using, so imitate this discussion here. But due to singularities, it's much, much harder. And we found sort of two different approaches for dealing with the singularities. And you get some interesting results out of this. So in particular, if you look at the space of metrics of positive scalar curvature, then you conclude that that's either empty or contractible. So this was. Or contractible. So this was shown by Fernando Marquez to be empty or path-connected. And we extended that to full contractability. And then you can look at diffeomorphisms. So again, RicciFlow has proven to be a very powerful tool for addressing these questions from topology. So for example, So, for example, there's something called the generalized Smale conjecture, which reads as follows. If you have a metric with curvature one on a manifold X, which is compact and connected, okay, so of course that means it'sometric, isometrically covered by the three-sphere, right? So then the claim is that the isometries of that round metric on the spherical space form include into diff, and that's a homotopy equivalence. Okay, so this is. Homotopy equivalents. Okay, so this is something that had been studied by topologists for decades, and there was progress, but they managed to get some cases, but the problem had become resistant to their methods. But we were able, our methods handle all cases kind of uniformly. And then you can go further and study diff X for other three manifolds, for example. For other three manifolds, for example, you eventually understand the topology of this for any prime three manifold x. Okay, so I will stop there a little bit early. All right, let's thank Bruce for the beautiful lecture. So, questions? Can I ask a question? Yeah, please. Does your methods help you with Pi Zero? So I was always wondering, suppose you want to reprove Marquez, is it easier with your methods? Do you basically have to do what he does? Well, I wouldn't say it. It's certainly not easier. Certainly, not easier, like I give it. I mean, assuming you know your theorem, like your, you're, yeah, well, no, it's certainly, yeah, it certainly pi zero is just a special case of what we do. Yeah, in that sense, it falls out. But I mean, it should be said that what we do is, I mean, even if you subsume all the complications of constructing the singular Ricci flow and proving uniqueness and continuity, even if you just take that for granted, what we're doing is already quite a bit more complicated. Uh, quite a bit more complicated than what he does, sure. And in the Pi Zero case, that complication is sort of manifestly unnecessary. I see, okay. I just, I mean, I'm just asking basically, because in the in the mean curvature flow setting, with this, the thing I talked about yesterday, you can prove that you get a nice weak flow, you know that you know the canonical neighborhood theorem. And then we, we, you know, we ended up like Felix's student ended up showing surgery. It's sort of backwards, right? He showed that using. Surgery, it's sort of backwards, right? He showed that using this, you could get surgery. But I was always wondering if you could avoid constructing the surgery flow. Well, I think the answer is yes, but not in a very satisfactory way. I mean, if you go into the guts of our PSC proof, you know, first of all, there's a combinatorial side to it. You know, you're dealing with You know, you're dealing with families of metrics, okay? Maybe finite-dimensional families of metrics. And before long, you know, I mean, we tried to avoid this, but at some point we just gave up and accepted the idea that there will have to be a combinatorial component to the discussion. And when you make things combinatorial, then you start doing truncations, and then you see stuff that looks like it's not surgery, okay, but you're lopping off. Okay, but you're lopping off stuff at high curvature. And then you can ask yourself: well, is this really better than dealing with surgery? Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's about okay. I think that's that's basically what I was asking. So thanks. Yeah, yeah. Thanks a lot. Well, all right. If there's no other questions, let's thank Bruce again. There's no other questions, let's uh let's thank Bruce again. I guess we reconvene in, I think, uh, yeah, 20 minutes. So yeah, so the next talk starts at 10.20 because we have to catch the bus for the hike afterwards. Okay. Okay, now that.
