Happy rather another opportunity to visit Canada. Rather I wanted to to go to the port instead of fleeing the port. I mean I spent like eight years in Australia because where they should be developed. But then when I have to give an extract I realize I don't need to call bank scripts for that problem. That's what I'm doing. But then when after the first day I realize, oh my the banks get Right? Also, so this is how I should sort of say this is a joint work that Christopher Brown, Afriana Jericho and David World from Christian Australia. This all started part of the woman, I think, in 2016 when I was still in Australia. Afriana was visiting me for our workshop when we organized. And I showed all these nice these nice patterns that I that I found in a study. But that sort of started his work. And then this also involved, and Christopher Browning was a master student involved in some work. So I'm just gonna get a short introduction right and again I could skip off my introduction right because this topic I'm getting a lot of it on the publishers different right so I just skip off with the slides even when Art was talking I was deleting more slides. So that's cool. Then if you're done with this stuff, find this is the solution they come from true check. That's okay, so that was sort of Okay, so that was sort of uh let's say 144 character summary, you know, about a lot of things, but that's sort of what it was sort of. Now, better than right, these are very simple containing an images, so they're sort of everywhere, right, as Mary already showed in the heart. So I don't have to sort of approach this at this stage in the form of the wiggle map. And you have sort of these small amplitude trends, right, neurons that geomatums are the sort of the channel as well. And if we're used four amplitude patterns or these high amplitude patterns, there is much less now, and simple perturbation trace what we're doing here is sort of the only way of three techniques and so on. Today we're going to sort of link in this particular model, we can sort of link these online patterns to this uh to this long magnetic pattern. So then I had one slide about uh chewing I had one slide about tuning buttons, right? But then Sam did a great job, right? So I just replaced. But then Mark was talking, so I should also go to the heart score, right? Yeah, so you see, I prepared this presentation a long time ago, right? So let's look at a model, right? So this is sort of an experiment. I don't know what's going on right, but they observed experiments. So they observed these um sort of strike patterns, scopes, green plants, checkable plants patterns. And they wrote down quite a few different phenomenological models for them. And one of the models that they sort of came up with was this sort of component model. So they sort of modeled three species. They modeled three species, the current density, the focal stroke, and the surface charge. They first tried to be two, so we just huge, but then there were things they saw in the experiments that they could not find in the model, so they added the third equation. And we saw, for instance, when we saw the remote simulations by Sumaster's group, oh yeah, and I should say this this look almost it's almost linear except for this F, but it's all very good uh cubic numbers. Favorite cubic on the US, right? So we really sort of have that machine. And then the first way you navigate when we start working on this, we sort of try to non-dimensionalize this. So with Ariane and Tussa, Tussa has a leaf, unfortunately, we sort of non-dimensionalize this. And if you look at the primaries of diffusions, there is almost a big scale separation between the U and the V1. So we put an actual square. One, so we put an epsilon square here. And if you look at the Kaukman terms, after you go out with scaling, these are sort of small terms. So we put an epsilon from the Kaufman term. But that epsilon, so that Kaufman term was, let's say, the most debatable thing that we did in this rescaling. I had to put this up somewhere, otherwise I wouldn't have been up. Have to pull this up somewhere, otherwise, it wouldn't be up. So now this is sort of a two-proponent model. We're going to look at this in 1D. We're going to look at this in 1D. So epsilon's a small parameter. All the other parameters are assumed to be one of one. And so we looked at this on a non-bundled domain and we proved, let's say, the stable stationary one pro solutions are big X. And to understand where we came from, we had to drop this this Drop this requirement that this component term was absent, right? So we originally introduced that just because I could not do it otherwise. And I was a PhD student, so I had to sort of finish in four years and I didn't want to apply the whole time. So we put the epsilon over there, and I'm very thankful for the leximon. But now Krian asked this nasty question and now I have to write, right? So that's what we're going to do today. So that's what we're going to do today. So we're going to sort of look at this model without too difficult, okay? Another question, sort of why do we care at all, right? There's a lot of people that sort of could be disparate to computation diffusion equations, right? So one of the problems here also was to understand what happens if you have a third equation. So what we what is the dynamics? What are the patterns that you can observe in T d mainly between T equations if you cannot do it? That's sort of not another problem to find. This is sort of the model we're now interested in. So it's sort of all in fun, not bigly comparable to two equations. So I'm kind of working on a pure recommend, and hopefully it will become clear when we do this on the last slide. So otherwise ask me if I don't if I don't want to do it or yeah. And hopefully, for the talk, I'm also going to assume that B and C are small again, just to make my life a bit easier, right? Because, as I said, I want an epsilon here, I cannot have it anymore. And maybe P is the epsilon. Now, I mean, we can do it with both B and C, not small, but it just makes the ultra ground too nicely and adequate. And what we sort of gotta do is sort of kind of connect for. Of kind of two is sort of kind of connect for A, for A being more than one, you have these small twin patterns or seven patterns. So this is small because there's small patterns, right? And then when we decrease A to be more F small, that sort of discussion. So some sort of preliminaries, etc. Let's look at a fixed point. So when you play with A, now B and C are just a normal one parameter sheet. A normal one parameter she like that is a developing one fixed variable. And this happens in this sort of critical uh uh number or critical uh value. And if we can see how small this happens exactly. But let's say we started with an AS2, you have got one fixed point and um one uh four A star feature. Then you can sort of look at a Hamilton hotification or tuning instability and you can compute that it happens around A is two-thirds. So A star was one, right? And then A, when the Hampton Hotification occurs, it's two-thirds. So sort of uh in this region where we have got two tricks branches, and we have the two branches, it's sort of uh the homogeneous state sort of proofs that we expect. Um But um here is sort of the sort of the beginning of all the eigenvalues that we need for that, and then I've got loopholes. And uh you see this happens in a fairly small range for data transactions. And these eigenvalues, and these these dockers are actually, these are scaled versions, so these are actually what I have to display. Okay, so they probably come from Turing buttons, so let's now print on the memerics right and let's see what we see directly. So I take B small, as I said, equal t equals to zero, because then we have we started something symmetrically just a bit easier to find all the branches in a gradification diagram. PS3 doesn't really matter, and LS5 is the same as the size of that. What do we sort of see? We sort of see that you get a spike solution over here. So let's say we So let's say we start with a big A and then we sort of enter in this branch and we see sort of spike solution being created. So the background state sort of increases and the size of the spikes is also increases right. Then if you keep on increasing A, you come sort of in this red region or pink. This is sort of the region that we sort of studied before, right? Not on a periodic domain, but on an unbounded domain, whether it's similar or not. So what they sort of see. Enough. So they sort of see. You see that this spike is scrolling and it reaches a maximum of around two. Oh, yeah, and we also have this rapid word, of course. And then, when it hits sort of its maximum value, it starts widening. This all happens in this order absolutely. Another A zero. So the width between so we have let's say the pills and now become two multiplaces. They are widening and widening and now Widening and widening, and now also what you see before, the slope components of V and W more as did nothing, and now sort of they also start to grow and start to sort of have a And then if you let's say keep on increasing or decreasing or increasing A, we get so sort of this sort of this width, keeps on increasing until it more or less fills half of the domain. And when it fits half of the domain, then you keep increasing A or dec decrease or decrease A, we just sort of see Decrease or decrease A, which is sort of C, is then also just sort of lose this sort of step function-like behavior and also away from these interfaces equally. One thing that we noticed when we did this simulation is that around this branch here, the V and W components are exactly zero. Or exactly zero. So when U has this big interface, P and W seem to be zero. And then also sort of in this frame A, this over here, it happens just after the, it doesn't happen at the first at two minutes, it happens a bit later. We sort of see a new baby spine here. So we sort of see a baby this one being born. Okay, so this is the symmetric case, but you can have This is the symmetric case, but you can then of course turn on C and it becomes asymmetric, but you still get the same sort of behavior. But you see, if you now start from here, it will be very hard to cover this feature. So we see that, as I said, I don't have to do this a lot. But you see the same behavior, the chronology of the spike, the widening of the interfaces, sort of changing behaviour of the fast component in the slow region, and then here you see. And then here you see new paper spike will be born. So effectively we sort of identified, I would say, four different types of solutions. Four different types of solutions. Three of them have AB more than one, and one of them has this AB more than. Right? I've got a one spike, it's got, let's say, the one plus, it's got a two interface and a two interface plus one spike. Phase and two weak phase plus one spike. So this one we sort of have done before. So let's say this one first, so that's sort of this last one. I can sort of basically I meant to argue that this is actually beyond two added together. So let's not focus on that one. Okay, so let's say we understand this, because I can add the animals. So that's done. So that's done. And then this one is also sort of, we have done this effectively on an unbounded domain, on a pre-R domain technical, but it's not so too much. And then we also, with a different approach, we actually looked at this before. So you can derive an existence condition, sort of explanations of hyperbolic signs, so you have a bit more different more complicated combinations. This is sort of how many roots there can be. roots they can be. There's an x star here that you need to solve and this x star is directly related to the different space. So that was that part we sort of understood before. So now let's see, so let's say these two are down, right? Let's see if we can understand these two. So now A is really order one, right? So I really have to give in now, right? I I cannot get away anymore without a lot of order. With our notebook. But I said the work on the domain name is sort of the same as what June was doing, right? We have to define our region in our spatial region in different regions, let's say slow regions or fast regions. I decided to take the colour coding of PAL because it's much better than blue and color colour coding, of all for fast or slow way. So red is slow and blue is fast in this case. And blue response in this case. And that should be a good venture. So, or the other way around, I have to do this. As long as they can make us about the other way around. So, we see for this fat solution, we sort of have two different regions, right? We have one fast and one slow region. And for the student phase, we have the key phase. Now we can sort of use spatial dynamics, right? Now we can sort of use spatial dynamics, right? So we can sort of do the standard machinery open but any hopefully we can say something about metrics. Um so this was our uh this is now our ODE, we write this at first of a slow system. Uh this is used to study the red regions. We can go to a fast system. Right, so this is my uh my one slide sort of uh justifying me being near. Uh justify me being here. It's not time, but it's spread its right. Ah, that's spread. Um so we said epsilon to zero right, so we look at the toss-reduce system or the layer dynamics. So we have sort of this Hamiltonian system that we can sort of study. So we write down the Hamiltonian problem, right? And now we have sort of these different cases. We also have negative. three different cases we also have negative force but we don't uh i it's a symmetric case so if eight times p bar is zero you've got two uh hypothetics if eight times p is less than this two two over three square of three you've got a homo homopinic connection in which it's really of nothing and then you think this metric two over three square of three result is four right because that's four out of the square which is not right. So we have seen that in three times. Sorry? Three times. Sorry? Three times. Three talks. Three talks now, right? Yeah, yeah. So this is the metric number, right? So I'm trying to connect my talk to as many other talks, right? So we're also referring to now, okay? So this is sort of the different system based, the different Hamiltonian is based on sort of the value of V bar. So V bar sort of is one of the slope or just the constant value of V doing job. Right? And now we maybe remember or Maybe you remember, or if you look into the scripture, right? Remember, this V bar remember zeros. So this is the special case where A times V bar is zero. So there we have two hydrogenic conditions. This is exactly what we see here, right? We see the one hydrogen jump and here is the other hydrogen jump. Yeah, so here HMG bar is zero, so we've got two helicopter connections, and here it's below certain limit and it's what I want to do. Alright, so we won't be Alright, so we will need this setup for let's say the two interface solutions, so we do need this setup for the first five solution. Oh, I actually say that. Then we look at the fast-reduced system, right? So we look at the L scale internet to serve. So we've got a slow system on a constraint that sort of all these dynamics sort of combined. So here we've got a u minus u q. Here on the whole frequency at A times P. Let's just have A times V. Um so effectively if you're over here on the on the right branch, and A times V is weak, you've got to hook in connection. So A times V is zero, you've got to open the other way around. And this sort of explains the whole picture, and then you have to do some some hand waving to line this up. So the one thing sort of So the one thing sort of what we needed, because we don't have, let's say, enough fast regions, so for the spec solutions, the slope components really cannot do anything. This is the background state. And that's all what we get. The U component is that the spike is this one here. It's given by the solution to the problem, and you can completely say whatever the height of the spike is. If you go to the two-interface case, A has to be again less than two-thirds, but A can also be bigger than two-thirds, but then it's sort of, then L cannot be too big, and this is related to this matchable number over here. This was this, we saw this back in the sort of the bi-froggy label. When we kept this extra spike, we sort of saw we met A was bigger than its conflict. And so we get this hyperbolic. So, we get this hyperbolic tensions that are sort of jumping up and jumping down and jumping up. Then, if you look at the slow dynamics, you have to solve the slow system, but you have this constraint, so it's easier to write this in terms of u and q. Then you have to desynch desynchlorize, you're studying the headwrite, but in the end you sort of this is the phase portrait and you just have to leaking away with it in the frame, and then you can sort of make sense of it. And then you can sort of make sense of it. That's sort of uh uh the the whole story. So we now understand all these four different um solutions and we sort of understand how these sort of two tuning pattern two tuning instability these spikes are born and how they connect with these two interfaces. So this picture is sort of understood, but then of course we can keep on Increasing, decreasing, increasing, decreasing, any rate, because why not? And when you sort of see a sort of capital, it shows where you go from one to three to five losses. Why do we want to, I mean, we didn't look at anything at all, at stability, right? I mean, so I don't know. And uh why do we want to look on pyramid boundaries, uh I told you I would say, right? We I mean David uh is very interested in the I mean the data that I'm going to be something that marks the watching models actually. Are there any questions? I'm curious, you have basically two equations that you're adding, they're very much the same, one just has a slightly different diffusion constant. That's sort of surprising, but now you're taking it very small as well. So does that be, I mean, must be doing something, but I mean, just intuitively, it's sort of funny you have twice the same equation. How does that come in? So if you work on an unbounded domain, so. So you can take this alpha and mean they don't necessarily these coupling problems don't have to have to be positive. I mean they have to be positive for the application, right? But if they have opposite sign you can sort of can sort of change the behavior. You can sort of get two solutions that don't exist if you have only one of the for one separate equation. If you go in two spatial dimensions, you find uh travelling spots that are stable. Uh you don't find them when you have two components, you find them when you have two components. You find them may have two components and both positive and observations that you find yes. So the filter component really does something, but it looks extremely like the design component. I mean in what you presented today, you know, you talk about situations that you've not presented today, have you? Yeah, no, no, uh what I presented today, I would say. Can you do it without? Yes, yes. Well, I mean, I can say no, right? Because I guess you're standing here. I don't see why not. Because we sort of ignore the whole detail. I'm pretty sure I could get a good question. Yeah, but I already answered it. Oh, sorry. I maybe just make a comment, because you say blue is fast and red is slow, and that should be the convention. Now, if you want a convention, then you should have something that is meaningful and easy to interpret. So, you know, in our colour scheme, blue and red have something to do with stability, you know, uh white the colour spectrum, uh shifts, uh shifts uh that means the star moves away from you or towards you or if you want the cold blood coming through the heart and moving away. So there's meaning to these colours. It's very dangerous to use red and gold. So I would suggest green for fast, orange for slow, in like stock-like colours or something like that, that people understand it automatically. No, no, but I mean the red, right? I mean it's green, blood is red, right? Yeah, and then who? But I think it should be a democratic process. So we false. It's important for us. Maybe this should be full of discussion. All of this is around, actually. Flow is blue, layer is green, and epsilon is non-zero is edge. I've used this for thirty years. This was not very important.
