We're meeting the taking. This is a really fun conference. You're doing. Yeah, so I'm going to talk about our cubings. If there's time, I'll talk about our cubings. And this is all joint work with Monsei and Leah who are over there. So I'm going to state, like, I'm going to talk a little bit about the main motivating question, but it's maybe not the Maybe not the point as much as I thought it was, but so for which finitely generated groups G is the asymptotic component of G v. So it's like the original question. It's like the original question, maybe that they had first thinking about it, they were already thinking about it. So, when you make an astrophotic count of a group G, I think it was Matt that said it was like away from an Iraqi ship instead of you piloting that in the truth. Just like Um just like kind of faith in a mind or a tree or whatever. Um so there's yeah, so when you make an asymptotic um you make choices. You make like you choose from a dizzying array of things because you've got to pick an unalterable filter of natural numbers and then you're you have something that's highly non-canonical. So the answer um is not at all. Not all. So there's this, like there's a lot, there's a lot of work on this, actually. And the thing I would encourage looking at, maybe if you've never seen this before, is just a paper by Thomas Andrelakovich in about 2000. They make some really presented small cancellation examples. And it's four for a five-page paper, and it's just an example where the radio asymptotic codes. We have two non-human market asymptotic codes. I should say my thing for unique sense of violence should so we can work with it. So you're never going to do better than that because if you just change the generators or something in your group, you're going to change. Or something in your group you're going to change the metric, and it's closed in a sound class. That's teaching. But the question is whether or not for which groups that's the worst that can happen. So there's more and more like results, like weird, weird things. Like I think SL3Z already, I think, has the property that depending on whether you'd like to continue hypothesis or not, you Like to continue hypothesis or not, either there's uncounting many different autopsy components with images. So there's lots of things that can happen. But on the other hand, you know, many are. So here's like G is hyperbolic, then all the codes. All the cones, so all the asymptotic cones are isometric. Let's only say if it's, hold on, some grammar, say it's non-elementary, that all the asymptotic cones are asymmetric to the universal real tree. Uh real tree of continuum elements. So there's this unique um uh real tree, just the unique real tree that when you delete any point from it, it's got continuous parts and all the asymptotic cones group that's not very exactly isometric to that. Uh there's then there's some um Some generalizations of that. So Osin and Sapir and also Alex. So if G hyperbolic relative to H, and H has a very simple thing. H has unique cones. So does G. And Alex used this to prove it for three normal groups. So this was all around like I don't know, twenty ten to 10 to 15. So there are lots of groups that look more like the ones that we've heard about this week that don't do the weird things. I saw three dead does or something. Hyperbolic groups and various generalizations of them that you guys thought of coming. So that's how the real treatment thing got started. real people thing got started was we were going to try to well we're going to try to prove this for rags and path classes so I'm going to state the I'm going to state the theorem and then so let's let G be it's quasi asymmetric to Either the fundamental group of a compact special Q complex. So, for example, it could be a rag or a right angle complex group or something. Or the mapping class group will finite change, just like this. There's a more general class of groups, and I haven't written let G be a hierarchically hyperbolic group because it's not quite all hierarchically hyperbolic. Not quite all hierarchical hypotheses, but it's extra hypotheses, extra more algebraic hypotheses that accommodate those examples. The original example that they were thinking about was Kagistan-Redang group. So then all asymptotic comps G from all the operations. So the way that I guess that we do it is not that different, or it's supposed to not be that different from what these people were doing. So you have to make the relatively hyperbolic case, the asymptotic cones are tree-graded spaces where you have all these pieces that must. Have all these pieces that look like alpha side of counts of h, and they're just grouped together along points, and they're grouped together along every possible point. Like any way of like walking around in your tree of spaces and spending a certain amount of time in one of these fashion, anything can happen. It's like the biggest possibility. So we were just like, let's try to imitate that construction, but in the same way that HHS imitates. I made little notes for myself when I had them. Okay. If anyone wants little pieces of paper like this, we'll be having a lot of fun with them at lunch. It's like the right amount of math to beer during lunch. So I guess I'm just going to start giving some definitions. So there is a little bit of an outline for the business. So that was just like a little motivation. If you don't care about asymptotic cones, though, then you should probably leave. But if you then you should probably leave, but if you but if you don't care about if you care about asymptotic cones but you don't care about this question about asymptotic cones, then you should stay. Because there's other, this is kind of a one motivating question. I'm not really going to talk about that theorem too much anymore. So what I'm going to tell you about is real cubits because those are the analogs of these universal cubicles. Right? And so we have to talk about some median stuff. I have to talk about most of the time. I talk about which media and stuff. Oh, I have to talk about... Wait. Owner laws. And I have to talk about. About how it comes at the end. So, I'm going to basically one and two are about how to define a real cubing. So, no one's defined the higher. Has anyone done the hierarchy of allic space definition in their talk about it? Okay, so I'm going to do something which is sort of an easier version of DAO. But that's immediate one and two. And then there's time at the end, I'll tell you about at least why passenger comes of. Asymbolic code instead of error are these really key. So, okay, so medium things. I'm going to put some definitions so immediately. So a median space, looks like a triple, you have a so you have a metric space and the other paired is immediate algebra. I'm not going to tell you that definition of this. I can say it in the UK for our purposes. Then you play for our purposes. So what it will tell you is that mu is a map from triples x to x. And then the property that you have to have is that, well, I'm going to just draw the picture rather than so in drawing it like it's a geodesic metric space, but it doesn't have to be. So here's just for any three points in the space, element. And look at what the median is. And it has to be the unique point so that when you sum the distances, like for any pair, when you go from there to there, that sum is equal to the actual geodesic distance over there, and the same as that one and same with that one. So if it was a geodesic space, it means that there's a geodesic tripod that goes from the geodesic. Okay. So Okay, so uh I mean it would be nice to tell you about median algebras, but I won't. Uh but it's kind of a nice um this is more important this is more important than that. If you're thinking about these things for the first time, the median algebra structure really has one to do. So let's do some examples around my little salient over here. So heads through That's here two complexes with the L1 metric or median metric spaces. So here you just put the L1 metric. You think of each cube as one metric and you prove that you can extend that to like a metric thing that's sensible so that the cubes are asymmetrically embedded and that's a medium metric. Simpler example A simpler example, if I do a set with two elements and take a product, that's a median space. And I'm drawing attention to that one because, so a set with two elements is obvious metric, is vacuously a median space. And if you take a product of median spaces in general, then Then we can do the following. So then there's a component-wise median, and if you give it the LOM metric, it's a median space. Write that down. So this one's going to be kind of important. So I take some collection of spaces outside this median space, and I'm going to use the notation. So L1. So L1 of the correction xi is going to be the subset of the product with the product median so the median. So the median of three tuples is just the component bias median and the L1 metric. And this is just the base point. So you just pick a base point and then you look at all the things that are at finite L1 distance from the A one distance from the that's this thing. So meaning on a two point set is just like our rules. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so exactly. So right, yeah, so the um so the mu has zero is zero one is zero, mu is one zero one. And if you if you And if you if you um if you everyone should just spend the rest of the talk drawing a planet cube and um reading the obedience of all the triples. Whoever does the highest dimension will want the planes. So okay. So now I guess I should tell you. So this has like, right, I mean this has like HHS vibes. I don't know if there's anyone who's sort of encountered the ideas in that quarter, but that's been an HSI. That order, but that's in an HHS. What are you doing? You're looking at some space and you're mapping it to a product of hyperbolic spaces, and you're analyzing it inside the product of hyperbolic spaces. And because of all the coarseness, you're super not doing the L1 metric, even though the distance formula has a sum and it looks kind of like the L1 metric. But what we learned from Matt talking about cubicle approximation, but we kind of. Talk on the cubicle approximation, but it kind of are because metrics are finite sets of points. And for any pair of points, you are doing all of a metric pair. So let's actually make that a little bit more precise. So this was This is like the some people have heard me rant about this before the like the Berstock inequality and Segiv's construction are kind of the same thing point like it's fun so there's like we heard about the Seguki About the Segu construction of the dual cube complex with dual wall space. And what the Segiv construction is just talking about is the fact that that zero cube complexes are median sub-algebras of cubes. So let's talk about that. So if I take, I'm going to try to write this in a slightly Write this in a slightly wavered way. So let's have xi filled in that notation over there be just a copy of the unit interval. So that's a median space also with the usual quick. Median is three points in the middle. And let's have Let's define relations, which I'm going to call that and that. We're not going to masking that on my indexing set. And if I is transverse to j, then To J, then choose an end point of each of the i and j intervals, each one associated to zero. So I'm going to call them rho j i and rho i j, which are both either zero or one, but this is inside. Inside x of j, some that's inside i. That's like in the definition of some shots, but it's when we had the core, whenever you have two transverse domain, two overlapping subsurfaces, we have a subsurface prejunction. So I'm just saying that for each edge in my collection, if I have two of them that are transverse, it's really an Transverse. It's really unfortunate that some people say transverse in cube complex context to mean like some walls cross. I mean the opposite of that. I mean transverse in the HHS sense. So they have to have, these edges have to have a well-defined projection onto each other. The orthogonality is going to be about crossing walls. That's going to be about independence between, like, those two things don't constrain each other at all. And then what we do is you're going to let. We're going to let C, which is going to be a subset of L1 and all these things. So it's a, it's like a, I think it's literally like some sort of variety, right? sort of variety actually if you think of this as a don't do it so I'm going to take the solution set of the following system of equations down so I do xi minus r j i x j zero draw What am I doing? I'm just so so what's each um what's each I have an electrical product of the i and the j factors and we could have something like that for one of the resolutions. That's the solution set. That's the solution set in that square, and then I'm just intercepting, I'm like, taking its pre-image under projection to that square and intersecting all this thing. And that's a, yeah, like every, so here's a theorem by Saviv. You'd be totally weirded out if I stated it like this, but every I can just imagine what's keeping this. So every cat-tier cucumber arises like this. And to give some, just a quick picture of how this happens, if you're in a cat zero cube complex and you look at all the hyperplanes, I'm going to pick one. Pick one, I'm gonna, like, capital I is going to be my set of hyperplanes. I'm gonna pick one edge dual to each hyperplane. And if I have two, try their carriers, if I have two hyperplanes that don't cross, then and if they, if this is like hyperpower. If this is like hyperplane I and that's hyperplane J, then I can look at the closest point projection of this hyperplane onto that hyperplane, and that's going to be on one side or the other because they don't cross. And this point in the edge, the one, so it doesn't matter which edge, because it's just about which side it controls. But this one's on the same side as that one, so this is going to be rho ij, and this is going to be rho ji. And what does the consistency condition tell you? What's the rule in C Deep's construction, which is like every vertex in the Q complex is a choice of half space for each hyperplane so that you're never orienting them away from each other. Well, the consistency condition, like is to like a vertex, I can orient this hyperplane, like if I orient them both. Hyperplane, like if I orient them both towards the vertex, in this case I'm orienting this hyperplane towards this hyperplane. If it's over here, then pointing them towards the vertex means I'm pointing this one towards that one. So like I'm going away from the row point over there, but I'm going over here. What am I saying? The projection of this point onto here is far from the point. Here is far from the projection of that hyperplane once in there, but they project in close with it. So now let's talk about the Berstock inequality, which should be written like that, except there's some coarseness in it, so you can't quite write it like a system of quadratic equations. But it's the same. It's the exact same thing. We're going to replace all those edges with hyperbolic spaces, and we're going to replace those projections with the AJ just and we're going to make course so that's that's used construction and then let's look at the The Veristock inequality. Or, yeah. Well, I'm certainly trained. So, this is the consistency axiom in the general HHS setup. And I'm just going to draw the picture. So, here I have U and V are transverse domains. So, I can make a picture of. Of I'll make a picture of the product of Cu and C V. So here's Cu, here's C V. This is a really, this is a really well-known picture in this room. So here is rho VU, and here is rho UV, and what does the consistency inequality say? Well, it says that. Quality say, well, it says if I look at the projections of points in my HHS onto this thing, onto the product of the two paragraphs, they have to either land, they have to land in there. They have to either land uniformly close in this thing to the row point or uniformly close to that point to be there. But this is sort of an appropriate coarse sense that HHS is the intersection of the pre-images of all those little complements of quarter spaces. I mean, that's the quarter spacing circumposition doesn't make sense for all interval, doesn't it? That picture is real. And then there's a nested case, too, which I didn't have any nesting in the Q complex. Complex. That's the case. Let's see. I have here, there's CU. C V, I've just drawn the product again. And then inside of V, I have a point for U, right? Because V is the bigger one. And the consistent. And the consistency plus boundary field as a human jackson says like, well, if I'm in V at the point associated to U, I'm in V at the point associated to U, then I can go anywhere I want in U. But if I'm not, if I'm in V away from there, then I have to be in a specific V. Specifically. If I want to move inside the smaller thing, I have to first go to the appropriate places. Those are the pictures of the consistency of course. So that's the bare stock inequality is. Bear stock inequality is like some Gibbs construction thing. And the idea behind the real cubing is that we're going to decarsify HHSs in a way that generalizes cube complexes. So sort of RQing, I'm going to just tell you the philosophy first. The philosophy first. So it's like in HHS, except what are the differences. You take the definition from HHS, and then you say each CU is now, that changes to one I call it TU. I'm going to call it TU. An archery. All the things in the definition of an HHS that are coarse points, sort of the rows in the definition of HHS and the projection maps or course maps, these become actually points. So your trees are all homogeneous? Not at the moment. Like, this is an example. Like this is an example because the units are quotes maximum. But in practice, like verb becomes. So course points become points. On constants that you see in the definition, but on HHS, all become zero. And then there's some more serious things that happen, which is, if you know the definition of an HHS, it's It's not meaningful, otherwise, you're not going to be encumbered with notions, and you should ignore this anyway. So, we're going to drop the large link axiom. And we're going to drop, and we're going to weaken, let's say, a uniqueness. But what we're going to do instead is What we're going to do instead is assume, essentially assume the distance from. Now we're going to be, but we're allowing infinite sums. So you're taking, so your real cubic X is going to sit inside of L1 of this family of R trees. Arches as a median sublime. So this isn't an actual definition of anything. It's kind of constructed equivalently. This is the sort of idea. If you like to think about it the HHS way, it's a space that's isometrically embedded inside a product of R trees, generally infinite product of R trees. Infinite product of R trees. And it's a median sub-algebra. That really just means, like, it's a theorem about median algebra is that sub-algebras are obtained by deleting half spaces and quarter spaces. And so the deletions are going to be determined by consistency conditions that are exactly this. Of course, the symbol. Yes. Yes. Doesn't that give you something stronger than uniqueness? So uniqueness... Uniqueness implies that there are arbitrarily large diameter involved spaces. Because uniqueness says that if you have two points in the HHS that are far apart, then and and so the weakening of uniqueness over here is just it's weakened to your insider product. Like so if two points are different, then they're they different. Different, then they're the difference. So you don't have a threshold. So you don't have anything saying. You can work with thresholds. Right, exactly. And you don't want a threshold because you have like a literal sum. The dropping large links I won't talk about right now, but if you're interested, there's a paper about most of the stuff. Most of the stuff, everything I'm talking about today is in a paper that's on my website. There's going to be more of it in a week. But there's a section of the paper that's called What Happened to the Large Links Axiom When We Run to the Slack if you're interested in using this one. Um so okay, so now I should tell you what one actually is. Yes. So um like the this setup is very similar to the This setup was very similar to the whole clock location now. In that you can replace, like locally you can replace all the hyperblock space for the trees, and then back mess no horse mess anymore, et cetera, et cetera. But I remember we talked about, I don't remember exactly, is there's like a connectedness assumption, if I want to know that's the main difference? Well is that somewhere maybe like assuming that it's simple? Somewhere maybe like assuming that it's local or something. So yeah, so in gener it's true that in general a median subalgebra of a product doesn't have to be connected. I could like delete that open quarter space, that open quarter space. I'm just off with that's a sub-algebra and that's fine. So that is ruled out by the definition. Like an R cubing is kind of like a thing. The I mean I guess the main, so the, yeah, that's a great example actually, because the cube complexes in the cubicle approximation are cubings in an interesting way. So this sort of thing shows you that A cat0q complex, just using Complex. Just using the edges as the R trees turns out to be an R cubing, but that's not a very interesting R cubing. But the way that you said it, that same finite complex inside a product of trees that have a meaning, that's a more interesting thing. I guess the thing that's more general about this is that you're allowing There was something, I remember this, and there were some other gits that were But yeah, so this is supposed to be a global thing, and that's the global thing. So the market has to call a market which is supposed to be gold. Yeah, yeah, so this is this, so actually, well, let me state that right now, actually, because that was so they didn't, they didn't say it, they didn't say it this way, but. But it's not too hard to get from their theorem to this one. So Berstock and Drutsu have like 2010. They essentially proved that the cones of the mapping class group are architects. The trees are like the PDF trees? I'm going to tell you what the trees are. I'm going to tell you. Stop! I'm going to tell you, unless you want to give my time. No, they're not the V V F trees. That's actually really subtle, because they're not um they're not ultra limits of periods. Because there could be this issue of linear distance without it this on linear cells. Right. If this self-linear self-toes. Right, that's right, that's right. So you, instead of instead of building up the, instead of taking the things in the HHS structure and taking their ultra limits and looking at the product of those, you have to look at the cone and collapse stuff to get trees. And this is what we used to do in the network. And news to me. Was that said news to me? And um, right. So, uh yeah, so I'm gonna tell you how that works. So, I didn't tell you, so if you know the definition of an HSS, you can imagine the definition from that. Um what I'm gonna do instead is do something a little bit more concrete to construct a Construct a, to a more constructive definition. So if you've seen why certain cube complexes are HHSs, then this is more like that. So there's three authors of the paper and there's three equivalent definitions of R cubing. And so I'm giving you a mixture of two of them. And there's well, I mean, actually the third one is sort of more like that algebraic geometry. So let's color walls. So yeah, so let's have X. Now there's going to be a complete connected finite dimensional finite. So the rank thing is, so for cube complexes, it's just a dimension. In general, remember how the discrete, like n cube, is a median algebra? The rank of a median space, as you look at what discrete, like n cubes you can embed as median sub-algebras into the supreme. And so there's this really sort of like amazing body of work by Pierre Levant, which the upshot of which is if you have a median space that satisfies these three things, then anything that you hope to be true from calculated u complexes probably works in your median. So a wall that we have. is a pair of subspaces, so the union W and W star is the whole of X, and W and W star are convex, partitioned into two convex pieces at the Catsero Review Complex. I said convex. Complex. I said complete connected on finite rank. That implies that it's a geodesic space, and so you know what convex means. You can define it just in terms of the V. And now. What would I relate to that? Well, so here's this thing that's also really important. So Chatuji True 2000. Blooms. So they generalize to these constructions. So if you're a wall space and you're making a cat-zero cube complex dual to it, then the important condition, or the condition that used to be important in soil curtains, is that finitely many walls separate many two points. And then in the median setup, what they ask is for a wall space with some measure on the walls that you just have. That's a measure on the balls that you're just asking for the reflect. That's the ball separating points. So what they um did is they made a measure, call it L on the set. So good to note that Wx is meant to be the set of all the walls. If they made a measure, L. They made a measure L on there such that for all points of X, the distance between those points is the measure of the set of walls in X that separate X is in one half space and Y half space. So they made a measure so that when you look at any new points, the distance is to measure the set of walls separately. Which is just like this is a like, so for a cat zero cube complex, this is counting measure, and this is just the fact that the L1 distance between vertices is the number of hyperpones that separate them. This is just a generalization of that. And the one we actually use, so I should have to give one to that. Yeah. So if you're about to use Um so if Firovanti actually improved this in a technical way, uh question? Yes. So proto balls, I guess you say you have both W and W star be the enterprise X events or sorry? You have both W and W star be the enterprise. Oh, sorry, I want to make them just one. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, sorry. This is what yeah. Yeah, sorry. This is what yeah, I mean it's uh um and I think of W I think of the stars actually evolution on the walls that not on the forgotten on the half-space system. Okay, so yeah, I mean I'm going to tell anyone who wants to hear about asymptotic cones at lunch, but uh I will try to get through the rest of the definition of argument. So um I have to say one more thing, and I'm going to hide something to make a sort of simpler definition. If you know about I'm not going to tell you yet. So So let's just say. So in a collection F NCF of closed convex subspaces, X is a Factor system. If the following things happen. So it's a little bit different than what you're used to from kube complexes, but that's just an artifact of the order that I'm saying. So you want the whole space to be in there. You want, so if u is some. u is some subspace and u prime is some subspace of x parallel to u. And the problem is in x, what does parallel mean? Parallel means that they cross the same pulse. It also means that when the closest point projects one of them onto the other one, it's an isometry. And then I want to close this under projections. So if u and v are in there, then just closest point projection onto u of v, that's some other closed convex set, and it has to be in there. And now I'm going to say A additional definition, and then I can tell you how you make real heating some practice. So, given F isn't because I listen to F A for Z coloring. Of the walls associated to F is map color from walls to that set of subspaces where the color of a wall is the unique inclusion minimal. Inclusion minimalism to parallelism U in F such that W hat crosses U. And so that might not exist, but here's a lemma. So if F has bounded As bounded chains, when you order by inclusion up to parallelism, then the coloring map exists. Why? Because of, so every wall crosses somebody in the collection because of that condition. And then if you have a bound on the length of chains, then you can find. Then you can find a smallest one. And then this condition tells you that it's weak. Because if you cross two of them, then you cross the projection of one onto the other one, and that's contained. So colorings, as long as you have the bound on chains. And I guess you really just need chains that are at the moment, but this one's more like EGS stuff. And here's the other. And here's the other fact. Well, let's say the definition. So the coloring is nice if the colors of two walls are orthogonal. I'm going to tell you what that means in a second. If and only if the two walls cross. Walls cross. So crossing of walls means what you think it means. It means that all four possible quarter spaces are not empty. And orthogonal, two closed convex subspaces of the median space are orthogonal if the convex hold at their union is the product of them. Nice coloring means that anytime you see two walls that cross, Walls that cross. If I find the smallest in the minimal subcomplex or subspace in my collection that intersects them. And actually what I have is if I parallel, translate, copy, I actually have that work if only a QWR Q and W are if they cross. Okay. Yeah. So orthogonality is this geometric notion of a product region. And it's certainly true that if two subspaces are orthogonal, then the walls, and so they form a product, and the walls crossing one all cross the wall crossing the other. That's a general fact. And then the converse is a property of this set and that map that may or may not hold. That may or may not old. But uh now I can tell you how you get RQ thing. So coloring is nice if it admits this relation. Yeah, yeah, that orthogonality came from like the correspondence across the other walls. Like the correspondence across the walls. So you should just think of like in a just in a rag, each hyperplane is labeled in the universal cover of the Seletti complex is labeled by the generator. And if you take, if you've got like two, if you look at like a square, right, there's going to be a the lines corresponding to those generators are in my f and their product. My f, and their product is a plane, and that's square. And this is just so now I can say what I have. So I'm going to make a so given somebody in there, I can consider, so I'm going to write W sub U of the U. So u of a pair of points x and y is the set of walls that separate, walls like w hat, that separate x and y in the sense that x is in w and y is in w star and have the color contained in the colour. Contained in the subspace U. The containment of these subspaces is always opposite of the opposite parallelism. So if the subspace that colors this wall is contained in U, and it's in that set. And then this thing you have to prove, I guess the little important, is that It's measurable. Measurable set of walls. And if you define like d sub u of x and y to be the measure of w u minus the union over all the stuff properly contained. Properly contained in U. Yeah. And then du is a pseudometric on X, and the metric potion is Is an R tree. And the way you showed this is you, well, the way you showed the last part at least is you, it's not too hard to see that the median on X descends to a median on the quotient. That's a general fact about median pseudometric spaces. But the real thing is you have to check that the median space has rank one, which makes it an R. Is rank one, which makes it an artery, and that's where the niceness condition gets used. If you have two crossing walls, then they're basically, if you have two crossing walls inside of you, then their colors can't be you. They got lost, they got crushed here. So this is just like crush all the product regions that I knew and objects are just like and I'm gonna say one more sentence. I'm going to say one more sentence and then I'm going to stop. The one more sentence is that, so these archeries sort of the distance formula on x, so distance in x between x and y, it's almost a tautology, right? It is nothing other than the sum over the sum over the over the colors of these archery distances. And this setup satisfies the definition of an arcuing that I sort of sketched over there. So you have all these trees and you're looking at the product and there's a consistency picture and all this stuff. But so to go back to what Kazra was saying when he was starting to give him a talk. One thing was starting to give me a thought more efficiently. Is that if you take a, so the, I mean, a theorem is a theorem. So if you have like Z is an HHS, then any asymptote of Z is by Lipschitz. So it's bar keeping. What I've sketched here a little bit for HHS super nerds would only prove the case where you have wedges and clean containers. It's a little bit of a little bit trickier than this setup in general, but it works. And if you're, so the way that you do this is like just for, say, the mapping class group. like just for the say the mapping class group is you have um all the sub marking graphs associated to subsurfaces of the mapping class group and those so if we're in a general HHS you have the standard product regions and limits of like ultra limits of sequences of those things embed inside the asymptotic cone you have um and you want to see them as product regions inside the asymptotic cone um and then you use this there's a photo that showed that Use this, there's a boat that showed that if you have a coarse median space in particular in HTS, then you can put a new metric on it that's biologists to the old one, which is stuff that was coarsely convex in the space becomes convex in the cone. Now you have all these product regions that came from the South American graphs, and you check that they give you a nice coloring. Coloring, so when you collapse them, you get a bunch of arteries. I've been class groups where it's actually exactly based. And I'm going to stop. We have time for one quick question. Save the rest of the break. f isn't countable right so um it's some honorous countably gonna have countably many non-zero terms for for any pair of points so there's some title measurability thing so oh yeah you mean you have to you have to check yeah you have to check Alright, that also is not good in this measure of this. Yeah, yeah. So it's true that for any two points you have countably many of them. But the typical picture of an interval is like geodesic from this point to that point is colored by the different things it has non-trivial projection onto and they Triple projection on you and they're going to be an answer.
