Perfect. Great. Thank you first so much, Noah and colleagues, for organizing this great event today. I'm now very excited to conclude with the talks here. I will cover what theoretical population biology contributed, years and decades of theoretical population biology research in the response to the COVID-19 cancer. To the COVID-19 pandemic. And in that, we'll go through three different topics. So we'll touch upon the reproductive number, a concept which has been developed for decades, cover logistic growth, both with applications to the COVID pandemic, and then look at where are we now and what does the future promise. All right, so reproductive numbers. So, reproductive number. Here you see a sketch of a healthy population, and assume at some stage somebody gets sick, a first infection. So, be it a first infected individual back in Wuhan in 2019. And now further assume this person infects on average two people. So, we have then three people in total infected. Those two people on average may infect again another two people. In fact, again, another two people makes four. Those four, in fact, another each, in fact, two makes eight, and so on. And so, this two is actually what I had here now, exemplary, the reproductive number of this hypothetical outbreak. The reproductive number is defined as the expected number of secondary infections caused by a single infected individual. And this quantity is central. This quantity is central in epidemiology. And actually, there have been many decades of work around this reproductive number. And I would claim pretty much throughout the 20th century, there were in different fields, demography, population biology, epidemiology, concepts not necessarily coined as the productive number, but concepts discussed. And actually, I think rather than giving names here, it would be a huge list who contributed to it. I recommend this. To it, I recommend this article by Hans Histerbeck from 20 years back: A Brief History of the Productive Lumber and a Recipe for Its Calculation, where he really outlines how the whole 20th century was influenced or were contributed to how we now use the reproductive number. And in fact, most of the names which were dropped in Mark's talk earlier with chapters of this book, he laid out those. He laid out those names also in some way were involved in this reproductive number. So, what does it, why do we care in epidemiology and what does it mean? Well, first, if R, the reproductive number, is bigger than one, it means the epidemic is growing exponentially. One person on average infects more than one person, so has more than one children, meaning things spread. Spread. While if R is smaller than one, the epidemic declines. So, well, one could argue we can just look and see if case numbers go up or down. Why do we care about this reproductive number? Well, one first thing is, and here we do an additional definition, the reproductive number at the start of an epidemic called also R0. It is how fast is the pathogen being transmitted? Being transmitted. So, what's the expected number of secondary infections at the start without people having any immunity nor any measures were there? Meaning that was in 2019 in Wuhan when nobody even knew about SARS-CoV-2, or then in the early 2020 in most of our countries when the virus had already entered, but we didn't really realize. And so the virus just spread with. Spread with our normal lifestyle, and everybody was susceptible to the virus. So then it became a big question: what's this R0? And in general, there's a lot of scientific work on how to calculate R0. And why do we want to do that? Well, if we know R0 when an outbreak starts, then under simple population dynamic models, we can derive that the epidemic is only starting to decline again once. To decline again once one minus one divided by R0 of the population obtained immunity, be it through vaccination or infection. So people are immune to being infected by the disease. Why this term? So I had this example of two. One person on average infects two people. Now, if we plug two in here, we get an 0.5. And you can now envision. And you can now envision if I, on average, infect two people, but half the population is already immune, well, then I only find one half who is susceptible, meaning rather than infecting two people, I only infect one. The other one I would have infected is already immune. So once half of the population has immunity with an R0 of two, the epidemic starts declining. And early in the pandemic, this was, of course, it was. Was of course, um, it was very important to know what is this or not because that will give us a sense of when do we think case numbers will go down again if we weren't to do anything. And so, in what follows, I actually want to highlight a few examples where first this are not, but then throughout the pandemic, the reproductive number played a role. So, first, early on, so very early 2020, it was uncomfortable. It was unclear what is the R0. We just saw in Wuhan increasing case numbers. And Vio and Althaus were one of the first to actually quantify R0 for Wuhan. What essentially they did is they looked at the case numbers and assumed that roughly every five days that's from contact tracing was suspected every five days on average a person infects another transmits the disease and infected individual infects disease. This infects disease after five days. Then, at day five, those people are getting newly infected again after five days. In fact, and roughly every five days, this epidemic was doubling, meaning in every step, people infect, each individual infects two people. So, the productive number that are not would be around two. Then, in parallel, once the first sequence. In parallel, once the first sequencing data became available, we in our research group asked: well, there's China, but there are all those other places where the virus started spreading. What's there or not around the world? And at some stage, there was, well, maybe very optimistic hope that while Wuhan, things got very quickly out of control, maybe climate and environmental factors are so different that in other countries the spread would be. Countries, the spread would be slower. But what we found based on sequencing data, and in a second I'll outline how from sequences you actually can also get the R0, we got an R0 between two and three, maybe even a bit bigger, consistently for the different countries. Meaning, one type of SARS-CoV-2 SNRNA between two and three. So at least 50% of the population needs to be infected with both. Needs to be infected before the epidemic is starting to decline. And that already knowing back then that the case fatality or the infection fatality was around a percent, it was clear that this will not or there would be overburdening of the healthcare system if one would just let the virus run through. So, how did we get this or calculated? This calculator are not based on sequencing data. And here I should say again, this was not, you know, that we developed at the time a new method. This was again based on decades of research by many different groups. So you have sequencing data here. Hypothetical, I say we have four SARS-CoV-2 sequences from a particular country. They differ at particular positions just because in different infected individuals, the virus. Infected individuals, the virus may have fixated a different nucleotide. Based on similarity between the sequences, we can reconstruct a phylogenetic tree. So that's the whole field of phylogenetics. And this phylogenetic tree, we can see as a proxy for the transmission chain. So we can approximately assume that, you know, this patient here or the virus. Patient here, or the virus from an infected host here, infected onwards yet another infected individual from which we sampled another sequence. So we have a tree, but of course the tree doesn't help us yet to get the R0. Now we ask how quickly actually do those transmissions happen? And if we had a sequence from every single infected individual, we could now just count through time. We could now just count through time how fast are the lineages accumulating, and if every five days there's a doubling, well, that would mean the reproductive number is two. Of course, we only have a few sequences out of a big epidemic, so statistical methods need to now also incorporate that we have incomplete sampling. But the idea is essentially counting lineages through time, correcting for incomplete sampling. Incomplete sampling. And the whole field of phylodynamics is called phylodynamics, extracting from a tree population dynamic parameters, such as the reproductive number. And you now may wonder why actually did we use genetic sequences and not just look at the case data? Well, for countries, say, like Italy, all of a sudden, all those cases appeared. And it was not clear if very early on, up on the first introduction. If very early on, up on the first introduction of the virus, cases were actually already counted well. I mean, we were all short on PCR testing, etc. While with sequences, even if we sequence a couple of weeks later, we can reconstruct what happened right at the start of an outbreak. And that's why we use this alternative approach and were then rather convinced that an R0 between two and three is plausible given from sequences, we got the same as. We got the same as Rio and Althaus got for case data in Wuhan. Okay, so then we all realized around the globe that actually, well, this pathogen is spreading very fast. We are in the middle of a pandemic. So, what we wanted is not to only know our NOT, so the reproductive number at the start of the pandemic, but also how it's developing. So, different countries wanted to know than the R. Different countries wanted to know than the R value, how big it is to see how well measures work. Once, say, there's a mask mandate, by how much percentage does the R value drop, that allows us to consider how many measures we actually need to get the pandemic under control. And so we set out first for Switzerland, but then we downloaded data from around the world every day in real time to estimate the R value through our. The R value throughout the pandemic. And what was the core idea or in detail? How did we calculate the R value? Well, so if at some day, say that was April, during the lockdown in Switzerland and most of our countries, we had say 700 new cases. And five days before, and remember five days, it's roughly how long it takes until one person infects its offspring, there were a thousand cases. So we had an R value of around 0.7. 0.7. However, not on that day when we saw 700 infected individuals. Roughly, it took 10 days at the time until a new infection got confirmed and reported in Switzerland. So actually, the reproductive number of 0.7 was 10 days earlier already. So we always have a bit of a delay quantifying our epidemic. So, in a summary, what I just described is how to calculate the reproductive. How to calculate a reproductive number is based on a renewal equation. There is a method implemented by Anne Corey already in 2013 at Imperial College, FPSDEM. That was a method I remember reading this paper in 2013, thought it's a very nice R package, useful. I tried it out for some influenza data here and there. And then during the pandemic, it's fair to say around the globe, different countries, different researchers who were involved in the response. Who were involved in the response used this package? Where essentially the R calculation is based on the idea I just outlined, with the exception that, well, not exactly after five days are we transmitting, but there is a distribution. The W S is how infectious are you after S days? And so if it's exactly five days, then W5 is one and everything else is zero. But more realistically, you would have a distribution. A distribution. And so, essentially, using such a renewal approach, and of course, having parameters around it matching COVID-19, we then reported our values throughout the pandemic. And now I want to highlight how the R-value in two examples actually impacted public health policy making. That's based on how our R-values were used. But here, I really want to emphasize that I'm just showing now examples what we did, but around the globe. But around the globe, similar approaches by many different people were developed and used in their own countries for helping in the response. So in Switzerland, our federal office of public health got very interested in knowing the R value per day, which then actually led to that the government put this R value into a law at some stage, end of 2020. What they did was so the Federal Office of Public Health every day reported this R value catch. Every day reported this R value calculated based on what I just showed a slide ago. And then, in some periods, pretty much when we were in the height of the second wave and then this new variant alpha came, restaurant closures in Switzerland were actually ordered when the estimated R value was above one and then restaurants were allowed to open again when it was below one. I guess it's something for later over a coffee to discuss how much sense that makes to have it that fast. That makes to have it that fast going back and forth. But, anyways, to look at the positive side, it was a time when the politicians actually really wanted to have evidence for making their decisions. A year later, then, you may remember, there was the next variant of concern. It was Omicron. We had both countries were in a Delta wave, and all of a sudden, Countries were in a delta wave, and all of a sudden, South Africa, there was a briefing by the health ministry, they reported about Omicron. And as one puzzle piece to convince pretty much the world that Omicron is a real problem, is they calculated, so they were at Lavarlos case numbers. And then we always, in collaboration with them, updated also the R value for South Africa and their different provinces. It just jumped up this R value from well below one to Well, below one to roughly 1.5, and that was exactly when, in the sequencing data, they all of a sudden saw a dominance of Omicron. So, it was one puzzle piece here showing or quantifying how much faster Omicron can be transmitted compared to the until then dominant delta variant. So, those were now examples, two examples, and there would be many more by people. And there would be many more by people around the world, where the R-value was actually used by policy makers to have evidence for decisions they want to make about the public health policy, be it tightening measures or having other interventions. Another concept which was used quite frequently was logistic growth. Growth. So, just to get us all on the same page, we suppose a population X grows in size exponentially. So, after time t, when we start with a size x naught at time zero, we have e to the beta being the birth rate minus mu being the death rate times t individuals. So, classic exponential growth. And then, suppose some other population y grows in size. Y grows in size according again exponential growth, but now the difference that the birth rate is a bit bigger than in population X. So it's beta times one plus this growth advantage F. And then we can ask what is the proportion of y in this total population x plus y. And so if y is first very small, well it'll grow in size because In size, and because it has a growth, a transmission, a birth advantage. And in fact, one can easily take the ratio and get this equation, which is the logistic growth equation. And here, just to remind everyone, that's how logistic growth looks. This population Y first being very small and in frequency, so close to 0%, and then it outgrows population X because it has. Growth population X because it has a birth rate advantage. Again, now, what does that have to do with COVID-19? Well, let's look at the growth of alpha, this first variant of concern. And again, going back three years by now, up to December 2020, there was predominantly the source COVID-2 wild type. So there was what pretty much Was what pretty much started in Wuhan. And of course, this virus accumulated mutations, but it was not yet different in a sense that it became more transmissible or evaded immune response. And in December 2020, the variant alpha was reported by the UK, who sequenced a lot at the time, and to be spreading with a transmission advantage. And so, this transmission advantage would be exactly the birth advantage we had in our logistic growth function, this Fc. So, the proportion growth of this variant alpha is expected to grow logistically. And the speed would be determined by this Fc, which was not totally clear at the time how high this number would be, but it was clear it is bigger than zero. So, then a few, I mean, and that's the logistic. I mean, and that's the logistic growth. I mean, that's a very basic concept, but it became highly important. So in Switzerland, a couple days before Christmas, we got the phone call by our health minister in Switzerland. And he asked, well, when will alpha be dominant and cause a new variant wave? And he wants to know when do they have to do something? Because we were, as I mentioned before, in the middle of the second wave and already. Middle of the second wave, and already then the hospitals were overwhelmed and couldn't cope with yet more cases due to a variant. Well, this was a few days before Christmas, and of course, we can only know how alpha is growing if we know what's the frequency of alpha now, tomorrow, the day after. So we can fit a logistic growth curve to those frequencies. At least at ETH, normally between Christmas and New Year, all the labs have to be closed even for security. Have to be closed even for security reasons. And so I called the ETH president, say we need to keep those genomic labs open. The government wants so. And so all went very smooth. It was one of those positive experiences that people just were very keen to support and understand this situation. And also the genomic, then the other call was to the genomic lab if they could sequence. And those people actually were very happy to, we were anyways in lockdown to have something to do. Down to have something to do. They couldn't travel anywhere to their families. So it was a very busy Christmas break in those genomic labs. And so a few hundred SARS-CoV-2 samples were sequenced in the week over Christmas. The first alpha sample in Switzerland was then detected on Christmas Day. That was actually a lab in Geneva. And then we determined, based on all the sequencing being done in our lab and other labs, what's the What's the proportion of alpha among the sequences until the end of 2020, such that we know how fast is alpha spreading here? And so you see the case numbers here in the top in Switzerland, and that's end of December 2020. So we're in a stabilizing phase after this big second wave. And the proportion of alpha, just this is just two weeks, we see going up from around half a Around half a percent of to three percent, roughly, and from that we fitted a logistic growth curve, so just the equation I showed you before, and predicted or projected that by March, alpha will be dominant. And if transmission happens at the time then, cause another wave. So, in March, we will have another wave. And actually, that's how it. Actually, that's how it turned out retrospectively. So, indeed, it was dominant by March. What the government did, anticipating there will be a wave in March, that actually during dropping case numbers, namely early January, they tightened the measures. I think it was one of those moments where it was very hard to explain to the population what is being done. People thought they are out of the danger zone. Case numbers are. Zone, case numbers are dropping while we saw this new variant underneath growing. And so the government did something. And so, yeah, again, there were more restrictions going through February to dampen the March wave. Okay, so with that, this I want to come to the end of my talk. Where are we now? Where could we be heading into the future? Could we be heading into the future? And actually, now surveillance got downgraded a lot. Also, in Switzerland, we barely sequence any clinical pathogen SARS-CoV-2 cases. However, nevertheless, in somewhere in Switzerland, there were quite a bit of headlines, and even Switzerland made it to the Washington Post with this new variant, BA286. And I want to just cover or give that as an example where we could be heading. So, BA286, as you may remember, was detected. You may remember, was detected first in August, and the first five countries were the US, UK, Denmark, Israel, and South Africa. Where in some patients this variant was found. And those countries still, in relative terms, much less than at the peak of the pandemic, but they still sequence some fraction of their population. So, why did Switzerland actually get into the Washington Post headlines? Well, actually, in Switzerland, a surveillance system was built up where wastewater Where wastewater was analyzed. And Switzerland was the first country to detect this new variant BA286 in wastewater. And actually, what is being done at those wastewater treatment plants, there are samples, every hour samples are taken and once a day, you know, everything has been mixed together. This is shown here is Zurich. So all of us living in Zurich, we contribute to this pond here. Then the wastewater samples are shipped to To the lab. And actually, not only from Zurich, but from 15 different places, the samples are prepared. And by now, not only SARS-CoV-2 is considered, but also influenza and RSV with the vision to expand further to other pathogens. And then with a digital droplet PCR, the concentrations are measured, which is essentially a proxy for how many cases do we have at any point in time. And with sequencing, we can determine which variants are round. Can determine which variants are round. And so you get then those plots: how much, how fast are variant outgrowing other variants. And pretty much with the models I showed earlier, so the reproductive number, the logistic growth, you can analyze this data. And then in August, already indicated there will not be a major BA286 variant wave, but sure enough, cases probably will increase due to weighting immunity. Will increase due to waving immunity and seasonality. What also turned out to be the fall wave. Here, pretty much all I covered. We are now using for wastewater except for the phylogenetic trees. This is much more work ongoing because it's not so clear how to reconstruct the trees in wastewater. You only have short reads from different variants, but not a consensus sequence of one virus. So it's not as straightforward to build trees and do phylodynamics. Trees and do phylodynamics, but I think that's a very exciting research area for the future. Being at the future, what are our challenges and opportunities? Starting with the opportunities, I think throughout the pandemic, different countries showed that they can set up surveillance networks gathering relevant data on a and by now also with all the new assays on a variety of pathogens in real time. I also think environmental sampling, such as wastewater, can serve. Sampling such as wastewater can serve as a great data source going forward, and that really got a push throughout the pandemic. And many models, also like the concept of the reproductive number, were developed further in the pandemic to enable very fast real-time estimation and robust estimations on huge data sets. And robust is also important if anything is used for policy making. So, I think, in a way, the pandemic accelerates. In a way, the pandemic accelerated that we're in really good shape that we could do good surveillance and apply the models to the surveillance data to have insights both for the point of surveillance but also for understanding ecological dynamics in more detail. Challenges, of course, will be will countries actually invest in this monitoring of pathogens? How will the data be shared rapidly and the people involved in the sequencing know probably about all those All those recent GISAID articles. And then, last but not least, of course, can and will modelers be again so committed as they were in this past pandemic if a future crisis occurs, given all the backlashes many different researchers experienced. With that, I want to thank all the group who did do all this great work, all our funding, and thank you for the attention. I'm very excited to exchange now for the innovation. Very excited to exchange now for the inner questions section. Thank you.
