Thank you very much for um inviting me to this uh uh this nice conference. So um today I'm going to talk about three analysis of invariant homology. So this is somehow I think the three analysis is I think many people familiar with. But equivariant one of homology also many people work on it. But maybe it's a bit unusual to use to be analysis. Unusual to use the analysis to analyze quantum cohomology. But as it turns out, actually, this is quite useful method. And also, actually, people have encountered this query analysis secretly in many situations, but just people didn't hold this as a query analysis. Anyway, let me talk about let me start with some classical things. Some classical things on classical theorem by Twistermat and Frickman. So let me consider some syntactic compact syntactic manifold. Syntactic manifold. This is a real This is a real simple active manipulation as opposed to complexness, like holomorphic symbol. Real simple activity and let me consider some torasia torus or empath torus. So this one is the L. And Hamiltonian torus actually. Hamiltonian towards actually. And then, because this is, I assume it's Hamiltonian, you have a moment map from x to the real of the realge of t, moment map. And the theorem, famous theorem of this format heckman, say that Say that that said that so if you consider so on next there is a natural measure defined by syntactic 4 omega. So this is called maybe U bill measure omega to the n over n factorial. This is a some standard measure. And if you push forward this measure by mu the momenta Then this will be a piecewise linear sorry, post-piecewise polynomial piecewise polynomial measure. So it's a polynomial measure. And for example, maybe just give, let me give one example. So example, when So uh example, when x is p1 and uh we consider the standard Hamiltonian polarization uh rotating rotating P1, then uh the moment map is just uh given by the height function map, just given by the z coordinate, z coordinate. That coordinate. With image, just 0, 1 interval. And in this case, what is the push forward of this LUBU measure? So in this case, very famous, the push-forward of the LUBU measure is just supported on 0, 1 meter and just given by meaningful maintenance. Uniform measure. So uniform measure on this is the actual new star. Uniform measure. Information on zero and interval. This means that, for example, if I measure a region of this shape, then this only depends on the length. You then this only depends on the lengths lengths of this uh of this input. Even this uh the same length but different position has the same area. But I think this is something famous. And and uh yeah, and actually this is peacewise polynomial, this is peacewise constant. And yeah, so let me Yeah, uh so l let me explain this in terms of uh uh equivarian cosmology. So this here is this is also some famous explanation in terms of localization theorem. So there is something called uh sometimes called heckermas all which is a variant of lift equivariant lift of a simple active form omega, which is given by the following. So I write omega hat omega minus lambda d so uh this means that uh maybe I because mu is a uh vector value function, may I maybe in general this is uh uh some linear combination of uh components of mu. Of components of mu with some coefficients lambda, lambda i. Where lambdas are equivariant, t equivariant plan variant prime. This is some formal function. And mu is a moment map as before. And then this combination turns out to be equivariantly closed. So this is an equivariant closed. Equivariantly close to four. So, in the Kaufman model of equivariant function. And so this, maybe you can think of this as an equivariant lift of the original symbolic D4. And then I want to compute the following quantity of x exponential of omega hi. Exponential of omega hat. Then this will be something called the invariant poly of X. And you can compute this. How should I compute this? So just some by definition, this is you can lamb the dot mu. This is just a function times some prime. Times in front. And the exponential omega part, I only pick up the top degree component. So this will be just by definition this. You just integrate in the usual way. And then you can also use Vini's theorem here. So you first fix a value of mu and then integrate on the level set of mu. And then integrate on the level set of mu, and then integrate over the value of mu. So t, the value of mu the integral over more varying star. And sorry, t is a coordinate of t star. And what I get is I I what I get Is what I get will be an integral of the level set of t, but actually this reduces to the integral or symplectic reduction. So you can write this integral using the Hubini theorem and you can write it this way. Because yeah, and we just first fix the value of mu and Fix the value of mu and t and then integrate along the level set of t. And this actually reduces. This integral will turn out will be a volume of a symplectic reduction, where this omega red is the reduced symplectic volume. Volume of the symplectic recap. So they are actually related by, so Fourier related by Fourier transform. So you can compute the volume of this one and this is maybe a nice. And this is, maybe I can't just talk to you, sorry. This one is by definition, so now by definition, this amount of H1 measure, this one is this part. This part is just for similar. Just by the way, computation, just we need URL. We can compute like this. This. And so this is Mantechmann theorem that says that this is a polynomial in T, piecewise polynomial in T. And actually, you can show this by using the inverse Red transform. So this part, if you're very involved, you can compute this by localization theorem. Localization theorem of Atlabod. Very well. And uh and then you you do the inverse free transform to see that this is actually this physical. This is one of the one way to explain this problem. Okay, so uh so this is a completely classical uh geometric thing and uh I want to consider the quantum version. How? What is the quantum version? What is the quantum version? So maybe what is the quantum version of analog of a body and the And yeah, so maybe my answer is the following. So you can consider something like a path integral. Path integral on the free loop space. Maybe or maybe more precisely it will be a path integral of the universal cover and a positive. Cover and a positive part of the positive cover. So, which is, you can think of this as a boundary values of a holomorphic disks x. So, if you're given holomorphic disks, then you can construct boundary values at this loop. And with the set of holomorphic disks in X, maybe you can think of this as some universal covering of the whole. Universal covering of the positive part of the previous case. And so this is Gibbon Tau, and this path integral was considered by Gibbon Tau. And let me this is only heuristic argument, but let me consider omega, which is a symbolic form on LX TL, which corresponds induced by corresponds induced by induced by small omega you can naturally define something like informal blue space and there is the actual function of blue space this is some standard atmos functional in Hamiltonian completions. In Hamiltonian of Newton's. Then you consider the following thing. So Lx delta plus alpha dimension of omega minus Z A over Z. Ah, then then I also introduce another parameter, Z. Z is a S one two equivalent parameter. Equivariant prime. So in this quantum story, you have an additional S1 action, which does not exist in the classical case. We have a loop rotation. Always, because we are only constraining loop space, there is a loop rotation as well now. So so even this is non-equivariant with respect to x, but you still have some equivariant. You still have some equilibrium. And this omega minus ZA will be some this amount with respect to this group action, group escalation action. And you can somehow consider this kind of quantity. And then I'll explain that this will be this can be also somewhat heuristically computed in terms of localization here. So localization here, and you get the following. So he showed that this will be actually a J function. Maybe I'll explain what it is, but some solution of the quantum differential equation. And maybe later, you know, one of these adults and myself. Myself, we explain actually, j function is not quite enough, and we need to correct it a little bit by some gamma dots. So anyway, this is heuristic, so this is not mathematics. And there's a characteristic class called the gamma class and uh And so, this is a finite dimension of ordinary integral, and j is some maybe something I'm going to explain. So J, just I give you a definition just for the sake of completeness. But maybe the formula itself is not so important. We are T1 plus 3. So zero one D to the R. So this is called something called J function, which is defined in terms of gravitational chromatic invariance, some chromatic invariance. And actually, the important thing about this function is. important thing about this function is this is a solution of the quantum differential equation. So this is a solution of the quantum differential equation. So we already saw it in that small stocking. Now I'm working non-equivariantly but maybe later this will be on the But maybe later this will be also equivalent. But this one and this is a class in in. In cohomology. So cohomology values function. Sorry, maybe I can think it's wrong. This is a HX valued function. Functional omega. And then somehow this formula now, I guess, makes us maybe. Makes us maybe I didn't explain what it's a camera class, but maybe I'm not going to explain. But this is some class which somehow similar thing. PRICAMALOP already appeared. And so yeah, maybe you can see that this leading term leading term is exactly the integral we were considering. So this maybe you can think of this as a Of this as a quantum deformation of the symplectic volume, as we talked before. And then the conjecture, we can now conjecture maybe. I'm not quite sure how this conjecture is correct. But there are some examples. Maybe I let let me call this quantity pi of x. Pi x. So, and this is a some analog of a period, so uh I call it quantum period because if you have mirror symmetry then it will be uh periods so let me call um period or maybe quantum volume ball conjecture and you can also consider that. And you can also consider the T equivariant vertig. This is only now S1 loop equivariant, but you can now consider T action on X, and then everything will become T cross S1 equilibrium. And you can also consider equivalent quantum both. And conjecture equivariant origin of X is a 3 transform form of I X mod mod of T. So this is a maybe naive conjecture you can and maybe this is not quite precise because in general this part you need some deformation, more bulk deformation, bulk deformation. Maybe you may need bulk deformation. Maybe you may need multiple deformation of both sides. Bulk deformation means that I this is this only depends on H2 of the cohomology. Only it depends on omega, but also you may generalize this to insert many cohomology classes here. So And then maybe I'll show you one instance where this is actually correct. And maybe you can think of this as a quantum version of this electronic nature. And maybe I also maybe want to mention that it'll be very important. This is a function of lambda of lambda. And this part is a function of t. And this part is a function of t. And actually, because of the bulk deformation, maybe there may be some non-trivial neural map if you can. But if you want to say that this is Fourier transformed, the Fourier variables are lambda. Yeah, so one theorem which I proved a long time ago. Say the following. So when x is a funnel boring manifold, Maybe all the videos works, but maybe I guess. Then the equivariant version of this quantum period will be written as a Fourier transform of something. So minus w of x and exponential lambda of x. of x over t of dx over x. So this is one form of mirror symmetry. So where w is lambda into mirror and wax. Which is some all I'm polynomials. Some lowland polynomial. And you can, this is an integral over some i omega. So I have a torus action of the same dimension of x. n-dimensional torus acting on x. And for instance, um so this is uh some uh mirror symmetry. You can think of this. Mirror symmetry. You can think of this as mirror symmetry. And for example, maybe one explicit example where x is P1. If it's a P1 case, this W would be the following function. Wx would be, I think it's also here in Colorado Andrew. This is the famous potential function. And function. And where q, maybe I didn't explain q was the exponential of the volume of parameter of electron. And then in this case, if I write a graph of this function of exponential minus w x of d curve. And it's going to be the following. And it's going to be the following function actually. So I take, I identify T with the log of Q and then this W, this function, exponential minus Wx. The t will be exponential minus Q to the T plus Q to the T. q to z t plus q to z minus 1 on t over z. That will be this function if I change t for x. And then this function, if I suppose that q is very small, q is very small parameter. Suppose that q is very, very small but positive. Then uh this function will be in the following shape. Be in the following shape. 0, 1 is here. 0 and almost supported on 0 and interval. Because somehow for t between 0 and 1, this somehow the exponent is close to 0. And this is close to exponential is close to 1. But otherwise, this will be very, very small. Be very, very small. So you can see that this is actually a kind of continuous version of the system of technical here. And so this continues to hold for every Toric funnel. And also you can see that this is actually a J function of a point. And in this case, because I'm I'm quantum time. See, this will be a point. And this will be actually a quantum period for a point. With W being some mirror label. This is a phi of a point. So any questions? So, yeah, so this example you have of jump at critical value of mu. At critical value of mu jump. But I think this only happens when the quotient is zero-dimensional. But I think in this quotient has positive dimensional k. has positive dimension k then it is I guess. The walls of the bar chamber is the wall is the critical value of mu. So in general it may be a piece of polynomial function like this. And then uh these these are critical values of V critical values of And in in a quantum version everything will be smooth. So at least for toric itself maybe you could see that for this analytic, real analytic function. So yeah, so this maybe proves why free analysis may be relevant or gives you evidence. And in analyzing the model and maybe I'm making you the idea of Kelma. So because that is very important parameter lambda. Parameter lambda is redual redundant time. And then Helmo says that we can identify racial distability. We can identify actually this stability parameter in terms of the equivariant quantum homology. And he says that exponential T, this stability parameter exponentially, should be identified with the sidel operator, which I'm going to explain now. Seidel or shift operator. Shift operator his message as far as I understand. And so let me recall what is the side of operator, side of representation. So if you have a torus action, T action on X, and then you have this induces a cocktail. A co-character Maddie's action on the loop space, pre-loop space. Because I have, if I have a loop, I have a loop, then I can if I have any any character k, then I can act. Then I can act this cocherator pointwise to the loop. So exponential I feature is a point on the loop character. And so this will be a lattice action on loop space. And this lattice action will, because somehow I didn't say, this quantum cohomology or quantum, it'd be a very important point. It'd be very important for homology. It can be viewed as a homology of semi-infinite homology of blue space. This induces an action of this called character lattice on quantum cohomology or equivariant quantum cohomology. Quantum cosmology, or maybe even further, if you vary in quantum D module. Maybe I and here this is a lattice, it's just Z dimension L dimensional lattice. When I mean this is S1 to Z L, then this will be just a lattice, CZ L. And this. And this is an interesting rupture. And you can identify this with H2 second equilibrium homology, equilibrium homology with Z coefficient. And for any element S, we have some operator acting on equilibrium. And the reason why Tilman Why Tilman just did this is that you have some commutation relation between S operator and lambda, equivariant times. If you consider T module quantum, equivariant quantum cohomology is the commutative limit of the T module, so there is no mutation. But if you work on quantum D module, then you have a commutation relation. Computational relation. Some canonical computational relation between quantum mechanics. So you have a, excuse me, how does the H T point depend on L? I mean, I think it's possible. L on So uh L on the line above is uh a positive integer. Yes and H2 point Z uh doesn't contain E here. R T equivariant second homework. And this is just by general and I have some computational relation as saying that uh lambda you got Uh lambda, I have several lambda side, right? Lambda I and SJ, I have several S operators here and they have satisfied the following computation relation. So this is a commutation relation as an operator acting on quantum d1. This is that. Maybe I'm not going to explain what is quantum dignitar, but it is something like quantum homology, but equipped with that connection, the flat connection. Yeah, quantum connection we already saw it in Andre spoke. So this is somehow a basic idea. So to use Basic idea. So to use this hybrid operator as a Fourier dual parameter for lambda. Because of this computation relation, you can identify S with the stability parameters. And actually, you can slightly refine this and you can consider the poem. I have the following exact sequence, h2 of x. I have h2t of x and h to be t of a point at this standard exact sequence. And I have, this is, as I said, this is for care. This is a as I said, this is for Kerala apparatus and which gives a shift operator, side operator. SIDO operator here. And this one corresponds to the so-called NOPIPO run, the slow R, which I noted by Q variable. And And the practical picture, more practical picture, is that we should combine Q and S together. So actually what we have is that this equivalent content homology is a module module over the grouping of equilibrium second homology. Equivariant second homology of X, where somehow part of equivariant second homology comes from Novkov variables, individual Novkov action, Q-variable action, and the part of it comes from a side of operator. And maybe more precisely, I need to consider the positive part, positive part, because I'm only I will usually quantum cosmology, you can consider, either consider over nautical field or not. Consider over node of field of non-clock ring, but now I want to consider node of ring, and then some only consider positive column of the curves. This is an equivariant kind of equivariant Molly column. And this equivariant Morical, maybe I don't explain what this is, but this is dual. What this is, but this is dual. And I give a dual description. This is dual to the so-called T-AMPO column. Let me move to the general symplectic control, general symplectic manifold to smooth project in variety now, because I do language algebraic geometry. So let me consider the output column, CTX, which is a column inside. These are common inside. Secondly favorite coconuts. And the thing, Apple Corn is some less common, well studied con studied by Dolbert F. Hu and Tadius and some some studied in connection with the GIT. Connection with the GIT. Okay. So GMP column is a definition. It is a column span by equiparis function class of a T amplifier line of the whole point. L over X such that stable, semi-stable or stable locus with respect to L is normal. So this is used, this can be, this is a set of numerical class of a T ampuline bundle whose stable locus is non-empty. So this can be used as a parameter space of the GIT question. And this, you can this has a wall and chamber structure. So this will be a union of columns. Maybe I'm only considering a maximal cell, but depending on which GID quotient you write. So this is divided into chambers or CI and each corresponds to Corresponds to some different possibility of GIT portion or a simplified portion. And then now we are, we said that this quantum equivalent quantum cohomology is a module over the equivalent molecule, which is dual to the T-ampu cone. And this T-ampo con is now divided into chambers. Chambers and so maybe you can somehow pull back these two resolution, the kind of resolution of this tolerant variety. So you can consider you can think this equilibrium function homology is a module over the secondary part. Over the secondary part of right. Secondary part of right meaning or spec of C C I j The standard construction of autoric geometry. So if you have a column and you the column will be divided into several rational points of columns. It into several rational quadratic or terms, and then you can construct a toric variety which will be a resolution of a spectrum. So you can and then maybe at least at least and this naive conjecture is that this should restrict to To point from cohomology of the I-TIT portion over the chart over each chart spec and maybe you can this is roughly speaking identified with the Roughly speaking, identified with the ample call, CI itself is identified with AMPU call notes x number I of T. So this is a maybe natural conjunction. And this also involves certain Fourier geology because I yeah, somehow equivariant parameter will be replaced with the x dot equip parameter. So that involves certain Fourier transforms. So, um so uh maybe I can actually get close to something neat. Close to something we see in the case of a toric mirror symmetry. Example: when X is a toric variety or maybe just a vector space, for example, X is a vector space, then you have many different GIT portions as toric varieties. And those quantum cohomology are just related over the secondary toric. That's the reason I say secondary, but if you don't assume X is a second tort, then If you don't assume X is toric, then it's not secondary. But anyway, the picture will be: I have some toric variety, secondary toric variety, and there are several classes. And equivariant onto the hology lives on everywhere. And if you restrict the earth near each path. But we are asked this somehow on the homology effects of model. It's a picture in general. And maybe I can also give you a more precise conjecture in terms of discrete Fourier transformation. But maybe I I don't I'm let me uh Let me consider, give one application of this idea. All these things are just conjectures and not yet proven, except for the theorem I so you can actually study quantum cohomology of blow-ups using this. So let X be a speed project, right? Right and Z be assumed subright and that X killed will be the blow-up of X along C. And so then there is a birectional morphism X. But this birational transformation can be realized as a variation of GIT quotients. So let us set W to be set load of C plus C one or X cross P1. Let me consider this space. So just a blow-up of x cross P1 along Z cross C1. And this has this is equ equipped with a sister action P1 on the bottom. But there is a natural sister action acts trivially on X and only acts on P1, and that action induces an action on the blow up. And then both x and x tilde will arrive as a GIP quotient code, stopped by this track. Do would be so I have X and there is also field and there is an exceptional divisor some projecting bundle over Z I have Z inside X and I have Z cross P1 and this one is an exceptional divisor for the scale. So two control of normal control of C delta X plus one and which intersects along X till Intersects along and still look at the perspective on the board. So this is a picture of DALP. And this disk is an external divisor for DALP. And you can see the moment about picture. So actually, sister action has three things. Sister action has three fixed components. Then the sister fixed component will be the union of X and Z. Z is here. And X tilde. X tilde is nice, sorry. And then the moment map for the S1 action associated with C structure has three critical points. And if I pick a regular value here, then the quotient by the S1, the quotient will be X. And if I pick a W parameter here, then the quotient will be X. And so in this case, I have two chambers for the GLT portion. Chambers for the GIT portion. So maybe the GIT chamber will be something like a column over this feature. So actually, the picture is much more higher dimensional. So this is only magic picture. I have column for X and column for X tilde. And this is the T umbu call for DAL. TMBOM for DAL. And uh yeah. And and in this case somehow you can show the conjecture or the conjecture picture in this case. And well, I need that same QR name. So uh So using this analysis of the equivalent quantum cohomology, you can show that this quantum cohomology x tilde at the parameter tau tilde. I didn't explain the bulk deformation part, but I explained what quantum cohomology is. Quantum cohomology is some deformation of a cup product. This shows that you have a direct direct sum decomposition of algebra where how and how i, how the function of tau i, sigma i, so the function of tau i. There think about in the homage of x and college. Colonial X and Columbus of Z respectively. They are bulk deformation parameters. So valve deformation depending on L tilde. And L tilde is a deformation current, therefore X tilde. And this this there is some multiplicative decomposition and this also can be lifted can be also lifted to a quantum demonstration yeah I should say maybe I should say this is a formal so I'm not I'm not considering So I'm not considering any convergence. But maybe I write quantum D module in this notation Q dm of X t. You can, this, the composition, uh maybe if you know something about Robini's manifold or F manifold, and then this is as the composition as a F manifold, quantum homology F manifold. Quantum cohomology F manifold. So F manifold is weakening of a Four Benz manifold. So having products on each tangent spaces, but maybe non-metric or flat coordinates, no flat coordinates. So yeah, so this gives you a decomposition of the F name. But this follows from the fact that this can be also linked to quantum D module. So this is a formal decomposition of quantum function. Formal decomposition of quantum connection. I I'm sorry, I don't have I didn't explain what it's like. But let me so any questions? Ah, yes, thank you, thank you. I I R is imagine how Yeah, so for example, this decomposition, for example, you know, classical. You know, classical homology also has this decomposition. But in the classical case, this is not multiplicative decomposition. That quantum B can be multiplicative. So here it is. The probability of manifold is structured with the matrix. Yeah, yeah. So on the level of content V module, this preserves metric. But maybe not on the level of F matrix. Maybe you're not on the level of ethnic system. So finally, I explained a little bit about the idea. So the idea is already somehow explained. We only consider equivariant quantum cohomology of that v. And this decomposition is constructed using equivariant chromatic invariance without. So this isomorphism is not quite constructive in my proof. So this is constructed using equivariant chromatic invariance, which is somehow maybe as equally hard as computing chromatic invariance of X2. Anyway, a deal. So, this is something like a spectral decomposition. Exactly, it's a spectral decomposition, but a spectral analysis with respect to the equivariant parameter of itself. So, you consider equivariant quantum emotion, which is some connection map connection. And you can construct a map to quantum V module of X. quantum D module of X and quantum D module of XQ and the quantum D module of Z. Actually, R minus for many for Z I construct R minus for many homomorphism, D module homomorphisms. They are solutions. So construct reconstruct solutions. Solutions via Fourier transformations. So, constructing a Fourier transformation is some exactly Fourier analysis. So, these two arises as GIT quotients. And the final one is just a fixed point, not GIT quotient. But these first two arises as a GIT quotient, and so GAT forching and so you can use shift operators and then you can do the discrete with transformation using shift operators. And also you can also do continuous with transformation as well. But you can first show these are there is such maps using free. And then this picture we think is the following global, kind of global Keller model. And global Keller modified space, which is the secondary for rightly dimension. So I have two cusps, x tilde and x. And this solution, for example, this solution is a solution near this chart. And this solution is a solution near this chart. This chart. But actually, maybe because of the grading, actually, these two charts overlap. And you can compare the two things. And finally, I also have a piece coming from Z and this part is given by some, this R minus one many solution would be given by milling barns d to this also you can think of this as You can think of this as a Fourier transform as well, and the Lining-Bann's integral appears, and this you can interpret as taking values in the given tau column of C because of by Colt's given Halloween theorem. So, maybe this is a bit technical. Using Millium-Barndon and Coltz-Given-Hall theorem, you can say produce R minus 1 of these solutions. And finally, I back here. So what you can show is that you can consider the completion of the equivalent quantum D module W near X tier, near this chart. The quantum D constructed completion. And this will be uh isomorphic to contemporary motion of X here. I haven't proved, but maybe it is likely that if I complete the completion at this chart, then you should probably get this continuum of x. Here you should get it. And then what we show is how this morphism, these solutions continues to the complexity. Then you get this morphism. Then you you get this uh are there I understand that your last result has factorifications to irrationality of four forward but can you say anything about that? Yeah, yeah. I this is not my work, so but uh Kontevich and But Kontevich and his collaborators somehow have some applications in irrationality problem. And as far as I understand, they also consider some Hodge structure, usual Hodge structural hormones. And how somehow the isomorphism I'm constructing, the composition I'm constructing is a an algebraic, some discreted hodge structure. For example, if I Hodge structure. For example, if I uh restrict tau tilde to lie in the algebraic class, then this should preserve the Hodge structure. And uh somehow quantum cohomology is maybe you can think of it as a topological structure underlying the Hodge structure. And somehow you can decompose Hodge structure into smaller pieces. And that somehow allows you to, for example, show the rationality. The rationality, for instance. But yeah, no more detail I can say. Just a detail. So on the left board, T is just one copy of S1, right? Yes, yes. Ah, this is T? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh, so there you have R minus one copies. Here, R minus two, is this R minus? R minus 2. Is this R minus 1? I call 0 to R minus 2. Not R minus 1. This is R minus 1. So 0 is R minus 1. Which point are you changing first from one chart to another? And X Super and X U are these two different charts? What is the coordinates? I think some of these coordinates are corresponds to class of line on exceptional basically. So one coffee parameter corresponds to class. Roughly speaking, up to mirror transformations. Thank you. Oh, but thank you for your market.
