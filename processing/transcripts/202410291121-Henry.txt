And hopefully, I'll keep the impressive timekeeping of Anna and Guido going. So, I'm just going to give a brief overview of a recent paper between written with myself, Ross and Ivanov, who many of you know, and Cece Sakularis. And what we're interested in is deriving higher-order integrable models for internal wave-current interactions. So, it's recently appeared, it's online if anyone's interested. In the time frame, I'll just give a brief overview of what we look at and yeah. Look at, and yeah, okay. So, I guess there's been some mention of Hamiltonian forms and Dirichland-Neumann operators so far, maybe not so much in internal waves. I think they're coming for you guys there. So, what we're interested in is two fluid layer models. And as many people know, this is a common model for wave current interactions and wave interactions in the ocean. So, basically, you've two different fluid layers of different densities where you've got variation in temperature or salinity or whatever. And temperature or salinity or whatever other reason. So, what we're looking at in particular is we add a current, a sheared, a constant vorticity. So, it's a sheared current in a two-layer model. And we're going to make a flat surface or a rigid lid assumption. We also incorporate Earth's rotation by having Coriolis forces, but if we're doing so, we restrict to the equatorial region, which is of interest for mathematical and physical reasons in itself. Okay, so. In itself. Okay, so basically, it's an inviscid model. And what we have is the Euler equation, the standard Euler equation. This term here is the Coriolis force, essentially, and P is the pressure, G is gravity. And in the equatorial region, you sort of have a trapping effect. So we can approximate by looking at a two-dimensional model. So we have a flat lid or a flat surface rigid lid approximation. And essentially, what we're looking at is this interface. Essentially, what we're looking at is this interface here, which is denoted by z equal to eta. So we have all sorts of accompanying boundary conditions that I'm not going to put in. But basically, the essence of what we look at is we incorporate a constant vorticity by decomposing the velocity fields. So just to emphasize the one subscript is the upper layer, without subscripts, the lower layer. So we have phi is your typical potential, gamma is Potential. Gamma is your vorticity in the lower layer. Gamma 1 is the vorticity in the upper layer. We can also have constant current terms here, this kappa 1 and kappa, but we usually take these to be equal. So using this formulation, we can focus on the trace of the velocity potentials on the interface. This is the common approach. Phi is the potential on the interface. C here denotes, I guess we could use I for the interface, but it's the common. We could use IE for the interface, but it's a common interface. And then one recast things using the Dirichlet Neumann operators. So much work was done on Dirichlet Neumann operators by people there present and elsewhere. So, I mean, Mark and various people looked at it for the surface wave case and Walter Craig, I guess, and then Rosson and Constantine adding currents. And Walter Craig and collaborators, Philip Grain and Kaleesh and so on, looked at the internal wave model. So on, looked at the internal wave models. So, much is known about Dirichland-Neumann operators. This P happens to make sense if we define this operator here. Basically, then what we can show is you recast things as this kind of fairly horrible looking set of equations. But this involves eta and G and B, which is the Dirichlet-Neumann operator, and this involves psi and eta. Psi and eta. I guess I have it written here: psi is a combination of the different velocity potentials. So it's a closed system of evolution equations involving only these Dirichlet-Neumann operators. What one could do from that point is to expand using small amplitude expansion, epsilons and deltas, but it turns out to be very expedient to use the nearly Hamiltonian form of these equations. And then, if you do this, you do expansions for Dirich-Len-Neumann operators, we get an For Dirichlet-Neumann operators, we get an equation of this form here. And this is a higher-order Kdv. If we ignore the epsilon squared, we get something of Kdv form. And then having epsilon squared, we get fifth derivative. So this is often known as the Kdv5, or it can be mapped to Kdv5. So this equation is, in general, not integrable. However, it does possess what's known as asymptotically equivalent integrable equations. So basically, if we So basically, if we introduce a near-identity transform, it's also known as the Kadama transform. So, in this case, we use this explicit form, you get an equation of KDV5 type here. Okay, so this is a well-known studied equation, and it happens to have three values of B here for which it's an integrable equation. So, for B equal to one, it's the Sawada-Kotero or Coudri-Dodd-Gibbon equation, B equal to 4, Cooper-Schmidt equation, and B equal to 3, it's the second. And b equal to three, it's the second equation in integrable KDV hierarchy. Okay, so these equations, we have known soliton solutions, there's infinite conservation laws, there's lax pairs, they're integrable, so we have inverse scattering. And what one can do is give them soliton solutions, you get some sort of approximate soliton solution of the equation we've derived here. Furthermore, a different near identity transformation here results in a mapping that can. In a mapping that can result in the well-known Camasa-Holman de Gasparos-Prochesi equations, which are also integrable and have a more storied background in the water wave context. And once again, soliton solutions exist. Multi-soliton solutions can be recovered using the Herata method. But we point out that using this formulation here, it's unlikely that the well-known pecon and cuspon solutions. Well-known pecon and cuspon solutions can be transformed into solutions of our original equation for eta. Okay, so basically, that's what we've been looking at and what we've done to this point. So, thanks very much. Thank you, Dekky. Other questions? I had a question. Can I also ask a question online? Absolutely. So, I like Kamasolm equations, for instance, is suitable to model wave breaking, right? So, could you use, is that a scenario that one could look at then? Wave breaking for internal waves using this equation, or is this outside of the regime where this transformation would hold, for instance? Yeah, exactly. So, the problem is with things like the PC on Coupspan. With things like the pecan coupon and the wave breaking, with the x-derivative having a problem, um, you know, you don't recover it from this formulation easily. Um, yeah, so I mean, I guess the point is integrable equations are well known. They're studied, we know lots about the solutions, the classical soliton solutions. And what we're looking for is trying to derive a higher order model which is approximately integrable. But it's only this Kodama transformation. It's only this Kodama transformer near identity transform, it's really only applicable when you have smooth soliton solutions. You can see from the formula we get problems when there's derivatives involved that blow up or which don't exist. Right. Okay, thank you. Thanks. More questions? Not let's indicate it again.
