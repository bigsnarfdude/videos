Unstable. So, if you can't hear me well, then please let me know. So, this I will talk about numerical solutions for singular SDE. And this is based on the two John's works with Dariotis and Mate Gerenza and another. And Mate Gerenza, and another one with Jen Chen Ling. The outline is like this. So I will talk about Ola Mariyamaskin, a variant of it, which is tamed. And then the techniques that are inspired from RAPFA theory and some recent progress in open problems. And open problems. So the SDE is just the usual one where you have the standard Brownie motion with diffusive coefficient sigma and then the drift B. So in this setting, I want sigma to be uniformly elliptic and regular with respect to the X variable. But the Trift B can be a measurable. Can be measurable bounded functions or even have some singularities, but it should be integrable. So the motivation is for the numerical method is because of the multi-level multi-colour method. For this method to work, you need to you need to control a strong conversion rate of of the of the challenge is because your drift is not lifted continuous and it's not and therefore that this is the main main challenge in this problem so let me quickly remind you about Quickly remind you about well-posedness for SDEs. So, with Lipschitz coefficients, then this is a standard classical theory. For bounded drift and elliptic diffusions, there have been known by Varatenikov and Zonkin in the one-dimensional case that your SDEs have a strong unique solution. These have a strong unique solution. And for integrable drifts with elliptic diffusions, there's a famous paper of Kriloff and Ragner in 2005, where they show that if the trust B is LQ, LQ in the time variable and LP in the X variable, with P and Q as some number. And Q are some numbers satisfying this condition, then the SD have a unique strong solution. There are some recent works by Kriloff and Rockner and Zhao, where they try to show that under critical condition, meaning that this inequality here, D over P plus 2 over Q. D over p plus 2 over q equals 1, then you also in some cases you also have strong solutions. So on the numerical side, things are less understood in the sense that the strong conversion rate is only obtained in recent years. So for legitimate So, for Life coefficients, we have the simplest scheme, which is the Ola Maru-Yama scheme with uniform time steps. So, for this scheme, you have a strong convergence rate of order one-half, and this rate is optimal, meaning that if I normalize the error x minus xn, then the normalized error converges in distributions. Versus in distributions to the solution of SDE. And this is a result of GERS drugs in 91. And for one shadow lipstick drift with growth, there are many works and there are many works here and I only name a few authors. For Holder Continuous Training. For Holder continuous drift with elliptic diffusion, there's a work, there was a work of Pamin and Taguchi in 2017. And here the rate that they have depends on the holder exponent. And if the holder exponent is very small, then the rate is essentially the holder exponents over half over two. Over half over two. And only recently that there is the paper of Dariotis and Gerenser, where they show that if your drift is continuous and bounded, then the rate is exactly one half. Exactly one half. So there they have a control for the L2 moment. And for about measurable drift, we have a recent paper with We have a recent paper with Dariotis and Goring, where we obtain the optimal rate with epsilon loss for all moments. And for interior drift, this is the story that I will tell you. So for the case of the bounded measurable drift result that we have. Result that we have. So, in this paper, we only look at the time-independent coefficients. B and sigma are time-independent, and B is bounded measurable, and sigma is C3 and bounded elliptic. So, then we have a strong conversion rate with an epsilon loss, meaning that for NEP, you have an estimation for For the difference between x and x, and on the right-hand side, you have some constants times here. Epsilon is as small as possible. In the case of integer bottles, so this is when we recall that this is when B is LQ in time and L P in space. Space. So the oil scheme does not make sense because of this term. So in this setting, the drift is allowed to have some singularities. For example, we can think of b as x rise to a small positive power epsilon. And this kit doesn't make sense because your simulation and And the simulated solution can be near to zero, which makes this evaluation very large or undefined. And this is what motivates the attempt of the scheme where you replace B by an approximation BA, which is logical in the sense that if your If the evaluation of B composed with X is large, then you may want to replace it by a truncation by a fixed number. And this is the setup and details. So the diffusion is C1 and bounded. With bounded derivative, but Derivative, but it has to be uniformly elliptic. And the drift is again LQ in time and Lp in space. And the approximating drift is any sequence Bn that is bounded in space and LQ in time. And it has to satisfy some uniform estimates that I don't described here. That attempt. Then the temp aula scheme is just the usual Ola Maruyama scheme, but instead of the B, I replace B by Bn. So some we cannot take BN to be the same as B for the reason I explained earlier, but you can take, for example, Bn to be a truncation. Here, the truncation is something Is some constant times n to the chi. Chi is some constant, and the chi has to be smaller than this number so that the uniform estimates for the DN are satisfied. Another choice is we take a smooth convolution with a heat kernel with a small variance, and the variance is one over n. the variance is one over n to the chi and again chi is between some range of intervals here so the historically the the ten dollar scheme is introduced by by these authors when they look at the SDEs with one-sided lift script but with growth so the the Growth. So the truth are more like x minus x cubic or polynomial growth. So here we in their paper the Bn is chosen explicitly as a function of B. But here the difference is we don't require any explicit formula for the BN. Explicit formula for the BN. And this is the result that we have with ten tingling. So here we have an estimation for the moments of xn minus x. And the moment is about p bar, where p bar is smaller than p and also smaller than 2 over d times p. times p so gamma is as close to one as you want and on the right hand side you have the difference of initial data and then the rate is one over n to the half times a low radi factor log n plus another error term which is pi n here so the pi n essentially measures the distance between b and the approach B and the approximating drift Bn. So we have two bounds for pi n. So the first bound is in terms of LP1 and LQ1 topology. So recall that P1 is the LP1 in X and LQ1 in space. And then the second bound is with respect to a With respect to a subo F, a negative subo F space. So this L this L minus nu P is subole F minus with regularity minus nu and interoperability index P in space and then LQ in time. So the number nu is between zero and this number. This number here. So, some examples. So, for the truncation case, we can estimate pi n. The P1 and Q1 here is of P1 is P over rho and Q1 is Q over rho, where rho is rho is some number. Road some number that satisfies this condition. So essentially, on the right-hand side, you want to choose rho as large as possible and chi also as large as possible. And the second example where we smooth out the drift B, then the LQ1 doesn't give you a good grade. However, the suboleft topology topology the negative suburb topology will produce some rate and this is the rate and again essentially you want to choose chi to be as large as possible and new to be as large as possible so in the in the first example and um so if chi is bigger than this range bigger than a half then i can simply choose rho to Then I can simply choose rho to b2 and I get an optimal rate one half. So it's just a bit about rapa theory that I believe the audience know very well. So it was introduced by Terry Lyons about the rough differential equation and has many And has many wonderful properties. But here we learn from Lyons' work. There are two things. First is about sewing arguments, and the second thing is about the users of the control functions. So just a reminder that the control is any function of s and t that satisfy this inequality, which is simple additive. So about assuming So the about a sewing so sewing lemma is about convergence of a Riemann sum. So if I have an abstract Riemann sum and I form a pi here, then under what condition of A I have the convergence of the Riemann sums and the sewing lemma give a sufficient condition that saying that if delta A is If delta A is of the size of a control raised to a power one plus epsilon, then the Riemann sums converge and it gives estimates for the limiting function. There are three different proofs. So the first proof is due to Young and Lyons. The second proof from Gubernales and then the third proof. And then the third proof using the adequate partition so all these proofs are different. So the sewing condition is not satisfied with the Ito integral because although the Italo integral converged, as Ito showed in 1944. Ito showed in 1944. So this motivated stochastic sewing, which technically cut the stochastic. So the setting here is instead of an arbitrary Riemann sum, we only look at Riemann sums in the moment M omega, where M is a little. Omega, where m is at least two. And you have the first condition is similar to the sewing lemma. However, on the right-hand side, we only ask an exponent of a half plus epsilon. And then the second condition is about the conditional expectation of delta A. And then on the right-hand side, we require to be of order T minus S to the. Of order T minus S to the one plus epsilon. Then, under these two conditions, you have a convergence of the Riemann sum, and you also have estimates for the limiting process. So, the proof is based on dyadic partitions and combined with Bacon-Davis-Gandhi inequality. Okay, so the method of proof for the strong conversion. The strong conversion rate. So we just take two equations. So and this is a Zonkin transformation to deal with the singularity of the drift. And then some groundworld type arguments. Then we see that this strong, this error is controlled by the quadrature error. By the quadrature error. The quadrature error is of this form, which is the here. So F have the same F is essentially Bn. So F has the same regularity as Bn. So namely Lp in X, LQ in time, and bounded in X, LQ in Tan. Where the G has one more weak regularity than Regularity than the F. So the G will be W1P in time and sorry, W1P in space and LQ in time and also bounded in both space and time. So then with an additional argument to deal with the statistical law of the all Maruyama scheme. Maruyama scheme, we see that the statistic of this Xn is behave very similarly to the Brownie motion. So for the purpose of this talk, we can think of instead of the quadrature error related to Xn, we can think of the quadrature error related to the Brownie motion. And to estimate this quadrature error, we use the error. Quadrature error, we use the stochastic sewing lemma. So here we defined A S T as the so first you take the small increments from S to T and then we take conditional expectation with respect to Fs. So this will be the when we sum up. So this A we So, this A we form a Riemann sums, and the Riemann sums will converge to the original integration. So, here we use the statistical property of primary motion. So, we see that AST is of order of this order. So, on the right-hand side, here you have a correct rate, one over n to the half, and a control raised to the power half, where the control is defined. The control is defined in this way. So, this is just some computation that so this control comes out from the computations. So, in this control, you see that there is a singularity in time here. There is a norm of F LQ over the time interval S and T. interval s and t and that is also a norm of g over the time interval s and t so uh so we uh so the fact that w is a control is important here um so the stochastic setting that i told you earlier is uh is with is a specific case where w is t minus s however it can be extended to to to deal with general deterministic control Deterministic control. So, and then we apply the stochastic sewing lemma to obtain the rate. However, remember that the stochastic sewing lemma asks that I should have one half plus epsilon, but here I have a control rise to the power exact half. So, this is a critical case and. Critical case, and then there is an additional argument to deal with the critical exponent. And the trade-off is instead of one over n to the half, you have a correction log n. And with some additional arguments, you can bring the sub remote inside the moment and this gives you the rate. Okay, so some recent progress. So we have a restriction on the moments, which seems unnatural. So it would be nice to have some estimation in the higher moment. There is a recent work of Alexander. Alexandra Richard and his students, where they look at numerical solutions for fractional for SDA driven by fractional brain motion with distributional drift, where some similar ideas have been used. They also use a time or scheme. And then on the SPDE side, we know that the SPDEs also have. Know that the SBDs also have solutions, strong solutions with distributional drift. And it would be nice to have something in that direction. And also the SDEs and SPDs with multiplicative noise. So I thank you for your attention. Or a quick question? Or a quick question. Yeah, so if you do not use it in the tail tricks, if you just take B and that is B N, what happens? Sorry, could you could you say that again? Yeah, so you use this. These taming versions of your drift replace B by some BN, right? So if you do not do that, you just what happens? So it's just that the the your scheme does not make sense because because Because of this example, so the drift has a singularity at zero. And if your simulation is near zero, then it becomes very large or undefined. Well, it becomes very large, it's not undefined because you touch zero with zero probabilities. I mean, it's a scheme. Yeah, but I mean, I want to evaluate it point-wise or almost surely. point-wise or almost surely. So mathematically a result doesn't work if you if you don't do anything. What happens? Can you observe
