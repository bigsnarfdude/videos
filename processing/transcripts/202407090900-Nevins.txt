So good morning everyone and thank you so much to the organizers for giving me this opportunity to share my perspective on branching problems in the p-atic setting. I really appreciate the nature of this workshop. It's having people in the real p-atic and idelic setting sharing the problems that are interesting to them. I really enjoyed yesterday's talks. There's all kinds of questions that real people are phrasing that I would love to be looking at in the p-adic setting. So in that spirit, with the permission of the organizers, I, with the permission of the organizers, um, the first part of my talk is really meant for real people. Can I have a show of hands in the language of yesterday? Who's like really real? All right, by the way, you know, P. Eddick, you've heard this. Yeah, fine, but it's not real and real is the best. And, you know, like you might be at that. So that's who I'm talking to. And so my apologies to any PI people in the audience for the first one. Piatic people in the audience for the first part. Okay, sorry, I guess I have to thank you. Good. So we'll start off with the first half of the talk and a little bit more. We'll just be pietic. What I want to share are some of the things that are different in the p-iadic setting than the real setting, where those things actually stand out. Because amazingly, a lot of the representation theory comes out the same. We can both talk about the Langlands conjectures. And I'll stop with the representation theory of SL2. And then I'll share just a few slides on some. Have just a few slides on some selections of branching problems that we're looking at in the p-adic setting. And I apologize for all the things that I missed. There's a lot that one could include in here. So p-iadic fields. So a p-adic field, so that's a local non-Archimedean field, and I'm thinking characteristic zero. So it's a finite algebraic extension of Qp. As a set, this is a Cantor set. So it has lots of compact open sets. Among those is a maximal compact open set. Is a maximal compact open subring, and that's the set of all elements of norm less than or equal to one. That is an open set, it's a maximal compact open, and it's a subring, and it has a prime ideal. So if you're thinking that it's a fractal, what you've got is another copy of that integer ring when you multiply by a prime element, which we usually call varpi. Okay, so you have the integer ring, something like Z to P, you have the prime ideal, typically generated by P. Prime ideal typically generated by p if you want. And what's really nice about this, the fractal nature means that I have a neighborhood basis of zero consisting of compact open subgroups. And these are just the powers of p. And you can also do that at the multiplicative level. You can take r cross, and there's also a neighborhood basis of the identity consisting of compact open subgroups. The first quotient of the integer ring by its maximal ideal, that's a finite field, and that's what we call the residue field. And this is where The residue field. And this is where the connection of representation theory of p-iadic groups touches on the representation theory of finite groups. P-i-dic fields are characteristic zero, but there's elements of characteristic p just below the surface. Now, where the p-iadic numbers are way better than the real numbers is we have tons of algebraic Galois extensions, like infinitely many. And among all the possible extensions of the field, the very nicest ones are the unramified extensions. So that's why that word should. Extension. So that's why that word shows up everywhere in our representation theory. One definition would be that if that prime element giving you your prime ideal is the same one for the extension field. What it means is that the extension actually just came from an extension of the finite field. So you can classify the unramified extensions just by the extensions of the rest field. Okay, and maybe the catchphrase would be if you're doing a ramified extension, you're doing a lot more arithmetic problems. You're caring about if minus one is a square or not. About if minus one is a square or not, and little things like that. But in unramified extensions, things are quite elegant. Okay, so just to compare some structure theory, we take a connected reductive group over the p-adic numbers and compare with taking the real points of such a group. So over the real numbers, your favorite things are carton subgroups, and you just have a few of them up to conjugacy, and you might not even have a compact carton. Over the pianic field, what we're excited about when we talk about are tori. About when we talk about our tori. A torus is an algebraic group that is isomorphic to a number of copies of the multiplicative group of the field over a suitable extension. So that's the same thing as a carta, R cross or maybe S1 or maybe C cross. Those are all examples of tori. So if you do those in the p-adic setting, you get infinitely many more choices because we don't just have one quadratic extension that can produce an interesting torus. And in fact, we have tons of And in fact, we have tons of elliptic tori. An elliptic torus means compact mod center. So these are as good as the ones you'd love to have in the real case. And there's tons of them. For example, take split SO5. There's about 21 elliptic tori, and it grows exponentially with the rank. So this kind of classification has been done. It's very tricky, but let's just say we got lots and lots and lots of those. Feel free to interrupt at any time. Feel free to interrupt at any time or to hunt me down afterwards for more questions. The other cool thing we do in real representation theory is we say, well, we got a maximal compact subgroup, and that one's unique up to conjugacy. And oops, that's definitely not how it works in the p-adic case. We have several conjugacy classes of maximal compact open subterrans. One way we can describe them is each of them does arise as the stabilizer of a really good point of the Ruha-Tietz building. And we'll get to that in just a moment. And we'll get to that in just a moment. So, we have a way of talking about them, of classifying them, of seeing their conjugacy in a nice geometric way. And if you want to think about what are these maximal compact open subgroups, they are not piadic groups because they're not defined over the p-adic field. They are integral points of a group scheme. So, we leave the category of algebraic groups to talk about them. And if you look at them, you have a pro p radical, and when you take that quotient. P radical, and when you take that quotient, that's going to be a finite group of Lie type, and that's where that representation theory of finite groups of Lie type pop in. Okay, I said the Rouhatitz building. The Brouhatitz building is this immense and glorious object, and it comes from, you start with a split carton, a split maximal torus, and you write down the root systems. And then for us, we're interested in the affine roots. So you'll draw your, this is an apartment corresponding to a split torus in sp4. And SP4. The building is just, that was one split Taurus. Take all the conjugates of that split torus, that gives you a whole bunch of these apartments, and glue them together in the perfect way. The perfect way will mean that the stabilizer of a vertex, for example, will be a maximal compact open subgroup. There can be more points that are not vertices whose stabilizers are maximal compact open subgroups, and stabilizers of other points will be interesting things like maybe they could be a perihoric. Interesting things like maybe there could be a perihorics and all those other things. Now, I wanted to give you a sense of the different kinds of maximal compact open subgroups. If you're in sp4 and you take this hyperspecial vertex over here, because it has all the root hyperplanes going through it, your stabilizer would be the integer points of sp4. That's sp4 over the integer ring. And if you look at the reductive quotient, that's sp4 over the finite field, just what you'd expect. But here's another vertex, and this one's more surprising. If you look at what that maximal compact. Look at what that maximal compact is, and you ask for its reductive quotient, you get two copies of SL2. And you can see that by looking in a neighborhood of the point. And you can see the root system of the spherical building of the finite group of Lie type by the neighborhood of the point at which you're doing the stabilizer. Okay, so that's just to say that where we have geometry in the pietic setting is very often hidden and embedded in the Brouhat-Titz building. There's so much more I'd love to say. Okay, now we have maximal components. Okay, now we have maximal compact open subgroups, but that's not the coolest thing. The coolest thing was the filtration of these compact open subgroups by a neighborhood basis of the identity. And one of the nicest filtrations is called the Boin-Prassade filtration. The Boin-Prousade filtration says, take any point X and look at the stabilizer. That's a pretty big, compact, open subgroup. And then for each real number, positive real number, you have a filtration subgroup GXR. Actually, the filtration only changes at discretely Only changes at discretely many values. But because my x could take a value in a real vector space, the apartment, that's why I just give a name to every filtration level. But they only change. And where it changes depends on the coordinates of the point x. If x is a vertex, the places where it changes are the integers. Okay, and a way of thinking about what are these groups. So it's this weird, the really weird filtration, and the filtration can have many different steps at some points and only two steps at other points. And only two steps at other points per Z. What it's capturing is that the volume of GXR is roughly the volume of the prime ideal to minus R times the dimension of G. Understand that as roughly because R is not always an integer. And you can have filtration subgroups that are a little bit bigger and a little bit smaller. But it's a way of saying we can control the size of the group across the whole, all possible conjugacy classes. Classes. Okay, representation theory. Oh, very good. So, representation theory. We have smooth representations, but we don't differentiate anything. We are a Cantor set. So, for us, the definition of smooth is the multiple constant. So, smooth with means, you have a representation. You take any vector. You can find some teeny tiny compact open subgroup that is fixed by k. So, every point has some small. Has some small compact open subgroup that fixes the point. You typically can't pick the same compact open subgroup for every point. That would make those very boring representations. You say it has depth R, and that's a key ingredient for us. If you're looking at all those Loint-Persot filtrations, GXR, you've looked across the entire building, and at a very big group, you might not fix any points whatsoever. No vectors are fixed by a big group, perhaps. But as you get smaller and smaller, Perhaps. But as you get smaller and smaller, you're smooth. Eventually, there's going to be a compact open subgroup that fixes some vector in your representation. And just at that moment, the R where you don't have any fixed points, but if you go any further in R and you have to have fixed points, that's the depth of your representation. So think of it as measuring kind of how complex our representation is, how big it is. If you have to go to a very deep R, you're a huge representation. If you're depth zero, you're among the If you're dex zero, you're among the smallest representations. Okay. And then admissible. Admissible for us, the definition is that those fixed points, those vectors that are fixed by a particular compact open, K, has to be finite dimensional. For any compact open, you just have a finite number of vectors in the fixed points under K. Just like in the real case, what we get from here is Harishandra's admissibility condition, which is that an admissible Condition, which is that an admissible representation has the wonderful property that when you restrict it to any compact open, you will have a direct sum of irreducible representations of K with finite multiplicities. Unlike the real case, however, this isn't a reduction to the simple case. We don't know these. So we'll come back to those in the branching problems. And what we do have in this case is something called the theory of types, and that is something like Of types, and that is something like our p-iadic analog of the lowest k-type. But there's a lot of differences, but the theory and the spirit of the theory is perhaps the same. So I'll come back to that. Okay, the thing we all talk about is supercuspital representations. If you've been to any talks by p-adic people, this is the one we talk about. And you guys are so jealous of our supercuspital representations. Our supercuspital representations are ones whose matrix coefficients are compactly supported. Coefficients are a compactly supported mod center. And in the real case, I think you only get that if you've got a compact group. So we have, however, tons and tons of supercuspital representations. So they're really, really nice. And if you have unitary central character, they're unitary, you're in the discrete series, they're great. But they're also absolute building blocks to our representation theory. So if you have an irreducible smooth representation of G, call it pi, there exists a parabolic subgroup and a Levy subgroup. Parabolic subgroup and a Levy subgroup and a supercuspital representation of the Levy subgroup such that pi shows up inside as a subquotient of the parabolically induced representation. Now, that part so far, I haven't said anything shocking for you as a real person. Great, every representation shows up in some parabolically induced representation, but this cuspidal support is unique up to G conjugacy. So for every representation, So for every representation, I can find a Levy subgroup up to conjugacy and a supercussible representation of that Levy so that my representation varying is, so my representation is showing up in this parabolic wave induced representation. Okay, and that's certainly a huge part of the classification of representations, but we should do SL2F. Okay, everybody loves SL2, so let's do SL2 over a finite field and Field and so we'll go. So we say cuspital support. So SL2, the only levy subgroup is the split torus. So if I have proper cuspital support, I must be a principal series representation. So the induced formabaral of a character chi. Very normal, very usual kind of stuff. Those ones are actually for SL2. They're almost all irreducible. The exception is when chi is a quadratic character and I have a couple of those, then I will break up into a direct. Then I will break up into a direct sum of two irreducible representations, and that's a unitary case. And then, if my chi is the norm character or the inverse of the norm character, that's where with unitary induction, I get the trivial and the Steinberg representation. Now, I could also talk about supercuspital representations. So, if we go to that classification, if I don't have proper cuspital support, then in fact, I must be a supercuspital representation. And there, the theory absolutely. And there, the theory absolutely splits into positive depth and depth zero. If you want to make a representation of depth zero of SL2, you first go to a reductive quotient for one of the two vertices of SL2. Those are two non-conjugate maximal compact subgroups. You take that quotient that's isomorphic to SL2 over the finite field. You could choose a cuspidal representation of SL2 over F. You inflate it to this compact open sub. And then the compact induction of that representation is an irreducible supercuspital representation of depth zero. So that's easy to state and easy to write down, but I would say that cuspital representations of the finite group of Lie type are not easy. But for general groups, they're produced by the theory of Billing and Lustig, for example. So there's some handle on how to produce those. And this was part of the original theory by Moin Prisat, showing us that all depth zero. Prasat showing us that all depth zeros would show up in this way. And then for the positive depth, these ones are very fun. So, but for SL2, they have a beautiful statement. And SL2, you start off with an elliptic torus of SL2. For SL2, there's either four or six of those, depending on whether or not minus one is a square. So you take an elliptic torus up to conjugacy. You choose a character of that porous and of positive depth r. Of positive depth r. And so, one way to think about it is that character is a character of this quotient group, P mod T R plus, T R plus being a certain filtration of my torus, my torus being copies of the field. Then this building of the torus, this is a compact group. A compact group has as a building a single point. So that point is sitting somewhere inside the building of G. And that's the point at which I have to do this construction. And that for SL2 could be a vertex or maybe the midpoint between two. A vertex, or maybe the midpoint between two vertices. You take your character chi, that's just a character of this one-dimensional subgroup. If I induce that, that's way too big. That will not work. I need something that's the analog of parabolic induction. And this is where I would say, morally speaking, this is our AQ lambda, our cohomological induction. We're starting off with tori that are elliptic and more generally, elliptic twisted levy subgroups. And what we're looking for is And what we're looking for is a way to extend it to a representation and do some kind of induction. But we don't need to go to cohomology for this. What we just need to do is take that representation chi, and we're going to fatten this up. So think of t times gx r over 2. The gx's are all open subgroups. We are taking a character of the torus and we're fattening it on a nice open subgroup. So you have a character of the torus, and then this, you've extended it across. And then this, you've extended it across just the perfect amount of open space. So, this is now a compact open subgroup of GL2. And I can do this compact induction, and that will be irreducible if I did this extension just right. Okay. Is it handled again the character or one? Oh, excellent question. So, if lots of the time, this will just be a one-dimensional representation, but there exists exactly the horror. But there exist exactly the horrible moments that make things interesting, and that's where you extend it as far as you can, and it's not enough to induce irreducibly. But the difference between how far you could extend it and where you can, where you want to extend it, is basically a Heisenberg group. And you have a character of the center of the Heisenberg group. So by the Stone-Neumann theorem, there's a unique way to make it, but it'll be like Q-dimensional in that case. Yes, yes, exactly. So what is this R? Positive, you know, R? This R here. This R here. So that depends on the torus. If I have an unramified torus, R will be some integer. And if I have a ramified torus, then it will be a strict half integer. And so it's related to the filtration of the point that you get from the building. So very good, very good. So in general, there's only a few rational numbers that those depths can possibly take. I should have mentioned the depth of a representation is always a rational number. And the points x that show up in general are from a fairly Show up in general are from a fairly restricted set. They're optimal points of the buildings. So, and okay, that's good. Any more questions? Because we're right, but this is the end of our representation theory. So, if you had a burning question. Okay, perfect. Then let's start talking about branching problems in the p-adic setting. Okay, so this is just my favorite list of branching problems. So, the first one is branching to a maximal compact open set. Branching to a maximal compact open subgroup K. This is where we are so far behind you guys because we don't even have an explicit description of pi restricted to k. That is a multiplicity, finite multiplicity decomposition. Our problem, we have it for a bunch of rank one groups. So GL2, that was Castleman, PGL2, that was Silberger, SL2, I did that, U11. We're going to hear about that this afternoon from Ekta Diwari. And we have unramified principles series. We have unramified principal series of GL3 that was work I did with Peter Campbell and then finished off by Yuri-On and Puja Sinclair. The problem is that the representation theory of these groups is not known in general. And people are saying that the classification looks like it's a wild problem. So to write down all of the representations of K is not a good way that we could start at this problem. We can't do that. But where we're approaching these is kind of in a top-down approach for a particular positive. Down approach for a particular pie, sometimes we can create those representations. Okay, another interesting thing is that theory of types I was alluding to. So if you start with the least depth pieces, say we just talk about a supercuspital representation. If I take the smallest depth pieces that it has the miraculous property that basically this uniquely identifies my supercuspital representation, which G is semi-simple and simply connected, I think. Semi-simple is probably good enough. Semi-simple is probably good enough. Then these types are just like it's one representation of K that's playing like the lowest K type, but your lowest K type can show up in lots of different representations. Our types show up only in the representations that they belong to, and they can't show up in any other representation. So they determine the Bernstein block of pi. We know the types for almost lots and lots of classical groups. This is work of Bushnell and Krutzko in the 1990s. It was important to 1990s. It was important to the Langlands correspondence. Sometimes we have to restrict to p not equal to 2, but it's very, very tangible and concrete, and it's built out of like field extensions and skew parameters. But at the other end of the spectrum, we have full generality for any G. It doesn't even matter if it's exceptional, classical, doesn't matter at all. But we have to assume that the group is tamely ramified. It slits over as tamely ramified extension, and that P does not divide the order of the bile group. And in that case, we know all the possibilities. Group. And in that case, we know all the possible types. And there's a lot of work going on at kind of filling in the few gaps that are left, but we don't know them. But I think we're almost at the point of being able to say, we know all the types for representations. And then you could say, well, we know all the types by we've built them, we constructed them. But I constructed a type this way and somebody else constructs a type this way. Are they the same? And there's a lot of work going on in that. You might call them. Lot of work going on in that. You might call it as unique. One of the ways you might want to phrase it is: for superclassical representations, if I induce to a maximal compact open subgroup, I know that I'm going to have types there. So could I just make a list of all the maximal compact open subgroups and the types that are sitting on those? Turns out it's not a great list. In GLN, it was perfect. It was a one-to-one correspondence. It gave us an elegant-looking inertial language correspondence. But in other groups, it's looking a little bit. Other groups, it's looking a little bit hairy. So, but there's open questions there. And then you could say, well, okay, forget the maximal compact open subgroups. Let's go to the smaller compact open subgroups. The representation there is, theory there is much easier. Well, not easier, but well, you know, it's much more tangible, manageable, I think is the word I chose. Roger Howe, for example, in the 1970s told us all about the representations of those smaller groups for GLN. And a really interesting question that I have there is: when you look at the local character, There is when you look at the local character expansion that came up in Baiying's talk yesterday, it predicts that if you take a representation and you restrict to a small enough open subgroup, just that subgroup where you start to get fixed points, that representation, its character is really simple. It's just a linear combination of Fourier transforms of nilpotent orbital integrals. And the question would be, can we write this as a sum of representations coming from nilpotent orbits? We know the character somehow comes from The character somehow comes from these analytic objects. Is there a representation theoretic version of that? And that's something that I've been excited about lately. Okay, so we're way behind the real world on restricting to a maximal compact open subgroup, but here's where we're ahead of the real world. So Gelfland pairs and the Gangros-Prussade conjecture. So Gelfland-Pairs is the same definition that you'd have in the real case. So one of these pairs such that for, let's say, all irreducible representations. Let's say all irreducible representations pi of g and sigma of h, we're wondering if the dimension of the space of symmetry breaking operators is at most one. And we often rewrite this just by putting the configuration over here. And then this is phrased a bit closer to the question of distinction. So that question, or you know, when do you have a Gelfand pair? We know lots of them. So many people here have been involved in finding Gelfand pairs. Involved in finding Guelphant Paris. So I will put on this list. I mean, there's the big paper of Eisenbad, Gurevich, Rollis, and Schiffman gave us this whole slew of Gelfant pairs, showing these had multiplicity at most one. Welts-Pergé gives us S-O-N, a bunch of work of Emery and Takeda recently giving us more generalizations of this. And of course, we've always known this one. The Gangros-Prasad conjectures. The Gun Gross-Presade conjectures, which are a huge motivator in this area, they're doing a little bit more. They're saying, okay, it's great that that's multiplicity at most one. When is it exactly one? So that's very close to branching rules that we've been talking about here. And it should identify the pairs for which you actually get one in terms of the local Langlands correspondence. So I didn't mention the local Langlands correspondence when I was giving you the rundown of representation theory, eh? Sorry. But let's say it exists. Um, but let's say it exists, and this one's saying that there's a way to predict how that decomposition is going to work out, not so much by looking just at the representations, by looking at their alpha parameters. And some really cool things. And I think we'll hear a lot more about this from Dihua Zheng's talk later this week. And the questions that are open here, so as we said from Beijing Yu yesterday, the gross ground predictors in the non-timbered case are certainly a big question. They're mostly for A big question. They're mostly proven in the tempered case. You can probably correct me if I'm wrong. Mostly generously interpreted, but we're pretty close to knowing a lot about these conjectures. Twisted versions, I think Danielle has done work in twisted versions of the GGP. And then there's a lot of work going into just finding more pairs that would fit into that framework. Okay, other places where you might have finite multiplicity. We could look at a pair. We could look at a pair GH such that H is sitting between the derived group and the whole group. So, you know, a GLN-SLN kind of thing example. Branching in this case does have finite multiplicity, so it's a reasonable thing to hope for. Here's a few quick facts. So if your quotient of G by the center of G times your H is cyclic, then you're multiplicity freeze. So that's a wonderful Agelfant pair. For supercospital representations, your question of multiplicity. Your question of multiplicity turns out to become a question on multiplicity in the restriction of the associated finite groups of V type. So it comes down to the depth zero piece of the type and the rest of the representation somehow is behaving right. So this is part of a more general theory that's telling us that for supraclassical representations of positive depth, we have high hopes that the big questions could be reduced to a depth zero question. But more generally, and this is work of Jeff Adler and Work of Jeff Adler and Depender Prasad, and a recent work by Puang Ho Choi explaining how the multiplicities of this restriction would be predicted by the local Langlands correspondence. And there's a wonderful web of explanations of what should happen there in, say, the tempered case. And it's just based on some conjectural properties of the local Language correspondence. So we can write down the answers even when we don't have a local Language correspondence. And we're just hoping that we catch up with that. Just hoping that we catch up with that. The kinds of questions that turn out to be kind of fun to look at still here. Of course, we should finish making up that local language correspondence. Any day now, I'm sure. And then how explicitly can we develop those branching rules on the pietic side? So there's kind of really weird, surprising examples that people know about, about how this fairly simple-looking branching problem turns into surprises. And we'd like to understand that a little bit better. Understand that a little bit better by just working out more of what's going on here. And now let's just warm up to the morning. What will you be hearing about this morning, for example? Well, in an hour and a half or so, we're going to take up the same topic that Haiyan He was talking about yesterday, which is I've got a finite group acting on a connected reductive group defined over a p-i-t group, G. Group defined over a p-i-t group G, and you take the set of fixed points, and so an example like GL2N, SP2N. And here, the branching multiplicities can be infinite. And the question yesterday was, oh, when is it discretely decomposable and stuff like that? The question that we'll be looking or that I will be sharing is more the second one here. What kinds of relationships can we even postulate between the various representations of G and their restrictions to H? Those kinds of things are. H. Those kinds of things are where that question is coming from. And then you say, Well, that's in a huge generality here. Let's bring it down to symmetric pairs, just like in the talk yesterday. And if you're going to look at symmetric pairs, then one of the coolest questions is of distinguished representations. So if I have an involution on G and I take the fixed points under the involution, so that would be a symmetric pair, GH, then you could take any character of H. Maybe traditionally you would take the trivial character, but any character would do. But any character would do. And then you'll say that a representation of G is H ch distinguished if there are some symmetry breaking operators from pi to chi. And discovering the plus of these representations is something that we've been working on in the real and in the p-adic setting for quite some time here. I just wanted to include a few casual examples of symmetric pairs. This is, you know, a classic in another group. This is an extension. In another group, this is an extension of scalars. We do a lot of that stuff. And here, say, the diagonal group embedded in the product. Why you would look at distinction? It's the key to a bunch of global problems. And I think over the next few days, we have a few talks about the global problems, talking about period integrals or the relative trace formula. All this stuff is in this context of distinction. And I just want to highlight one that's very important for the work that I've done is, oops, sorry, I'm getting to that. So the H-distinguished representation theory. Distinguished representation theory. So, if you just look at the set of all representations that are H-distinguished, it has a beautiful analog to the set of just all representations. So, we have a way of talking about H-distinguished representation that's really quite beautiful. And the kinds of where these applications have come up, for example, in work of Hakeem Mernahan in 2008, they used this kind of distinguished pair to prove when the construction of two supercussible representations would produce isomorphic representations. Isomorphic representations. And this was a huge result that gave us the equivalence of supercuspole representations. So it's having implications in all kinds of stuff. And with that, I leave you with some favorite references to read more and a whole morning worth of talks. Are you seeing you? Are we getting any questions for you? We're going to talk about the character formula, but what do we mean by? What do you mean by representing from nilpotency? That is a good question. So, what do I mean by a representation associated to a nil-point? I think there's got to be one. And in SL2, I can show that you can construct nice representations of the maximal compact open subgroup that are just built from the nilpotent orbit, maybe a central character. And it's an infinite-dimensional representation such that if you take the representation of SL2, you restrict it to GXR plus, you're going. To GXR, you're going to get those representations corresponding to the wavefront set, and then a plus or minus some copies of the trivial representation. So restricted to a small enough open subgroup, you can just write down what the representation is. It's these nilpotent representations, plus or minus some copies of the trivial representation. And that's in the spirit of the local character expansion, which says your character looks like, oh, well, a number of copies of the number one plus maybe with coins. Maybe with coefficients 0 and 1, you'll have the Fourier transforms of the nilpotent orbital integrals of the maximal orbits, of which there are four in SL2. Sorry, I said that very fast. Didn't I say? So in SL2, there are five nilpotent orbits, four of them are maximal, and you can construct a representation of any maximal compact open subgroup attached to each of those four nilpotent orbits, such that when you take your representation pi, you restrict it to GXR plus. You just need to know those. You pull those off the shelf. Just need to know those. You pull those off the shelf, and that's your decomposition of your representation. So, your representation, built one, will now be all simple aspects as well. They're only representations of the maximum compact open sub-group. Now, but Henyart and Vinyura are approaching it from the perspective of you could take the unipotent representations. In SL2, there are the four special cuscal representations that show up in that one unique L packet of size four. And each of those, in fact, And each of those, in fact, their restriction to GXR plus is indistinguishable. Like that gives you that milpotent orbit. And so you could take sums of those, and when you're stripped small enough, that's what all your representations look like. Another questions? So I've also done it for enough bigger groups, but when you're potentially telling me to say something about what you process. When I'm restricting to K specifically, you should be able to, I mean, that's what you're talking about for ourselves. Should be able, I mean, that's what you're talking about for us also, yes. And so, um, so we'll have a little bit more this afternoon about U11. Uh, how about the examples where we really know the branching are like GL2 and PGL2, and there's not a whole lot of nilpoten orbits. That's right. That's right. And in the higher rank case, the stuff that we've done is on RMF5 principal series. Well, then all nilpoten orbits show up because it's principal series. So, so we don't have clear things. I do have for p equals two, which, oh, Have for p equals two, which oh, I mean, I threw up p equals two a long time ago and I didn't tell you. Uh, with p equals two, the representation theory is a bit of a mess. And you do get there, you got like eight nilpotent orbits if you're over q2. And you still see this kind of branching going on, but some of the nilpotent orbits blonde together. So thank you very much.
