That's right after lunch. I'm glad to be giving the first talk in the coming marathon of six talks. So hopefully this will be of interest to some of the folks here. So this is about the Landau Degen model, just magic with the crystals, doing optimal control. This is joint work with Thomas Survich. He used to be at the University of Marlburg, Germany, but he recently moved to Simula, Oslo. Oslo jump right in. You all know what liquid crystals are, so I'll give some kind of motivation for doing optimal control. So here, you have this golden particle with maybe different patches of different types of anchoring conditions on the colloid. And so this could be something that you may want to optimize, like optimize the distribution of these different patches. By the distribution of different packages with a different state.
