Deliberative plan, which I'll say, a deliberative plan is one where the robot has to stop and think about its next action before it does it. And a reactive plan is just a feedback strategy in which the next action of the robot is completely determined by its current state. It doesn't have to think, it just acts. Both of these are important for robots. I'll say reactive planning is especially well suited to sort of low-level control. Suited to sort of low-level control. And it enables you to respond really quickly to changes in the environment because you don't have to stop and think, you just have to act. And now, improving what's possible through reactive control also enables the development of increasingly effective deliberative planners. Now, formally, what I mean by a reactive plan is one for which the closed-loop system is expressible as a semi-dynamical system and by A semi-dynamical system, and by semi-I mean flow in forward time only might be what's possible. Now, on the other hand, when I say the kind of dynamical systems that show up in robotics are not necessarily classical. So, because of either physical or engineered events, there can be cause or those events can cause abrupt changes in the governing dynamics, which cause the relevant dynamical systems for row. Relevant dynamical systems for robots to be hybrid, and I'll give a more precise definition later. So, for example, making or breaking of mechanical contacts or switching according to logical decisions by a high-level planner. Here are two pictures of such things. So, in the picture on the left, there's a common model of a robot from the hybrid zero dynamics literature. And because when the foot hits the road, And because when the foot hits the ground, there's a discontinuous change in the Newtonian equations of motion, you have a hybrid effect. And on the right, what's shown are you have a bunch of contractible domains on each domain is, say, a gradient vector field. And what you do is you flow along the gradient vector field until you flow into one of the neighboring domains, and then you switch. And so, because hybrid dynamical systems show up all over the place for various reasons in robotics, we want to analyze such systems. And so, our goal is to develop a unified hybrid dynamical systems theory to analyze systems like these. Now, of course, there are many branches of dynamical systems, but in this talk, I'll focus on developing and extending aspects of topological dynamics to hybrid dynamical systems. Systems. More specifically, the goal that I'll talk about is generalizing, I think, one of the high points of topological dynamical systems, or two of the high points, which are Conley's decomposition theorem and what many, but some people call his fundamental theorem of dynamical systems. So I'll state it here without defining everything. I'll define, I'll give more general definitions of the various things later for hybrid systems. Of the various things later for hybrid systems. But so I'll just say a few words about this. So the setting is that of continuous semi-dynamical systems on compact metric space. So here by a semi-dynamical system, I mean again, it might only be possible to flow in forward time, and time can be the non-negative reals or non-negative integers. So in other words, this is a continuous monoid action of the non-negative real. Monoid action of the non-negative reals or non-negative integers on some compact metric space. And Conley defines this thing called the chain recurrence set, which roughly speaking captures all the points which can flow back to themselves if you allow small errors to happen along their orbits. And you can also define these things called attracting sets. And you can define their dual repelling sets, which are everything in the state space which does not attract to the Which does not attract to the attracting set. And Conley shows that the chain recurrence set admits this decomposition. It's kind of a very deep relationship between the chain recurrence set, which its definition has nothing to do on the face of it with attracting and repelling sets, but the chain-recurrent set can be expressed as the intersection overall unions of attracting-repelling pairs. And furthermore, Conley shows. Conley shows, and this second theorem is what's often referred to as his fundamental theorem, that every continuous semi-dynamical system on a compact metric space has what's called a completely opponent function, which is some continuous function that strictly decreases on trajectories outside the chain recurrence set, is constant on trajectories within the chain recurrence set, and satisfies a couple of other technical properties. So here's a picture of such a completely opinion function for a very simple system on the plane. Very simple system on the plane. Here, the ordinary differential equation defining the system is shown at the top. So there is a stable limit cycle and an unstable, a repelling equilibrium at the origin. And this sombrero-like function shown here is the graph of one such completely opt-in-a-function. So that's the classical results we want to generalize. So we came up with a dev. We came up with a definition of two definitions of hybrid systems, which we felt were closer in spirit to topological dynamics than many definitions seen in the literature, where there's often assumptions that the state space is, say, a disjoint union of smooth manifolds with corners, and there are smooth things all over the place, and lots of things which are not, which are kind of extraneous when you're trying to develop topological dynamics. Topological dynamics. So we define topological hybrid systems to consist of the following ingredients. So you've got just a topological space, which we denoted I here, state space. You've got a continuous local semi-flow. By local, I mean you might not be able to flow forwards for all positive time. The domain of phi here is an open subset of the non-negative reals cross F, where F is this open. Where F is this open flow set. It's a subset of state space. And then you've also got this closed guard set denoted Z here equipped with some continuous reset map. It's just a continuous map which sends the guard back into state space. And if I happens to be a metric or extended metric space, we just say that this is a metric hybrid system. Here is a picture of what an execution of such a system looks like. So you started some. Looks like. So you start at some point and then you flow along the continuous time dynamics until such time when you smack into the guard. And then you teleport according to the reset map instantaneously. And in this case, I reset back into the guard again. So I instantaneously teleport back into the flow set. And then I continue flowing along the continuous time dynamics. Now, it's probably worth making a remark here, which is that those familiar with the hybrid systems in the literature, what's Systems in the literature, what the definitions look usually look like is you've got several modes, which are typically like some big disjoint union of manifolds with corners. And there's often talk of an underlying directed graph, which encodes the resets. And so on the face of it, our definition looks a lot less general. But the motivation for our definition was in developing Conley theory, we realized that the underlying graph structure was That the underlying graph structure was kind of extraneous. So we came up with this on the face of it, simpler definition. But if you take a definition that's common in the literature and you just take the disjoint union of everything, you can reduce things to our definition. Okay, so I showed you a picture of an execution of a topological hybrid system. You can formalize this. It takes a little bit of work, and because it's kind of a dense definition and I'm short on time, I'm just going to On time, I'm just going to skip through this, but the key idea is just the picture. And I will say a couple of things about these add-on definitions, because they're relevant for the precise statements of our theorem. So if you can, if executions are such that you can flow and reset and flow and reset, and keeping in mind that resets are assumed to take up zero time, they have. Assumed to take up zero time. They happen instantaneously. If you can extend executions for infinite time, we say that the execution is infinite. And if infinitely many resets occur, we say this is a Zeno execution. And we say an execution is maximal if you just can't extend it to any larger execution which strictly contains it. Okay, so just like in classical topological dynamics, In classical topological dynamics, you can define omega limit sets and attracting and repelling sets. And I'll just say for the rest of this talk, I'm going to assume that the hybrid system is deterministic. There are unique executions from every point. I'll assume state space is compact, and all maximal executions are either infinite or xeno. So, just like in the classical theory, you can define omega limit sets of a subset following Conley to roughly be the smallest subset that. Roughly be the smallest subset that executions emanating from the set S collectively converge to as either time or the number of resets tends to infinity. And you could formalize this definition in this equation here. And you say that some subset is an attracting set if it has a forward invariant neighborhood, such that the omega limit set of that neighborhood is the set itself. And you can define the Bayesian of the set to be the set. Define the basin of the set to be the set of all states whose omega limit set is contained in the attracting set, and the dual repeller to be just everything not in the basin. I need one last definition, which is to extend Conley's notion of epsilon T chains. So here are the rules for an epsilon T chain, and you should think of this as an execution with errors. I start here and I flow. If I flowed for at least capital T seconds, I'm allowed to do a hop. I'm allowed to do a hop as long as that hop is distance less than epsilon. And then I'm allowed to flow again. And I'm also allowed to jump if I hit a guard and then reset. So I hit the guard and reset. Because I just reset, I'm allowed to do another epsilon hop. And these are essentially the two ways I'm allowed to hop. And there's one extra way, which is if it has been at least capital T seconds since my last continuous time hop. So here's a continuous time hop. So here's a continuous time hop. Now I do a discrete jump and I do a reset hop. Sorry, I do a continuous jump and then I do a reset hop and then I teleport over here because it's been and I do another hop and I flow here because it's been from this point to this point at least capital T second since my last reset hop or continuous time hop I'm allowed to do a hop again. And so you have these epsilon t chains are executions with errors in this way and then you Way and then you can define two points x and y to be chain equivalent. If for every epsilon t, no matter how small epsilon is or how large t is, you can find an epsilon t chain from x to y and vice versa. And then you say that a state x is chain recurrent if x is chain equivalent to itself. Now, if you just make these definitions, you find out that a lot can go wrong. For example, omega limit sets don't need to be forward invariant, they don't need to be contained. Be forward invariant, they don't need to be contained in the chain recurrent set, the chain recurrent set doesn't need to be forward-invariant, and the chain-recurrent set doesn't even need to be closed, which are all properties enjoyed in the classical theory. And so we impose this one extra condition called the trapping guard condition, which roughly says the following. It says that you need to assume the trapping that the guard Z has some neighborhood and a continuous retraction of that neighborhood onto Z, which is compatible with the flow. So essentially, um. Flow. So essentially, where the retraction sends a point, it sends a point to just its limiting value according to the flow. And we show that two very broad classes of hybrid systems appearing in the literature satisfy this definition. And so what we do, and I'll have to define completely opinion function on the next slide, we show that if you just use these definitions, as long as the hybrid system is deterministic, state space is compact, Z is trapping, all executions are infinite or xeno, then just a zero. Are infinite or zeno, then just Conley's theorems, his decomposition theorem, and his fundamental theorem, they generalize roughly verbatim. So you still get this nice Conley decomposition, the chain recurrence that decomposes into intersection overall attracting, repelling pair unions, and you still get a completely opponent function. And so what is a completely opponent function? Here are pictures of tube. So up here is shown a hybrid system where you flow outwards, you hit the blue circle. You flow outwards, you hit the blue circle, you teleport here, and then you spiral around. And there's a limit cycle in the outer annular region. And on the right, it showed a bouncing ball system where you go this way, you teleport, you go this way, teleport, and so on. And so a hybrid completely optimal function, the rules are, if you're not in the chain recurrent set, you've got to decrease strictly along both the continuous time and the discrete time dynamics. Time dynamics. The Lyapunov function has to disambiguate points in the chain recurrence set, your chain equivalent if and only if you have the same Lyapunov value. And finally, the Lyapunov function has to take the chain recurrent set to a nowhere dense set in R. The proof idea is to reduce to the continuous time setting by you take the guard, you stretch it out, and then you glue it back along the reset. And what we show is that the semi-flow on this system. The semi-flow on this suspension space, so I guess the semi-flow on this suspension space, which generalizes Smale's classical suspension of a discrete time system, it's well defined and continuous if and only if the trapping guard condition holds, which was our motivation for the condition. So I won't say much about the proof for the sake of time, and I'm going to skip through the last couple of application slides I have here because I want to talk about future directions. Want to talk about future directions. And so, some brief ones I'll mention. You could talk about whether it's possible to generalize to non-compact state spaces and non-deterministic systems. But the one I really want to talk about, because it relates especially to Barbara's work, so far I've discussed a top-down approach. Given a hybrid system, does it have a completely opt-in-up function? But oftentimes, what you have, like in this picture below, is a bottom-down approach where you have a bunch of Where you have a bunch of continuous time dynamics given here on each of these contractible regions with known Lyapunov functions, and we subsequently introduce switching via reset maps. So what can you infer about the global dynamics? And there's this connection with Lyapunov one forms. So assume you've got a Lyapunov function on a hybrid state space, which on a hybrid state space, which is non-increasing along the continuous time dynamics, but possibly not the discrete time. Generally, this function cannot. Generally, this function cannot descend to a Lyapunov function on the suspension because of monodromy effects. But, however, if you view V as a continuous closed one form in the sense of Farber and others, it always non-uniquely descends to a Lyapunov one form for the suspension semi-flow. And so, my question to all of you: this is open, what can Lyapunov one forms tell us about hybrid systems? And one point is that because the Because the hybrid suspension semi-flow is typically always, unless the reset map is injective, it's only a semi-flow, not a flow. We would need a theory of Lyapunov one forms for semi-flows. So that's my talk. Sorry to go a couple minutes over. All right, let's thank all of Dan, Vasilios, Paul, and Matt. And then we'll open. And then we'll open it up to questions.
