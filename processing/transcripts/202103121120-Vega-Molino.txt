I want to thank BIRS, all the organizers, and especially Masha, both for the invitation for me to speak as well as more generally just having this session. I think it's been excellent and I'm very appreciative. So yes, today I'm going to be talking about heat kernel methods in index theory, which I should point out that there have been a number of exceptional talks earlier on in the conference, especially by Elton Su and And among others, as well as there are quite a few experts in the audience today. So, my goal here is to talk a little bit about how heat kernels that we've heard discussed quite a bit can actually be used in the specific context of proving index theorems. So at the end, I'm going to indicate some research that I'm currently working on, but let's take a look here. So, I figure we should start by actually discussing what index theory. By actually discussing what index theory actually is. So, the idea behind index theory is to identify some sort of invariant, usually in the context of pseudo-differential operators, that the properties of these invariants then tell you something about the underlying geometry of the space you're working on. So there's a handful of different applications that these have shown up in. But to give you some idea, maybe a little bit more concretely, probably. concretely. Probably we could say that index theory comes back to the Gauss-Binet theorem all the way back in the 1850s that allows you to relate triangulation of surfaces to the curvature, the local curvature quantity of the surface. This was then extended pretty very quickly to Riemann surfaces and somehow a complexified version of the similar idea. The biggest extension The biggest extension, I think, is arguably the Atia-Singer theorem that generalized this idea to Dirac operators in the context of spin manifolds, and then it included all of these previous cases. It's been further generalized and extended many different directions. This is a very active field of research. In particular, in the 1970s, Atiyapat Potodi and then McKean Singer, among others, were able to introduce a method that involves Introduce a method that involves using the study of the heat kernel to accomplish these types of proofs. So, the motivating theorem for this talk is, in fact, a Sharon-Gauss-Binnet theorem, the generalization of the theorem on surfaces to arbitrary manifolds. So in the context of an even-dimensional compact-oriented Riemannian manifold, the theorem says the following. The Euler characteristic, which traditionally could be defined Traditionally, could be defined as the alternating sum of the number of vertices, edges, faces, and so on of a CW complex, appropriately defined on a manifold, is equal to the integral of this Euler form, which somehow encodes information about the curvature of the space. In particular, omega here is the curvature form associated to the Riemannian curvature tensor of the manifold. So, I want to make sense of this and show how this is. Make sense of this and show how this is accomplished using heat kernel methods. So, I said that the Euler characteristic is defined as an alternating sum of the numbers of these components of a CW complex, but we're actually going to take the slightly more sophisticated approach and consider it to be the alternating sum of the dimensions of the Duram cohomology groups, which are defined as the quotients of the action of an exterior differential on the space of exterior forms of degree P. Of degree p, modulo the image of the same action on the forms of degree p minus one. If you're not as comfortable with this, this is a generalization of the differential on vectors, essentially, to an idea of somehow generalizing to arbitrary dimension. And the study of these objects is somehow dual to this idea of counting the behavior of these CW structures. The behavior of these CW structures. So then we introduce a Laplacian on these differential forms defined as this anticommutator of D and delta, where delta is the formal adjoint of D determined by the Romanian metric. So in the Romanian, in the setting of Romanian geometry, this is well defined and gives us a notion of Laplacian on forms. In particular, there is a decomposition of the exterior. Of the exterior algebra into the kernel of this Laplacian plus the image of d and delta, from which we are able to get the exceptional isomorphism saying that the kernel of this Laplacian forms is isomorphic then to the Hodgduram cohomology groups. This isomorphism is essential and it's the key ingredient in the sense that it relates this the Euler characteristic and therefore this global The Euler characteristic, and therefore this global geometry of the space to the behavior of this Laplacian operator. So we can now study instead the Laplacian and somehow introduce notions of curvature. So connecting maybe back now to some probabilistic methods, we know that under relatively mild conditions here, compactness and closure and completeness of the metric is sufficient, definitely, that there is in fact a heat kernel acting on That there is, in fact, a heat kernel acting on differential forms. That is, it solves the heat equation, and we have this expression where normally we'd have the PT here, but I'll write it in the exponential form for something we'll see a little bit later. But yes, this is just saying that we have a heat kernel in the same sense as usual, but acting on differential forms now. So, we have a definition of a super trace. You have to understand that underlying all of this, we have a sense of supergeometry. But for our purposes, it's Supergeometry. But for our purposes, it's sufficient to understand that a supertrace of a linear endomorphism is the alternating sum of the trace on each of these individual spaces. We want to show that, in fact, the Euler characteristic is the integral of the supertrace of the heat kernel on forms. So to see this, we actually have a relatively straightforward argument. The idea goes something like this. We know that the Euler characteristic by definition is the alternative. Characteristic by definition is the alternating sum of the dimensions of the Durham cohomology groups. By the Hodge isomorphism, this means that we can instead look at the kernel of the Laplacian. And you can write the kernel of the Laplacian as the dimension of eigenspaces. So here, these are just the eigenspaces for the Laplacian. The key step is going from here to here. It turns out that we can show using the decomposition above that the Above that, the eigenspaces for any eigenvalue other than zero actually have to have an alternating dimension. And as a consequence, as you take this alternating sum, the dimensions all cancel out. In effect, this sum is precisely equal to this sum. We can introduce this exponential term that vanishes on the zero eigenspace without accomplishing anything. Accomplishing anything. And then the interesting observation is that this is precisely the expansion of the supertrace in terms of its eigenvalue decomposition. So as a consequence, the Euler characteristic is the integral of the supertrace of the heat kernel. This is, in essence, the way we take these geometric global ideas of Euler characteristic and move them over the domain of stochastic analysis and introduce. Stochastic analysis and introduce the heat kernel. So, what remains, of course, then is to compute the supertrace of this heat kernel. And there are many different approaches to this, but I write this here. It's important to observe that the expression has to be independent of time. The reason for this, of course, is the Euler characteristic is independent of time. So, since it's independent, we're able to make a, if we can get some estimate on the short-time asymptotics of this. On the short-time asymptotics of this, we will be able to say a lot and arrive at the theorem. So, there's a famous relation between the Hodgderum Laplacian that I've been talking about and the Bochner or Rough Laplacian that is naturally induced by the Romanian curvature tensor. This is given by the Weichenbach decomposition that says precisely the relation between the Hajjor and Laplacian and the Bachder-Laplacian is given by the Romanian curvature of the space. So, if we then So if we then, as we've seen this perspective several times throughout the conference, understand that the heat semi-group can be interpreted as an expectation of the expectation of the, how do you want to say this? The heat flow, essentially. We can apply the Feynman-Koch formula using the Weichenbach decomposition above and get this expression. above and get this expression for the heat flow induced by the Hodges during Laplacian. In particular here, UT is a parallel transport along a Brownian bridge and Mt satisfies this differential equation as determined by the Feynman-Coch formula. So as a consequence, this means that the heat kernel on forms actually can be expressed as the heat kernel on functions times As the heat kernel on functions times the expectation of this other term. So then we want to take the short-term asymptotic of this and actually achieve the result. So the heat kernel on functions is well understood, and we know the order of this is t to the d over 2, where d will be the dimension of the manifold, or negative this, excuse me. Yes, here we go, as t goes to zero. So in particular, for this to be, Particular for this to be well-behaved, it's going to be necessary that the supertrace of the side of the term actually has to be the corresponding term to cancel, the corresponding degree to cancel out. So there's a number of different approaches to this, several important ones, including the Maliovin calculus that follows from ideas from Bismuth, there's a handful of others. I'm going to be showing an approach that is referred to somehow as the Brownian-Shedden series and was written up very And was written up very, very nicely by my advisor, Fabrice Baudoin. So, okay, if we're looking at the non-commutative algebra over our formal series of this form, so we're in the setting of rough paths theory, equipped with a bracket, and we introduce a commentator associated to words of arbitrary length. We can then define this sort of intimidating-looking expression for random coefficients, and by considering the lifts of the By considering the lifts of these paths in an appropriate sense, we can show that we have this expression for the exponential of a term of this form, where we have the x naught and xi are appropriately defined vector fields, as the expectation of a term where the coefficients here are determined by a Brownian motion. Importantly, then, we'll notice Importantly, then, we'll notice that the Hodge-Deram-Plausian can be written in exactly this form. As a consequence, we can get the short-time asymptotic of this format, where here dn is the density at zero of the appropriate motion. In particular, we have some terms of higher order here that, well, we'll want to see exactly how they cancel out. If we look at If we look at this, this difference here can be described as the Clifford action of some object in the even exterior algebra. And as a consequence, the supertrace of terms of this form will vanish whenever they're of too low degree. This is referred to as fantastic cancellation. And as a consequence, the previous term has to simplify exceptionally down to a single term of degree derivative. term of degree 02 like we wanted. So when you actually apply these two together we can get precisely the result we were expecting that in the short time the supertrace of the heat kernel has this form in even dimension and vanishes in odd dimension, which is expected. Applying this finally with the result from before we can say we have a precise way to show that the Euler characteristic Way to show that the Euler characteristic is in fact the integral of the supertrace of the curvature tensor. So, this idea has been generalized in many dimensions, and there's a very similar argument, somehow appropriately generalized for the Atias-Inger index theorem, and therefore all of its various directions where it falls out. My interest is in the setting of sub-Romanian geometry, which we've seen talked about a little bit. Very, very quickly, the idea is that we have a sub-bundle of the tangent. We have a sub-bundle of the tangent bundle that obeys some sort of bracket generating condition. And the idea is to only have an inner product defined on this restricted distribution. The problem, of course, is that all of the analysis that I've mentioned before depends on the Hodg-Dorah-Moblossian being elliptic and well-defined, which is not at all the case. We've seen this discussed in a few different settings. But from my perspective, related to the work in my thesis, along with Thesis along with Fabrice Baudois and Erlen Grong and Luca Rizzi, we take the perspective that we're working on a totally geodesic foliation, where the transversal distribution of the foliation is in fact this sub-Romanian geometry. In the direction of the foliation, then you can introduce some sort of parameter epsilon. So for every epsilon greater than zero, we have a Riemannian manifold, and all of this analysis that I just explained still works. That I just explained still works, and these ideas hold in the setting we'd like. The question becomes: can we make sense of the limit as epsilon goes to zero? Now, it's well understood that in an appropriate sense, these Laplacians converge to the horizontal Laplacian that you'd want in the subramanian setting, but there are other difficulties that are introduced. At this point, we do have a McKean Singer-type super trace. Do you have a McKean Singer type supertrace result that's been accomplished? And there are questions relating to how to actually interpret this as an invariant. This relates to ideas of what are called eta invariants that were studied in the 70s and 80s. But like I said, this is ongoing work. And I'll actually stop with that. Here's a few references that are specific. I also want to add to this Elton Sue's excellent book on Sue's excellent book on heat kernel methods as well. And thank you. Thank you for your time. Thanks, John Marco. Excellent talk. So let's see there are several questions. So maybe Hadrian, you can ask first. Hi, yeah, first of all.
