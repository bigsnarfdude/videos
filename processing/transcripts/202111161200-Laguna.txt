First of all, I want to thank the organizers, Michael in particular, for inviting us here. Fantastic place. Nice to be back in Oaxaca after seven years. All right, so yes, what I'm going to do is I'm going to talk about this system that is the mergers of a black hole with a neutron star. Of a black hole with a neutron star. And in particular, I'm gonna spend time about how the tidal deformations and the debris that comes out of the neutron star has an imprint in the gravitational waves. Now, I've seen that many of the talks here were on machine learning. I had to disclose that my knowledge on machine learning. There. There. This is as much as I know about machine learning. Okay, so then how do we remove the hopefully not all these when I answer the question? There we go. Okay. So, no, this was not, this is too far up. No. There we go. Okay, so this is the first slide. So let me just start by putting the now canonical plot of the graveyard of masses of black holes. Masses of black holes produced by the merger of two neutron stars, two black holes, or a black hole and a neutron star. And in this catalog, at this time, we had 55 detections. Most of them were binary black holes. There were two, so bad that it's a little dark to think. But there are two here that they are the neutron star mergers. And there are two that at that time there were still some question marks about. Time there were still some question marks about if there were binary neutron star mergers. But now, as we know, with the most recent catalog, which is amazing, we went now to 90 detection. So now we have entered the proper stage of gravitational wave physics or astrophysics driven by observations. And in this catalog, now we have up to 90 detections. Most of them still remain BBH. There were no new double neutron star detections, but now the number of mixed binaries increased to five, although there are this one here, I believe, and this one here, there is still question mark, but this seemed to be solid. Now, this is a little bit, we were having dinner yesterday talking about this. I remember in the years way before Layu was even completed, that I think the spectrum. I think the expectation was that there were more double neutron star mergers than even black holes. So I think this is a surprise. Another one, of course, is the masses of the black holes. I mean, it's also something unexpected. So this talk will be mostly about numerical relativity simulations, since it's motivated also the workshop by having a component in mathematics. A component in mathematics, so I'll show two slides a little bit dancing equations. Um, so, but before we do that, so let me just tell you what numerical relativity can do these days. Well, this was the first detection on our group by that time we were in Georgia Tech. We produced this animation. Notice that there are only very few orbits. These simulations are expensive. These simulations are expensive. These contour lines are the gravitational waves. The white spheres are the horizons, in this case, apparent horizons. And the stars in the background, of course, they were just for artistic purposes. So then this is the one that produced the first, what is called an intermediate mass black hole, intermediate mass according to gravitational wave research. To gravitational wave researchers. I mean, perhaps what astrophysicist is called intermediate are a little bit more massive than that, but that's okay. So, this is another simulation. Now, this was done by our postdoc, Deborah, and graduate student Babesha, I believe. Niguel was also involved, I think. And here again, it's another way to represent what the merger was. And that was still when we were. And oh, that was still when we were in Georgia Tech. Okay, finally, we have that when the first double neutron star detection, so is when the proper multi-messenger astrophysics was born, in my opinion, and others. Here are the three channels in which they were detected in the gravitational way. This is so beautiful. I mean, it's amazing that nature gave you so. It's amazing that nature gave you something that is just so clean and perfect. And of course, we had a talk in which there was a glitch here that was removed, but fortunately, it was in such a way that it was so clean, clearly that it was a glitch that we were left with the signal that it was clearly in spiral. And of course, here are two examples of the burst in the electromagnetic part of the Electromagnetic part of the messenger part of the multi-messenger that also tells us that the merger came together with electromagnetic emission. And here again, it's another simulation. On the left, you will see contours of the density of material, in this case, the two neutron stars. And here in the right, you will see gravitational waves. Of course, you don't see them there because in America relativity, the way that we Because in American relativity, the way that we do things of this, when we show these movies, is we show you just the part in which we solve the Einstein equations in a computer. And at this stage, the system is quiet. In the sense, you don't see the wave content that you will see when you show you the strain in which we match it to post-Newtonian. So, here again, you have very few orbits, even though. Even that this event had many, many orbits, hundreds of orbits in the LIGO part. In American relativity, we can only do a few. And the interesting thing is that this part, LIGO didn't see it. That was actually, if I not mistaken, that was outside. And there were questions about what happened at the end, if there was details about a hypermassive neutron star. Hypermassive neutron star and formation of a black hole. All right, so that's all for movies. Okay, so the purpose of the work that we did was the following. If you have a mixed binary system of a black hole and neutron star, and you characterize by a parameter Q the mass ratio of the system, in which I'm going to use the notation in which the mass of the black hole is in the numerator. Hole is in the numerator and the mass of the star in the denominator. So typically, these numbers will be larger than one. Okay, so you have the situation, this is wrong, this is as we approach one, okay, we're going to have the situation in which the mass of the black hole is small or is comparable to the mass of the neutron star. And as we will see, that is when tidal effects are the strongest. Effects are the strongest. And it's likely, not likely, you will see that the neutron star gets disrupted before the material gets swallowed by the black hole. So you will see snapshots like this in which you have the formation of kind of an accretion disk, and then the material is spiraling in into the black hole. And the opposite side, that is, when Q is larger, much larger than one. Much larger than one, probably it doesn't have to be much much larger, but one you have the situation in which the neutron star, as we will see, gets swallowed by the black hole almost entirely with very small effects in terms of what the tidal forces do to the neutron star. So, the system will behave close to what a BVH or a binary black hole system is. So, the question is, So, the question is: where is the boundary, or can we just study the transition from this state to the one in which is BBH-like, and then look at and see how LIGO and Virgo and others will be able to distinguish this case here that is very BBH-like. And that was the motivation for that. All right, so just to set the stage, okay. Okay, this is the parameters that we investigated. So, if you have a black hole and a star, you get the tidal forces along the line that joins the two objects. You have that will elongate the star this way. You also have forces in the north and south pole of the star, and what it will do is it will compress the star. And depending on the strength of that, you can, you know, strip material. You know, strip material from the neutron star or completely destroyed. So if you use the back of the envelope thing, there is a radius, okay, or a distance between the black hole and the star at which the forces, the tidal forces are strong enough to disrupt the star. And that is given by this expression. The only thing that you have to do is you take the difference of the force here and here and compare. Here and here, and compare that one with the binding force that binds the star. And you find what the distance is between here and the black hole at which the tidal forces overcome the self-gravity of the star. Now, you can then do a little bit of math in which you rewrite this expression, you divide by the mass of the black hole, no, sorry, for the total mass of the binary. The total mass of the binary, and then you can then rewrite this in this other form in which you have q. Remember, q is the mass ratio, the mass of the black hole divided by the mass of the star. And C is the compactness of the neutron star. And that is a parameter that one typically uses in investigating neutron stars, the compactness of the star. And so you get a sense, again, typical compactness of the one that we use because. Or the one that we use because it's a typical value used for neutron stars, is 0.15. So that's why we normalize with that. Okay. And then we pick mass ratios of two, three, and five. Remember, the closer you get to one, the more that you disrupt the star. The larger you get away from one is when the star gets swallowed by the black hole entirely. So if you use these three. So, if you use these three values here, okay, the three values here, what you get is that the tidal radius in units of the total mass of the binary are this, okay, are this, all right. So then the other radius that you need to calculate, the other length scale in the problem is the ISCO. And let's just assume that is the one given by a black hole that is not rotating. So, this is what you need to compare to see if these two quantities here, which one is larger. Is here, which one is larger? And then you will see that if ISCO, okay, is larger than the tidal radius, that means the star goes inside the black hole without being swallowed. If it's not, then it gets disrupted and then you form this inspiration. Okay, so let me just restate the goal. The goal of this problem, I mean, the study is to compare binary black holes with mixed binaries, okay? With mixed binaries, okay. And to see how that through the eyepiece or through the machinery of gravitational wave data analysis, how these differ or if they get very close to each other because the star doesn't get disrupted. A key ingredient there, as it happens with all these numerical simulations, is in order to compare apples with apples, a key ingredient is initial data. Ingredient is initial data. Okay. And not that much the what is interesting, and that's why we believe that the results on numerical relativity are robust, is not that much the form of the Einstein equations. I mean, we have now that we have these BSSN equations or we have the generalized harmonic that they're using. They give the same results if you put the same initial data. But even if you have the same equations like we had, that is the Same equations like we had, that is the PSSN equations in our code. If we want to do comparisons between these two systems, you have to have similar initial data. And one way to get similar initial data is to have similar methodologies. So this is where the math part of it comes. Now, before I do that, so just so you know how we set up things, the initial data for binary black holes. For binary black hole simulations, there are some parameters that we need to specify. The parameters are the masses of the black holes, the spins of the black holes, and I'm putting here just magnetus, but obviously it's orientation, the momentum of each of the black holes, the eccentricity, and the distance, roughly speaking. Not roughly, that's what it is. Now, where do we get this? Now, where do we get this? Well, we get this from post-Newtonian approximations. So, what we do is we go to a time in which the binary was widely separated. We pick the best approximation that we have from post-Newtonian, and then we evolve the system. This is time here. This is early spiral in the post-Newtonian regime. We evolve the system until we reach the point in which we say, okay, now. The point in which we say, okay, now numerical relativity can take over. Just to give you an idea, depending on which code you use, simulations lasting 15 orbits or the like, or 20 orbits, that's what currently we can do. That is something that we need to start thinking. If we go for third-generation detectors, we need to be able to do better than that. But just at 10 orbits, so something around here. Now, actually, it's even before. Around here, Maxwell, this even before that, okay. And at that point, we stop the post-Newtonian evolution. We read the parameters from post-Newtonian, mass, spin, momentum, essentially, if you want, and the separation. We fit them to the initial data, infrastructure, and numerical relativity, and then we take off. Okay, that's how we do it. All right. So, I'm not going to talk about the evolution, I'm going to tell you a little bit. Evolution: I'm going to tell you a little bit about the initial data, and that's the math part because that was actually the big part of this project was that. So, to set up the initial data, okay. In order to do that, let me start with electromagnetism. So, you know, if you understand this one, then you see the challenges that we have in GR. Let's say that you're going to solve Maxwell's equations, but instead of using the electric field and magnetic field, Field and magnetic field. Well, it doesn't matter if you use the one that is close to what we do is to use the electric field and the vector potential. But it doesn't matter if you use the magnetic field tool. There is one constraint here, okay? That you have to satisfy. That is that the electric field, given the charge distribution, has to satisfy this equation here. Okay? Gauss's law. Then the Then the problem is the following. You can freely specify A, there is no constraint associated with A. Okay, but the thing that the problem that you face is the following. This is just one equation, right? It's the divergence of a vector equal to a scalar. But E, okay, E has three components. So the question is, which of those three components is the one that is solved from this? That is solved from this, and which are the other two that are freely specifiable. So, as you probably did in your course of electromagnetism, the way to do it is the following. You decompose your electric field in a transverse part that is divergence-free and a longitudinal part that is the gradient of the scalar. If you put this here or here, okay, the gradient of t is zero by construction. Of t is zero by construction, and then you are ending up with this form of equation. But now you know how to solve. This is basically a Poisson equation. Everybody in the dog knows how to solve. Okay, so let's go to GR. If we write the Einstein equations in what is called a three plus one decomposition, you are going to find that is at the initial data or at every time any hypersurface, you have to. Any hypersurface, you have to satisfy these two equations. This is the Hamiltonian constraint, and this is the momentum constraint. Think about this as equivalent to this divergence of the electric field. Now, let's talk about these quantities here. So, this is a total energy density, total momentum. This K here is what is called extrinsic curvature. It's a way that Is a way that tells you how the hypersurface is embedded in the four-dimensional space-time. This gamma here, that you don't see it here, but it's in the Ricci scalar and in these derivatives here, that spatial metric is the one that tells you the intrinsic metric to these hypersurfaces. Okay, so the problem here, again, is this is a scalar equation, and this is also a vector. This is also a vector equation. You know, these indices run from one to three. So you have four equations: one here and three here. But here, and they are equations that fix these two things. But here, the metric, the spatial metric, is a three-dimensional tensor that is a three by three matrix. It's symmetric. So you have six quantities here, and you also have six here because it's also. Also, have six here because it's also symmetric. So, you have 12 quantities and you have also only four. So, you have the same situation that you have with electromagnetism. So, one way to deal this was Jim York, based on the work of Lichtnerovich, came up with a prescription. It's not the only prescription, but they came up with a prescription to be able to find out which of the pieces, which four quantities that you have. Which four quantities that you have there are obtained by solving these equations. That's what he did. And I'm not going to go into the details, but then he find out that you can go from this equation that looks complicated, there, Richie Tensor and blah, blah, blah, to one that looks also like the one we have for the electromagnetism. You know, just some if you eliminate this thing here and you set this to one, it's the same thing, okay? And you get another one. And you get another one here, okay, that is for the extrinsic curvature. Now, fortunately for black holes, the right-hand side of the equation is zero, right? This comes from the T mu nu, the stress-energy tensor. So this is zero. So the equation that we need to solve is this equal to zero and this is equal to zero. So we have to find just a transverse tensor, not vertical. You solve it from here, plug it. You solve it from here, plug it here, solve this equation, and you're done. Okay, one of the assumptions that Jamie York did was they assume that the space was conformally flat. So the metric is just one factor. The four is for convenience because it eliminates a bunch of fours everywhere. And it's just a factor times the flat metric. And then he did other things for that. Anyway, so this data. Anyway, so this data is conformally flat. Okay, conformally flat. So, and that will come back in a second. Okay, so then Jim Jorgen, I think it was his student at that time, came up with a solution to this equation that is just one that is the divergence of a tensor that needs to be zero. And they found it. One of them, okay. One of them, okay, represents an object, an extrinsic curvature, that has linear momentum, and the other one that has angular momentum. So if you put these solutions, and those are solutions for point particles, point particles, okay? If you put this into this equation here, you get what is called the Boyne and York puncture data. It's called puncture because it's. Puncture because it's you have a point particle and there are infinites there. So it's just everything is regular except at that point. And then you have here that there are evolutions of puncture black holes and so on. Okay. Here again, the space is conformally flat. Conformally flat. Now, why is it that that is an issue? Well, Swartzhill, you can go and rewrite. Can go and rewrite inisotropic coordinates, and that metric is conformally flat. But Swarti is a black hole that is not rotating. If you grab a rotating black hole, care, okay, although there is no, as far as I know, theorem that has been proved, there is known that care cannot be brought into a space that is conformally flat. So, in order So, in order to do that, in order to do that, when you put this solution for a single puncture that has angular momentum, forget about you have an object that can be used to represent a rotating black hole. But it has more than that. Why? Because you need to make the circle. In order to make the space conformally flat, you have to add energy to it. And you add energy in the form of gravitational waves. Of gravitational waves, and that's what you have probably here, or I'm telling you now, that is called junk radiation. You add energy in gravitational waves, okay, or just to be able to make the space conformally flat, and you still have the black hole. And there are many studies and simulations of spinning puncture in which you start the simulation, you see the junk radiation, and you evolve into. And you evolve into a terrible black hole. Okay, once the radiation is ejected. Okay, so now the results. Okay, so what we did is we consider simulations of binary black holes and mixed binaries. We consider, as I say before, three cases, cases with Q2, three, and five. And here are the BBH. Here are the VVH and the mixed binaries. This is the total energy in the system. So now you can see that the energy initially at the system is comparable. Okay. So at least we're doing apples with apples in that regard. In terms of the total angular momentum, in this case, it's orbital angular momentum and so on, is by construction. I'm not going to go into details, but by construction is identical. Now, once we start the evolution, we can measure the eccentricity. The eccentricities vary a little bit. I mean, this one is close, this one is one that we don't understand was the largest, but this one is close. So it's not that bad. Okay. All right. So here are the six simulations. The ones in dash are the black holes. The ones in solid lines are the mixed binaries. And we're plotting here is a separation. This is a quarter separation, which is not. Coordinate separation, which is not a quantity that is gauge invariant, but so what versus time. So all of them started at a coordinate separation of nine. The red ones are Q5, the blue ones are Q3, and the black ones are Q2. So one thing to, oh, and these dots here, in the solid ones, which are the ones that had a neutron star, are the separation. Are the separations at which the star enters the tidal radius that we discussed before? So, things to notice here. This oscillations is due to imperfections in the initial data that has some eccentricity. If you don't have eccentricity or so, it will be a very smooth, you know, quasi-quasi-circular decay. But these are imperfections, okay? Both the PBH and the mixed binary, both. And the mixed binary both have them. Now, one thing to notice here is that the solid lines, and remember, merger means that they go to zero because the black holes are coming together. So you can see here that the neutron star, the mixed binary cases, they come together more rapidly and they merge earlier. That's one thing to keep in mind. That's one thing to keep in mind. The other thing is that initially you can see that for large Q, Q5, the two, the dashed line and the solid lines, trace, follow each other better than in the other cases. So here, these two objects are behaving more close to each other, which is consistent with what we know. Large cues are more BVH-like. Okay? So, all right. So, all right. Now, here are just a snapshot. Q equals 2. Okay, you can see that here is a neutron star. It's already starting to get disrupted. And then you have this in spiral structure, something that looks like an accretion disk. And that's it. So the star gets completely disrupted before the material gets swallowed by the black hole. Okay, now this is three, and it's a little better, you know. Little better, you know, at least you don't get that spiral arm thing. It's a little better, but Q equals five is the one in which this is very, very close already. And you see, it's being swallowed at that, it's at the time in which it's been swallowed that the star gets disrupted. And if you were to go higher than five, it will be even even more extreme. Okay, all right, so here are So, here are the results in connection with the final black hole. All right, here again is the cues. Remember, we have three sets of pairs. I mean, three pairs. And here again, this is the mass of the black hole. Okay, initially it's the same. The mass of the star, initially, is the same. This is the mass of the final black hole. So now let's just think a little bit about it. Okay. Think a little bit about it. Okay. So, if you have that for large Q, the mixed binary system is close to the BBH system, the final masses are close to each other. Here, they are also close. But look at this one here, is where you have a little bit more of a difference. Forget about this, it's another way to measure the final mass. This is the MR. This is the Mr is the remnant mass, is how much mass is left outside the black hole. So for the one q equal two in which the star disrupted, you get quite a few, you know, quite a bit of material outside, q equals three, not as much, and the q equals five is when you get the least material outside. So it's consistent with that picture. This is the final spin of the black hole. Okay, final spin of the black hole. The final spin of the black hole. For the q5, that the two systems look close to each other, the final spin is not too far from each other. It gets a little larger in q equals 3. And in this one, there is a significant difference. And I'll come back to this playing why, in particular, why the spin of the final black hole in the mixed binary is larger than in the BVH. I'll come back to that. BVH. I'll come back to that. In terms of radiation, the same thing. Okay, you get that the system that behaves more like a BVH radiates more. And this one, they don't radiate as much. Here you go. Why? Because if you have a star that is a neutron star that is a compact object and you destroy it and you create mostly a cloud, then that damps the gravitational radiation that you can, you know, if you have a cloud. Can you know if you have a cloud around a black ball, it doesn't do much, okay? All right, then I have a few more plots. Let's just put it in terms of plots. Here again, the final mass as a function of time. Solid lines are the mixed binaries. So, and then the dashed lines are the BVH. The reason that you have here the BVH. The reason that you have here the BVH all the way through is just for reference. Okay, time t equals zero is when the objects merge. So you can see that for q2, when that disrupts, the black ball starts accreting mass, but it doesn't reach the level of the BVH. Why? Because there is material that is left behind. But as you increase Q, then you get closer. Then you get closer and closer to what the final mass of the BVH is. The spins is kind of the opposite of this. The spins, the Q equals 5 immediately goes and match each other, so to speak. But the Q equals 2, which is the one in which the star disrupts, the black hole gets more spin. Why? Because how the material is being attributed. Because how the material is being accreted, it has a lot of angular momentum left in that accretion disk, and it's being accreted, and that's why it overshoots the BVH. So you get a high spin, higher spin black hole with a neutral star that disrupts. In terms of kicks, it's the opposite. Here, the kicks of the binary black holes are much larger than the kicks of the neutron star. Here, again, especially. Here again, especially if you go to the q equals two and three, in which the star gets disrupted, so the kicks as a result of asymmetric gravitational wave emission. And if you have an object that doesn't give you the right quadruple moment to emit the gravitational waves, of course, that damps things. Okay, quasi-normal modes. What we have here now, I separate. Here now, I separated the cases. Okay, this is q equal to 2, 3, and 5. Okay, for each plot, we only plot the mixed binary system. So, because for the other one, you know, you get clean quasi-normal ringing of the final black hole when you do DVH. And we heard yesterday a talk by Lorena about quasi-normal modes. If you have a clean mode, If you have a clean mode, in principle, you should be able to see exponential decay. We don't see it here. We see it for the Q equals 5, in which the system behaves more like a binary black hole. These oscillations, we believe, forget this, this is a noise that we should just plot it here. I mean, this is too low for the accuracy that we have. But here, this oscillation here, part of it, okay, is we. Okay, is uh, we believe it's this mode mixing that Lorena was talking about, okay. So, we didn't do any of this cleaning, but look at these cases here. In particular, this the q equal to, there is, you cannot talk about proper quasinormal ringing. And the reason for that is that you have quasinormal ringing is a black hole that is almost, almost quiet, and you have small perturbations that are damping. Small perturbations that are damping. The black hole for q equals 2, it never gets there. Why? Because it's growing. If you remember this thing here, here is the growth. You see, the black hole keeps growing and growing and growing through the most part of the simulation. So you never have the situation of a black hole almost final with perturbations that are damping. That's why you don't get the question over. That's why you don't get the question over any. So, that to me could be: if you don't have the luxury of having many orbits before merger, this could be one way to discriminate between a PBH and a mixed binary, in which you just don't see the quasi-normal ring. Okay, that could be a way. Okay, gravitational waves, all right? All right, so these are the two two modes, just psi four. We didn't bother putting the strain in this, but this blip here is the junk tradition that I was talking about. And that one, when you have these hybrid waveforms that you go and stitch post-Newtonian with numerical relativity, you don't see this because the matching we do it here. Yes, because the matching we do it here precisely to get rid of that junk radiation. But I just put it there because you know, so you know the connection that I was making with initial data. So now look at this thing. This is a snapshot of what happens early on. Okay, this is Q2 and this is Q, no, Q2 and Q5. So notice here that very early on, and here again, the sum. And here again, the solid line is a mixed binary, and the dashed line is the black hole. So, early on, you can already see that the amplitude, the amplitude of the mixed binary is larger. It's radiating more early on. And since it's radiating more, it's approaching each other faster. That's consistent with the first plot that I put. So early on, you have. So, early on, you have that if you were to calculate the luminosity, okay, okay, early on, the mixed binary is higher than the BBH. But then, once that the star disrupts, it's the opposite. Now, in this part, you can see that the amplitude of the waveform is much smaller than the BVH. And not only that, here is where it merges. Okay, and where it merges and And when it emerges, and it's early. And you don't see the cycles of quasi-normal ringing that you see in the VVAs here. On the other hand, here, okay, if you were just to stretch it a little bit, they look very close. This is the Q equals 5. They follow each other, but and the luminosity or the way that energy is radiated per unit per unit. Unit per yeah, for unit time, okay, is very close to each other. If you were to do a q equals six or even seven, these two things will be almost on top of each other. Okay, let me skip this. All right, now angular momentum radiated. That's the thing that makes the binary get more bound and eventually collapse. So here is the angular momentum radiated. The angular momentum radiated. This is the difference between the initial angular momentum and the one emitted by gravitational waves. So you can see here that Q2, okay, Q2 is a difference. Q2 is emitted faster than the binary black hole. But as you get close to Q5, things get closer to each other. Not only that, they That not only that, the final amount, okay, gets all together with the one of the BBH. The difference here, the difference between this and the reason for this difference is because there is still angular momentum in the material that is left outside of the black hole. Now, why is it that the case of a neutron star radiates more? Star radiates more angular momentum. Well, we can go to post-Newtonian to get clues about that. If you look at the expression on Posnonian about how energy is radiated, this is the symmetron is a mass ratio, and this is new is some. But anyway, it's a combination of masses. But there is a term here. There is a term here that is a title deformability. And that actually was. For a mobility. And that actually was important in the double neutron star detection. But look how it scales with one over r to the q. So as r gets smaller, this term gets bigger. And if these terms get bigger, then you have here that is minus, then it takes more energy out of the system. So that means that the things will merge faster. To merge faster. All right, finally, as I say, one of the motivations is to see how LIGO and future detectors will distinguish these two. We did just a very naive thing. We calculated these matches. Okay, so this is a match. This match is one minus a match. And we did it for two detectors, LIGO and the Einstein telescope. Here are the three cues that we use. Three cues that we use. Okay. And what we did is we did a mismatch between the BBH waveform and the mixed binary waveform. And what we found is that, and for three inclinations, for three inclinations. So you can see here that the mismatch for q equals five is smaller in all the cases. But with the inclination, things get a little more interesting here. Things get a little more interesting here that in that sense. So, this will be an interesting thing to and for instance, here, if you go pi over three, I mean, you can you can get a reasonably large mismatch between the two. So, that is when these higher volts will enter into the picture that we saw. So, just to end, okay, so tidal effects on the debris, we believe will have a profound. We believe it will have a profound impact. Okay, first of all, early in the merger, in terms of how rapidly things evolve, and the final black holes, this will be particularly important for systems with low Q, that is for more comparable mass Q. So our work, the key of that is that we develop a initial data method that closely mimics the one for BVH. The one for BBH, and that way we didn't have to have the headaches of comparing apples with bananas. And I didn't go into the details, but it's very easy to implement. However, it has, you pay the price. There is no free lunch. You will still have the junk radiation. That is okay because we have junk radiation with BPH and we have learned how to live with it. But perhaps the most severe thing is that we assume. That we assume the method assumes that the star is spherically symmetric, which is not. The neutron star is, you know, you have to have the deformations of being in the presence of the black hole, and even if it's rotating and so on. And that has an experience effect that produces some oscillations in the star. It triggers the natural frequencies of oscillation of a neutron star get triggered. Now, fortunately, Get triggered now. Fortunately, those frequencies are outside the inspiral frequency, so you will, you know, you still get a good, a good sense of what's going on during the spiral. We want to extend this. We're currently working in using other equations of state. We're going to compare with the Lorraine method of producing initial data, and we want to expand our Or our methodology to use non-spherical sources. And with that, I'll take some questions. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Pablo. Any questions? Yep. So one place I got a little confused was the Q equals to 2Ks. The final black hole has more spin if it is a. More spin if it is a mixed binary, right? That means that if it was a BBH, then more gravitational wave, more angular momentum must have been radiated away. But in your last plot about this discussion, you showed that the NSPH gets more radiation. This is different. Remember, what I'm plotting is the initial angular method minus the one emitted in gravitational waves. So you are right. If the one emitted in the gravitational wave, Right. If the one emitted in the gravitational waves, okay, it's larger, then the difference is smaller. Oh, okay. All right. Yeah. You just like plot the difference. There is a question that probably is the same as mine. So I'd like. Okay, let's see. Go ahead. Go ahead, Dip. Hi, that was a great talk. I was wondering that for these simulations, That for these simulations, when you take a mass and convert it to the compactness, I'm assuming that you are fixing. Can hear you? How about now? Are you there? Yep, can you hear me? Can you hear me? I can hear you from here. Okay. All right. I think online, folks online say that they can hear me. Maybe it's an issue with the host computer. Try to speak. We can hear him. Do you want me to unplug it so you can? He's audible online. He's a bit chat or yep. And I can keep talking. That's okay. I'll just type my chart. Go ahead. Okay, perfect. Yeah, so I was wondering that for these simulations, you probably are fixing the equation of state when you do these simulations. And I'm wondering that changing. How much does it affect these results? Repeat the question, Deep, please. So I'm assuming that when you do these simulations, do you fix an equation of state? I'm assuming so because you take the masses and convert it to a compactness. Or could you give me some of the details? And if you change the equation of state, what is the impact? Yeah, that's precisely what we. Yeah, that's precisely what we're doing right now. We're doing two things. We are keeping the same equation of state, which is just a simple polytropic equation of state, and varying the compactness. Okay, so that is one thing, because if you had too many knobs moving at the same time, then we just couldn't get the clear picture. So we say, okay, let's just stay with polytropic and move the compactness. And as you can imagine, as the Can imagine as the star gets more compact, if we increase the compactness, even the q equals 2 will not disrupt as much and to be able to then get closer to the. So that is one thing. And also the kicks will go up, okay? But the equation states something that we want to do next, but we haven't done. But I'm sure that it will have an effect. I mean, anything, the game here is the following. Game here is the following. Anything that has an effect on the disruption of the neutron star will have obviously an imprint here. So if you disrupt it earlier, then you will get to the cases that I was telling you. If you manage to get an equation of state and a compactness, so to speak, in which you get it more like a BBH, then things will be more difficult to distinguish. Then things will be more difficult to distinguish. But that's the game. But yeah, that's the natural way to do it. Okay. Thank you. I see. Yeah. And so when you say that you're fixing the mass and then you're changing the compactness, is it the polytropic indexes that you are sort of sweeping over? I'm wondering because, you know, in my mind, I'm thinking there's a one-one mapping between. I'm thinking that's a one-one mapping between the mass and the compactness if you're a pure state, that is. Yeah, no, I mean, what you can, you let's see, either you do, you change the mass, I mean, you keep the mass fixed and then you change things in such a way that the radius changes, right? Which is the compactness too. And for that one, we just change, remind me, Miguel, we change the adiabatic constant, right? The adiabatic constant, right? Yeah, we keep the same polytropic index, but we change the adiabatic constant to get different mass to ratio cases. I see. Okay. Thank you. Any other question? You show three cases, like three cues, different cues. Can you find some general relations to extend that? Extend that. So, you know, Sean Deep and I would like very much to be able to predict if there is some matter remaining outside based on, you know, masses and spins. Yeah, well, like my particle physicist tell me, we have three points, right? Like my particle physicist tells me you can always feed the straight line through three points if you make the line. Points if you make the line thick enough, right? Yeah, and uh, so yeah, you should, yeah, so yeah, no, we need to do more cases because there must be some scaling. You're right, it's it must be some scaling, especially because if you only change if you only change the queue and keep everything there, I think there should be a smooth behavior. The behavior that looked like from the front, yeah. So, yeah, that would be. Let's see, Miguel, we for the key work that we're doing, we added what Q equals four we have now and what Q equals four, six, seven, and eight. Yeah, so we have those. So, what we can do is plot the quantities of interest, for instance, you know, how much mass is left out or the spins and something, because yeah, with. The spins and something, because yeah, with that, you know, with that many, we can do things like that. The thing is that the only one that we have done plots like that is for the kicks, and we still don't understand why there is some bump that we're getting, right, Miguel? Or did we clean that one already or not? Yes, we clean it or yes, still there. We still have some problems. Yeah, we still with the kicks, okay? But the kick also had, I mean, when I show the kicks and they're not. I mean, when I show the cases, they're not as monotonic as one would expect as a function of Q. Okay, but maybe the final spin, the final mass, or the final material that outside will be, that will be a little bit interesting. And does it become very competitionally expensive to include initial spin of the black hole? Because that would change. initial spin of the black hole because that would change the it would not so that's the nice thing about uh using this point and york and this method i mean even to add spin to the to the neutron star is it's trivial it's trivial because uh you then you can have a q equals to three maybe and even five uh you might have tidal disruptions right that's right because the the black holes more right yeah I think I didn't get why the young radiation takes place before the match between the post-Newtonian and the numerical relativity. You didn't get what? Why? The young radiation takes place before the post-Newtonian match with the numerical relativity. You have a waveform that is not clean. Okay? So, and that was actually a big surprise in American relativity, at least to me, that people thought, gee, I mean, we're dealing with really imperfect data, okay, conformal flatness and so on. The only information that we put there is those numbers from post-Newtonian. Okay, so the nice thing, the nice thing. The nice thing about this is that, and we wrote a paper about it, is that most of this junk radiation is confined in the vicinity of the black holes. Because that's where you need to do, that's where you need to make the space conformally flat so you can put a rotating black hole. If you go far away from a rotating black hole, the terms because what is it? One, what is the cross-term of? One, what is the cross term of a care black hole? I forgot, is it one over R or whatever that thing is? They go away, and then you end up far away, it almost looks like a non-rotating black hole. So that means that this junk radiation will be throttled by the black holes. It will change a little bit the mass, but by the changes, LIGO doesn't see them right now. When we go to the third generation, it's something that we're... Got to the third generation, it's something that we need to worry. That when we do the stitching, because what we're going to do is we're going to cut away from here, you eliminate that, and then you're going to bring the post-Newtonian form here. Okay. But the problem is that if you use the parameters from post-Newtonian that you use for the initial data that created this flip here, and then the John radiation changes the mass of the black hole and the spins, then you are doing a match. Then you're doing a match, a mismatch. The positonian doesn't agree with this, and that's something to worry about, okay? But not for what LIGO's accuracy right now. It will happen maybe in five years or so. Yeah, but because we thought that that jungle addition was everywhere, then remember, if you have a computational domain that is, let's say, 600. Is let's say 600 m at the speed of light, it will take 600 for radiation to go away, right? So that means, look at here, this is beginning to see. So that means that here we will still see the effects of John radiation. But we were so lucky that it's mostly there, gets into the black hole, doesn't change it much, and that's it. Yeah. Yep, yeah, yeah. Thanks. I really enjoyed the talk. I was wondering about the kick of the final black hole, whether this is something you can actually measure with the gravitational waveform. Okay, so that is another kind of warmth, and that applies also for the VBH. I mean, right now, if you have, let's just say. If you have, let's just say that forget about the mixed one, if you have this one here, okay, uh, and if you know the inspiral, and then you do parameter estimation that gives you what the binary system is, then you can go to these phenomenological formulas that people have done, these fittings, and from that one you can compute the kick. That's one way of doing it. The other one, you can do it if you have a clean part. A clean part of the merger, then you can look directly with a waveforms. But that's, I think, right now not as likely. Okay. But we had a talk by Juan Calderon Mustillio just last week in Austin. And he was telling us that what will be the SNR that you will need here to be able to get the most. To be able to get the modes and then and then get the keys. Thanks. To model this accretion disk, you use something like general relativistic hydrodynamics, right? My question is, how crazy would it be to use something like a collision that is approximation of this? That is an approximation of this accretion disk or well you still have that I mean you still have that the temperature is important there okay and so I think that it's it just becomes the case of a kind of a standard WIMPy accretion disk. So I think you will still need to have the pressure effects mostly that it gives you when you do with the gas. But on the other hand, on the other hand, I mean, you can try it. I tried with another project I did for many, many years, which is titled Disruptions of Star by Supermassive Black Holes. In that case, you had supermassive black hole and star like the Sun. Black hole and start like the sun. And again, it gets disrupted, and you have an increase. And I did that. I did the case because I was using what is called smooth particle hydrodynamics that are just basically particles. So I turn off the pressure. And especially if you get to the debris that goes away, you know, passes by the black hole and gets ejected, then because the gas is expanding, the pressure is dropping. The pressure is dropping, then the collisionless particles were a very good approximation to the gas. Now, the price that you pay is that one of the nice things about the ejected debris in that problem is the interaction with the interstellar medium. And if you don't have a gas, you cannot get the shocks that will generate the signal. So I have a silly question and probably I misunderstood, but you said that in the puncture uh formalism, the right-hand side of the Lichnerowitz York equations are zero, but you have matter here. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So all our work, okay. Well, now you open, we need to go, I have a servesa, right? That's right. Okay, but let me just show you. Let me just show you something more. Okay, so here it goes. Uh, where oh, here you go, okay. So, this is the same equations that I wrote, but you put the right-hand side not different from zero. Ah, there, okay. And that way, and then I use that for the neutrons, but I didn't show this because just too many indices. Okay, yeah, but that was it. That was our work, basically. And the thing is that if you And the thing is that if you set z to zero and q to one, that is a case of a black hole. So it was just another. Okay. We didn't do this. We implemented it. It was a point and yoga. Yeah. Yeah. But one of the things, one of the plots that I didn't show, what I kept that I just went very quickly is this one about the luminosity. Is this one about the luminosity? These are very early on, and these are the oscillations that I told you about that are imperfection in the initial data. It's just like you kick the start, and the start is going to be oscillating with, this is the F mode, right? Of a neutron star. So that's. But the F mode is much higher in frequency, so you don't see it. See it. I mean, Lago could not see it. Well, maybe the future one. Any other question? No? Let's thank Pablo for this fantastic talk. Thank you. And I think it's time for the lunch. So see you.
