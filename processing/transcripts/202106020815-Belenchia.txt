Objects and the quantization of gravity. Take it away. Thank you very much. And first of all, well, good morning or good afternoon or good evening to everybody, depending which part of the world you are. I hope that everything is fine everywhere you are. And first of all, I would like to thank the organizers of this workshop for inviting me today to speak here and also for organizing this workshop during these difficult times. Times. And as Alex said, we speak about a project that we did around 2018 and 2019. And before starting and digging into the topic, I would like to, well, first of all, I would like to be able to move my slides. Okay, that's good. I would like to give you the references that these two works, the Physical Releta 2018 and this essay for the Gravity Research Foundation 2019. SH Foundation in 2019 and acknowledge the other actors that made these two projects possible that are from the left Robert Wold, Flaminia, Giacominia, it is here as one of the organizers, Steven Kastorowitz that spoke yesterday at this workshop, and then Chasla Bruckner and Marcus Aspermayer that they will both speak tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, respectively. So, having done this, let me start by trying to give By trying to give some context of what we have done, some motivation for what we have done. And usually, I like to do it in a sort of an incomplete historical perspective. Some of the stuff that I will say, you have already heard already on Monday and before with Sugato and Anupa. So I will go kind of fast here. But the whole story starts with the question of Feynman that we can trace back, let's say, to the 50s. Trace back, let's say, to the 50s or to the Chapendill conference. And the question is: is it possible that gravity is not quantized while the rest of the world is? So here is the first milestone. And this is the start of this kind of tortuous way towards an answer to this question that we still don't have. At least we still don't have any kind of empirical evidence for either the positive or the negative answer. And now And now, here I would like to place some milestones around this tortoise way. Again, this will be a completely incomplete account of them, just to give an idea a bit how the story proceeded. And let me say that this was not the main focus of the quantum gravity community, which had another focus. But this kind of problem, as you have seen in the first, in the previous two talks, are starting to become more and more interesting. More and more interesting, also given the technological possibility that we are starting to have right now with quantum control and quantum system. So, here are some milestones are for sure the page and Gary Kerr paper in the 80s in which they essentially introduce, lay down what will be the setup of many proposals in the 2000 to test a specific aspect of this problem that is to discriminate between To discriminate between what it would be somehow the extension of the linear superposition principle of quantum mechanics to the case of the gravitational field generated by quantum objects in a spatial superposition and discriminate these from what is known as semi-classical gravity, that is where the Einstein equations are sourced by the expectation value of the stress of the quantum matter stress energy tensor as understood. As understood as an effective theory. Then, going on, there are works in the 90s by Roger Perus and also Laius Dioshi, in which they consider, well, these are theoretical works in which they consider gravity as the possible source of the collapse of the wave function in quantum mechanics. So, somehow the solution of the measure and problem of quantum mechanics. And going towards the 2000s, And going towards the 2000s, we start to see a kind of proposal using quantum system to essentially perform the Pagen Gallica experiment with the modern technologies. There is this proposal by Perens and collaborators using Bose-Einstein condensate. Then there are proposals by Anostopoulos and Du and the Carless and collaborator using optomechanical systems. And always with the 2000, we start to see also something that Sugato was pointing. Sugato was pointing out before, we start to see that this problem, this kind of Feynman question, starts to be tackled using quantum information tools. And finally, we arrive here in 2017 with these two papers that are the first one, the one that Sugato was telling us about before, and the other one, the twin paper by Marlette and Bedral, in which there is a sort of these are sort of game changers in the sense that. Sort of game changer in the sense that here we go from the setup of Page and Gallicare to what Sugato has explained to us. So, to look for gravitational induced entanglement as an empirical evidence of the quantum nature of gravity. After that, there have been many, many works in the last three, four years. Just to show you here, there are some of them, and that some of them are even two, three weeks old. They are even two, three weeks old. So this field is incredibly active at the moment. And now I will somehow, yeah, there are a lot of them. I will somehow zoom into this one, into the proposal of Sugato and collaborators again very fast, because these will give me the incipient, the motivation for what we have done. So, as Sugato said, the idea is to use MB centers, essentially two particles. Essentially, two particles that go through two different Stenengel-Lach interferometers. And the claim is that if, at the very end of the story, if we are able to be sure that the only relevant interaction here is the gravitational interaction, and if we are able to witness the creation of entanglement in this experiment, then we can claim that gravity has to be quantum somehow in some sense. Now, if I have to play the devil. If I have to play the devil advocate, there have been criticism to this paper that, again, Sugato and Anupam already discussed somehow. And the main criticism was that essentially what you need to generate entanglement here is just the Schrodinger equation with the Newtonian potential. And the Newtonian potential in the weak field limit of general relativity is the solution of a constraint equation. So it's essentially not a dynamical degree of freedom and is enslaved to mass. Is enslaved to matter. So essentially, if you see entanglement, you will just see features of the quantum matter that you are using. Now, this was the initial motivation for our work. So what I will discuss right now is in some sense a complemental argument to the one that Sugato and Danupam already gave in answering to this criticism. So is, again, an answer. Is again an answer to these criticisms from a different point of view. And in particular, what I will show you is that we can actually argue that gravity ought to be quantum in a specific sense that I will specify if we assume non-physics to hold. And this argument, you will see that is as general as the assumption that I is basis, so the non-physical assumption that I will use. However, the last word. However, the last word on this matter is left, of course, to experiment. Physics is empirical science. We need empirical evidence to conclude that gravity has to be quantum or not. So the take-home message at the very end is that a consistent picture of entanglement of massive objects through gravity necessarily requires gravity to be quantum. Again, you will see that it's not a Nogo theorem, necessarily, maybe it's a bit strong here, but the crucial part is. Uh, but the crucial part is a consistent picture. Uh, now let me start to dig a little bit into the detail, and I will start with what I like to call a spherical cow. That is, I will show you a Gedank experiment. I will use a Gedank experiment and what follows, which is pretty much different from what Sugato was discussing, which was actually a proposal for a real experiment. And the Geranka experiment that I will use. The Geranka experiment that I will use was originally introduced by Department of Jovanette Mari in 2016 and in a slightly different fashion some years before by Baim and Ozawa. And the setup is kind of simple. We have Alice and Bob. Alice is blue and Bob is green. And they both have their own particle. Ellis particle is initially preparing a superposition of being on the left or on the right. And Bob particle is initially trapped and is in. Is initially trapped and is in the ground state of an harmonic trap. Now, the initial state as described by standard quantum mechanics is this one, where, as you can see, I'm also giving a spin degree of freedom to Alice, just to mimic what Sugato was discussing before. Now, here, if we use the Schrodinger equation, we know that in the moment in which Bob opens the trap, his particle will fall through different slopes. Different slopes, and essentially the state will evolve in this way. And this state here will be, in general, an entangled state between Alice and Bob particle. Now, the Geranka experiment is the following, is a guess what game. And the game is the following. At time t0, we have Alice in a superposition on left or right, and Bob in its trap. Now, at this point, Alice starts to recombine the path of her particles. Recombine the path of our particles. So start to send the particle into one of the stenogallic apparatuses. And after a time that I will call TA, let me put it here. After a time TA, Alice will look at the interference pattern. Here, I put in really interference pattern. Actually, in the experiment with spin, she will look at the coherent property of the spin state. At the same time, it is equal to zero, Bob decides what to do. Bob decides what to do, if to open the trap or not. Now, let's see where the problem is. You can probably already guess from the figure where the problem is, but let's see it explicitly. So, let's imagine that Bob doesn't open the trap. The state is a separable state. When Alice performs the experiment, we expect that Alice will see the interference pattern. However, if Bob opens the trap and we use the Schrodinger equation with the Newtonian potential as before, With the Newtonian potential, as before, we know that the two particles can get entangled. And so that when we trace out Bob, we expect Alice to lose some of the interferometric visibility. In the extreme case, to just not get any more of the interference picture. But this is already a problem. This is superluminal signaling if it happens in a time TA and TB that are less than the light crossing time. Because in this case, Ellis could. Because in this case, Alice could, by looking at the experience pattern, she could say what Bob have done, even if they are space like separated. So, this would be a problem with causality. Now, you could already stop me and object that I'm using the Schrodinger equation with your Newtonian potential in a case in which relativistic causality is relevant. And this is actually true, but it's not the source of the problem. Indeed, let me assume that causality is sacred. I cannot touch causality. I cannot touch causality. So, whatever Bob does now, I assume that Alice will always see the interference pattern because whatever Bob does here, if Bob opens the trap, cannot influence Alice if they are space-like related. Now, Alice has the interference pattern, but on the other hand, if Bob releases the trap, his state will evolve and Bob will acquire which path information. So, in this case, we have a problem with. So, in this case, we have a problem with complementary quantum mechanics. We have witch path information here and the full interference pattern there. So, we are left with a situation that is akin to this very famous riddle of a man that has to take on the other side of a river a cabbage, a goat, and a wolf, and he can take just only one each time. And in this case, the cabbage is causality. If we take causality with us, we have to give up complementality. To give up complementarity, that is the goat, and the other way around. If we take complementarity, we will have to give up causality. Now, what I will show you in the second part of my talk is that what I'm describing here as a sort of a paradox is actually not. The solution to this paradox is somehow trivial and it rests on the fact that we are not considering the gravitational field that is the mediator of the international. Field that is the mediator of the interaction between the two, and in particular, we are not considering the quantum properties of its dynamical degrees of freedom. So let's see how this happened. And the other is great and gravitational case, because usually I do this starting from the electromagnetic case, because for the electronic case, nobody complains usually. But in this case, I will start directly with the gravitational case, and I will point out the little differences with the electromagnetic. Little differences with the electromagnetic one. So the two quantum ingredients that I will need to have a consistent picture here, and you will see the balance between the two, are quantum vacuum fluctuations and quantized gravitational radiation. So let me start with the first. Why I need quantum vacuum fluctuation. Well, quantum vacuum fluctuations are important for the Bob side of the story. Quantum vacuum fluctuation indeed give us a limit on mass localization due to the fluctuation of the local Due to the fluctuation of the local gravitational field. This can be seen in the following way. Actually, this can be obtained in many different ways. The final result is that the localization limit is the Plant length, so it's not particularly surprising. However, the way that I'm going to discuss it now briefly can also be applied to the case of the electromagnetic field and gives also there a localization for charges. And the argument is the following: consider two particles in a spacetime region of linear dimension. In a spacetime region of linear dimension R, and I'm considered two particles because the position of a single particle in general relativity is meaningless. And these two particles will be at a certain relative distance. Now, the local fluctuation of the Riemann tensor are given as an order of estimate by this relation here, that is the Planck length over the size of the space-time region cube. And these you can see just by looking at essentially. See it just by looking at essentially the coincidence limit of the two-point correlator of the metric of the metric perturbations. And if you insert these fluctuations inside of the geodesic deviation equation, you integrate it, you will see that essentially there is an uncertainty in the relative position of the two particles that is at the Planck scale. So we can interpret it as being a localization limit of a single particle that is at the Planck scale. That is at the plank length. And these are using the following way. In order for Bob to acquire significant witch path information on Alice, I have to require that the separation in Bob's state after Bob released the particle from the trap is at least greater than the localization limit. Because otherwise, Bob cannot tell that what he's looking at is an effect of Alice being in superposition. Of Ellis being in superposition far away, or just of the local quantum fluctuation of the field. Now, to conclude, here, I need to compute this delta x for Bob. In order to do an estimate of this delta x, I can do the following trick. And bear in mind that this is perfectly fine with electromagnetism, but I will show you that it's not fine for gravity. So, the trick to do the estimate will be the following: consider above particle, consider the force. Bob particle, consider the force that is acting on Bob due to Alice being on the left or on the right. And then you just take the difference, you solve the second law of Newtonian dynamics, and you get this result for delta x. Now, here, what it appears here, what I'm calling this DA gravity, is just the product between the mass of Alice and the separation between the light and red state of Alice. Now, as I say, this would be equivalent to the case of To the case of Coulomb interaction, in which you will have this QA times D. But in the case of gravity, this result is wrong. Indeed, if you go on with using this result, you will not solve the paradox. And this result is wrong because in gravity, we have to remember that we have to conserve the position of the center of mass, meaning that whenever Alice is going to create the superposition, there will be a back action also in her laboratory. Be a back action also in our laboratory. So, essentially, also the air laboratory will go in a superposition. And now we have to consider this system and its action on both particle. Again, like before, we consider the differences of the forces and we solve the second law of Newtonian dynamics. And it's easy to see that no matter what, what I was calling DA gravity, that is essentially the gravitational dipole of this system of masses, considering all of them as real, even if they are. As real, even if they are not, is just a mathematical artifact. This is equal to zero, clearly. The right solution is, again, doing the same estimate as before, considering all these masses. And you will see that if you do like this, this inequality is translated in this one. Remember, the capital D is the separation between Alice and Bob. TB is the time that Bob is out of the trap. And then now this QA. trap and then now this q a n here is the n mass multiple mass multiple of this system of masses considering all of them real somehow again it's an artifact it's just a mathematical expression but it will be useful in a moment so okay this is the condition in which bob can acquire significant witchfuff information or get significantly entangled with alice now let's move to alice and to the second To Alice and to the second ingredient that I need here, that is quantized gravitational radiation. Now, for the quantized gravitational radiation, we'll come back to this slide in a moment. Let me look to the electromagnetic case because this is easier and then I can explain how we can estimate what we want to look at with the quantized gravitational radiation. So, if we consider the electromagnetic case, we can consider an interferometer. In the magnetic case, we can consider an interferometric experiment of this kind in which we have the charged particles in a superposition of two different paths. Now, if you consider that the paths are classical paths, we can consider them as classical currents. And you know that in this case, since we are accelerating the particle, the particle will emit electromagnetic radiation. And in particular, each path will generate a coherent state of the electromagnetic field. Now, let's see, just five minutes. Five minutes. Perfect. Thank you very much. Now, these will make such in such a way that ELICE loses interferometric visibility due to the fact that there is this emission of gravitational radiation by Ben Stralung. And the way to compute how much interferometric visibility Alice loses is to compute this overlap between the coherent state of the electromagnetic radiation that is emitted. All of this can be right away translated to the case of linearized gravity. To the case of linearized gravity. Now, what I'm interested here to show is that, and this was shown in this paper in 2003, that, okay, this overlap can be easily written using the property of the Courier state as this overlap here. And this is the overlap between the vacuum state and the state beta minus alpha. The state beta minus alpha is the state generated by a time-dependent electric dipole that is zero. That is zero at the beginning, then it becomes QA times D, and then it goes to zero again. So, what I want to say with all of this is that in order to have an estimate, an order management on when LIS start to actually lose significant interferometric visibility, instead of doing the computation of this object here, which can be a bit cumbersome in the gravitational case, we can just have an estimate by looking at essentially this. At essentially, this effective electric dipole, and when this effective electric dipole emits at least one photon of characteristic frequency one over the time of the experiment. And this can be done in the electronietic case just looking at the classical Larmor energy formula for the time-dependent electric dipole, or in the gravitational case by looking at the formula for the emission of gravitational radiation. This is the energy emitted. And following the And following the reasonment before, I just need to ask this to be less than essentially one graviton of characteristic frequency 108 in order to make sure that ELIS is not losing significant interferometric visibility. So, essentially, I arrived at this inequality here. From now on, I will call this Q the effective quadruple because at least more than usually is a quadruple unless the geometrical configuration. Quadruple, unless the geometrical configuration makes it zero. And this inequality tells us when that Ellis is not losing interferometric visibility. And now, and I'm almost essentially done, the resolution of the paradox. So we have our guess what game, and we take the case in which this quadruple is indeed small enough that Alice is not going to lose significant witch path information in doing an interferometric experiment. Experiment. Now, if we put together this condition with the fact that Alice and Bob are space-like related, we obtain immediately this other inequality that, if you remember, tell us that Bob cannot acquire which half information in this case. So in this case, what is happening is that Alice will see her interference pattern no matter what Bob does. Causality is safe. But on the other hand, if Bob opens the trap, he will not be able to acquire which path information. Acquire which path information, so also complementarity is safe, and vice versa. If this quadruple is big enough, Alice will lose interference visibility no matter what Bob does, but Bob will be in that case able to acquire which path information consistently with complementarity of quantum mechanics. So, this is, well, we are on the other side of the river. And this now is my last slide. What I have discussed is the Gedan. What I have discussed is the Gedankin experiment that shows inconsistencies with Kazite and complementary to quantum mechanics if the dynamical degree of freedom of gravity and their quantum features are neglected. If you put back together everything, so the vacuum fluctuation plus quantized radiation, these are the two features that make me call the field quantum, then we get a consistent picture. Again, this is not a Gnogo theorem. You can have a theory. Technical theorem, you can have a theory that works perfectly well without this, but you have to find it and to make sure that there are really not no inconsistency in this kind of scenario. With this, I've concluded. Thank you very much for your attention. Well, thank Alessio for that nice talk. Any questions? All right, so maybe we can have some time to hear. I thought I heard somebody maybe trying to ask a question, but maybe not. All right, so maybe we can think about some questions. All right, so maybe we can think about some questions that might come up and we can resume that in the discussion session. So let's thank Alessio again.
