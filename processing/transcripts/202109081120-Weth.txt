We'll talk about Morse index versus radial symmetry for fractional Dewiclet problems. Many thanks for the invitation, for the chance to give a talk here. It's a great pleasure. And I would like to present some joint work with Mustafa Fall from AM Senegal and with Pierre M. Feulefak and RÃ©my Ivan Tembur, both joint PhD students of ours based in Frankfurt and simultaneously in Senegal. Guy and the starting point of what I'm going to talk about is something very basic. It's a very nice geometric result for some local problem. And we wanted to generalize it to a non-local problem. We found out it's not so easy. And then afterwards, we found out that it has some very nice implications. So let's start with something very basic: with semi-linear elliptic Divi problems of second order. And I will make it even more basic. I will make it even more basic. So we just consider minus delta u equal to f of u in some smooth bounded domain omega, no problem of regularity here. u equal to zero on the boundary, so Division boundary conditions. And we just take a C1 nonlinearity F here. So formally, this equation has a, or this problem has a variational structure with respect to this energy functional given here. So I say formally because we don't put any growth condition here on the nonlinear. Condition here on the nonlinearity, but if you want, you can try to treat this problem variationally in the space C1, 0 of omega. Then you have a well-defined functional of class C2 and critical points of E are solutions of one. Certainly, I have to say that this place might not be the best space to find solutions, but it's not a bad space to investigate solutions. Okay, so there's something more specific I want to talk about, and this is I want to talk about, and this is symmetry versus variational properties of solutions. So, suppose for the moment that omega is a bounded radial domain, so which means a ball or an analyst, and then we can ask this very unprecise question, which solutions of this problem are radially symmetric. So, this is completely unprecise, but we still have answers. So, for instance, if omega is a ball, then by this very classical result of Giedersny-Niernberg based on the moving plane method, which they introduced to this problem. Method which they introduced to this problem, positive solutions are radially symmetric. And then we also see that sign-changing solutions to this problem may or may not be radially symmetric. And if omega is an analyst, then positive solutions may or may not be radially symmetric in general. So we can be more specific with our question. So we can ask whether the radial symmetry or the non-radiality of a sign-changing solution is related to its variational properties. So this is what I would like to discuss. So, this is what I would like to discuss. And I would make this a little bit more precise. So, I would like to address the variational properties by means of the Morse index. So, what is the Morse index of a weak solution? So, we take weak solutions in H10 of omega, and we also ask them to be in L infinity because we did not put any growth conditions on the nonlinearity. So, the MOS index is simply the number of negative eigenvalues of the linearized eigenvalue problem. values of the linearized eigenvalue problem. So minus delta v minus f prime of u v equals lambda v with Bigishly boundary conditions. But variationally, one should think of it as the maximal dimension of a subspace of h10 on which the Hessian bilinear form is negative definite, right? This is equivalent. And then we have a sorry, let me keep this for another second. So then we have a very nice result relating symmetry to the Mohs index of a solution. Symmetry to the Mohsen X of a solution. And this result is due to Aftalion and Placella. It has also very nice and easy, or I would say elementary proof. And it says the following. If you have a ball or an analyst as your underlying domain and you study a C1 nonlinearity here, then every radial sign-changing solution of this problem in omega has Mohs index greater than or equal to n plus one. equal to n plus one. So where n is the dimension. And I have to add the remark that Aftario and Pacelli assumed additionally that f prime of zero is greater than or equal to zero, but this is in fact not necessary and also an assumption which in fact should not be put here in addition. I can maybe come back to this point later. And also as an application, let me remark that they deduced the non-radio Remark that they deduced the non-radiality of least energy sign-changing solutions of this problem in the case where they exist, which basically means, for instance, for a superlinear non-linearity with subcritical growth. Because you know that these solutions have in general MOS index two, so if the dimension is two or higher, then these least energy sign-changing solutions cannot be radially symmetric. Okay, so let me come to something very basic. Me come to something very basic to a trivial special case. And the trivial special case is something we all teach in our PDE classes. It's just the eigenvalue problem for the Laplacian. And if we apply the result of Aftalion Cella to this, just to this eigenvalue problem, considering a ball or an analyst as the ambient domain, and we just take as a nonlinearity something which is not really. non-linearity something which is not really non-linear f of u equals lambda u we see that when we study a radial sign-changing eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue lambda then there must be at least n plus one eigenvalues below lambda counted with multiplicity so this means if we consider the sequence of eigenvalues lambda one which is positive and smaller than lambda two and then we have degeneracies or and we have some gaps and some degeneracies. We have some gaps and some degeneracies, then we can deduce the following corollary, which we all know, which is well known, that every eigenfunction corresponding to lambda 2 is non-radial. So why am I explaining you this very basic fact as a corollary of the result of Aftalion and Parcella? I will come back to this, but let me just at this point also point out that we have much more precise information on eigenfunctions corresponding to lambda 2. To lambda 2. And so let us consider, as before, a ball or an analyst. And then for the eigenvalue problem, we know that every eigenfunction corresponding to lambda 2 is in fact of the form u of x equal to j of modulus of x, so radial function, times just a linear function. So in this case, we can take it as a scalar product with a unit vector. So as a consequence, every eigenfunction. As a consequence, every eigenfunction corresponding to lambda 2 is anti-symmetric. So, u of minus x is equal to minus u of x for x and omega. Okay, as I said, all this is very basic, well known. And let me just point out again that the result of Aftaglo and Pacella is much more general because it's for the semi-linear problem. But let us now pass from local to non-local. So, to the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem for the fraction. So the fractional Laplacian, as it is given here, is a singular integral operator. And so here the order is between zero and one. And the CNS is a normalization constant, which is not too important in the following. We can also just neglect it for the moment since we consider fixed. Moment since we consider fixed order s here, or the order should be, in fact, 2s. And I prefer to look at this eigenvalue problem in a weak formulation. And for this, we consider the bilinear form, which is associated with the fractional Laplacian. This somehow avoids a little bit some regularity issues. And we consider the sub-olef. We consider the suboleft space h as zero of omega. So we define it as a function in L2 of Rn, which is zero outside of omega, and where this bilinear form where I twice plug in u is finite. So let me point out here in order to, this fractional Laplandian is a non-local operator, so we always need to know functions in all of our n. And therefore, yeah, we define this division. We define this Divichlet Sobolev space as it is given here. And then, by definition, a function u solves the eigenvalue problem in weak sense with just this bilinear form when applied to v equals the right-hand side lambda times the integral of omega u times v dx. And this for all v in h as zero of omega. Okay, so now we can ask similar questions for the fractional Division eigenvalue problem. Eigenvalue problem and so about the shape of eigenfunct. And let me just recall what is known. So again, we have a sequence of eigenvalues. Lambda 1 is a simple eigenvalue, and it admits a unique positive L2 normalized eigenfunction. And therefore, by uniqueness, phi 1 shares the same symmetry properties of the underlying domain, if it has any. And eigenfunctions corresponding to higher eigenvalues. Functions corresponding to higher eigenvalues have to be orthogonal to the first one and therefore have to change sign. So it is very natural to also ask what the shape of eigenfunctions corresponding to lambda 2 is. So in particular, can we decide whether eigenfunctions corresponding to lambda 2 are radial or non-radial? And in fact, that was somehow the theme of. Somehow, the theme of a conjecture, as we found out after our work, essentially. So, it was not known whether eigenfunctions corresponding to lambda 2 are anti-symmetric and therefore non-radial functions. And this conjecture is due to Banuelos and Kojiki. And they, in particular, conjectured this for the ball. I mean, for the analysts, it's a different story. Maybe I come back to this later. Maybe I come back to this later. So, Barnouelos and Kochike also proved this conjecture in the case n equal to one, so one-dimensional case, and for the square root of the La Partian, so s equal to one-half. This was in 2004. Then, later by Kroznichi, the conjecture was proved for n equal to 1 and s between 1 half and 1. Then, later by Duda, Kuznetsov, and Kroznichi in 2017 for n less than equal to 2. n less than or equal to two in the full range of s between zero and one and for n between three and nine and s equal to one half so the square root again and then for n equal to three s between zero and one by ferreira and then finally we proved it in full generality recently and so i will make some remarks about this so all So, all previous partiary results were based on fine estimates related to somehow a fractional separation of variables. I explained this in a little bit more detail. And we verify the conjecture, as you might already guess, by proving a fractional analog of the general MOS index estimate of Aftalia and Pachella for semi-linear fractional problems. And in fact, so we solved this conjecture. And in fact, so we solved this conjecture without knowing at this point that it was a conjecture. And then a quite different proof of the full conjecture based on polarization, but only valid for the linear problem has been given shortly later and independently by Benedict, Bobkov, Dara and Geerg. So let me explain somehow in a little bit more detail what I mean by a fractional separation. Detail what I mean by a fractional separation of variables. This is the content of this nice proposition of Dida, Kosnetsov, and Klasnichi. So, if you look at this fractional eigenvalue problem here in the ball, then what is known is that every eigenfunction is of the form u of x equal to vl of x times phi n plus 2l n of mod x. n of mod x for some integers l non-negative and n greater than or equal to one where vl is like a homogeneous harmonic polynomial of degree l and this phi function here is again a radial eigenfunction of this problem but in a different dimension in fact in higher dimension which depends on l on the degree of this harmonic polynomial m plus 2l and corresponding to the nth radial Corresponding to the nth radial eigenvalue, counted multiplicity. So you go in dimension n plus 2l, and you only count the radial eigenvalues. They also form an increasing sequence. And there you take this eigenfunction. So this is very nice that you have this multiplicative structure. The only problem which you still have is that the radial eigenfunctions are, well, I mean, they are not so well understood, at least, not so well. Understood, at least not so well, clearly much less than the local ones, so for s equal to one. So they also proved that if you have an eigenfunction corresponding to the second eigenvalue, lambda two, then in the representation above, we either have L equal to zero and n equal to two, which means u is radial, or L equal to one and n equal to one. And the only thing we had to do to solve the conjecture is to prove that the second case holds. And case holes so that L is equal to one and n is equal to one. And for this, we only had to prove that u is non-radial. And this gives the connection to the estimate of Aftalion and Pachella, which we now want to generalize to the fractional case. Okay, so this is the content of our main theorem: a fractional analog of the Arftalian-Pagella estimate. And in fact, we have to put some restrictions here. First of all, we only consider this in the ball. And we study a C1 nonlinearity here. We consider a radial sign-changing solution of this fractional semi-linear problem, minus delta S U equal F of U with Dirichlet complementary conditions. And we need an additional assumption. So, well, basically, in the range S between one-half and one, we don't need anything. Half and one, we don't need anything else, but in the case where s is between zero and one half, we need an additional subcriticality condition, I would like to call it, on the nonlinearity. And under these assumptions, we can prove the same estimate that u has Moore's index greater than or equal to n plus one. And here, similarly, as before, the Mohs index of U is defined as the number of negative eigenvalues of Number of negative eigenvalues of the eigenvalue problem, which is given by the linearization of the equation. And let me just point out here that this extra subcriticality assumption is satisfied in particular for non-linearities of the type f of t equal to lambda mod t to the power p minus 2t if p is greater than or equal to 2 and subcritical. So it's particularly satisfied in the linear case. Are satisfied in the linear case, and we can apply our theorem to the eigenvalue problem and verify the conjecture of Banwellos and Kochiki. So as you see, there are certain restrictions, and I will have to make clear to you why we need these restrictions when we pass to the fractional problem. So at this point, what I would like to do is I would like to give a I would like to do is: I would like to give a brief sketch of the proof of the classical estimate in the local case s equal to one of Aftalion and Pagella. Also, because it's very nice. So maybe it's the most important point of this talk if you don't know this proof already. So let us suppose for simplicity that we are looking at the ball and that in addition to our nonlinearity being C1, we also assume that F of 0 is equal to 0. Then we take a radial sign-changing solution. Then we take a radial sign-changing solution and well, to prove that the Mohs index of this solution is greater than or equal to n plus 1, we have to find an n plus 1 dimensional subspace of H10 on which the Hessian bilinear form is negative definite. So the key idea is to construct a test function space by using partial derivatives. So just the coordinate directions, we consider these partial derivatives vj. And I mean, it's very obvious that these functions. Very obvious that these functions solve the linearized problem just by differentiating the equation in the xj directions. And since we assume that our solution is radial, these functions are odd with respect to the variable xj, respectively. So clearly also these functions do not solve the Diviesley boundary conditions. But this we can now, at this aspect, we can now look in more detail. Aspect, we can now look in more detail. So, let us assume without loss of generality that near the boundary of the ball, u is positive and the radial derivative is negative. We can assume this just by noticing that we can write the radial solution as a solution of an ODE, where we have, well, clearly, since we assume f of u is equal, f of zero is equal to zero, that at the radius one. The radius one, the solution cannot vanish together with its radial derivative. So we have a picture more or less like this. So let us assume for the moment we just have one sign change. So u is negative in a smaller ball and positive in an analyst. And then we look at the partial derivative in direction xj, and we see that what we can have to look at is just the circle where u takes its. Circle where u takes its global maximum. And then inside the circle, we have the structure as on the picture on the right-hand side. So we see where the functions vj, which are odd functions, change sign. As I said, this is just a simplified case, but we can work with this one. And what we can do then is we just consider the positive part of this partial derivative restricted to the half ball. The half ball where the xj component is positive, and what we see from this picture is that this function is in fact an h10 function, right? It vanishes on the hyperplane xj equal to zero, and otherwise it has, so to speak, compact support. So we can take the equation for the partial derivative multiplied with v j plus and integrate over b. And integrate over Bj plus, this half ball. And what we see is that this integral is precisely like the second derivative bilinear form applied to Vj plus, but only the integral taking over the half ball. So since we also know from the picture above that Vj plus vanishes on a non-empty open subset of Bj plus, we can conclude that the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of The first Dirichlet eigenvalue of this operator minus delta minus f prime of u on the half ball must be negative. Right? We have a test function where the bilinear form vanishes and then we know that the infimum on a somehow since this function also vanishes on the non-empty open subset, we know that the infimum of this quadratic form, if you know put a normalization condition, must be negative. So then we can completely So then we can complete the argument as follows. So I follow the argument of Aftalion and Paigella. So we just take the corresponding unique positive L2 normalized eigenfunction corresponding for this half ball and for this linearized operator. I extend it to a function h10 by odd reflection in the xj variable. And then I also take the radial positive L2 normalized first Dirichlet eigenfunction for Eigen function for the linearized operator in the fold ball. And what I get is an n plus one-dimensional subspace spared by these functions. And using the anti-symmetry and anti-symmetry properties of these functions, it is then easy to see that the quadratic form is negative definite on the space spanned by these functions. And then we conclude that the most index m of u of u is at least n plus one. One. Okay, that is the argument in the local case. And we ask a question, can we apply this strategy also to the fractional problem? And after we were finished, we found out yes, essentially, but only with further restrictions, major modifications, and more involved estimates. And this is reflected by the length of the papers. And let me point out what the main difficulties are here. So, clearly, the problem which we have to look at now is non-local. And the proof of Avtalion and Pacella used localization in many regards. So considering just the half balls and just integrating over subdomains of the ball, all of this, if it is done in the fractional case, requires the consideration of interaction. Requires the consideration of interaction energies related to different subdomains. And also, what is important is that the boundary behavior of solutions is more singular in the case where S is between 0 and 1. So partial derivatives may be unbounded close to the boundary, and this is in fact the typical case that they are unbounded. So it's more like a degenerate case when they are bounded close to the boundary. And clearly, we also have no ODE for the radial solutions. ODE for the radial solutions, and maybe as a final remark, a fractional Hawk Phlemmer, which one might hope to apply, exists, but not a local one, so it does not help very much in the study of sign-changing solutions. So these are the main difficulties. And let me come back maybe to the boundary behavior. But before I do this, let me clarify what we mean by a solution of the semi-linear problem. We also consider this in a weak sense. Consider this in a unique sense. So we again consider the quadratic form E associated with the fractional Laplacian. And so we only study function solutions in weak sense, which are also bounded because we don't put any growth condition on the nonlinearity. And then we have just this definition here of a weak solution. And let me also recall that the Morse index can be. That the Morse index can be defined variationally again as the maximal dimension of a subspace now of HS0, where the quadratic form which is now associated to the linearized problem is negative definite. Okay, and as you can see, this quadratic form here in the bottom has a local part which is associated with the non-linearity and then a Linearity and then a quadratic non-local part, which causes some problems, but also helps, as we might see later. Okay, so let me come back to the regularity aspects. So for the moment, let us fix a weak solution of this problem. And what is very important in this, if you study boundary regularity, is to consider the quotient of u to Of u to the s power of the boundary distance function. And here we have it is extremely easy. The boundary distance function is just one minus mod x. So we study this quotient psi. I would like to call it psi u over delta to the power 2s. And then we have the following regularity results. First of all, we have interior. I should maybe say that this is a theory. Say that this is a theorem more than a proposition. So, first of all, we have interior regularity C to S. This is basically due to Silvestre. And for the boundary regularity, we have Cs0. So, Herder continues up to the boundary with zero boundary conditions pointwise. So, clearly, he considered a restriction here to the closed pole. And this means that the quotient. And this means that the quotient psi u over delta to the power s is a bounded function and in fact it is also a C alpha function on the closure for some alpha between 0 and 1. So these properties are due to Rossenton and Serra. But unfortunately, these properties do not exclude oscillations of the radial derivative close to the boundary. And since we want to analyze partial derivatives, we need to avoid these oscillations. To avoid these oscillations, at least it would be very helpful to avoid oscillations of the radial derivative because these are connected to oscillations of the partial derivative. So, in order to avoid these oscillations or to get a more precise picture on the radial derivative, we need gradient estimates. And let me therefore also recall some gradient estimates first by Fall, Mustafa, Fall and Mustafa, Fall, and Sven Yawas. So here you can see that the gradient of a solution u is bounded by a constant times delta. So the distance function to the boundary to the power s minus one. So clearly this means that the gradient is usually unbounded close to the boundary. I mean it's it does not follow from this, but this is what we expect in general and what you can have in many Have in many precise concrete situations. But what is also very important, if you consider again these psi functions, so you can evaluate the values of the psi function at a boundary point by a kind of L'Hopital rule. So you can compute it with as a limit which involves the radial derivative. And this is very important because it says us if the psi function is positive at the psi function is positive at the boundary, then this also means that the radial derivative is negative close to the boundary. And this is precisely what we want. So we can use the psi the values of the psi function close at the boundary to study the radial the sine of the radial derivative close to the boundary. And let me also recall the result by Giott Grupp that if s is between one half and one then in fact the psi function The psi function, as she proved, is of class C to S. And then, what is important for us, it is a C1 function in the closure. So, in the case where U is radio, we can just write U as a function of the radial variable and also Psi. And then we can just see that the sine of Psi at the value one decides the sine of the radial derivative close to the boundary, as it is given by this formula. given by this formula. So in particular, if psi of one is different from zero, then this radial derivative does not change sine close to the boundary. Okay, I only have probably five more minutes, but let me discuss a little bit now the role of partial derivatives. So we have to define partial derivatives on the whole domain. So naturally we extend it by zero outside of the ball. And then in general, we have a discontinuous function. I have a discontinuous function. But still, it says the partial derivative solves the linearized problem in distributional sense in the ball. And what we can say even more, if we know, if we take a test function which has compact support, and then we can even take it in HS0 of the, I mean, yeah, then we can do not have to take a C infinity function with compact support, but we can also take an HS0 function. But we can also take an HS0 function with compact support. And then we can also evaluate the quadratic form. So it makes perfect sense to evaluate it to phi and we get the value zero, which is expected from the fact that we solve the linearized problem with vj. And then also if we know for some reason that vj is an hs0 function, then we can evaluate it also to functions. Also, to functions phi which are just in HS0 of B and do not necessarily have to have compact support. Okay, so this is the role of partial derivatives. And now we can try to build test functions from these partial derivatives, as it was done basically also by Afralian and Pacella. And what we have to do is we have to find again to estimate the Mohrs index in n plus one-dimensional subspace. n plus one dimensional subspace of h is zero on which the quadratic form is negative definite and let us assume in the following that this psi function at one is non-negative and then what we do now is we consider again the half balls and now take the functions dj which are given very similarly as in the local case we take the positive part on the positive half ball and we subtract the negative part on the negative The negative part on the negative half ball, then we directly get an odd function with respect to the hyperplane xj equal to zero. And these functions are even with respect to the other hyperplanes, since the function u we consider here is radian. And now what we can say is that if psi of one is positive, then these functions are in HS0 and they have compact support. support and if s is between one half and one and psi of one is zero this is usually the bad case then we can at least say that vj and dj both are hs0 functions and here at this stage we use the result of uh get group of group right because in this case eventually um these vj functions are continuous so continuous in the whole of our n and In the role of RN. And in fact, from this, we can use a result by Silvestre to in fact prove that they are in HSU. So we can look basically at the same picture as in the local case, assuming that for the moment U is positive close to the boundary. And for simplicity, let us assume also that there's just one sign change, which we don't know, in fact. And this would correspond to the case where psi one is different from zero, so strictly possible. One is different from zero, so strictly positive. And then we have essentially the same picture as before for the functions dj. And now we can deduce from a previous lemma that, in fact, the quadratic form is, or the bilinear form is well defined on Vj and Dj and equal to zero in these cases just by the properties given in this lemma. And now the key estimate is that if I apply made is that if I apply the quadratic form to dj in both arguments, then I get a negative value. And at this stage, the non-locality helps because this is a non-local feature. In the local case, the corresponding quantity would simply be zero, right? Because in fact, this is due to the interactions we have to count. In the local case, there are no interactions between different domains, so disjoint subdomains of B, but in Domains of B, but in the non-local case, there are interactions. And eventually, it turns out that these interactions help you if you count precisely. So, you have to balance them, and eventually, you get something negative. Unfortunately, I don't have time to give an idea of the proof, so I have to skip this. But let me just conclude at this stage that the conclusion of the proof is very similar as before. So, we see that the bilinear form is negative. see that the bilinear form is negative definite on the space spent by these test functions d1 to dn and this follows by the inequality i just stated and by the fact if we apply the quadratic form to different dj and dk then we get the value zero this is easy to compute by simply by the symmetry and anti-symmetry properties of the functions dj and the final observation is that again i can add Add a radially symmetric L2 normalized eigenfunction of this full eigenvalue problem in a ball corresponding to the first eigenvalue lambda one, which is negative, because we already found a test function where the quadratic form is negative. And since this function, this eigenfunction is radial, and therefore even with respect to all reflections, we can compute that in fact the bilinear form is negative definite on the form is negative definite on the whole space spanned by d1 to dn and also this phi1 this function phi1 and we conclude from this that the Mohr's index is greater than or equal to n plus 1 so we have proved the result therefore but I somehow avoided one case and I have to discuss this case now and we have not covered the case yet where this psi function Psi function is equal to zero at the boundary. So recall that psi is equal to u over the distance function to the power s and where s is between zero and one half, because in this case, we cannot deduce that the psi function is of class U1. And therefore, we cannot prove that the test functions we construct are HS0 functions and that we have this important relationship of the quadratic form. form so somehow we have to avoid the um the case seven and recall that in this case we require the additional subcriticality assumption given here and what comes in very handy is the fractional Poissive type identity due to Rossoton and Sera because this allows to characterize the square of the psi function at the boundary by an integral over the full domain b. Full domain B, as it is given here. And by our subcriticality assumption, we now see that this integral must be positive if we have a non-trivial function, so a non-trivial solution. And therefore, psi cannot be zero at one, and we avoid this case. So this is the reason for assuming this additional subcriticality assumption. And clearly, the open question would be, can this assumption be Would be can this assumption be removed? And finally, let me just say another open question: is the case of the analyst. In this case, we cannot extend the full result. What we can only do is we can do the same thing for radial solutions having an odd number of zeros. But for radial solutions with an even number of zeros in the radial variable, the argument breaks down. And these solutions with an even number of zeros, well, we have no idea. Well, we have no idea yet how to deal with them. But let me just point out that this is a difference to the local case because, in the local case, the annulus case is included in the result of Aftalion and Pagella. And this is due to the fact that in the local case, you can simply pass to a smaller annulus so that you still satisfy the Dirichlet problem and only has one interior zero. And well, then everything works. And from this, you can get the full result. And from this, you can get the full result. And well, with this remark, I stop. And thank you very much for your attention. Okay, thanks a lot for this interesting talk. Other questions, remarks? I do have a question. Hi, Tobias. Hi. I actually was thinking about I was thinking about this Mohs index estimate that you are presenting, and then I wanted to know whether this is in any way related to stable solutions. Like if you have stable solutions of the PD you are looking at, is it that some of these estimates can be reformulated as, I mean, you can get them maybe as a priori estimate for the fractional problem you are looking at. Yeah, I mean, if you look at this precise geometry, then in the local case, it's known, right, that radial solutions are sorry, that stable solutions are radial. I have to check if there's some additional assumption on F, but I would not think so. Yeah. Yeah but there should be a restriction on the dimension in that case I guess sorry there should be a restriction on the dimension right in that case that right right either restriction on the dimension or on the non-linearity I mean that's true right because we have this these counter examples in high dimension right but this is for very specific non-linearities in Nonlinearities. I have to say that I cannot, I would have to look it up. I know that there's some result with an additional assumption on the nonlinearity in the local case, but I'm not aware of anything in the non-local case yet. Okay, so thanks a lot. I just didn't understand who was posing the question, but it's not really important. Posing the question, but it's not really important. I mean, then okay. So, Tobias, just maybe a second question quickly. So, is this conjecture simply related or exclusively related to the ball? Or maybe if you replace the ball by convex domain, something could be expected? Very difficult question, even in the local case, right? Question, even in the local case, right? I mean, you can ask questions in more general domains on nodal domains and nodal sets. And I mean, there are some results in the local case, but in the non-local case, I'm not aware of anything for general convex domains. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Wh who are you? Who posed the question, just for curiosity, I mean, because Curiosity, even because uh, I'm I'm Gaiel Diebo, I'm a PhD student at University. Okay, because I mean, your name didn't appear. Okay, are there further questions? I wanted to make a small remark. This is Rupert. Hi. Okay. Hi. Hi to be a nice talk. I just wanted to make you aware of things that are discussed in the physics literature. They have a lot of Literature, they have a lot of inequalities there. They are usually go under the name of labeling of states or something, which is exactly the same problem. So you want to decide whether the second S wave is above or below the first P wave, which is sort of what you do. And so they would look at the linear case, but look at an additional external potential. So you look at minus Laplacian u plus vu equal to. Plus vu equal to, and then you look at how the eigenvalues are ordered. And there are a couple of results which say that something like r to the alpha times v is convex, then you have this inequality. And if something else is something, then you have a different inequality. Anyway, so did you think about such questions? Do you think that something might be possible? Possible? Maybe, yes, but clearly not with the help of partial derivatives, right? Because even if you take radial potentials, you really, yeah, these partial derivatives do not help you so much. But maybe you can look at angular derivatives or well, I think maybe something can be done, but I think maybe something can be done, but one has to replace the partial derivatives. Yes. Yes. Okay. I think it's time to stop here and thanks again for the talk because it's time for the next and last speaker of today.
