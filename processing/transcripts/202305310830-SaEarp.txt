Welcome everyone to this morning's session of the third day of the workshop. And to start the session, we are very happy to have Henrietta Sar from Unicam and he's going to tell us about rows of geometrical structures. So, hello, and let me thank the organizers for the opportunity to come to ban once more. Also, I should mention the talk refers to the pre-print title, which was written together with Daniel Federal, who's my former student with Gonzalo, Eric Lubo, and I should mention that I believe this in terms of user experience, if people are interested in this free print, they should. People are interested in this preprint, they should read it in tandem with Udav's paper, which was presented yesterday, which is a sort of application of all the things that we're doing here, and in fact was written at the same time. So the dates are different for editorial reasons, meaning I can only finish one preprint at a time, but they are really written at the same time. And in fact, one of the results was actually proved independently by Udov and Melveres, basically being the same. Udov and Andres basically be in the same room sorting out some issues with the reference we were following together. So Udov has a lot of protagonism in at least the first part of this. So it should be clear as well. Just keeping the authors consistent with the title screen. And then I should say this derives from an intersection of two references. Of two references. So there's Chris Wood in the early 2000s who was interested in looking at the, originally at the, what should be the harmonic flow of UN structures. So almost complex structures, almost compact, you know, metric, Hermitian, in this or that case. And so that was the harmonic. That was the harmonic flow. That's what was happening here in the 2000s with Kwiz Wood. And then there's a, so Heglobo and I were trying to understand this and see if it applies to G2 structure. And then at the other side of the boards, there's a spirit. Stayed in the floors of G2 and Spin 7, also in the early, in the sort of mid-2000s. And I found it very interesting, and I was also interested in this. So Ekebo and I were trying to understand both things at once. Things at once. And then what happened around 2017, 18 is that there's also Sergey. So everybody's here. Christmas. Yeah, feels like Christmas a bit. He was interested in the sort of div T phenomenon of G2, but from the sort of From the sort of somewhat gauge theoretic perspective. And then, so here we are. This is flows of just any age structure. Just any flow. So when I reported to Jason that we had been writing this up. Had been writing this up. So, this is a study. This is basically a survey of what Eric and I try really hard to understand what these people are trying to say. So, all the credit in terms of original ideas belongs elsewhere. This is just operating an intersection. And then, when I reported to Jason that we're doing this, he asked us very interesting questions. Why? Why? What can you hope to achieve by writing down a general theory of flows of anything? Then hopefully, I suppose the idea is to gain perspective and gain some sort of systematic approach to all of these flows so that we're not partisan or idiosyncratic to this or that choice. Why do we study G2 structures by means of the By means of the Laplacian flow or the Laplacian for floor, for historic reasons, they are very well motivated by the very clever people who suggested them. But the Laplacian flow or the floor are just inflowed. But I'm sorry, I did not understand. What is which kind of harmonic flow was we look at? Oh, he was looking at, he posed the divisional energy as the starting point. That's for each structure, sorry. For you, M. Structures for UN. For UN structures. Yeah, yeah. I said it, but I didn't write it. The idea would be that by looking at all flows sort of indiscriminately, first of all, can you prove some sort of constants of motion for flows? So if you're flowing some H structure as such, can you find some symmetries in that very Symmetries in that very fact, which then would hold for every flaw. In some sense, yes, we can. So, there are some things which can be proved in general. So, it's a war to win awards. People who will be interested in future flows and would have given you an example yesterday, don't have to compute within the idiosyncrasy of the representation theory of a specific reductive tag. They can now use some of the facts from general theory. Are from general theory. So, this is one, this is one. And then, Arias, before Natu, was he already thinking of the law of edge structures? Yeah, because he's friends with Kuzu. And he was familiar with this. And he's the one who said, these look awfully like this div T business. Maybe we can innovate there some hungry way to prove it that. But that's just a. So, the answer to Jason's question: why? Well, first of all, there are some things we can prove in general so that no one ever in the future has to prove them again. Just understand what the diagonal operator means in a particular context, and then some of the facts are already there. And then the idea for the future would be, and I'm leaving, I'll talk more about this at the end, that we can start choosing flows. Start choosing flows with some more perspective and protagonism. So, can we choose the flow that does the job we need to some particular PDE? So, can we prescribe some sort of analytic feature to the flows we want and then choose the flows from the degrees of freedom we now understand to need. We choose the good flows to do various jobs if you understand what all flows look like, which is what's What all flows look like, which is what Spear was trying to say in terms of G2 and spin 7, right? We should be able to choose flows. And there's a paper which I'm sure will soon come out where Spear illustrates how you can choose better flows of custom-made to do certain jobs. I promise it's you last December, but I'm going to say mid-July. Make it next December and then get here. So, um So, the talk has two distinctive parts. So, the first three parts are about the general theory of everything in terms of flows. And then we specialize the issue to the harmonic flow, which after all is the breadwinner of this interaction, for which we just prove the package of results one would expect, which Udav has illustrated in the SP2 SP1. Illustrated in the SP2, SP1 case yesterday. But now we know it stems from a general theory that holds for harmonic flows of any age structure. And then at the end, time allowing, I'll present a very disturbing example. I find it disturbing. Anyway, so how do we go about this? So we think of H2. So there are other So, there are alternative ways to think of H structures. So, we can think of them as H reductions of the frame bundle. We can think of them as homogeneous sections of homogeneous fiber bundle we obtained by quotienting the fibers of the frame bundle by H. And then we can think of it in terms of a, and this is possibly the one we're most familiar with or used to thinking with, which is Used to thinking with, which is in terms of a given tensor or multi-tensor object, which is modeled pointwise by a choice of frame into a sort of linear model. So it's mapped pointwise by a choice of frame into some sort of linear model. The picture to have in mind points to itself. Point to it at several occasions. So we have a principal bundle, which in this case will be the frame bundle, but as we've been discussing, maybe we could make it the spin bundle. Who knows? Then let's fix a metric for the time being. But the metric could vary with time. So then we take the quotient by h into some n, which is no longer a principal bundle, but it's a Longer, a principal bundle, but it's a fiber bundle. And then on M, you have some sort of tensor bundle, some tensor bundle, right? With PQ with P co covariant indices, Q contraband indices. And in fact, you could have any could have a multiplicative which has a compact structure. Has compact structure, transverse contract structure, whatever you want to package in terms of considerable objects. SUN already requires all of your disk. Yeah, indeed. We're doing SUN just now as well. SUN has every difficulty being encountered with every other group together. So it's uh yeah, SUN is is hard, but uh we'll we'll do it. But we'll do it. So the notion then is that, you know, I'll talk more about this later, that, so this is the space of frames, of sort of H classes of frames. The H is proved to be the stabilizer of some sensorial object, like H. But the linear model. Of the linear model. And then, if you use the thinking of an edge structure as a tensor pointwise modeled on some model by a frame, then indeed an each class of frames, because it's stabilized by an age change of frames. And if I tell you what that class is. And if I tell you what that class is, which maps your tensor into the model, it's the same as telling you what the tensor is. Right? So instead of talking about sections of this, you can talk about the sections of that. And that's the equivalence between the perspectives. If I tell you which class of frames maps your tensor into the model, it's the same as telling you what the tensor is. Tell you what the tensor is, and then you know, for UN, you know, of course, the tensor is the almost complex structure, so it's an endomorphism with a relation. In the G2 case, it's the positive three-form, for sp2, sp1, you know, we've heard how it was yesterday, and for each of these cases, indeed for spin seven, which is the harmonic flow of which The harmonic flow of which Shubin Adivadius here was very much part of study. Then you can see how this goes. So we adopt the perspective of homogeneous sections. This is what's called the homogeneous Mr. Bundle show once. And see the signals are the homogeneous sections. That's the perspective we're going to adopt. So this is the picture I just showed you. So, this is the picture I just showed you. In fact, if you pull back your tensor bundle, there's an actual pullback of the tensor. Forget about the side of the picture. I won't use it. But there's a lot going on to make this work behind the scenes. So if you pull back your tensor bundle to the total space of the homogeneous bundle, then it admits a natural universal section. So, universal section. Universal section knows all the H structures, right? Because it just says its value at an H class of frames is the pullback of the model by that H class of frames. So, the universal section encodes the information about all the structures. And it's great because you can differentiate it. So, if you know how to take the covariate derivative of this big psi, and essentially that's how we derive sort of universal. We derive sort of universal formulas for all H structures. But I won't expand too much on it. And then the correspondence I just told you about between a homogeneous section and a tensor, well, is the one I told you about indeed. So it's by pulling back by sigma back to the manifold, the universal section. And it does this job of correlating the homogeneous section, so the H class of frames to the tensor, this H class of frames. Insert this H class of frames describes pointwise as the fixed model. And the linearized version of this, so if you look at derivatives now, so we just differentiate this part of the picture. Now the tangent bundle to the homogeneous bundle of each classes of frame splits into a vertical and horizontal part. And in particular, we are allowed to sort. And in particular, we're allowed to con so so that the differential of the of sigma as a map goes from Tm to Tm and we're interested in the vertical part of that. Vertical part of that is what's called the intrinsic torsion. And it is the intrinsic torsion we're all used to consider. The horizontal part is kind of boring. So there is one way of thinking about torsion. Thinking about torsion in terms of, so yeah, so fixing the metric for the time being, then the Lie algebra, so we fix an SUN. H, your symmetry group is a subgroup of SUN, let's consider this case. And we call M its reductive component, which would be. Which would be kind of important to notice. Then the torsion, we can show. So one can show that the vertical component is a bundle of copies of M. And so the torsion really is an M-value one form. Now, if you think of any case you're familiar with, you will agree that this is exactly what's happening. There's a way of thinking about this in terms of the intrinsic torsion, in terms of the difference between the sort of unique natural age connection and the levita connection for our fixed metric. So there's a way of thinking of torsion that way. And this is equivalent to thinking of torsion as d V signal in RP. In our picture, this is one of the things Chris Wood showed for almost complex structures, but it doesn't depend on almost complex structures at all. So we just have to show that this is still true in general. And in particular, torsion-free does mean harm with respect to principle method. Now, Now, my understanding of Spears' philosophy is that we should look at the general deformations of an H structure in terms of the most general possible thing, which is the general action by pullbacks. And in particular, the infinitesimal deformations will be given by just about any endomorphism of the tangent bundle, in principle. And these guys split, right? They split. Right, they split into, first of all, symmetric and skew symmetric endomorphisms. The skew symmetric ones are a copy of SOM, so they split within two forms. They split as a copy of the Lie algebra page and copy of its inductive component. And there's a symmetric component, which is a pure trace, and a traceless symmetric bit. And this will happen for any infinitesimal definition. This will happen for any infinitesimal definition of just any structure, and the symmetric and skew-symmetric bits are going to have distinctive roles. So, this is the general feature. And this is, in some sense, this is the major observation. We should look at the symmetric and skew components of just any influential deformation in a qualitatively different way. Let me tell you the end of the story. So, the symmetric guys actually deformed the Symmetric guys actually define the compatible metric, the skew guys are isometric definitions. And that's the kind of main gist of it. And then the linearization of this GLN action, the natural GLN action, is the diamond operator. So a few guys to form the isometric direction, but the omega 2H doesn't do anything at all. Indeed. Doesn't do anything at all. Indeed, it's in the colour of diamond. Let's start proving things then. So, as Piero has told us, indeed, that's the case. So, if your model is analyzed by H as a group of SON, then you can identify within the skew symmetric part, you can identify the Lydge group of H with the kernel of diamond. It could have some more kernel, but within the skew symmetric part. kernel but within the screw symmetric guys it could be can be identified with the kernel and well there's also sort of consequences one can derive from it I'd say so the sort of major formula which was derived together with the with the Schubert is the correspondence between the usual sort of variant derivative of a tensor object and the intrinsic torsion. And the intrinsic torsion by means of the diameters operates. So, which is why torsion-free really means torsion-free in the usual sense. So, yeah, and then the examples where the point of having a general theory is that it shouldn't be so abstract that it's more laborious to specify it to a given case than to actually derive it. And we promise, and we've proven from experience. And we've proven from experience in SPIN 7 and SPIN2, SP1, it is less laborious to start from general theory than bravely fighting the contractions and computations in coordinates. This can all be assessed now in a sort of coordinate-free way. And the same for G2, can be done. If we understand if it has more variations, then... If it has more variations, then if it has more deformations, then well, that's all we need to pose some general shape of a flow. And indeed, this is what we propose to do. So we propose that the general flow of an H structure as such ought to be its diamond flow by just any choice of A, and of course, A could be as non-linear, you know, it's just an expression of the pointwise endomorphism that is actually flow. Every flow, it varies in time, it could depend on psi itself, it could be just anything. But it can be assessed for any flow you like. For instance, SUN, we're now assessing what is the diamond action corresponding to Kayla-Ricci flow, as one can do for the Laplacian flow, the Co-Flow, the TFT flow, and flow. You're really careful. And in this context, the particular character in the story. The particular character in the story which kind of triggered it is the harmonic flow, and then it's easy to show. So, the harmonic flow is an isometric flow, so the symmetric part is zero, and indeed the skewed part is given by this divergence of the diversion. Then we can see, we can ask how the compatible metrics or these these tensors co evolve with with the Riemannian metric, with the compatible Riemannian metric. With a compatible Riberian metric, and one can prove that it is always the case that the metric evolves with the symmetric part. I thought you're able to evolve by the magnetic. Yes, but if now that's what I told you. There's a given picture like this, but G can evolve with time. If it does, this picture is dynamic. Could be a G of T. So the effect that you are not assuming that the integrals are going to be. Correct. Previously, we were. But I'm saying there's a way to make sense of this in full generality for varying metric. So do I want to explain why? Well, no, this is the proof of it, but let me speed up a bit. This is how we make sense of the general evolution of the method. Of the general evolution of the metric, sort of co-evolution of the compatible metric with your H structure. Prove this. Looks like a proof, right? So I can. Because I want to tell two stories for the price of one, and that I have to manage time a bit. So here's just for kicks. One natural thing we could do, let's try out a natural flow that exists for any structure which does vary the metric. Well, you can take as the symmetric. Well, you can take as the symmetric part its Ricci tensor itself, the Ricci tensor itself, and then the promise is that it will co-evolve with the Ricci flow of the metric. So it's kind of boring because, I mean, it will be as good as the Ricci flow is. However, we can always add this Q part, and if we do it judiciously, we might be able to prove much more. But for the time being, this is just a thought experiment that's a general. Experiments that there's a general notion of Ricci flow of just any edge structure where Ricci acts by the diamond and it has short time existed. So there's a sort of general thing one can prove without me, but the proof is very easy. So there you go. Once we start talking about flows in general, we discover a general richer flow, which is that. I think it's a few part. What we see is what we see. Oh, C is what? C they C is anything. It's a tensor. Oh, I see. It's not unique. No. But it could prove short time existence. And I don't believe this should be studied. This is a template of the kind of stuff we could just pose things and automatically know things about them. I think some modified version of the Richie Flow with. Version of the Ricci flow with carefully chosen skew parts would be very good to prove things. This one just co-evolves the Ricci flow. You're going to discover, in the end, if you want to discover some Riemannian phenomenon, this will discover exactly as much as the Ricci flow would have. But if you modify it, then that's a different story. So then one can compute, as Pira has taught us to do, but now once and for all, the evolution of all the Riemannian sort of Of all the Riemannian sort of related quantities relative to just any A and C symmetric in skew parts. And indeed, we can even look at the evolution of torsion. Well, you've had me compute this in at least two examples, and I I by the second time I promised myself this was to be the last. To be the last. So this is hopefully the last. So this opens the door into establishing sort of systematic shit type estimates for this kind of stuff. And indeed, we have computed the first estimate for just arbitrary flows, and there are complications to it. If you're particularly interested in E-structure, so flows of frames directly, as Gavin asked me this week, then the sheet. This week, then the sheet-type estimates are particularly nice. Because, in general, they involve a projection into the reductive complement. But if the reductive complement is everyone, there's no projection, you can just continue differentiation. So, frankly, there is this result which says that the only natural vectors we need to divide under a metric is a Richie last time study of all of the metrics. But you look for a bit. So you will talk about asymmetric tensor which is natural and everything or something. This is the only one. So it's this not combined that are different. You're saying if there's older metric, those are the only thing you can do. Yeah, so if you want, I think there is this term that you can use. But let's say the other metric, you know, more. Yeah, if you have a G2 structure, then the tile 3 is an edge solution tensor. So that statement is true. That statement is true if all new patches are developed. But nonetheless, let me tell you exactly what you can prove with diffomorphism invariants. You can prove these sort of Bianchi type identities. So the questions are they haven't been agreed beforehand, but they're in perfect order. So yes, so what you can hope for what you can hope for. What what you can hope for what you cannot prove in general is this Ricci identity and corresponding Bianke identity, which tells you how to commute derivatives of some sense, to commute indices in the derivative of torsion. And this is mediated by the diamond action of the rich string. Again, let me not prove this. It can be done. Can be done. This level of the flow is on parabolic or anything. Just a flow. It's just a flow. They're not geometric flows in the usual sets. They're not parabolic. If you impose if you're morphism and variety, then there holds a ritual. Yes. Yeah, just start just doing arbitrary deformation. Arbitrary deformations. You have to impose something so that this is still meaningful. Once you start imposing the meaningful things, you start recovering meaningful properties which have been observed in the past. I was just going to say, I mean, so the sheet type estimates, they can't hold in this level of generality. The thing's not parabolic, you know. There's no way you're going to get any estimates, right? Well, they will be rubbish. Yeah, but you can compute. Compute. At this level of generality, we're not going to prove a Psychon regularity. This will not happen. But the point is, once you want to compute the sheet type estimates for your case of interest, you just have to specialize some general notation to that case and then compute from second derivatives onwards, I guess. The first one is in the back. One is your A capital A, which is S plus C. Capital A which is S plus C. Right now it's general, but eventually to make it geometric, you're going to pick something which involves two derivatives of psi, right? Or maybe some Dirac thing. I don't know. But yeah, you know, we'll choose some reasonable A's. The point is you could choose unreasonable A's as well and still be able to say something. And you know, diffomorphism invariance basically leads to this, to a particular contraction of the To a particular contraction of the curvature, which turns out to be the Richards effect by diameter. Then, in particular, we can, as a corollary, we recover the Bianke-type identity, which tells you how commuting derivatives indices in the derivatives of torsion relates to the Ricci and to the brackets of torsion. Portion. This whole package defines the trivial diameter. It tells us something about the projection, right? So the whole projection of this has to be in the H, in some sense. So its projection into the reductive complement is zero. And the point being that if the reductive complement is everyone, then this. Is everyone, then this is just plain holes without, and that's useful. Otherwise, it's not theoretically useful, unless you understand the representation theory. And then you can prove all sorts of interesting other interesting corollaries, such that torsion-free structures have R-B-symmetric from H to H, and indeed, if we Indeed, if we decide to study torsion-free structures in general, we can sort of address, provide a five-line proof for all of these guys, which we did. We didn't want to repeat spear in those he did. In those you did, but from this approach, you can basically prove the Richie-Flat characterization of these curves. Again, I mean, those results I've had long before. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just that you can prove them in five lines. Oh, this is known. Yeah, yeah. The point is you can prove it in a sort of almost coordinate freeway, sort of almost immediately. Sort of almost immediately. The philosophy that I had is: I don't know any representation theory abstractly. I wanted to understand this by brute force. To me, that's the only argument I understand because of my own categories. But yeah, it was the proof that the parallelogram structures between flat is yeah, and at that time that transition to artful. Part of it. Yeah, well, to call brute force is what we call pioneering. It doesn't require a speaker for because with a speaker, it's another point of view. Good point. And in fact, we could just take a double cover of this picture and then try and look at spinners represented, as opposed to homogeneous sections have spinners represented. Have splinters and geometric structures and see how much you can advance with this. This is completely unexplored. This is was it that gave me this idea? Yeah, so we could just take a problem with this and rewrite the story for thinking. Spinners completely unexplored from our sort of a general perspective. Great idea. Right. Right. So, quite often when we're studying geometric flows, we stumble upon singularities forming which you would like to model by some very special type of rather rigid solutions, which are called this sort of similar solutions at first, which are then shown to be equivalent to a solid and sort of stationary condition. And defining the solutions, this is also something Shoban taught me, right? So defining the solutions requires producing some, requires some, at first glance, some specific understanding about the stationary behavior of your flow. But then, in further work with UDAV, and then finally in full generality, we believe it's possible to. We believe it's possible to formulate a general definition of solutents in such a way that they will be equivalent to self-similar solutions. The important notion here, I guess, is, well, so first of all, not just any flow admits this narrative, so you have to indeed impose the formula in Paris. And you have to impose some sort of scaling coherence. Your flow cannot be completely indifference to escape. Indifference to rescale, indifference to rescaling. If it responds to rescaling by just chaos, then the notion of soliton doesn't fit into it. But we were able to isolate exactly what condition that is. So here's the question. So why? Why? Why? Can we classify all flows that admit a proper concept of solute? So can we classify all flow flow? So, can we classify all? It looks like something that shouldn't be too hard, but we didn't have the time to do it. But we could now classify all flows for which it makes sense to talk about solitons. We quite often see, you know, classifying which solitons may appear on a given solve manifold for some specific type of flow. This is one step. Specific type of flow, this is one step back, right? It's classifying all flows for which such a discussion would make sense on a given manifold. What do I want to say here? Yeah, well, so it is, this is not very hard. So once you fix a flow of interest, it is possible to check diffeomorphism invariance and scaling coherence. You just find out what the exponent alpha. What the exponent alpha sort of homogeneous exponent has to be. Let me just clarify as well: if you're looking in detail, you can see some L here. L is what we call the next degree. So if you have a PQ tensor with P covariant and Q controvariant, L is the next degree, so it's P n squared. So instance for J for an almost complex structure, it's 1, 1, so the net degree is 0. So the net degree is zero, and that's right, because rotations by 90 degrees don't scale. So this is the sort of net amount by which your tensorial object scales. If it's a multi-tensor object, then it will have a multi-homogeneous zero mix in the matter. Why? We divide them by that one. Um yeah, uh think about this yeah what I think this says is that there shouldn't be solid things, I guess. Or um no, it's okay if alpha is equal to yeah, if alpha is zero. Oh, anyway, L is zero is a bit of a problem. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, but I. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but the alpha depends on L, and that's sort of yeah, so you chose uh so so possibly in the case of almost complex structures there will be some additional complication. Yeah, yeah, we probably have to allow, we probably have to allow alpha to be minus infinity. That's correct. That's the point. Thank you. Thank you. This will go into version two. But for all other cases, unless they're very perverse, this is, and indeed I should mention that her indeed, who cited yesterday, they produced a sort of novel, sort of more modern approach to this strongly analytic approach to this flow of UN structures. It has some idiosyncrasies. So maybe this is a way to. So maybe this is related to it. But in any event, for the average age structure on the street, under those conditions, it is possible to classify all floors that admit self-similar solutions. So then the notion of self-similarity is clear. I mean, it illustrates the definition of the net homogeneity degree because it'll stipulate how. Stipulate how self-similarity manifests itself. So you're allowed to scale by a concept that is consistent with the negative individual of your structure, in particular if you jump in scale. And conversely, I guess, one can look at, one can post directly the stationary condition into your flow and try and derive how. Flow and try and derive how the metric ought to behave with respect to your field of translations. And we can find the precise role of the symmetric and the skew parts of your flow into the general soliton condition. So we now know what's the soliton condition for anything, which deserves it. Which deserves it. See what this row looked like in the in the case you had that effect. Is it always the same? Is it? What does the function look like? Oh, we computed it in a few examples. You have to work it out. You have to solve work for the yeah. I don't have it in here. I was gonna wonder: does it always actually shrink? That's right. So Sorry with the slide. No, if you pose c equals to plus minus one, or if you pose c equals to zero, you can determine row. It does the job. But it has to be done. We've done it. But you have to pose each of these three regimes and see what they give, and it's different rows. They're fundamentally different. I guess your point is for some of these cases this will be impossible. Yeah, this will be wrong. Yeah, yeah, or something, yeah. Yeah, this will be wrong. Yeah, yeah, or something. Yeah, yes, that's right. If you want the side to be changing in the right way, the names make sense. The names are taken from Richie flow respecting this convention. So we take this convention for Richie Flow and we adopt the same name. So it could probably be our name because nothing actually shrinks over Richard Flow. Yeah, that's a very strange name. It shrinks from the perspective of an observer that is evolving. Of an observer that is co-evolving with the field of translation. That is moving. Yeah. But I mean, bear in mind, this is an equation in space. So, yeah, it's just how it's perceived by someone who's moving along the translation field. It's not that it's shrinking in time, I guess. Shrinking in expression. Shrinking and expanding, I mean, in terms of its self-similarity, for example. But anyway, right, so this concludes the first part, sort of motivational part of the talk in terms of the gender theory. And then we decide to put this into practice by choosing a typical flow which exists for all of these structures, which is the div t flow or Div T flow or harmonic flow. We'd rather call it harmonic flow because it is the it bears very close resemblance to the harmonic map heat flow and indeed it bears a bijection to the harmonic map heat flow in a different space. This is how we prove a short time existence for all of these fields. But so I guess the stats. But so I guess the starting point is the Dirichlet energy. If you just give them a sigma like that, and you can only look at its intrinsic torsion, sort of in sort of completely full generality, in some sense, the only functional that it can pose in full generality would be this, or maybe adding some Riemannian data to it, which I think is what's on its way. And then this divergence of torsion emerges as a Emerges as a stationary condition is the Euler-Lagrange equation for this function for a fixed metric. Now it turns out you can allow the metric to be you can allow the metric to vary as well and then compute the full variation of this. And this is something that we're doing in our current project and I understand is being done for And I understand is being done for the G2 case with a lot of specific care. It is huge and it is horrible, but then one can hope to make some choices in there and make it greater. Listen to the GTK, something's just done by ISO, yeah, we've done it in general. I think we've seen this doing it for GTK, something's been done. Well, I guess the point. Well, I guess the point is the full no, then then who has the flow and by using variation techniques they do. They are looking at okay, what is the explicit evolution of the metric? Uh, which reminds me for this isn't all. In fact, this is chosen often by command wise and between the inspirers. Yes. So, I mean, they don't look like you look at screen or aspect and we look at everyone aspect. Yeah. Yeah, but the full thing is new. So, before we go to the next page, I just that I think Sergei was the one who found the original money for it. And also, I don't know why you can pull. So, I don't know why you can put my. I'm the third in alphabetical order in that collaboration, and I think at least my one-play paper was like this. Our preference for like a couple of days. Yeah, we spoke in Toronto about the decondition, but some of them Yeah, sorry. I I added some few things uh over the course of this yeah, this is a this is a long story we should tell about the Okay, that's an important punchline. So we wrote the same, three different groups wrote the same paper around that period. Events like this should prevent it from ever happening again. Talk to people. If they are likable, as was the case, there was no reason not to talk to them. So yeah, so we wrote three versions of the same paper, but I would contend each of Same paper, but I would contend each of the versions looks at the problem in a slightly different way and teaches us something we didn't know. So maybe it was fortunate. Maybe you shouldn't be talking to all of you. Well, this is me trying to be somehow comprehensive in the business of harmonicity of H structures, not even of flows. If I want to include the harmonic flow, then I would have to include He and Li here with a very And Lee here with a very recent like the 2019 have essentially their job for the harmonic flow of UM structures was the basis for the sort of general almost monotonistic and epsilon regularity mechanism that I'm going to tell you about now. So, yeah, there's one important omission which is heard me. Udof did mention it yesterday, but just stressed. And then, yeah, we'll. Stressed. And then, yeah, there's this, from this perspective of looking at torsion as a difference between two natural connections, some interesting things were able to be studied in terms of homonymic structures back by this Montales Davila, Martin Cabrera collaboration, and the people immediately around Chris Wood as well. But we contend that one can do a lot more with less heavy notation in the homogeneous section framework. And then we've been able to look at, yeah, so first with the Riklobo, we set the sort of ground rules for this investigation. Then with Schuban, we put it into practice, just really testing how much what was known for G2 was actually another instance of a perspective general theory. Perspective general theory, but try to put everything into practice for spin seven. And so there you go, spin seven. I'm now justified to be here, right? Octonians, I guess. And then this general theory was formulated and applied in tandem to SP2, SP1 between these two last two. You'll see. Can you say something like you work with Novo? What is this like realized? What is it like you realize the anti-sutras section? Yeah, we realized that we realized this what Chris Wood had been describing in terms of harmonistic for UM structures, but he did it in some sense by identifying the homogeneous section. Except that he wrote this picture specifically for UM structures as if it was specific for UN structures. What we did was realize that what What we did was we realized that what we had done there, the notion of what your structure is, we could define it by a class of frames, by its compromise model. Yeah, but Lava actually defines a universal section for any intro tree. Then we could just generalize the picture. There is a chain of implications between a harmonicity of A harmonicity of sections as sections, sections as maps, whether their image is totally geodesic. Before you take the trace of derivative of torsion, there's other choices you could have made in between. In some sense, in how many ways can you torture the second fundamental form? And for each of them, you could argue that some sort of harmonicity, including harmonicity as a map, it sits in there. There's a large group. It sits in there, there's a logical chain. Yes. But th this one is distinct here. This is Harmony St has a geometric structure. I don't think I'll be able to go over the proofs of things, so I'll just tell you things. So again, the harmonic flow is given by the divergence of quotient. That's the flow that's beginner. That's the flaw that's been mentioned several times by several authors, sometimes independently, sometimes in cooperation. And the key analytic tool is this sort of localized torsion density, in terms of which you can establish a regularity mechanism. Let's just remember that psi is defined on a sort of local. Local ball sort of concentrated in a local ball, and it has a parabolic cylindrical aspect. Is it the same thing which you know? Yes. There was a t1 minus t in front of them for screening. Oh, I think that is a matter of taste if you, yeah. Yeah, so integrates means we put it before, but uh yes, so that's why I'm saying that Udar's paper would be well read in tandem with this, because this is him putting this sort of abstract stuff into practice and sort of telling what it means for a specific group. I don't think they should be read separately, that's the but yeah, so this is a typical epsilon regularity statement. The techniques to establish it were taken from her and Lee in the context. From her and Li in the context of UM structures. And in fact, I should add that, so it is based on some Docker estimate for the Dorsian density, which is some sort of reaction diffusion process. And an almost monotonistic formula, and the almost monotonistic formula was proved simultaneously by Udov and this group. In fact, I thought. In fact, I thought, so in fact, they work together. So, Udolf and Andres dealt with a slight imperfection in the original argument by her and Lily, which has to do with working in a normal coordinates ball, a normal geodesic ball as opposed to Euclidean ball. And there's some cleanup to be done in the original argument to make sure it works. But then what happened is we thought UDA was just exploring the SP2SP1 case, but then Just exploring the SP2SP1 case, but then one day he came to my office and said, Look, I wrote a proof for SP2SP1, and it's exactly the same in general. So, this is how it happened, right? So, this is the same proof works for this anything, and you can get an almost monotonous phonema as mentioned yesterday in any case. So, yeah, well, this is an isomorphic. So, yeah, well, this is an isometric flow. Just like yesterday, there was this whole discussion that yesterday and today are the same day. It's kind of that German series. Right? Yeah, there is no yesterday and today. There's only continuum of. Yeah, that's right. So in this context, one can also prove a nice energy gap. Can also prove a nice energy gap theorem. So there's a sort of minimal energy beyond which a harmonic structure is actually totally free. Starts becoming tempting. Let me not prove it because I have to manage time. We're almost out of time. So I'll just say things. So, when you're able to establish a normal monotonicity formula that feeds into an epsilon regularity mechanism, you're then able to study long-time existence or guarantee long-time existence under small initial data. And in this case, you can do both in terms of small initial energy. So, if your initial So, if your initial energy is small enough, and you can actually improve this to small initial torsion. So, if your torsion is small ideal infinity, not just so in the first case, it has to be bounded. The initial torsion has to be bounded and L2 small. The alternative statement is that. The alternative statement is that it can be just bounded in the supreme. And maybe this is the last thing I'll say or No, let me mention the example instead. So this is something I'd like to mention. The last day before uploading this to the archive, Dino Fodel came up with a construction of a finite time singularity for G2. So the credit for this construction is entirely his. And also, if it's wrong, that's completely his fault. But we wanted to But we wanted to put it online and have people criticize it. Maybe there's a problem in the proof, but what is disturbing is that: so here's a machine to produce finite time singularities, right? If you know that there are no torsion free H structures in an asymmetric homotopy class, but the infumum of energy is zero, then Then, if you can cook a small initial energy flow under those circumstances, it will develop a fine-time C-larity. And we believe by essentially because pi 7 of RP7 is Z, that this can be achieved. The proof is technical. There are several steps to it. You have to choose a guy. Have to choose a guy in the you can essentially interpret G2 structures on a torus, on a seven torus, so it's parallelizable, so its frame bundle is trivial. So you can really think of G2 structures in this case as maps from T7 to upper seven. But in a small ball of T seven, which looks like just T seven at least a few one. No, I'm saying I'm saying that T seven is parallelizable. That T7 is parallelizable. I'm talking about if you're trying to use it in your studio. Yes. You should try to do it with a method that you know does not admit a torsion 3GT structure. I'll do it inside the ball. If that's okay. The ball admits a torsion 3G2 structure. The Euclidean space admits a torsion 3G2 structure. Some sort of some class, a homotopy class to have no yes. Oh, so so there's a baseline. How do I know that actually? Again, it's a technical proof. There's many steps to it, but let me just try to give the general. Why not start with the seven? Try to make it flat there. If you allow me to continue just the same as take a local Euclidean ball in T in T set. So let's understand first that G2 structures can be. So let's understand first that G2 structures can be thought of in the case of T7 as maps from T7 to RP7, because the print button in this case is trivial. The fiber is also 7 over G2, which is RP7. That's where RP7 is coming from. Now, if you take a small, then since the frame bundle is trivial, there's the constant map, which is the phi zero sort of baseline G2 structure that exists everywhere. And for us, it represents the constant map into our PC. The constant map into RP7. Okay, now you can take a small ball and modify that guy strictly within this ball, which means that B7, which can then extend by trajectory into the shadows to a map from S7 to RP7. But maps from S7 to RP7 classified by the corresponding homotopy group. And you can find the non-trivial representative there. With this fellow, you can construct a contradiction. With this fellow, you can construct a contradiction by redoing the analysis prescribed and showing that you can get a zero infinite energy, which will give you a contradiction. But again, we don't have time to validate this proof now. I just want to put it up for discussion because the conclusion is very troubling, right? The conclusion is, oh, let's not. The conclusion is you could have an isometric flow, so a Riemannian metric. Isometric flow, so a Riemannian metric is fixed, but the G-cost structure that induces it is developing a similarity. That's very hard to believe. The Riemannian metric is some sort of compromise between phi squared and phi psi. And you're believing that the both sides of this are developing a singularity at the same rate, so that the metric would still be defined even though the G2 structures become similar. It's very distable. They should be wrong. It should be wrong. So, I want to put it up for discussion and then maybe think about it.
