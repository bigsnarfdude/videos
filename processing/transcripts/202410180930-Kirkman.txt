So, what I want to talk about is how to use the Huff algebra action to actually construct Art and Schelter regular algebras. And so, this will also explain how we constructed the algebras that Frank talked about on Tuesday. So, this is all part of a bigger project that we've been working on and trying to extend classical invariant theory to invariant theory to a non-commutative or non-co-commutative context. And so by classical invariant theory, I mean a finite group acting linearly as graded automorphisms on a commutative polynomial ring, and then looking at properties of the fixed rings. And so the idea in extending the context is to replace the commutative polynomial ring by an appropriate algebra. Here it's a Art and Shelter regular algebra. It's an Art and Shelter regular algebra, which unfortunately there are not always a lot of graded automorphisms. And so, in order to try to extend the actions, we consider Huff algebra actions as well as group actions. And then again, try to find properties of the invariants that extend the classical results. So, the kind of classical results, I mean, this is the kind of result we're interested in, is, for example, the Shepherd-Todd-Chevale theorem. Shepherd-Todd-Chevalais theorem that classifies the groups such that the invariant subring is a polynomial ring. So, those are the reflection groups, the groups generated by linear maps where all of the eigenvalues except one are one, and the one that is not one is a root of unity. If that root of unity is minus one, you're actually reflecting across a hyperplane. And so, those are exactly the And so those are exactly the groups that give you an invariant ring that's a polynomial ring. Another result that we're interested in generalizing is this theorem of Auslander, which is about groups that are in SLN. So they're not going to be reflections. There are going to be no reflections in these groups. And so then we showed, or he showed that the skew group ring is. That the skew group ring is isomorphic as a graded algebra to the invariant ring automorphisms of A. And so, what's nice about that is it allows you to compare the modules over the invariant ring and the skew group ring. And the skew group ring is a ring of finite global dimension. The invariant subring won't be. And so, in some ways, that allows you to resolve singularities. So, these are the examples of like classical. Are the example of like classical results that I'd like to extend? And so the assumptions on the Huff algebra are going to be as follows. So I'm always going to be looking at something that's finite dimensional. So I'm going to look at the degree one part. Those are going to be the generators. And it'll act linearly on those generators. And the action will be defined in terms of those generators. If the element is not group-like, If the element is not group-like, it will not act as an automorphism. It'll act using the co-product on products. And also, it'll act on the unity in the algebra using the co-unit. And then we also want the action to be interfaithful. So that means that there's no non-zero Huff ideal that kills the algebra. Because when that's the case, you could define the action over that homomorphism ring, over that factor ring, and it might actually be. Factor ring, and it might actually even be just a group action. And so, we're interested in sort of the smallest action so that it can't be defined over some factor. And then the idea is to find pairs. I mean, in the classical case, you fixed the algebras, the commutative polynomial ring, but now we're looking at pairs, H and A, where H acts interfaithfully on A. And then again, we want to study the invariance. So, the hope for all of these many, many actions by Hough algebras is limited by this theorem of Eddinghoff and Walton, which shows if you start with, it doesn't even have to be a commutative polynomial ring, just a commutative domain, and look at actions that are interfaithful by a semi-simple algebra in Huff algebra in characteristic zero. Those are group actions. So, there are new. are group actions. So there are new, there are new quantum, there are no new quantum symmetries. All of the symmetries of the algebra are given by groups. And so then they extended this by looking at certain deformations of these commutative algebras and produce a number of algebras that have no quantum symmetries. So that raises the question, well, so how do you find these pairs, the algebra and the Huff algebra, where the Huff algebra is acting on the Were the Huff algebras acting on the algebra? So, one strategy is what was done here: fix the algebra and then start looking for Huff algebras that act on it. But what I'm recommending today is the opposite approach, starting with the Huff algebra and actually designing the Art and Shelter algebra so that it'll act on it. And that's what I want to illustrate in several different instances when we've been able to do that. So, kind of the two sections of the talk, I first of all want to look at the case where the Hough algebra is the dual, the vector space dual of the group algebra. So that's a commutative Huff algebra. And that amounts to looking at a G grading on the Art and Shelter algebra. And there, the fixed ring is actually the identity component. So, here, properties of the group are going to define the Art and Shelter. To define the Art and Schelter algebra. And then the second part, I'll look more generally at Hough algebras, finite dimensional ones, and try to use the representation theory, the module structure of the Hough algebra, to actually define an Art and Schelter algebra on which it acts. So starting with the group graded case, so this is the case that produced the algebras that Frank talked about on Tuesday. On Tuesday. So, to start with, in this setting, so where I have the functions on the group or the dual of the group algebra, that's going to be a commutative algebra. And looking at, you can look at invariance under that action, but that is equivalent to looking at the co-action by G, which means that the algebra is G graded. And then the ring of invariance is actually the identity component, the thing. Component, the things in group grade E, where E is the identity of the Hough algebra. So we show that this action is interfaithful if and only if, so A1, that's the degree one part of the algebra, so the algebra is generated in degree one, and you look at the group grades of those generators, and that has to generate the whole group. It doesn't have to be a minimal generating set, and in general, it isn't a minimal generating set. And in general, it isn't a minimal generating set, but it just has to be a generating set of the group. And then the action will be interfaithful. So, when this identity component, which is the ring of invariance, when it also is AS regular, then we call the group a dual reflection group for A, right? Because this is the generalization of the Shepard-Todd theorem in this context of group-graded Artens-Schelter regular algebras. Algebras. So, to do this construction, in other words, I'm going to start with the group and construct an Art and Schelter regular algebra, we look at some necessary conditions for this fixed ring to actually be Art and Schelter regular. And so, the degree one part, again, it's going to be, I'm going to assume it's generated by these generators in degree one that have different group grades, not equal to. Different group grades not equal to the identity. So they're all distinct. And if this fixturing is art and shelter regular, then a bunch of things follow. So these will be necessary, but not sufficient conditions. So again, the interfaithful requirement means that these group elements have to generate all of G. It's also the case that in this classical case, the algebra is free over the invariant. Algebra is free over the invariant ring, and that holds in this case as well. And then each of these graded components is a direct sum end of A, so projective and hence in this graded setting, free. And it'll also be of rank one. And so then each one of these graded pieces, so these would be the elements of A that are in. Elements of A that are in group grade G, there has to be an element, a minimal element of degree G. And it'll be written as a product of these generators such that this element G, this is the shortest length representation of G in terms of this generating set. So this is like what you do for Coxeter groups and look at like the shortest length that you can generate a group element in terms of the A group element in terms of the generators. So then, if you look at A, it'll have this invariant ring as a direct sum add, and then it'll have these group graded parts. So this is all over AG. And so if you want the Hilbert series of A, the Hilbert series of A will be the Hilbert series of AG times this element. Times this element we call the Pocare polynomial. That's what it's called in the Coxeter context. So, what the Pocare polynomial is, is you go through each non-identity group element. The one is representing this. And then you find, again, the length of this, and you take t to that power. And it's the formal sum of those. And so when you multiply the Hilbert. The Hilbert series of this, and this is just telling you the shifts as you go along here to get the Hilbert series of A. So the Hilbert series of the invariants times the Poincaré polynomial will give you the Hilbert series of the algebra. And so if I want this to be regular, this has to be a product of cyclotomic polynomials. So that's my necessary condition that I'm looking for. Looking for a grading where this Pocare polynomial is a product of cyclotomic polynomials. Product of cyclotromic polynomials. And so, just to see an example of this, the dihedral group of order 8 is a dual reflection group for this particular Art and Schelter regular algebra, this OR extension. So I can either have commutative polynomials in U and W, or they could be skew commutative. And then V acts on these by this automorphism that basically interchanges U and W, but I can do it with a scalar. But I can do it with a scalar. The A and B are just scalars to show that this doesn't have to be PI. It could be a non-PI algebra. And then D8, I'm representing this rho is the element of order 4. It's the rotation. And R is the reflection. And so these elements U, W, and V, they're taking group grades three of the four reflections. And then this will be graded because these generators are in, they're both. Generators are in, both parts of the relation are in the same group grade. So this will make this algebra graded by this group. And then the invariant ring is, well, certainly because these had group grades reflection, all of these things are in the identity component, but it turns out that's everything that's in the identity component. And so this is a case where this Pocare polynomial. Poincare polynomial. So again, we have these are the generators, those are their group grades. And so we've written A in terms of these minimal monomials of each group grade. And so, I mean, this is giving us the one. This is just length one in terms of this generating set. So there would be a T. This is also length one in terms of the generating set, and so on. So there are three of length one, three of length two, and then Three of length two, and then one of length three. And that's the product of cyclotomic polynomials. When I take the Hilbert series of the algebra and then multiply by the Poqueret polynomial, I do get the Hilbert series of the invariant ring. Okay, so Kent Vashaw was doing a master's degree with me, and so we were looking for new examples of these dual reflection groups. Of these dual reflection groups. So, using these necessary conditions to see if we could find some examples that actually worked. And so, we looked through some small group, small order groups, but didn't find much. And so, Kent wrote a program in Magma to go through each group of order 16. So, for each group of order 16, Magma first found the minimal generating sets of each of the groups. Then it threw The groups. Then it threw in other generators so that you had all generating sets. Then it computed the Pincaré polynomial for each of those and then spit out the ones that were products of cyclotomic polynomials. Then, as we'll see, that will produce relations. I'm trying to build an algebra is what I'm trying to do. So, that'll give me the relations on this algebra that I'm hoping will be Art and Schelter regular. And then, when it is, I'm hoping. And then, when it is, I'm hoping that this identity component is also regular, and then it will be one of these dual reflection groups. So, running this program, he came up with two dual reflection groups. One is the semi-dihedral group of order 16. That's corresponding to the ring S that Frank was talking about on Tuesday. And the other was the so-called modular group of order 16, and that gave R. And then with Gave R. And then with some changes of plus and minus signs in S, he got T. So I'll show you how that works. So magma produces, represents this, you know, not minimally, but this is how it represents the semi-dihedral group of order 16. And so the generating set with the Poincaré polynomial was this particular generating set, and it has Poincare polynomial this. This is giving you the lengths of all the elements in terms of. The elements in terms of this generating set. And so then what you do is you write out the multiplication table for those elements. I mean, so using those relations, this is the multiplication table. And so now what I want to do is I want to define an algebra. So it's going to have four generators. X1 is going to be in grade B, X2 in degree BC, X3 in degree AB, X4 in degree ABCD. X4 and degree ABCD. Okay, so that's giving me the group grading. And then if I want to define a graded algebra, these relations are now forced. So for example, here is a C, and that's x1 times x2. And here's another C, that's x3 squared. So I make that a relation. And so identifying all of the products that have the same group degree, I get an algebra. Which I'm hoping will be Artenschelter regular. Now, I should also note that I could put scalars in here and it would still have those same group degrees. But we started just taking the scalars to be one. And so then with the help of Peter Goetz and Frank, we're actually able to find the right Grubner basis to actually prove that this ring is Art and Shelter Regular. And they are kind of weird. They are kind of weird relations. I mean, they're not the kind of relations that you typically see for these algebras of that are regular of dimension for. They're binomial relations, and they're thinking like x1, x3 is x2, x4, and so on. And they do have an interesting geometry. So, and then it turns out it is regular. The identity component is this commutative polynomial ring, and that is the And that is the Hilbert series of the fixed ring. And so then they also did this for the modular group, which produced the ring R as well. So the theme here again is I'm using the group, the multiplication and the group to construct the algebra, and then using necessary conditions, hoping that I'm going to get one that actually works. Okay, so also in this context of looking Context of looking at group grading. This group grading, wanting to have a group grade, and we're wanting it to be non-abelian because if the group grade is abelian, it's just the same as a group action. And so we're looking for non-abelian gradings that can change the presentation of the algebra. So for example, Simon Crawford completely characterized the Art and Shelter regular algebras of dimension two that have a group grading. That have a group grading that's non-abelian. And so, I mean, the standard representation of these algebras of dimension two is, you know, the quantum plane or the Jordan plane. But if you're going to grade X by A and Y by B, it's going to be forced to be an abelian group. And here it's going to be forced that A and B are actually equal. So in this presentation, you're going to get nothing. And so what he did was. And so, what he did was he looked at all the linear combinations of the generators to see what linear combinations would actually give you a grading. And it turned out there's only one, and that's this grading. That's actually isomorphic to this, which of course is this with Q equals minus one. But it's the only one that carries a group grading that's not abelian. And what you, of course, need. What you, of course, need are two generators, and you just need a squared equals b squared. And there are actually lots of groups that have that property. And he went on then to completely find all of the dual reflection groups and a nice condition on which ones the Auslander theorem holds. So this is again the group sort of telling you how to look at the algebra. So we did this earlier, actually, with down-up algebra. Earlier, actually, with down-up algebras, here there is no analog of, there are no reflections, there is no analog of the Shepherd-Todd theorem. So, we were actually interested in the Auslander theorem. And again, this is the wrong, well, unless if alpha is zero, if you don't have this term, then there are groups. You know, you can have A squared commuting with B and B squared commuting with A that are non-abelian. But otherwise, you need, again, some linear combination of those generators that's going to support. Of those generators that's going to support a group action. And it turns out that there's this presentation, which really doesn't look like your typical down-up presentation. So in other words, in order to look at a group grading on this, I need to think of this algebra like this. And similarly, the only other one is this is, again, it's isomorphic to this particular down-up algebra, but it has these relations, which are not the usual. Which are not the usual ones for the down-up algebra. And this is like, I mean, in classical invariant theory, of course, it's not the group that determines the invariance, it's the representation of the group. And so in this case, it's going to be the presentation of the algebra that's going to affect the action, not just the group. So that's the first part of my talk. So that's for the very specific. So that's for the very specific case that I'm looking at the dual of a group algebra. So now I want to look more generally at just any finite-dimensional Huff algebra and how I could use the representation theory of the Huff algebra to actually produce an Artenschelter algebra on which it acts. So this uses a theorem of Mark Rierfeld. So the important condition I want is this interfaithful condition. Is this interfaithful condition, which is not necessarily so easy to verify? But so, what you want to do is you want to look at the H1 module, the degree one piece. So, the degree one piece of the algebra is going to be an H module. And you want to repeatedly tensor it. And if H is semi-simple, all of these tensor powers will decompose into sums of simples. And so, if by repeatedly And so, if by repeatedly doing this, you get all of the simples, then it will be an interfaithful action with this A1 with that particular H module. Okay, so the idea is to look at different H modules and first of all, see which ones have this property that by repeatedly tensoring, you can get all of the symbols. And so, then the way this works: so, again, I'm fixing. So again, I'm fixing a semi-simple Huff algebra and trying to actually define an Artenschelter algebra on which it acts. Okay, so I look at direct sums of simples and I want to find which ones have this Riefeld condition, which basically amounts to looking at the Grotendie group and seeing and computing it and seeing what happens when you repeatedly multiply things. So then if I find, So then, if I find yes, this particular sum of simple modules does have that condition, then I need to know explicitly what the generators of those simple modules are. Because then I will use those as my relations. Okay, because in order for H to act on this, I need A1 to be an H module, but I also need the ideal of relations to be an H module. And so, if I have, and I'm looking for quadratic ones, I could look for For quadratic ones, I could look for other ones, but that's why I'm looking in this first, just the tensor power of A1 with itself. That'll give me the ideal of relations. And then I want to do this so that I get something that's Art and Shelter regular. I mean, in the end, I always have to, I've got choices and I have to find ones that actually work. So we've done this with a number of different Huff algebras. Again, starting with the Huff algebra and then defining the algebra. And then defining the algebra. And so these first three are infinite families of Huff algebras. And we found in each case there's an Art and Schelter regular algebra of either dimension two or three that is a Huff reflection algebra. In other words, has this Shepard-Todd property that the invariants are again Art and Schelter regular. Then Kashina has classified all the 16-dimensional semi-simple Huff algebras, and we've worked. Simple Huff algebras. And we worked through those and found which ones of those also are these Huff reflection algebras that are like reflection groups. So what I want to talk about now, though, is more recent work. So looking at the Drinfeld double as your Huff algebra. And so kind of the idea is maybe knowing something about the group algebra and about the dual, this smashed product, which is the Druinfeldt double. Which is the Drinfeld double, would also create some nice Art and Schelter regular algebras on which the Drinfeld double acts interfaithfully. So this SMASH product, you need to know what the action of G is on the right. And so if I have an element of the dual and an element in the group, it'll act as F on this conjugate of X. And then the algebra structure in this Drinfeld double. structure in this Drinfeld double. So you can write the basis elements are these characteristic functions on group elements. And so they multiply like this. And this product will be zero unless this A is this. They have to be the same characteristic function. So that's the algebra structure. So next I would need to know all of the simple modules. So Sarah Witherspoon actually classified them in the case Classified them in the case that k is algebraically closed, characteristic zero. And so the simple modules are defined as follows. So you take representatives of each of the conjugacy classes. So each conjugacy class, pick one element in the conjugacy class, then take the centralizer of that element. So then the simple modules are indexed by this representative of a conjugacy class and a simple. Class and a simple KGI module, where GI is the centralizer. And then to actually get the module, you induce up to the whole group algebra. So that'll be simple, and that will be all of the simple modules for this Dunfeldt double of the group algebra. And then the dimension of these will be the dimension of this representation, this simple module, and times the index of this centralizer. The index of this centralizer. And so to look at an example, so this is the quaternion group of order eight. So these elements, if you look at the conjugacy classes, so the identity in R squared, they're central. Then you have these other two, other three conjugacy classes. And so then you look at the centralizer. Of course, for the elements in the center, the centralizer is the whole group. And then these. Group, and then these are all cyclic of order four. And so then you need the representations of the centralizer. And so here they're the four one-dimensional ones and one two-dimensional and so on. And these being cyclic, they're all one-dimensional. And then to get a basis for the module, I need a transversal over the centralizer. So from this, we can construct the 22 simple modules. Okay, and we just indexed them. Modules. Okay, and we just indexed them starting here with v0 and so on. This is the trivial module. So then I need to decompose tensor products. Okay, well, the nice thing about the representation theory of the Drinfeld double is it's a modular tensor category. So there's an associated S matrix that's unitary and symmetric, and its entries are indexed by these simple modules. And it can be Modules. And it can be computed from the character table of the group and the orders of the centralizers. So there's an algorithm. So you put Frank to work. So Frank does this because once you have this S matrix, then you can find the multiplicity of each one of these simples in the tensor product using the entries in this formula. Again, an algorithm. Formula, get an algorithm. Okay. And so, but then you want to know, you know, when can you, for which direct sums of these modules does it have the Riefeld condition where you repeatedly tensor and you get all of these, you know, 22 simple modules. Another program. Okay, so what we found, you know, finding the, first of all, finding the ones that satisfied the Riafel condition. Satisfied the Rieufeld condition, by repeatedly tensoring, it has to have only one, or if it only has one or two distinct simple modules, it'll not work. And so we then looked at just the ones that had three distinct simple modules. And all of those turned out to be six-dimensional modules. And so that's going to give us a six-dimensional, hopefully Art and Schultz or regular algebra. Now, the computer produced 224 of these. Produced 224 of these. We did not investigate all of them. Frank hasn't figured out how to do that yet. But for example, we looked at this one. I mean, so this shows kind of what you do. So this, you know, I said they were labeled from 0 to 21. So this particular one satisfies the Riefeld condition. I think you have to tensor it three or four times and you get everything. And you get everything. And so then I need to actually explicitly decompose these. So the S matrix will tell us which symbols are there and what their multiplicity is, but we have to actually then find these generators for all of these simple sum n. So for example, this V17 tensor V17, it's the sum of four one-dimensional models, where 17 and 20 is two two-dimensional ones. Two-dimensional ones. Now, because this tensor product is actually commutative, V17 tensor V20 is isomorphic to this. So you actually have the same simple modules in that decomposition. So that gives us another way to get to use these relations. We don't have to just take them by themselves. We can go across these isomorphic copies. Okay, so we're hoping to create a six-dimensional Artenschelter regular algebra. Artenschelter regular algebra. That means we need six, choose two. We need 15 relations. So we can play with these relations in order to try to get something that's Art and Shelter regular. And so we did. So these are relations that we found from the previous slide. And it turns out this gives us a trim double OR extension in the sense of Zhang Zhang of this commutative polynomial ring. A commutative polynomial ring. So it's Art and Shelter regular Kazoole on which this acts interfaithfully. So we also then wanted to see what the invariance looked like. And I mean, we have lots of parameters here, but it turns out if alpha is one, beta is one, and gamma is minus one, then it has trivial homological determinant. We get that actually from the superpotential. We get that actually from the superpotential. And so we choose that. And then just to make things simple, we make these other ones one. And so then we also were able to determine that this is Colabiao. And because it has trivial homological determinant, this invariant ring, it will be Artenschelter-Gorenstein. And so this again was basically by hand, finding all of the generators. All of the generators. So I should say we also did this with kind of the next one up, the dicyclic group of order 16. There we got an eight-dimensional Artenscheltzer regular algebra that was also a double OR extension. There we had our choice of 1,952 different modules that would give us interfaithal action. And we did not explore all of them. Explore all of them. So, what I've just done requires semi-simple. It's using this condition of reofold. But there's recent work looking at a non-semi-simple example, and that's what I want to talk about last. So, this is a work of Chen, Wang, and Zhang that's appeared. And so, the algebra that they looked at, this U, is the They looked at this U is the restricted enveloping algebra of a two-dimensional non-abelian Lie algebra, restricted Lie algebra, and it's in characteristic P. And so the dimension of this Huff algebra is P squared, and it's not semi-simple. So the algebra relations are these. It's got a nil potent element and this element and this commutator. The Huff structure is both the generator. Structure is both the generators are primitive. There are no non-trivial group-likes. So, this is very different from being group-related and seems like a good example to look at in characteristic P. So, I should say the Art and Schelter regular algebras of dimension three in characteristic P have not been classified. So, you know, you're sort of on your own trying to find these Art and Schultz regular, although you know, of course, or extensions. Although you know, of course, or extensions and other things will be. So, what they did in this paper was they found all the quadratic and shelter regular algebras of dimension two and three, which will support an interfaithful action. Okay. And so they do something similar to what we did in the semi-simple case, but of course it's not semi-simple. So you have to use indecomposables instead of simples. So again, if U is going to act on this graded algebra T, which I'm wanting to be Art and Scheltzer regular, the relations, and I want it to be quadratic, the relations are going to have to be in T1 tensor T1. And the degree one part and this ideal generated by those relations need to be U modules. So you need to know about U modules. So this particular Huff algebra has finite representation type, so there's only a finite number of So there's only a finite number of indecomposables, and they're given here explicitly. They're p squared of them. There's two parameters. L is the dimension which goes from 1 to p. And then there's a second parameter, I, that's in ZP. So there are p choices for it as well. And so ux, so if a basis of this L-dimensional module is X1 through XL, U takes X1 to X2, X2 to X3. X1 to X2, X2 to X3, and so on, and then kills the last one and Wx diagonally in this particular way. So those are the indecomposable modules. And so then they computed the green ring, I mean, which is analogous to the Grotendig ring. So you know what the relations are as you tensor these modules. And in particular, they're just interested in what T1 tensor T1 is in terms of these modules. In terms of these modules. And so then you still have to worry about interfaithful because you don't have Riafell's condition. But fortunately, there are not a lot of huff ideals, so they know what they are, and you just have to make sure those ideals don't kill it. And so the condition that they found for supporting an interfaithful action is that this T1 has to be a direct sum of modules with at least one sum and of dimension bigger than one. Of dimension bigger than one. Okay. And so with this information, they classified all of these quadratic Artenschelter regular algebras in dimensions two and three that support an interfaithful action. And so then suggested that one look at the invariant rings. And so I started on that work with this undergraduate who is now a first year graduate student at Indiana. So we did a Indiana. So we did about half of them. We didn't get them all finished. Okay, so what I should tell you what happens with dimension two. In dimension two, the only thing you get is a commutative polynomial ring, which of course does not happen in the semi-simple case by the Edding F-Walton theorem. And the invariant ring are all polynomials. So it's got the Shepherd-Todd type behavior in dimension two. So looking at in dimension two, So, looking at in dimension three, so it turns out they have 10 families. There's some interaction between the families. Some of them exist only in certain characteristics. But so again, with the dimension three, there's two possible actions. Either you cannot have three one-dimensionals. You either got to have a three-dimensional one or a two-dimensional one and a one-dimensional one. And of course, this will have one parameter. This will have two. This will have two. And so then they look at, I mean, with a lot of computation, I mean, it's just direct computation to see which ones will give you Art and Shelter regular algebras and what those algebras are. So just to give you a flavor of some of the ones that we did, which are maybe the easier ones. So the first example one is, again, you have a commutative polynomial ring and three variables, which doesn't happen in a semi-simple. Which doesn't happen in the semi-simple case. And so it can have an action of one three-dimensional module. And so you have a commutative polynomial ring. Then to compute the invariant ring, you need to figure out what U does to monomials. And then you have to worry about what it does to linear combinations of those. And it's relatively complicated. We didn't find explicitly what they were, but we did find a bound on the degrees. And it's actually a relatively And it's actually a relatively small bound. The Nerther bound for group actions is the order of the group. So here you might expect the vector space dimension, which is p squared, to be a bound. But in modular representation theory, it's actually bigger. It can be bigger than the Nerther bound. So it was actually nice here that the bound is actually linear. And so just to look at one example that Rachel did. So this is when P is 5. And so my bound. And so my bound then would be 12. So, in other words, we just have to figure out what happens to all the monomials of degree less than or equal to 12 and which linear combinations of invariance give you zero for both u and w. And then when p is five, there's five cases, depending on what that i is, because there's now just one parameter. And so when i is zero, there's what I think seven different invariants here. When i is one, it's down. When I is one, it's down to, what, five? When I is two, it's down to four. When I is three, it's a commutative polynomial ring. And in fact, in all the examples we looked at, there was at least one where you had the Shepherd-Todd-Chevolt behavior. And then in I equals four, there's four. So this is just for P equals five. Also on commutative, so the second part of example one, example one being commutative polynomial ring and three variables, you could also have a two-dimensional and a one-dimensional. So now you have two parameters. But it turns out in all cases, you get polynomial rings. So those are all basically Shepard-Todd examples. Again, which cannot happen in the semi-simple case by the Eddingoff-Wall theorem. So just to see some non-communicable So, just to see some non-commutative examples, and this is, I think, the only other one where you have a three-dimensional module. The other ones are two and one. So, this is a non-commutative ring. It's x2 and x3 commute, and then you have basically this derivation. These two also commute. And so, in each case, the fixed ring is commutative. So, this only happens in p equals 3. So, this is actually. In p equals 3. So, this is actually all the cases for this example. And so, again, I get one that's a commutative polynomial ring. And this one, it's easy to see as a hypersurface. This is going to be the relation of these. So, these invariants I've just written down here. Example three: so, this there's a derivation and an automorphism. So, now we're starting with the red. So now we're starting with the rest of them, which have a two-dimensional and a one-dimensional, but the parameters are related. I mean, there's various conditions in each for each different one. And so these variables commute. This is, you know, a Jordan plane type thing. This is a little different. And again, you get one that's regular, but not commutative. So you might say, well, this is a particular example, which it is. Which it is. I mean, modular invariant theory is bad enough as it is. So now you have to look at all possible Huff algebras. But I think this is actually a good example. So for example, Zhalocki showed that there's a Druinfeld twist of this particular U. And then by results of Richard Ninge and Jingting Wang, they've shown that this twist will give you the Radford algebra, which is this algebra, which now has a group-like. Now has a group-like, and the other is skew-primitive. And so, you should also then be able to twist those 10 algebras that James and his collaborators found, and this algebra should act on those interfaithfully by just doing the twist. The other nice thing about this example, they also showed that if this algebra is a sub-algebra, a Huff subalgebra. Algebra, a Huff subalgebra of any larger H, if H acts interfaithfully and homogeneously again on Natheri and Kazul AS regular dimension three, it's got to be one of the algebras that they found. There won't be any new algebras. There will be new actions, perhaps. We don't know that those are the actions, but it's those 10 algebras. Those are the only ones you have to look at for anything that contains you, which they say are. Which they say are a lot of the algebras that have been found in characteristic P. So that concludes. So, my theme is that in all of these cases, we used the group or the Huff algebra to actually construct the Art and Shelter algebra so that this Huff algebra acts on it. And so, thanks.
