To supergravity in high dimensions, you look for a solution of the form R1n, where time is some compact space, m, and you hopefully reduce down to a Yang-Mills plus supergravity theory in a lower dimension. So example of this has actually already came up in Andy Royston's talk yesterday, examples of this type. Imagine that you begin with a 10-dimensional Lagrangian, like the one shown here, Einstein-Hilbert term, some Young-Mills terms, plus lots of fermionic terms I'm not going to write. lots of fermionic terms I'm not going to write. And you look for solutions on something like R13 cross, for example, X6. The goal with this would be to produce a four-dimensional effective field theory. This is most interesting for physics, of course, because we think we live in four macroscopic dimensions. So you would be interested in things like perhaps, you know, particle interactions that you might see in nature and so on. The way that you produce this 4D theory is by integrating out, as again, was discussed. out, as again was discussed yesterday, what exactly we mean by integrate out. We're going to view this as a multi-dimensional integral, this guy right here, and you're going to integrate over the compact manifold and just reduce down to some Lagrangian theory at the classical level, which depends only on the 4D coordinates, but of course, implicitly on the form of the compact space you chose as a solution. And we're interested, in order to maintain control of the solution to string theory, we're interested in solutions that preserve supersymmetry. And solutions that preserve supersymmetry, specifically things like n equals one and n equals two SUSY in 4D. If you don't know what those words mean, don't worry about it. These are just symmetries that are going to constrain which types of Yang-Mels theories we're interested in, and I'll say more about those in a second. In general, in producing these 4D theories, the kinds of things that we tend to see as solutions for the equations of motion of the theory give you things like trace of the curvature equals zero, i.e., conditions for. Zero, i.e., conditions for a Ricci-flat solution. These are one typical example. In general, things that arise in string compactifications are X6, which are frequently, though not necessarily, complex manifolds, and SU3 structure-valued. The specific examples that I want to look at today were to specialize still further and look at, for example, SU3 holonomy manifolds. Holonomy manifolds. Here, of course, we have Ricci-Flat and Kayler. And C1 equals zero. Thanks to Yao's theorem, we know that this condition leads to a unique Ricci-flat metric. And these are, in my notation, a Calabi-Yau threefold. Okay, what kinds of properties of this lower dimensional theory can we? This lower dimensional theory can we obtain in the case that we choose x6 to be compact, complex, scalar, and smooth, a good manifold. It turns out you can specify almost everything you want to know about the 4D Yang-Mills theory in great exacting detail. So for example, the 4D states can be computed very explicitly. So here you have, for example, 4D scalar fields can be computed as Can be computed as related to fluctuations of the metric over the compact internal dimensions. So you solve equations for harmonicity of some forms. Excuse me, d star, t star omega equals zero. And these harmonic perturbations, harmonic perturbations, do not change your equations of motion, i.e. they preserve Richie flatness. And this, of course, leads to the well-known And this, of course, leads to the well-known metric moduli descriptions of elements of H1TX harmonic representatives inside tangent and holomorphic tangent and cotangent bundles in the case of a Calabiao. These are the independent Hodge numbers in the case of a Calabiao threefold H21H11. So as just a simple example, we can compute massless states. If we get fancier, we can compute couplings. And the point I want to make about this is simply that in the case that I have smooth, compact manifolds, especially Kayla. Smooth, compact manifolds, especially Kaler, I can sort of control everything I want to control about the effective theory. A quick aside that will be relevant later. You have likely heard the words in lots of talks already of dualities. And the basic idea here is that starting from these simple higher dimensional theories, you can reduce on geometries such that you obtain the same effective theory in lower dimensions. So, e.g., imagine that you begin with theory one and theory two. And theory two. And let's say this is in D dimensions, just as an example. And you want to reduce both of these theories on an S1 down to some D minus one dimensional theory, where you get here same theory in one lower dimension. This theory may be the same theory up to field relabeling. For example, the classic example of T duality. Example of t-duality is where r goes to 1 over r under a field redefinition, and you have the same theory with different values of the same parameters coming from two distinct higher dimensional theories. The reason I mention this is this is a powerful way to be able, if you know that you have one theory that you can get from two different origins, you can compute lots of stuff about it in a concrete way. Observations like this type of duality, of course, observations like this in physics led Observations like this in physics led to things like observations of mirror symmetry for Calabiaus, and then, of course, later generalized to homological mirror symmetry. Cyberg duality has already made an appearance in some talks this week, etc. So we will be on the lookout for reductions of string theories that have related geometries for which we can also calculate stuff. So as a very quick summary, the types of manifolds that are going Quick summary: the types of manifolds that are going to make an appearance in this subject of dimensional reduction, which satisfy the string equations of motion. One large class that has been of a lot of interest for the last 20 years is special holonomy manifolds. And in particular, SU3 holonomy, I've already mentioned this is the case of Clabia threefolds or real six-dimensional manifolds. Examples that can produce sort of realistic physics that people are interested in in In four dimensions. Let me just catalog this here. This would be an X8, X7, F theory, and M theory. All of these lead to a minimal form of supersymmetry, which is known as n equals one supersymmetry in 4D. So these theories can be dual to each other through a variety of means like I just highlighted above. Here I've listed different types of string theory compactified on different special holonomy manifolds can lead to the same effective physics and load. Can lead to the same effective physics in low dimensions. That effective physics is very interesting, or rather, the possible effective physics you can get in four dimensions is of great interest to physicists. So, specifically, what we're interested in from a physics perspective is to be able to catalog. We want to know what effective field theories can arise in a string context in lower dimensions. And of course, this is going to be directly correlated to the question of what geometries. What geometries? Now, I just mentioned that already for smooth manifolds, geometries with special holonomy of the type that I'm highlighting here, these are already extremely complex beasts. So we don't know, for example, if there's a finite number of topological types of Calabia threefolds. This is unknown. G2 manifolds, we know overall a fairly limited number of examples with actual Ricci-flat metrics, Joyce orbifolds being a key example. Being a key example, but compact examples are extremely rare. Calabiao fourfolds, even attempts to build sort of systematic toric constructions of these have rapidly outpaced computer power. So this is a pretty open question about the topological characterization of these spaces and sort of a minimal model type program and their metrics lots is still not understood. But it's about to get worse. So I just highlighted for you sort of a classical dimensional reduction in which I talk about smooth geometries. But what I really About smooth geometries. But what I really want to focus on today, in the spirit of this question of what possible effective field theories can arise, is actually what happens in limits of the geometry where things become singular. So let me just make a quick aside, because you may hear this terminology. A lot of excitement in string theory at the moment is centered around something called the Swampland program. And it's exactly the question of which effective field theories can be completed to string theory at higher energy. To string theory at higher energy. And this, a lot of sort of general properties of quantum gravity are being tried. You know, physicists are trying to extract general properties of quantum gravity from this question. So classification problems in geometry are of a great deal of interest in physics at the moment because we want to know, again, which effective field theories. Okay, that's an aside. What's the punchline that I need to say more precisely? So the big butt here is that frequently Frequently, we must consider, frequently need singular varieties in string compactifications. So not smooth SUN or exceptional holonomy manifolds. Instead, we need singular limits of these. And the link to these has already been talked about in Andy Royston's talk yesterday. This has to do with non-perturbative effects in string theory, so-called brain dynamics. So examples, Calabiao Enfold. Calabiao enfolds. These within the subject of F-theory involve the geometrization of seven brain dynamics. These are solitonic solutions that are of the theory that are boundary conditions for open string states. Again, if you're not familiar with this, just hang on there a second because I'll just turn this into geometry and we won't have to think about what the brain is in the full string context. G2 is a particularly strong example for G2 holonomy manifolds. In fact, you can show that you will only ever achieve non-abelian gauge theories with chiral matter if you have singular G2 manifolds that exhibit both codimension four and seven singularities. And there are no compact examples in literature known with the right combination of singularities to produce interesting physics in four dimensions. Okay, the claim that I'm making without That I'm making without much justification yet is that within the context of the full string theory, including these non-perturbative effects, we must consider compactifications of string theory on singular spaces. So now the question of what exactly counts the states of the theory, what controls the effective physics that I would write down, is a much more complicated question. And that's what I want to highlight some work on in this talk. So in particular, we want to know in for singular geometries. In for singular geometries, we want to ask what states in the physical theory, couplings, basically any properties of the effective physics you can think of, how do I determine it? And I want to just illustrate one very simple example that dates back to, again, the early 90s. So, simplest example might be the sort of Might be the sort of mildest singularity that I can think of in the Calabiao context, which is the so-called conifold singularity, i.e., nodal singularities, in Calabiao threefolds. And here the picture is that within a Calabia threefold, I can consider two different smooth collabia threefolds. We'll say Calabia threefold one, and I'm going to draw it this way. CY32, which share a common singular point in their moduli space. This is supposed to be singular and spiky. From this direction, this is the so-called deformation side of the conifold. You can reach a singular point in moduli space by collapsing S3s to zero, i.e., deforming to a singular point in the complex structure of the threefold. And coming this way, CY32 is actually a small resolution of, so resolve side of the complex. So, resolve side of the conifold. In this direction, I can shrink S2s to zero, and I can hit the same singular point from two distinct collapsibals. Now, you could ask, from the point of view of either of these smooth manifolds, either the resolved or deformation side of the conifold, what's the effective physics of the singular point? And how do I sort of control that geometrically or field theoretically? This was done, first studied by Strominger and company in the early 90s. Strominger and Strominger et al. And they showed that from constraints due to supersymmetry, they could find exactly what the extra light states at this singular limit had to look like. What they find is an enhanced U1 symmetry, simplest singularity, simplest gauge theory to come with it, at singular points. And at that, they find an extra supersymmetric multiplet charged under the C1, which leads to a branch in the To a branch change in the effective theory, the so-called Higgs and Coulomb branch of the theory, which are just giving VEVs or vacuum expectation values to two different scalar fields. So again, if you don't know much about vacuum expectation values, simply this is just a branch change in the solutions. And of course, geometrically, each of these sides can be shown to match exactly to the deformed or resolved side of the conifold. So these are two different clobby. Of the conifold. So these are two different collabiaos, two different smoothings of a collabiao, either a small resolution or a smoothing through complex structure, which share this singular point. At the singular point, you can show using physics that we have we're dealing with an enhanced U1. Okay, how would you handle that geometrically? So how would you know just from a geometric point of view that that was what you should expect? Well, you can ask, so from a geometric perspective, you can consider limiting behavior of either the deformation or resolution side of the conifer. Deformation or resolution side of the conifold, and you can try and track what happens to the geometry in the singular limit. Specifically, limiting mixed Hodge structures show you that the Jacobian turns into a C star M minus R vibration over the Jacobian of the resolution, this is resolution, where here M is the number of conifold. M is the number of conifold points, singularities, i.e., the number of nodal singularities, and r is the number that are independent. So here this is related to the Hodge number change across this transition, this geometric transition, where you say h11 of x tilde is h11 of x deformation plus m minus r. So these are the number of essentially independent conifold points appearing in the Essentially, independent conifold points appearing in the geometry. Can you say a word about where this vibration comes from? Good. So, this is, I'm sweeping a lot under the rug. So, in a limiting mixed Hodge structure analysis, you have to decide which way you're going to approach the singularity. So, as drawn here, I'm actually asking what happens to the mixed Hodge structures as I come from the resolution side. So, I'm shrinking the S2 to zero. And one can do that analysis and see that there's essentially an extra degree of freedom. Essentially, an extra degree of freedom, the C star. So, per conifold, in the simple case, we could just talk about one. You get an extra C star's worth of degree of freedom, and it's actually universal for the choice of smoothing, which is sort of what generates the vibration over the resolution side. You label the branches, which is X, which is X tilde. Good, thank you. So, the Higgs branch, this is X deformation, and this is what I'm calling X tilde. This is the resolution side. The resolution side. Okay, I don't want to get into the details of this calculation just yet because I'm going to save it for a bit more of the non-abelian case in just a second, but this is sort of the mildest Galabiao singularity one can consider. There's a nice physics interpretation in terms of abelian gauge symmetry, and the interpretation of this is of degrees of freedom associated to these brains, these non-perturbative effects, wrapping collapsing cycles. So in the case here, we're wrapping S2s and Here we're wrapping S2s and versus S3s. Okay, so new light degrees of freedom coming from collapsing cycles. The technology to describe this more generally in a non-abelian case is something called brain world volume theories, which tell you that there is associated to these singularities, there are so-called local Yang-Mills theories. Associated to the sort of the complement of the singularity within the geometry. So, for example, if you have an ADE singularity fibered over a curve, you can talk about a local Yang-Mills theory living on that curve inside of a Calabiao geometry. That'll be one of the key examples I do in just a moment. But as an example, let's consider a seven-brain wrapped on R14 cross S. R14 across S in 4D and equals 1 theories, this would be a complex twofold. And this would lead to a Yang-Mills theory living over S. This leads to a so-called topologically twisted Yang-Mills theory. And specifically, these topologically twisted Yang-Mills theories lead to things that look very familiar to all the ingredients we've been. Familiar to all the ingredients we've been talking about this week. These lead to over a sub-variety in the space, you end up with gauge fields and Higgs fields localized to this higher codimensional system. So specifically, we end up with things like Higgs bundles, i.e. pairs, A mu phi, as I will define in a bit more precision here for various examples. So the two that are the most sort of poorly understood and of the most interest. Poorly understood and of the most interest to physicists are local Higgs bundles in 40n equals 1 again. Let me say that. Here we can find through Calabia fourfold singularities. We end up with a version of the Hitchin system, sometimes called the Waffa-Witten system. This has already made an appearance, I think, in CG's talk earlier this week. CG's talk earlier this week. But we end up with configurations of gauge fields and Higgs fields satisfying equations like the following. F02 holomorphic on some Kayler surface phi star phi is zero. We're here JS is a Kayler form on S, my On S, my Kayler surface, and phi is an element of here is the catch, not quite what it would be if this was a straight Hitchen system as studied by, for example, Simpson, but actually still twisted by the canonical bundle of the surface, anti-canonical bundle, excuse me. So this is sometimes called Boffa-Witten system. This system is the local degrees of freedom associated to Calabia Forfei. Freedom associated to collabia fourfold singularities. You get a very similar thing from G2 compactifications, and this is F theory for those who are interested, and M theory, where you can have a threefold, for example, of ADE singularities inside a seven-manifold. So here the local data takes the form of DAφ. I'm going to call this Pant of Witten just to Of Witten, just to distinguish it from the phi I wrote at left. DA star phi pw equals zero, and F is panda Witten, phi Panda Witten. So this is on some real three-dimensional surface Q3. And here the phi is an element of H1 endomorphisms of some bundle tensor. Of some bundle tensor TQ3 dual. Okay, let me shrink this slightly. So, what am I trying to say with these systems? Within a general, so I gave the conifold as sort of a simple toy model, within more general singularities, for example, ADE singularities appearing in either SUN holonomy or G2 holonomy manifolds, string theory tells you that these singularities come equipped with Hitchin-type systems over subspaces of your single. Over subspaces of your singular variety. For example, over a complex surface in the case of Calabia fourfolds degenerating, and over a real surface, a real three-dimensional surface in the case of G2 manifolds. Now, physicists are extremely interested in what the space of solutions look like. So if you understood the moduli space of these theories, this would be great. What we do know is that the sort of expected dimension of the solution set is zero, because for both of these systems, these can have obstructions in their infinite. These can have obstructions in their infinitesimal moduli space, but sort of all information about these moduli spaces that is of interest to physics. This is, however, only part of the story that I need. So what I really have to have a handle on is I need to be able to understand how a system like this fits nicely within the context of the complete degrees of freedom that would arise from the string dimensional reduction. So let me try and give a concrete example. And give a concrete example that's a little easier than the two systems I just wrote down to sort of illustrate the moduli problem that I would like to understand better. So, easier starting point. Rather than considering four-dimensional effective theories, I can actually back up to six-dimensional theories. And an example is that I can get honest Hitchin systems systems. Systems. Within degenerate limits of Calabia threefolds, these are associated to R15 physics, which I will not talk about in detail, but this is F-theory in six dimensions. Here the picture is that I have a Calabia threefold. I'll actually be interested in compact Calabia threefolds, but we can consider even a non-compact limit for a moment with a curve of ADE singularities. ADE singularities. So specifically, I'll be interested in X3s that are elliptically fibered over some base complex surface B2. And where that elliptic fiber degenerates, this has been classified by Kadira and Tate in great detail. And I could have mentioned one in the base. We have ADE classification. So I can have over some base surface B2 over the general point. I have my T2 fiber. And I will have a discriminant locus where this pinches off in assorted ways. Off in assorted ways in various numbers of p1s, and we'll call that delta singular elliptic fibers. And these can be an ADE curve of singularities associated to delta inside B2. In this case, for Calabia threefolds and this type of elliptic degeneration, This type of elliptic degeneration, what you can show is that here we have for the local degrees of freedom, these are the enhanced states associated to the singularity or the brain. What we have is actually the Hitchin system, which we have heard a lot about already this week. And phi is in H1 and V tensor case equal to delta uncle A. Delta, I'm calling it. So this is a pair V and phi, or I should say A and Phi. Sorry. A and phi, where A is a connection on some bundle V. This satisfies the Hitchin system. As we've already seen, Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence. We can view this as V, a polystable. Higgs bundle as the solution. The ingredients to this system that are supplied by physics are not always the sort of smooth Hitchen system for smooth curves and gauge fields and Higgs fields over them. Instead, in general, we can have parabolic Hitchin systems or even wild Hitchin systems in which we have Systems in which we have A Phi developing poles of various orders. So I'll say a little bit more about what pole structure I'm interested in. Just to say that the sort of physics interpretation of where these poles come from is the fact that the discriminant locus of the degenerate elliptic vibration that is generating this local brain dynamics actually has multiple components. In general, that discriminant is reducible. Discriminant is reducible and non-reduced. And at these intersection points, we actually have multiple components to the discriminant, which each of which sort of carry its own Hitchin system, which is correlated. So there's different solutions across each component. And you can write that in terms of one component. So on one piece, we can view this as sort of sourcing the Hitchin system from the other solutions. From the other solutions where we have things of this type and you see some point P, these are localized one, one currents. Specifically, mu R and mu C as written the source terms. As written, the source terms form a triplet of adjoint-valued moment maps. Okay, so as we've already heard lots of discussion of the Hitchin system in various talks this week, I don't have to say quite a lot about this, but as we know, the Hitchin moduli space is Is an interesting moduli space. This has a nice hitchhine vibration, which will play a central role in what I'm about to say. H is a mapping. Can I ask about the previous one? When you have multiple components, how do you couple the kitchen systems on different components? Exactly. So that basically what I'm doing is from the point of view of one piece, I am hiding the solution on its intersecting components with Intersecting components with these moment maps. So there is correlated conditions across each one. In general, this is a real mess to solve exactly. And what people have done so far is look for examples where either nothing intersects, which will be the primary example I'm talking about, or you just focus on one and simply consider all intersections to be marked points from the point of view of that Higgs bundle. And you ignore the solutions on the other components, you just choose not to solve them, and you look for any solution. To solve them, and you look for any solution, any data for that parabolic Hitchin system that makes sense on one piece, and then you try and worry about solving the other pieces later. But in general, this is, yeah, there's a lot to be understood about how to couple together such wildly degenerate configurations. This is very close to the problem of studying instantons on the modular spaces that Laura was talking about this morning. Very much, yes. And then that relates to slings. And there we know how to couple them. Yeah, I mean, this would be interesting to see. Yeah, I mean this would be interesting to see if the solution. I mean there's been a limited look at this in literature, but I'd be interested to see if the solutions look the same. I would expect they would. I mean it seems like the technology is very similar. Good. Okay. So here I'm writing this in the A-type example Hitchin fibration. So here I'm going to say C is one component of my discriminant. Is one component of my discriminant from the previous example. As we've already heard in the talk earlier this afternoon, this moduli space is hypercaler. It admits a trio of complex structures. And the thing that I am interested in within this moduli space in particular are sort of several features. Of course, I can consider spectral equations as part of this structure. Let me just write this down. Just write this down. So phi minus lambda i is zero. The spectral data of Higgs bundles is, it plays a very nice role within embedding these degrees of freedom into the global geometry, as I'll come back to in just a second. But there are, of course, singular fibers to the Hitchin fibration for which the spectral data becomes degenerate, i.e., nilpotent solutions. i.e., no-potent solutions like Hitchens' classic example, something like this. These no-potent solutions will not appear through the spectral data, and these will pose an interesting question about embedding in a global geometry. I'm getting slightly ahead of myself, so let me just mention one other thing. As we've already heard in previous talks, the fibers of the Hitchen map, of course, are the Jacobians of the spectral curve. This is an algebraically complete integrable system that we'll need to return to in just a moment. Now, the moment. Now the links to the physics phi in general, keep changing between capital and lowercase phi's, phi parameterizes transverse motion of the seven brain within X. So within the Calabia threefold. An example of this is that locally the spectral curve dot phi minus lambda i equals zero is very equals zero is very close to a deformation of the local geometry. So local deformation of the singular geometry x3. So as an example of this, let me consider a local E8 singularity. I write this simply because it's an easy one to write down quickly. E8 singularity, which is of the form y squared is x cubed plus. x cubed plus z to the fifth, singularity at z equals zero. And within the point of view of the Calabiao geometry, I can view this as a singular description of an elliptic fiber. This can be deformed from E8, say, to an E7 singularity by turning on another term in the description of the elliptic vibration. And this course. And this corresponds within, say, an SU2-valued phi to the spectral data of turning on a phi, which looks something like phi squared one, zero. So just to unpack that, SU2 times E7 is, of course, a subgroup of E8. By turning on a Higgs field that's valued in SU2, I can break In SU2, I can break E8 to E7 at the level of the Clavier geometry that corresponds to deforming in the complex structure, i.e., changing the singular equation. At the level of the local brain degrees of freedom, this looks like finding a solution of the Hitchin system with a Higgs field that is SU2 valued. So in general, this is an SU2 example. In this case, phi squared is quadratic Casimir invariant. Casimir invariant of the SU2 valued phi SU2 valued phi. In general, the general story is that chasm-mere invariance of phi for any group correspond to complex structure of x3, i.e., local deformations of the singular Calabier threefold. Now, this is very Now, this is very loose and simply from an interpretation of the geometry as, you know, these brains wrapping cycles. What does this correspond to in terms of sort of the degrees of freedom of the physical theory? But I'm already hinting at a deeper correspondence. So I'm claiming that for any singularity within a special holonomy or exceptional holonomy manifold, that I can interpret a local gauge theory as living near it through these local Hitchin systems. And I'm claiming that the model. Systems, and I'm claiming that the moduli of these Hitchin systems, i.e., the degrees of freedom of the complexified connection, should appear in the Calabia moduli space in some way. So, this is ripe to be said more precisely. And fortunately, the first steps in this direction were taken by Danagi, Dayakanasku, and Pantev, who provided a very nice explanation of more formally how does one map from the local data. map from the local data of the Hitchin system into, in this case, the Calabia data. So what you need is to find sort of a transition function to map the local moduli space to the global one for the compact geometry. And specifically, we want to understand the limiting behavior of some flat family, perhaps flat, perhaps not actually, but a flat family moving from smooth manifolds towards a singular limit. limit. So what did these guys consider? So specifically their setup was to consider non-compact, to begin with, CY3s, built as the normal cones of a curve of ADE singularities. So let sigma be a Riemann surface. We're going to fiber ADE singularities over sigma and take the total space of that in order to form a non-compact Clabier threefold. A non-compact Calabia threefold. And what these gentlemen studied was the behavior of the so-called Calabiao integrable system. And this was first studied by Denagi and Markman. So, what is a Calabiao integrable system? In the case of a Calabiao threefold, this is a mapping of This is a mapping of the Calabia moduli space onto the complex structure. And the fibers of the Calabiao integrable system are the so-called intermediate Jacobians. These are abelian varieties. Your colibio is compact or not? In the case that Dunagi and company, we're considering non-compact. And company were considering non-compact. Yeah, Donaghi and Martman consider compact, so it's not in general abelian variety in their case. Thank you. Yes. Not in general an abelian variety. One has to be more careful there. Okay. So intermediate Jacobian. Two one. And in the smooth case, this is how it's defined, from the point of view of physics, these two pieces, i.e. the complex structure of the variety and its intermediate Jacobian, have a very strong physics interpretation. So, for those of you that have seen some things in string theory before, in type 2a language, these would be called. Type IIA language, these would be called the complex structure moduli and the Ramon-Ramon moduli. These form halves of hypermultiplets of hypermultiplet scalars in effective theory in the 6D EFT. So as you might expect within the actual physical theory that you're getting in six dimensions, in this case from this dimensional reduction, there's a metric. This dimensional reduction. There's a metric, excuse me, there's a moduli space that is also a hypercaler, and of course, it reflects the geometric moduli space. So these are well-understood degrees of freedom from the point of view of the physical theory. Now, in the interest of time, I'm not going to go through the details of this, but what Dinagi, Diakonescu, and Pantiv show very nicely is by looking at the limiting behavior of a degeneration to this curve of ADE singularities, they argue that away from singular fibers, Singular fibers to these two fibrations, the Calabiao integrable system can be identified with the Hitchin integrable system. Where the identification of moduli is very much what I sketched very loosely up here. Notice the deformation of the local Hitchin system corresponds to local Corresponds to local deformations of the singular geometry. In this case, same sort of intuitive picture there, although much more carefully phrased. So this raises an interesting question now. The case that we're actually interested in for physics are compact collabia geometries, and we're interested now in how these moduli spaces talk to one another in a global sense. So with my So, with my collaborators, Jonathan Heckman and Sheldon Katz, and then later with Laura Shaposnik, what we asked was: can we extend the results of DDP to the compact case, compact setting. And specifically, we considered only A-type singularities to start with, just to make life easier. And again, omitting details for the point of view. Omitting details for the point of view of this overview, our result was that indeed this carries through in a precise way, and that instead of being a strict isomorphism, what we find is an embedding of the Hitchin moduli space into a singular limit of the Calabian moduli space. So the picture is as follows. And I'll define what I mean by these ingredients. Up here. So here, H is the Hitchin moduli space. M tilde complex is the complex structure moduli space of the resolved geometry. So here, just like in the conifold case, I'm going to do a minimal resolution of the geometry rather than. A minimal resolution of the geometry rather than a deformation. M is the full moduli space. And M local is the moduli of the local theory, i.e. the singularity preserving deformations. So what we see is that the bottom map here is the Hitchin map. What we see is that we have a sort of well-understood embedding of the Hitchin system within the compact Calabia moduli space. Now, this is useful in this setting, but it is far from complete. And what I want to spend my last couple minutes of this talk sort of highlighting is not the details of how we argued this or sort of what the correspondence was, but where this leads to interesting open questions about solutions to Hitchen types. About solutions to Hitchin type systems and the special holonomy manifolds that are sort of carrying them along for the ride. So good. And just to say, actually, never mind. I won't say that. I'll save it. All right. So let's do an example just to give a flavor for what types of things one wants to understand. An eg of the compact geometry that we would consider. That we would consider. We looked at, for example, Calabia three folds, which are elliptically fibered over Hertz-Bruck surfaces. These are in turn P1 fibered over P1, P1 bundles. Here I'm going to denote the two sections of a Hertz-Bruch surface, independent sections or disjoint sections as Z and Z prime. In terms of divisor classes, there are sections of this type, which square to plus and minus n, etc. etc. f squared is zero for such a geometry we can describe the fiber as a p1236 hypersurface over carrying with it information about the base vibration i.e we can describe this geometry by a so-called Feierstrauss model which always exists for elliptic vibrations so we can write y is So we can write y squared is x cubed plus fx plus g, where f is a global section of b k b to the minus 4 in general and g in k b to the minus 6. These conditions are to guarantee collabiow. And in my case here, B is going to be a Hertzberg surface. For physically interesting geometries, Physically interesting geometries, I need n bounded by 12. Okay, so examples of this type: the discriminant in this notation is going to take the form 4f cubed plus 27g squared equals zero. In general, delta can be a union of some curve ci, as we mentioned before. And here, f is a global section of a particular degree in the Hertz-Bruck surface. Hertz-Brook surface, h plus 8 minus 4nf and g likewise. Okay, so I have some explicit Clabia threefold. I have some explicit discriminant. Let me play the same game I was playing before and ask now, I have an E8 singularity tuned in this geometry, or I tune the complex structure. I tune the complex structure. So let's be in the patch z prime equals one. So this will be located at z equals zero on the section to the Hertzbrook vibration. And in terms of these global degrees, then y squared is x cubed plus g 12 plus n z to the fifth, where this is the degree over p1 base of the Hertzbrook surface. Okay, as we saw before. As we saw before in my sort of toy example, this can be deformed to E7 singularities. And again, I'm choosing E8 and E7 because they're quick to write down. And I have an SU2 Higgins solution, which is easy that I'll relate to in just a second. So this guy can be deformed X in the following way. In the following way. This deformation in complex structure, we claim, is associated to a local solution, local Higgs bundle with a parabolic solution for a phi, which in the case at hand would take the form 0f8 plus n g12 plus n. This is schematic. Something which has poles at the 12 plus n points associated to the zeros of this polynomial and zeros at the A plus n points associated to this guy. Phi here is parabolic and mapping from E tensor K C twisted by these are polynomials in Z, correct? These are polynomials in the coordinates of the These are polynomials in the coordinates of the p1 base. So, yeah, I didn't label those, but we could call those u, for example. So, here z equals zero is the section to the Hertzabruk surface. So I have a two-dimensional base to my elliptic vibration. Z equals zero is a P1 base of that Hertzbrook surface. And then these are polynomials over P1. So the point is relating here the same type of ingredients as were in Laura Fredrickson talk. This is good, Laura Fredrickson's talk. Talk. This is good. Laura Fredrickson's talk. This is going to be SU2 parabolic Higgs bundles that are defined over P1 with marked points. And specifically, I'm going to be interested in 12 plus N marked points. So you can think of it as E8 type granular singularity than fibered over U-plane, correct? Yes. Okay. So a couple of comments. A couple of comments. In the limit that epsilon goes to zero, this goes to a nilpotent solution. This is just one of the singular fibers in Hitchens vibration that could be of interest. These are interesting from the point of view of physics because the physical theory would still be E7 because the presence of this SU2-valued Higgs field is breaking gauge symmetry. But from the point of view of the singular geometry, this would return to looking like E8. So these are examples where. So, these are examples where, from the geometry, you would see one sort of ambient symmetry, but for the field configuration of the physical theory, you will actually break more symmetry due to the configuration or rather the value of the fields in the intermediate Jacobian. This type of solution has a special name. These are so-called T-brain solutions within F-theory, and there have been lots of papers exploring this, so I mention the aside. What we see in compact examples is that although the DDP correspondence avoided the singular fibers. Avoided the singular fibers of the Hitchin fibration. This appears to actually still hold for singular fibers. I.e., we reach a sort of well-understood point in the moduli space of the Calabia moduli space, even though this is on the discriminant of the Hitchin vibration. And the other things that we can see is that the location of Of the marked points, marked points on P1 in this case, for this Hitchin system are actually part of the moduli space. They are part of the Calabia moduli space and hence should have some interpretation as you begin to move those points as some extension of the parabolic Higgs bundle moduli space. Though I have not looked at this in detail, and this is something I've asked. Detail, and this is something I've asked Laura Fredrickson and Rafe about. But this is an interesting question: how does one actually talk about hitch and modulized-based metrics or other ingredients when you add the location as part of the data that you're free to vary? I should say that, yeah, the physics is sort of nicely behaved even into the nil potent limit. I made that point. Also, as a quick assignment, Also, as a quick aside, since I'm running out of time, I should mention here I'm focusing on the Calabiao case. Quick aside, the same type of structure in the example of G2 and metric deformations, there was a very nice paper in January by Roger and Lorenzo, who are both at this meeting, looking at so I'll say Velowski and Foscolo. And Foscolo looked at a very similar set of ideas to what I'm describing here, studying deformations of hyperkalar cone metrics in the case of G2, non-compact, and linking to, so hyperkalar cone metrics in the G2 case, and a very nice twister construction of these, linking these to deformations of the panto. Of the Pentev-Weinholt system. So I won't talk about that in any detail, ask those guys, but it's a lovely paper and cool that these same set of ideas are extending to the case of G2 metrics, at least in the non-compact setting, just like you can do this for the Calabiao metrics. So I am running out of time, but let me just try and mention a couple of open questions that might be of interest to people with the toolkit that are. Interest to people with the toolkit that are at this meeting. So, as I've already mentioned, one of the things that seems to happen very naturally within this geometry is that you see locations of the poles can change and that this should be a sort of pole location is a natural part of some Kuiper Kaler moduli space. Hypercaler moduli space location part of both the physical and the collabial hypercalar moduli space. So the interpretation of that from the point of view of Hitchin systems would be interesting to have a better handle on. In the paper with Lara Shapoznik, we actually made a conjecture about We actually made a conjecture about this. We expected that the moduli space of parabolic Hitchin systems with n-marked points should admit some sort of flat morphism into the moduli space of wild Hitchen systems with, say, a single pole of order n. A pole of order n. This is just one extreme limit. You should actually be able to bring poles together in any sequence you like and be able to interpret those sort of limits in moduli space. I should say there is assorted work in the literature on related questions of the confluence of simple poles into higher order poles for these types of objects. And I'm going to make an incomplete list of people who have thought about this. Jacques. Thought about this. Jacques, who is here, and in the also participants here, Laura and Steve, in the case of hyperpolygons, I think have looked at related questions. The other thing that I just sort of sketched was a limit between Clabiao threefolds and Hitchin systems over curves, either parabolic or wild. Either parabolic or wild. Obviously, these Wafa-Witten system, if we want to call it that, or i.e., Hitchen system, Hitchen-type systems over complex surfaces on S complex Kayler surface. This should have a correspondence with the moduli space of Calabiao fourfolds. Calabia of fourfolds. And this is what Jonathan, Ron Antonio, and I have started thinking about a bit more precisely. This is way harder because these are just Kaler moduli spaces, not hyper Kaler, and you have a lot less control of sort of the details of the moduli space. You'll no longer have integrable systems. You'll no longer have unobstructed moduli spaces. So, what you can say here is a little bit harder, but this is something that we would like to understand better. And even a more modest question. Even a more modest question are: What can we say in terms of when we expect solutions for any of these systems to exist? So, for example, can we in any of these settings bound given a base, sorry, given a Riemann surface or a complex surface for one of these Hitchin systems, can we bound poles in terms of number, order of pole, et cetera, that we expect to exist in the compact setting? In the compact setting, when will we expect the moduli space to be empty? So, in the case of Waffa-Witten systems, for example, can we argue that for certain topologies of certain surfaces and Higgs bundles over them that there will or won't be a moduli space? And for nilpotent solutions, solutions/slash singular fibers, we're interested in exactly what limits are sort of. In exactly what limits are sort of physically meaningful and/or finite distances in moduli space, we know already in the case of T-brain solutions in F-theory that you can have non-crepent singularities in the case of collabiat geometries, so i.e. things that are not collabio-resolvable. These moduli spaces, I should say, there's been work by Tanaka and Thomas and other people on this, but these are still quite a lot of Quite a lot of open questions, and what can we say about obstruction theory in general? All of these are interesting questions. So there's more I can say about this. I'll save it for the discussion session since I'm out of time. But what is the conclusion? Certainly, to me, when I first started working on this, I was surprised that special holonomy manifolds and geometry. And geometries and their moduli spaces have such a strong correspondence with Hitchin-type systems. Their moduli spaces, the metrics on those moduli spaces, have a lot to teach us about each other. And I think this is a field that is in general just beginning to be explored in earnest in a mathematically appropriate way. So I hope this rather quick survey will have at least intrigued some people to use some of the technology they know already, perhaps to say some things in this context. So I will stop. In this context. So I will stop there and thank you for your patience. Any questions? Where is your general result for compact Calibri R3folds? I somehow missed it because you switched to physics language and I didn't understand. Let me find where I. So let me find where I drew this. So the general result is that we have an embedding of the Hitchin moduli space into the moduli space of the Calabia threefold for the case of A-type singularities in the compact setting. We expect this will hold more generally, but those were the ones that we looked at. For any Calabia threefold? Sorry, no. So these are Calabia threefolds with an A-type set of singularities fibered over a Riemann surface. And specifically the context. And specifically, the context we did not rely on the elliptic vibrations, but that was the context we had in mind when we studied these. Yep. And I believe Florian Beck, I think, has looked at this similar results to ours for other types of singularities. I think D and E type. I don't know if he's published yet, but yeah, some confusion. Yeah, I somehow confused indeed because any compact Calabia threefold does not give a polarized abelian variety. Sorry, yes, no, more generally one has to talk about the prims. Yeah, okay. No, this is, yeah, I agree that was misleading of me to say it that way. So sorry. Yeah, but the claim is that the Calabiao integrable system in general can be identified with the Hitchin integrable system. At least, so in this case, not a full isomorphism as in the non-compact case, but. Full isomorphism is in the non-compact case, but an embedding. All right, any other questions? Okay, in that case, let's thank Lara again and proceed to the discussion. Thank you, Lara. All right, I'll see you all in Sokoko in the discussion room. We're not having a moderated discussion? I was just wondering that, too. Well, we can try it here. People have already vanished. Well, let's give people five minutes to walk around Sokoko and stretch their muscles and then get them back here. I certainly have many questions to Lara after this talk. I certainly have many questions till there are the talk. May I ask a question to Laura? Like, in what kind of theorem are you going to prove related to the VAP operation system and CalabiL4? Great. So what we expect is that we need data. So just like in the Calabia 34. So, just like in the Calabia threefold case, the data of the complex structure deformations of the local Calabia fourfold, i.e., the local singular Calabia fourfold, those should map to, again, Casimir invariance of the Higgs field over your complex surface. Now, that correspondence works exactly the same way, regardless of dimension. Now, you have the sort of the extra data of
