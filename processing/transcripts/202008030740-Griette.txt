So it's perfect right now, yes. Okay, that's nice. Okay, so good afternoon, everyone. So I'm saying good afternoon because I'm here in France, but I guess I should say good morning to people listening in Canada and the Americas, and good evening to people in Asia. So I'm Contain Guillet, I'm an associate professor at the University of Bordeaux, and Bordeaux, and so I'm going to present a model, a kind of a hyperbolic Keller-Siegel equation. So, before I start, I should stress that Ker-La-Siegel, we use the name Keller-Siegel because of some similarity with the chemotaxis model, but we don't have really a chemotaxis in mind, and it's going to be a model for repulsion, actually. So, we wanted to model the motion of. Model the motion of not bacteria but cells in a petri dish. And in particular, we managed to prove the existence of a sharp discontinuous traveling wave, which is relatively unusual. And so this is a joint work with Xiao Ming Fu, who was a PhD student at the University of Bordeaux when we started this work. Started this work, so now he's a postdoctoral fellow in Shanghai, I think. And Pierre Magall, who is a colleague and a collaborator, and he's actually the one who figured out the model. So before I start with the mathematics, let me first show you a picture of bacteria growing in a Petri dish. Growing in a Petri dish. So, these pictures are taken from an article of Pasquier and collaborators. So, it's Prafikit's Journal of Biological Chemistry in 2012. So, they took two different kinds of cancer cells, so it's breast cancer cells that are known to have different resistance to a particular drug, which is a doxolebicin or something like that. So, and they let them grow in a petri dish to study the additional mortality that is observed on each kind. But what interests us here is not really the experiment, but really the growth of the cells in the petri dish. And I'm showing this picture because they managed to color in two different ways two kinds of Different ways, two kinds of cells, and to monitor the evolution of the growth in the petri dish. So, these kind of cells are not especially motile, so they don't really move by themselves. And their motion is mostly the result of deterministic forces that are applied to the walls of the cell because they divide, so they grow and they push back each other. And so, in particular, there is no real reason to consider a Bornian motion in Consider a Bornean motion in the motion of these cells, and you can see that you can monitor the growth of the two kinds of cells. So, on day zero, you have the initial condition. It's I think there is four or five islets of cells. So, three are red and one is green. And very fast, so in three days they managed to completely invade the To quickly invade the field of the camera. And then the evolution of the population seems to be really... So the population seems to form clusters of cells. So there is a red cluster and green cluster. And then the evolution of the population seems to be the competition of the cells at the frontier of the clusters. Okay, so to try to understand To try to understand this kind of phenomenon, of dynamics, we used a hyperbolic model actually. And so let me present to you first the model for one species of bacteria. So I will start in two dimensions because it's the most complete model, and we did a kind of complete numerical study of this model. So, the one species model writes like that. So, on the left-hand side, we have a kind of a transport equation. So, we have a differential operator that models the displacements of cells that are following the reverse gradient of pressure field P, which at the moment we take as an external pressure. And on the right-hand side, we have the Side, we have the usual population dynamics kind of term, and I should mention that we consider this kind of term because we are looking at an experiment in the lab, so the food available to the cells is constantly renewed. And so, in particular, there should not be a real difference in the availability of food with respect to the position of space. So, we actually have a real logistic term here. Actually, we have a real logistic term here. But anyway, so we are looking at this equation of displacements of cells according to a deterministic gradient that undergo a population dynamics. Okay, so and the domain in which the equation is set is a circular domain, so it's basically the unit disk in R2. Okay, we have a sensing coefficient curve. We have a sensing coefficient chi, which is a positive constant and kind of represents the way that cells react to external pressure. And of course, this is the growth rate of the population. Basically, we think of it as the logistic term or as a decreasing function of the density of cells U. Okay, and so to model the external pressure, we use the P which is a determined Which is determined by the whole density of cells U. It's actually a linear function of U. And we chose this model in which the P so it's a kind of a diffusion equation for P, which is integrated at rate one. Okay. And it's created by U, which means that the more you have a high denomination But the more you have a high density of U, the more the cells will push back the other cells in a neighborhood of their physical location. And so we took the Neyman boundary condition for P because we assume that there is no flux that's leaving the Petri dish omega. So So I should mention here that it's so it kind of looks like a Keller attractive kilotaxis Keller-Siegel model with parabolic elliptic term. But so there are two different. So there is no viscosity here because we assume that there is no broad hand motion for the cells. And the sign is not correct. So the sign is repulsive. So integral. Repulsive, so individuals tend to repel each other and not attract each other in our case. Okay, so and the last thing is that you can notice that there is no boundary condition on the equation for U and I will explain in a minute that we actually don't need boundary condition for U because the equation is well posed. Posed, or well, it's we can solve it without a boundary condition. Okay, so one way to solve this kind of equation is to look, is to uncouple the spatial dynamics and the population dynamics that the cell are subject to. And to do that, we introduce a characteristic equation for this kind of transport part. So, the characteristic curves. So, the characteristic curves are the solutions to this equation. So, if you take for a minute h equal to zero, it corresponds to the curves along which the population is constant along the time evolution for this equation. So, if you take q as a constant, this is a kind of a transport equation, and the cells will just be transported along the gradient of P and along the And along the characteristics, the concentration of the set will remain a constant. This equation, and because we have a population dynamics, to get a complete picture of the equation, we actually have to investigate also the dynamics of the density of the cells along the characteristics. So we introduce this equation, which is also kind of a This equation, which is also kind of a non-direct differential equation on U representing the population dynamics. However, we need to have a knowledge of the Laplacian of the pressure if we want to solve this equation. So, fortunately, because of the particular kind of pressure we took, the Laplacian is actually determined by the local value of P and the local value of U. So this second equation looks like something we can solve. Like something we can solve, and we will see that at least in one dimension we can actually solve it. So, now let me show you just a little sketch of what the characteristic looks like. So, you have this red circular domain which corresponds to the Petri dish. And here we represented the arrows which correspond to the tangent space and the normal vector. Normal vector and because of the because of the normal boundary condition for P, so let me show you again the equation for P, it's a diffusion with Neumann boundary condition, the gradient of P has to be always normal, perpendicular to the normal vector, so it's it's it's actually uh tangent to uh the boundary of the Beth Vidich uh ato uh when you when you when you are close to the boundary. When you are close to the boundary. So, this means that if you look at the solution to the characteristics equation and you want to start at a location which is very close to the boundary, then you will follow a direction which is perpendicular to the boundary and you are never able to actually touch the boundary of the BetriDish. And this is why we don't actually need the initial condition for you. condition for you sorry a boundary condition for you because the the behavior of the of the dynamics is completely independent of what happens at the at the boundary okay and then uh if you want to uh our conception of the of the equations is the following so we look at the the behavior or the characteristics which is determined by an ordinary differential equation and then we look at Equation. And then we look at the population dynamics for the cell along the characteristic, which is also once again an ordinary differential equation. And the only thing that adds complexity in this model is the P, because P is a kind of a complex functional of U. Okay, so now this is one species scenario, but of course we can investigate a little more complex model for two species, which is the following. Species, which is the following. So we just take the same kind of transport operator on the left for the two species U1 and U2. So they don't necessarily have the same sensing coefficient a priori. And they also undergo a population dynamics, which is typically we think of it as a lotcapal terrain, a competitive. Competitive dynamics. And here, because we want P to represent some kind of pressure which is created by the cells themselves, then actually the P that appears inside of the divergence here should be the same for U1 and U2. So this is why we have the same P, and P is once again determined by a diffusion equation. Which now has u1 plus u2 as a source term. And once again, a normal boundary condition and two initial conditions. So one interesting feature about this model is that it actually preserves the segregation property at all times. So if you look at the initial conditions which are segregated, so you take a U1 which is supported in this little. Supported in this litter interval and U2, which is supported in this literature, then you will always observe separated boundaries for the two species U1 and U2. And so the competition will actually be a result of only the growth and diffusion dynamics at the boundary. And inside of the two intervals, the dynamics is much more simple because Much more simple because it's actually not a function of the two densities, but just of the one which is present. Okay, the reason is that if you follow the characteristic which well you can take any characteristic which is allocated in between the two support of the initial condition. Then if you look at this dynamics Dynamics. You will see that u is a factor. So if you start from u equals zero, then you will always stay at zero. So you have a conservation of the initial condition just for u equals zero. And so in particular, you will have the same kind of dynamics here. And you will always preserve the separated solution for these two. Okay, so and next. And next, we can actually solve. So, this is a work of Charmin. He built a numerical scheme for the equation and he managed to solve the numerical solution for a sufficient amount of time. So, this is the goal was to reproduce the experiment. So, we did it for six days. And you can see that it it reproduces It reproduces kind of the dynamics that was observed in the experiments of Pasquier et al. So, if you take a sparsely seeded initial condition, you will see that, well, it forms large clusters of red and green. And if you take densely seeded, it's a little bit more complex. And okay, but so today the main objective of my talk was not to talk about the Objective of my talk was not to talk about the 2D schemes, so I will present the real motivation in the 1D model, which is the one we can actually solve mathematically. So, if you look at 1D version of the model for two initial conditions, then you can observe that, so at first of course, the propagation occurs only for the one species before it comes into contact. It comes into contact, it's like a species that is freely propagating in the Bergdish. And if you look at the shape of this green surface, then you see that there is a formation of a very sharp area here, very steep area here. And it is to investigate this phenomenon that we built a one-dimensional model. So the one-dimensional. So the one-dimensional model is actually the equivalent of the two-dimensional, but one-dimensional. But it's much more simple because we have a derivative instead of gradient. And to simplify things, we took just u, 1 minus u for the population dynamics. And as before, the the pressure P is determined by a diffusion equation with degradation at rate one. With degradation at rate 1, and which is created by you. So, once again, if you increase the local density of fuel, then you will create a force that pushes the cell away from the high density areas. And because we are in dimension one, then we can write p as an explicit function of u with a kernel which has this function. With a kernel which has this form, so it's we completely know the kernel, it's one over two times sigma exponential minus absolute value of x over two sigma. Okay, and so we can use this convolution equation for P instead of this equation. Okay, and so if we look at the propagation from a compactly supported initial condition, then we see that very soon we have a formation of a profile which looks like a traveling wave, so it's propagating at a constant speed. We will see it in a minute. And so there is a formation also of a very steep surface, like we saw on the green two-dimensional surface. Two-dimensional surface. There is a very steep area at the edge of the propagation front. And of course, initially, it was a little bit difficult to guess that this is actually a discontinuity. So the solution is actually going from this density, which we cannot really determine at this point, and abruptly. point and abruptly to zero, asymptotically actually. And so okay, so if you look at the position of the level sets, you can see that it's a nice straight line, so this indicates a finite speed propagation. And you can actually compute the velocity of this propagation. And if you look at the level the position of the level sets at, for instance, 0.2 and 2/3, then you will see that the two level sets converge very fast to the same position. So, here I must apologize. The level set u equals 0, I think, is a numerical mistake. So, it's a numerical artifact. It should actually converge to. It should actually converge to the same curve. And of course, if you take a level set high enough, then you will have a propagation at a constant distance from lower level sets. So at this point, we are quite convinced that there is a traveling profile emerging from the equation. And then the question is. And then the question is whether there can exist more than one profile and numerically if we test two different initial conditions, so with two different steepnesses, then we don't see a difference. So our guess is that there is a unique traveling profile which is sharp, but at this point we cannot prove it. Okay, so Okay, so um so now uh I will present our results so um concerning this uh existence of a traveling profile but also also the Cauchy problem for the equation because we didn't find it in the literature. So our way to solve the problem is to transform the original model by using the characteristic curves. So we start from this model one, which is the original model in which Which is the original model in which so you have the equation for U, which is transport and the population dynamics. You have the P that is determined by a convolution of U against diffusion kernel. And you want to start from initial condition U0. Okay, and this is this we split in two equations. So the equation of the characteristics, which is the following. So you So the equation, sorry, the characteristic, they follow the gradient of rho star u, which is the gradient of rho star, the value of u here at the point h. Okay, and we have the equation of the dynamics on the dynamics, which is the following. So you have logistical production, and you have this term, which comes from the fact that we have to separate the data. The derivative here, and it perturbates in a way the population dynamics. Okay, and there is a new concern that emerges, which is this chi-hat. It's just you can do the math, it's fairly simple. And these equations, two and three, they define what we call a solution integrated along the characteristics. So it means that It means that a solution integrated on the characteristics is just a solution function u of t and x such that this equation has a classical solution, this equation has a classical solution. And so we have to actually assume only a smoothness in t, but we don't really care for x. So it could be, so in particular, the assumption. So in particular, the solution could be very could have many discontinuities or anything. We don't really care of what it looks like in X. Okay, so our first result is on the behavior of the Cauchy problem. So it's this one. So take any initial condition in L infinity of R, which is positive, then Which is positive, then we can construct a unique solution integrating around characteristics and which starts from U0. And then it stays in infinity, so it stays essentially bonded. There is no explosion in time, which is not really surprising because cells repel each other and they don't attract each other. So it's not really a surprise. A surprise. Next, if you look at the expected profile of traveling waves, you can see that there is no hope that we will have a continuity infinity of R in the sucralar norm because there is a discontinuity which is forming. So if I want to input this kind of profile into the equation and it's actually a traveling wave, then the solution at later time would be Time at later time would be at constant distance from a solution at the earlier time in a sucralum norm. So it's impossible to expect continuity in C0 or in the sucralum norm. But we have a weaker continuity which is in L1 eta, so it's a norm associated with this weight, exponential weight. And it's more or less similar to the local uniform L1 continuity. So it's more or less like saying that the semi-orbit is continuous in each bounded interval for the L1 topology. And then we have the same continuity when you pick a time. When you pick a time and you consider the variability with respect to the initial condition. So you also have L1 continuity. Okay, next, the equation is not too bad with respect to properties satisfied by U0. So it preserves a lot of properties of U0. In particular, it preserves the monotony, it preserves continuity and smoothness. So C1, I guess C2 and CN would be also. And Cn would be also preserved. And if you u0 is C1, then we have a classical solution of the original equation. So the new notion of solution that we introduced, along the integrated solution, actually it works for C1 initial data. So it's consistent. Okay, so next we can actually write. Your time is over. And if you can say in half a minute or something, please conclude your talk. Yes, yes, yes. So I didn't see the time pass. So this is maybe the most important property: that we can see the discontinuity forming in the Cauchy problem. So if you look at the boundary of initial condition, which is not, which is polynomial. Of initial condition which is not which is polynomial, then you will see that the level sets are converging exponentially fast to the separatrix, so to the boundary where it stays zero. So this means that there is actually a discontinuity which is forming. Okay, so maybe so this picture is very important. So it explains what I just said. So if you pick a beta level set which is not too high, Is not too high, and we have a bound for the maximal height, then you will see that this level set converges to the rightmost boundary, so the separatrix, exponentially fast. And of course, the asymptotic profile will have a discontinuity. So next, finally, we proved the existence of traveling waves for this problem, which are discontinuous, which are sharp and discontinuous. And we have some estimate of the speed with respect to the coefficients. So the profile of the traveling wave is not too bad. It's a C1 profile, which has just a disjump close to the edge of the support. And okay, so maybe I can skip to the end and already thank you for listening. And already thank you for listening. Thank you very much.
