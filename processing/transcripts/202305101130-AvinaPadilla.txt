By mentioning that it is really an honor for me, I don't know. No, but it's not in the screen. No, no, okay. It's somewhere else. I think. Okay, so hopefully now, yes, I want to start by mentioning that it's really an honor for me being today here. And I want to thank the organizers for inviting me to give this presentation. To give this presentation, where I mainly be describing some of the highlights of the results that we have obtained by applying and by developing multi-omics approaches to deep insight into the complex heterogeneity of cancer diseases in the search of driver genes with potential clinical relevance. So, also, first of all, I want to So, also, first of all, I want to acknowledge all the amazing people that have been involved in this project development by providing their expertise and the academic and the funding agencies for providing us with support. And since it's my first time in this meeting and also with the community, I will start also introducing myself. Also, introducing myself. I am Katia. I hold a PhD in plant biotechnology, and currently I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Bioinformatics and Complex Networks Lab, which is in Sinvesta Vira Puato, where Maribel is head. And my areas of interest are mainly multi-omics data integration for tackling complex diseases. And also, I am interested in participating in activities related to gender and minority. Related to gender and minority inclusion. And my unique is more related to functional genomics and plant pathology. However, I also have been collaborating and working with cancer, diabetes, and other types of human multifactorial and complex diseases, such as Alzheimer's. So, having said that, my presentation will be splitting basically these points. First, I will These points. First, I will start saying or pointing out a general overview of what are multiomics and what are the advantages. Then, what is the biological question that I want to tackle? And then I will focus on two particular case of studies, which are glioblastoma multiforme, which is a brain, a highly aggressive brain tumor. And also, I will talk a little bit of an analysis that we perform. An analysis that we performed using a subset of genes that is called intronless genes, and that we found that they have a tissue-specific regulatory role across solid cancers diseases. So, as an advertisement or disclosure, this talk is just a biologist's perspective on how powerful, on the power and the potential of computational biology. Biology and bioinformatics, and how can these tools be used to answer like a very complex biological phenomena? So since here are also people more related to maths, I will also give a general overview of what are omics. So, omics are basically an integrative discipline that requires Discipline that requires a multidisciplinary team. So that's the reason why here this community is composed of people that could be experts or scientists in molecular biology, biochemistry, computational science, statistics, mathematicians, and physics. So basically, omics is also defined as this collective characterization and quantification of molecules. And quantification of molecules of pools of biological molecules that translates into the structure and function and the dynamics of an organism. So what is multi-omics? It's the integration of multiple omics areas. For instance, genomics, which is composed of the analysis of DNA, transcriptomics, which is more related to gene expression of RNA molecules, interactomics. Molecules, interactomics, which is more related to proteins or other types of biomolecules, and functional genomics, which at the end is just saying which is the biological role or biological significance of a given set of genes and a given organism. And we have these multiverse of different omics that they are with the advent of. The advent of next generation sequencing and all these high-throughput technologies like metabolomics, lipidomics, etc. So I love this cartoon because I believe it is a very fun way and an easy illustration to have the idea of why single, what is what are the advantages of multi-omics if we compare to single omics. So when we are talking about So, when we are talking about single omics, it's like we are only seeing like a part of the problem, like isolated part of the problem, and where we are only analyzing consequential changes. But when we are working with multi-omics, you know, we have this holistic or this global vision of what is happening, and we have this multiple omics integration of. Simple omics integration of different levels of molecules, which also will provide us with more evidence. So, what are the analysis goals in multiomics studies? So, we have like this is relevant primary tissue, which could be different types of tissue in the human body. And also, this is like composed of multi-omic data that could. Also, multi-omic data that could come from DNA, RNA, as I mentioned before, for multiple different biological biomolecules. And we have the part of the computation where we have to use integrative approaches like, you know, to perform like molecular maps, to analyze clinical data, like patient certification. And at the end, we will be able to tackle like. Be able to tackle like very complex phenomena like to identify market identifications or drug targets. So also, it is important to mention that we have publicly available repositories that could help us to access data. For example, in the case of cancer research, we have the TCGA, which is composed of Which is composed of all the different types of cancer, and it provides us with tumor and also with normal tissue-adjacent data. And we have the cancer cell line encyclopedia. And if we are interested in analyzing like healthy human tissues, we have, for instance, GTS, we have ENCODE, which has a lot of this repository has a lot of information related to transcription factors. Transcription factors. And this is not only linked to human diseases, but also, if you are interested in plant biology, there are publicly available repositories to study plant-related projects. So my biological question. So we all know that cancer is a major health issue. Unfortunately, a million of people are diagnosed with cancer each year. It is among the leading causes of death. Among the leading causes of death. It is remarkable that at least one in three people will have cancer in their lifetime, which, of course, represents a very important economic burden invested in cancer medical care worldwide. So however, tumor heterogeneity remains the most challenging feature in cancer. I skip one slide. However, tumor heterogeneity remains a Heterogeneity remains as the most challenging feature in cancer diagnosis in treatment. So, in this context, understanding tumor heterogeneity will help us to design better strategies against cancer and avoid tumor recurrence. So, in this context, we have focused on analyzing the intrinsic heterogeneity of highly aggressive solid cancers, emphasizing the potential. Emphasizing the potential of driver genes towards a personalized medicine where each patient in the future could receive, you know, like the right therapy. So for this purpose, we have integrated data from multiple databases and developed bioinformatics strategies and pipelines to contribute to a better understanding of cancer biological, about biological. About biological processes, molecular processes underlying cancer initiation and progression that could contribute to differentiate between a healthy and a diseased cell state. So first I will talk about this study where we analyzed, as I mentioned in the introduction, glioblastoma multiforme by using multiomics analysis of driver genes. So glioblastoma. Glioblastoma is the most frequent and aggressive and deadly primary brain tumor in adults, accounting about 80% of all malina gliomas. It's characterized by a remarkable genetic heterogeneity. And ilioblastoma tumors are classified in basically in three main molecular subtypes. And this classification scam. And this classification scam that I show here in this table is also associated with patient age and prognosis, as well as to isological grade and cell morphology. So we took advantage of this classification scheme to analyze driver genes that were involved in glioblastoma tumorogenesis. Blastoma, tumorogenesis that we obtain by data mining strategies. So we search in the literature using a combination of three terms and we perform a PRISM analysis where we came out with 60 clinical cases where they were with 60 clinical cases and we analyzed those genes that were currently under We're currently under the use of the neuro oncology practice as biomarkers for immunostochemistry. So we came out with 18 driver genes. And we perform genomics analysis where we analyze the somatic mutation of those driver genes clustered by patient age. So we have three subgroups of patients, which is the young subgroup, adult, and elderly. So we analyze the polyphene impact value reported in TCGA. Value reported in TCGA that is a prediction of a mutation consequence being probably damaging, possible damaging, or venue. So, in this analysis, we identified that among all the patient ACEs, TP53 and EGVR were the most affected genes, and then OLIC2, which is a VHLH transcription factor, was a particular case for the elderly subgroup. And also, we analyze So, we analyze by using gene mRNA expression analysis, we analyze the expression profiles of those 18 driver genes. And we identified that their expression is related to the STEM model of ontogenesis and related to the STEM model of ontogenesis regarding the glioma progression. And we identify four of those drive. Of those driver genes as a potential biomarker to differentiate among the different glioblastoma subtypes. And of course, that will be helpful in a future to delineate which treatment a patient should follow, but also it is related to the sub-type prognosis of the patients. And also, we identified by analyzing. By analyzing the most affected genes in their polyphenol impact values, where were the genes that were highly less undergo differential regulation with a particular biological pathways for the young patients? For example, in the here, what we are seeing is that this heat map of the most affected. The most affected of the most affected genes clustered by patient age, where we can see that those that are mutated are regulated by different prescription factors, particularly for the group of young patients. And also that the functional enrichment analysis pointed out that the young subgroup has a distinctive biological involvement in processes when compared to the adult and the When compared to the adult and the elderly subgroups, and that there share less gene identities among patients age. So now I will jump on the other paper where we are where I'm going to explain another study that we did also applying multiomics approaches where we analyzed the tissue-specific regulatory roles of intra- Specific regulatory roles of intron les genes across cancers. So, first, I want to mention or to define what are intron-les genes. So, intron les genes are single exon genes lacking an intron and are found across most eukaryotes. It is important to mention that they are nuclear gene-encoded proteins with functional with assignment of. With assignment of functional relevance. So, for instance, pseudogenes or other functional RNAs are excluded from this definition. So, intronigines are basically a sequence, in all the sequence lack the presence of an intron. So, why do we believe that eggs are potential biomarkers? Because, in a previous study, we fully characterized the study. Fully characterized those types of subset of genes in the mouse genome, and we came out with the results that link them to cell faith, to growth, and to very important signaling events. So also we believe that they are easier to detect or associate mutation and polymorphisms, that they possess a faster genetic modulation since they skip splicing, and that for this reason we hypothesize that there could. Reason we hypothesize that they could have better predictability as biomarkers and anesia regulation as targets for therapy. So, we believe that eggs in humans are potential clinical biomarkers and drug targets that deserve careful consideration. And that was the reason why we focused this study. And also, in keeping with this, here I present this example that is SOX-11, which is an intramesine that is currently used in. Currently used as a biomarker for mantul lymphoma. And in this case, we are seeing a patient that presents erythroderma as a paranoplastic manifestation, skin manifestation of mantle cell lymphoma instead of T-SSRI syndrome, which is more commonly related to this type of symptoms in patients. So that was just a biological example of why we would. Example of why we believe that how do we obtain and perform the data extraction and curation for eag and meg data sets? So we implemented or developed EGFinder, which is written in Python. And basically what it does is it goes to the ensemble REST API. Ensemble REST API. So it retrieves all the protein coding genes for each species that you are interested in analyzing from the ensemble repository. And it performs like a counting of exons. So if it has one exon, it's considered like a single exon gene. And if it has two or more, you will have as an output a file containing the multi-exonic genes for this given organism. So then you will. So then you will filter the number of transcripts. And if it has one transcript, then it goes to the intron database, where is also another type of repository where you contain all the different presence of the introns across the DNA sequences. And if it doesn't have introns within the UTRs, then we can say that it's an intronigines after filtering out the mitochondrial genes. The mitochondrial genes, because as I mentioned before, there are only nuclear encoded. So we also identified that the 904 introness encoding proteins in the human genome are highly enriched in DNA replication, chromatin assembly, and nucleosome organization, as well as keratinization processes, which also which also has, you know, had the potential of could be linked to pivotal processes in cancer development. So what was our data source? So the TCGA genome currently has data from 37 types of cancer. So we found expression data from 418 types, you know, having, we have to have like the primary tumor tissue. Tissue sample, but also we wanted to compare against the adjacent normal tissue. So among that 37, only 18 types contain both of the data that we wanted. So at the end, we analyzed the four most prevalent cancers, which are breast, lung, prostatate, and colon. Prostetate and column, and four that have like a very high in aggressive heterogeneity, very high heterogeneity and aggressive outcome, which are bladdersophagel, glioblastoma, again in brain, and kidney. So we started by analyzing the same tissues, but in healthy Tissues, but in healthy samples, and we found that in the GTS repository that the X expression in healthy tissue is specific. So we can see here the cluster that for the different healthy tissues, where we are seeing if the spreads patterns of the eggs in the different tissues are similar. Tissues are similar. So, we also perform network strategies like this bipartite network that I'm showing here, where we analyze the share and the unique differential expressed X. We found that the most conserved X are histones, particularly a high conserved intuction of a group of the acetylasa histones, which are negative regulators of transcription. Of transcription that are located in a contiguous region of chromosome 6 in the human genome. We also identified two more specific differentially expressed intronigines across the solid cancers under study. At the end, we came up with this pan-cancer study. We identified the specificity, as I mentioned, and the uniqueness or Or specificity, uniqueness, and the conserved differentially expressed X across all these cancers. And we found that 35% of the 940 proteins are differentially expressed, and that the highest specificity of their expression is in glioblastoma and kidney and in prostate. So, also, most of the eggs that are differentially Most of the igs that are differentially expressed in cancer are upregulated in two or more cancers, which suggests that they are undergoing a transcriptional reprogramming of upregulation. And also, we compare the X versus the MEX expression profile patterns and identify that they, particularly this subset of genes, tend to have a more induced gene expression of the multiexone when compared. Of the multiexon when compared to the multixonic. And also by using protein-protein network approaches, we identified the differential express X protein-protein participation, and most of them are related or physically interacting with epigenetic regulatory roles. But in the case of Sophaga, glioblastic. Of sophagale, glioblastoma, lung, and breast cancer, they seem to be also like particular or specific participation in specific processes. So here I'm presenting this cancer-specific of the differential expressed bilayer network, and where we see in the upper. In the upper, I don't know if you are like really able to see it, but where we are seeing in the upper part of the network is the differentially expressed kicks that are specific for each, thank you, for each type of cancer. And what we are seeing in the in the in the bottom of the on the second level of the The second level of the network is the multi-protein complexes that are linked to the differential express X. And finally, we also perform a network deconvolution where we only were able to analyze breast cancer since it was the only type of cancer that has. Cancer that has the number of samples that the analysis required. So, in this co-expression network, this co-expression network was obtained using ARAGNE, which is a mutual information-based tool. So, we have the tumor, the tumor and the healthy submatrices that came together or are consolidated into a Together or are consolidated into a single network. And where we're seeing in the pies is a distribution of the tumor and the healthy changes of expression of the intron-less genes. So at the end, we came out with the conclusion that X play a role in the tumor phenotype at transcriptional and post-translational levels, but also with important mechanisms such as it is. Such as it is interactomics rewiring. So, summarizing multi-omics approaches are an analystic view. We can not only see like a single, like on one level, a type of biomolecular analysis, but we can integrate multiple types. And there are just a very powerful methodology and using this approach. And using these approaches, we have identified transcriptional profile patterns in Lioblastoma, fitting with the stem cell model of ontogenesis. And we also detected a combination of four biomarkers that could have clinical relevance to determine the glioblastomamolecular subclass. Also, we studied the potential regulatory role of differentially expressed intrinsic genes and as well as the implication in As well as the implication in specific protein-protein interaction networks in the case of the highly aggressive solid cancers such as glioglastomas of Agella in Law, and that they have also functioning important mechanisms such as it is rewiring in cancer. So, what is coming next? We are also interested in studying. next we are also interested in studying epigenetics and this is just like a preliminary approach where we trying to analyze what are the you know methylation patterns if they are different for for X or for MEX and if they could be in the case of what we are seeing is like we believe that maybe X equals Maybe X eponethation could be induced in gene expression. So, who knows? We will see. And also, if we compare XMEX, if we have some type of disease specificity. So, that will be all. And thank you for your attention. And I will be happy to take comments, suggestions, inputs, questions. Thank you, Prabhupada. Questions thank you very much, Antia. That was a great lab. I suppose one of the key things is that there's only one transcript for each of these genes, right? So I just wonder if there are multiple. I just wonder if there are multiple exon genes that still, when you look at cancers, you only see one specific transcript expressed. So I wonder if a similar effect is seen when you just see consistent use of a specific transcript and only that one specific transcript, even though it might have multiple exons. So that's one question. Does this generalize to that set of genes, if they are any? That set of genes, if there are any. The other one is, um, you know, alternative splicing is one way of getting diversity. The other one is paralongs, right? So six socks came in, came up. It is a member of a family of genes. And I wonder if there's, you know, do these internless genes tend to be part of gene families? Yes. And is that, or more often than not, and is that a way in which? And is that a way in which diversity is still used in the tumor and cancer, even though it's not a, right? So even though you don't need to switch transcripts or anything, you just might be expressing different transcription factors in different parts of the fibrillum. So for the second question, the answer is yes. So as I mentioned during the presentation, before moving to cancer, we We perform a study using mouse genome and also we analyze that all the functional assignment of intronless genes. And we noticed that they tend to be transcription factors. A lot of VHLH transcription factors are introness genes, that they tend to be transmembrane receptors. Membrane receptors, all of a lot of GPCRs are intronigines, and they also tend to be histones. So yes, the answer is yes. And we with Maribel and Marie Bell and a student, a master's degree student, they implemented a tool which is called Revolution Tool. And what it does is that reconstructs the evolutionary history. The evolutionary history of the genes of us gene families. So we study intronigines also in the comparing with multiple vertebrata genomes. And what we found, it was that they are conserved and that they belong to big families. And the first question, I don't know if you can please. Are there genes that are single transcript genes, even though they might? Single transcript genes, even though they might have multiple exons, but like in the cancers. Introns. They might have introns. Right. Okay. I wonder if a similar effect. Well, first of all, is there such a class and how big is it? And if similar effects you tend to see in those? No, I don't. So it's on it. I mean, crab more than one color, yes, but that's something that is like whatever you do. Thank you. Thank you. Are we ready? Oh, one more question. Ah, sure. Okay. I thought there was another question. Robert, sorry. Robert, sorry. Yeah, I was just curious if you very early in your slide deck, you showed sort of the mutational burden of the three age groups, right? And the younger people didn't have right. And so, and typically the notion, at least from human genetics, is that if you get a disease at a very early age, it's much more likely to be some special. Some special unique mutation in that individual, right? That pushes them into the disease rather than the environment and exposure basically being the underlying driver. And so my sort of question or comment is, are you sure keeping those folks in your analysis isn't doing you sort of more harm than good, right? Their biology is likely to be very different than people whose biology comes, right? And you have some opportunities with those folks. Opportunities with those folks. I mean, typically, if you could do sequencing of trio.
