And then I know who I need to call on to to be a chair in the hope that you could I could buy myself a few more minutes. Um but no, it's okay. Um thank you so much for having me. Thanks to the organizers, especially Jean, for the kind invitation to be here. It's been really wonderful to reconnect with old friends and make some new ones. So the title of my talk is Looking at Variability, which is a nice segue, I think, from Matt's presentation. Throughout my career, I've really spent a lot of time thinking about how do we model Thinking about how do we model gene expression variability and how do we learn biology from it. So, way back when, before when we had microarray data, even then we were trying to use variance as a population-specific parameter to identify new regulatory genes. And so, thinking about how does variability or variance change in relation to a specific phenotype, obviously from a statistics mindset, I think it's Mindset, I think it's really easy to understand the attraction of thinking about variability. We have moment estimators, right, and severance is our second moment. But also, as we go higher, we've looked at students and its relationship to gene expression and cancer data. And when we're talking about distributions, you know, I think it bears acknowledging that there are other sorts of curious features that we can think about the data. And so specifically things like bimodality, multimodality. Multimodality, even for bulk data, that's really relevant. And we've looked at the instance of bimodality in oncogenes in breast cancer before. And so I think as we acknowledge, you know, that transition from bulb data to population level bulb data to now having single cell level data, I think it's really clear that the opportunity to study noise has become a lot more tractable. And in fact, before when we had bulb data, we were really trying to estimate. Bulk data, we were really trying to estimate the variability, but now that we have single-cell data, we can actually understand the underlying distribution and look at different features associated with that. So, I'm not going to talk about any of this existing work that I've done, but instead I wanted to use my very short amount of time to touch on some more recent work in my group. And so, that's looking at modeling distributions and single-cell data, this question of how do we effectively measure variability. Of how do we effectively measure variability and finally talk about a new collaboration where we are going towards a more bizarre application, this is R and ASIC. So without further ado, I wanted to introduce this SE shapes. Certainly we're not the first to look at different distributions in single-cell data. We're in the presence of greatness, David Keegan, who gave us SCPB. And I only made that connection last night, I'm sorry. But this is our offering, and specifically, is this a project that was like. And specifically, is this a project that was led by my PhD student, Malindrie Dhammaratni, who was really interested in understanding what is the prevalence of different kinds of distributions in single-cell RNA-seq data? And certainly from Keegan's work, but also this beautiful paper from Chowdery and Satida that was published last year, acknowledge really the value of fitting specific distributions for individual genes. And obviously, in many use cases, we apply a simplifying assumption that these are negative binomial. That these are negative binomial, but there are other benefits too. And so we're really interested in understanding specifically what was the prevalence of these zero-inflated distributions. We obviously know that there's lots of zero sparsity data and single-cell data. And so understanding your plus one-negative binomial, but the zero-inflated counterparts, how prevalent were they? And so she created a bioconductor package that came out way before our paper, but the paper was published earlier this year in. But the paper was published earlier this year in Computer Science. So, Melinda's framework starts out quite simply. We've got some gatekeeper steps to make sure that we're applying this to the most relevant genes. So, initially, we ensure that these genes do actually belong to a family of microbinomial distributions. And then we do the classification step based on a variety of different model selection criteria. So, just to show you, she's applied this to a vast array of different biological Array of different biological conditions and perturbations. And just to highlight, my group has been very interested lately in aging. And so I'll talk a bit more about this first use case where we've got different mice and we're looking at single cell data from two different tissues. But she's also tried to really incorporate the breadth of different sorts of systems. So we've looked at COVID-19 patients too and all the kind of variability that comes from patient to patient. She's looked at a more contained system. At a more contained situation, looking at T cell activation from published data, and then we've used IPSC lines where we've got absolute control. In fact, only one chromosome is different across these three groups and looked at how variability plays out there and these different distributions. And then finally, there's a data set that we've been generating looking at mesenchymal stem cells that just got published in Geroscience, where we followed these cells as they become more and more senescent. So I'll just, in the brief time I've got, talk. So I'll just, in the brief time I've got, talk about the aging case study. So here we've got three mice, three groups of mice, sorry, young, old, and mice have been treated with methomin, which is an anti-aging drug. And what we see for these different tissues is obviously, as you might expect, representation of different cell types. But what's interesting is that for adipose, when we're only adjusting for technical variability, we see that most of these genes belong, as you might expect, to the negative binary of your family. Of your family. But the muscle sample, actually, it's used a little bit more towards Poisson. And interestingly, when we account for these different cell types, again, we see the balance of these different distributions shift again. So I think it's a really interesting sort of profile, a snapshot of what can happen. We then use this approach to look for genes that had changed the distribution from one condition to another. And there's lots of different comparisons here, but basically, orange is adipose. Orange is adipose, green is muscle. And we're basically looking at what happens between young to old, metformin to old. And nearly 30% of the genes had a change between at least one of the conditions. And we've seen different pathways that make sense depending on the comparison. But I think one of the comforting results that we saw here was that DNA repair was a common pathway that was common to all the different comparisons. Come into all the different comparisons. So, in a sense, it's a good validation to see. I invite you to check out the paper. We've done a lot of other things with that and always open to ideas and feedback. I wanted to talk about the next project that we've had, which is led by my PhD student, Kui Wenzeng, who's just finishing up the touches to her thesis. And we noticed that really there were many statistics actually available to measure gene expression variability. Gene expression variability. But actually, these have typically been optimized under their own conditions, so that really how they perform across a bust array of different data scenarios is a question. And this is certainly not a thing that's unique to variability, right? But what she's done is she's assembled a panel of 14 different metrics, and these come from different sort of approaches to measuring variability, and some of them you recognize are really simple. And we put them under different And we put them under different evaluative criteria. So, you know, how does sequencing impact performance? How do different data structures impact performance? And so she's assembled a variety of different data sets to do this type of evaluation. And most of our data comes from tabula mirrors, tabular various setups, which, as you might know, allows us to do that really nice comparison between full length and three frame sequencing methods. Sequencing methods. So, one example, just to really make it very clear in how we're evaluating performance, is this idea of sparsity. So, as you know, there's a lot of zeros, and some statistics like coefficient of variation are really influenced by the number of zeros that are available per gene. But there is actually a smooth version of this, and so if you look at how the local coefficient of variation performs, it's actually quite robust to the number of zeros in the data. Robust to the number of zeros in the data. And so this is just one example of how we'd rank the worst performer versus the best performer within this criteria alone. I know this is a really busy slide, but just to show you, we've done some benchmarking according to some known degrees of variation. And what I mean by that is we use ribosomes and stably expressed genes from Vincent's beautiful paper. And for there, we're basically trying to see whether the metric agreed that that was a low variant gene. Was a low-variable gene. And on the other side, we've looked at by simulation, highly variable genes. C-similarly, if the metric scores out quite highly, is a highly variable gene. So there's obviously a lot of variable performance, excuse the pun, but what I want to highlight your attention to is that overall we've tried to summarize the performance across these different categories of valuation and rank them accordingly. And so the one that ranked the highest was SPRAN in terms of its estimation of In terms of its estimation of variability. But you can see that performance is really quite spread out. But what we did with that was then to take SCRAM and try to learn about biology. So we looked at this context of looking at differentiation from hemophoidic stem cells to naive B cells, going through different stages of this B cell lineage. And what we were looking for were consistently variable genes or consistently stable genes during this process. So they look like this, they look like that. Like this, this, that. And these are their individual gene expression profiles. But what was interesting is that amongst the top consistently variable genes, so these got more variables we go through this lineage profile, these genes were associated with roles in B cell development and B cell function. When we looked at the genes that were more consistently stable, these were, as you can see, ribosomes and associated with other more general sulfogens, as you might expect. You might expect. Finally, we looked at networks as well, although these are really quite simple networks that have been generated from hands-cryption factor to target relationships. And we propagated these for hemoplitic stem cells separately and also naive B cells, where we identified genes that were differentially variable between young and old mice. And what I'll draw your attention to here is that there is actually one transcription factor in common, SPI1, and you can see that here. And you can see that here they've got actually different targets, which is actually variable. And when you look at the gene expression profile, you can see that that increase in variability that you see going from young to old is actually quite different between the two cell types. So you can see for hemopidic stem cells, there's almost an increase in that old group for that second mode, but almost in the 9B cells, it's largely due to that bimodal relationship. That bimodal relationship with a young group. So, I just think I'm coming up to time, but what I wanted to talk to you next was an application that we've got. This is a relatively new collaboration that we're doing with the Australian Red Cross. And this is being led by my PhD student, Namo Han. And we're really trying to understand human breastfell. And you might think that this is an odd application, the single cell sequencing, but there's actually a lot of really interesting questions. There's actually a lot of really interesting questions that we can ask. And so, breast milk, as you may or may not know, is an interesting sample because it's made up predominantly of epithelial or end immune cells. And obviously, within those two categories, there's more specialized cell types. And so, we want to ask sort of questions like, how does cell composition change as the baby grows? We know that there's actually quite an intricate feedback loop between mom and baby nutritionally. And the other kinds of questions we And the other kinds of questions we want to eventually get to are things like high volume and low volume producers. Can we understand what's different between them? And also, what solid features are really unique to humans? We're not the only species who can produce filt. And so one thing I want to draw your attention to is that there are currently two data sets, well there's actually three, but we've taken the two data sets of single sire and a seq and integrated them. And both of these were published last year, so this is really, really new. So, this is really, really new. Basically, what we saw were about 97,000 epithelial cells, 10,000 immune cells. We were really curious to know whether that was unique to humans, and the punchline is it's not. When we look at cow single-cell RNA-seq, we actually see that the skew goes in the other direction. And what we did was we actually got data from our colleagues at Agricultural Victoria, where they've actually got nearly 300 cows that they've done bulk RNA sequencing on. We applied CyberSort and. On. We applied cyber sort and inferred the cell proportions. And you can see this is the proportion for the epithelial cells and the rest of the moment cells. So, again, even with the bulk data, we see that relationship. Why do we see the ratio of being so different? There's a lot of theories, and I'd love to hear yours. But it's been put to us that maybe cows have been hyper-selected to produce milk, and humans are kind of the other extreme, think about it. And so, to answer that question, we've just found collaborators. We've just found collaborators who can give us milk samples from camels and goats. And we're talking to TEDx to see if we can actually do this. So watch the space. But it's actually one of those really interesting things where you just follow the science and you suddenly end up on camel farms and bird farms. So I just wanted to briefly touch on some of the challenges that you can imagine. We've got some cross-species challenges, we've got some cell annotation challenges, and really methodology and interpretation. Methodology and interpretation around gene expression for variability in no amount of time. So, I'm just going to cut to the acknowledgements and thank all the people that helped us through this work. So, thank you very much. We have time for one or two questions. Does anyone have a question? So, what are you hypothesizing might happen with the goats and the camels, do you think? Yeah, so we've been told that. Yeah, so we've been told that, I mean, we think it might be somewhere in between the ratios. So you can see the cows are really dominated by the immune cells, and the humans, it's the other way around. So I suppose if we're right in that regard, we'd see the camels and the goats being somewhere in between. Technical question about the SC shapes. I just briefly did. I think you used parameters. I think you use parametric models to classify. I'm just wondering what the motivation here with parametric models is, especially when you start looking for differences across conditions, for example, a little bit. It seems like it might be hard given the deviations that you might see captured in a parametric model. There are non-parametric options, I'm just saying. Yeah, absolutely. I think the motivation was really to parallel what most people do and that they adopt the negative pinomial. And so that sort of extension against. And so that sort of extension against zero inflation counterpart was actually useful and it was great in really capturing us that we could model that distribution. So I think that was really the motivation. Yeah. Well we might take other questions either online to Slack or to lunch or the coffee break and thank you again Jessica.
