Hello us in the bar, in case you don't want to wander all the way back to your room. Secondly, at the various times listed in the schedule, the breakout rooms will be open. Anybody feel free to wander in and break out and do whatever it is one does in a breakout room. All right, our next speaker is Teresa Hoxtra Mendoza, who will tell us about topological complexity of unordered configuration. Complexity of unordered configuration spaces of trees. Thank you for inviting me to this talk. Well, this is what I'm going to talk about. If you ever have any questions, you can always interrupt me. I sometimes tend to speak very fast. So, okay. So, I shall start with the definition of configuration spaces by this. Spaces. Why is this? Yes. I will get the definition for a finite graph, but you can have a configuration space of any topological space. The graph we shall consider to be a one-dimensional topological space. So for a finite graph and the positive integer n, the order configuration space of n points on the graph is the product minus the points. Minus the points where two entries or more are equal. And the unordered configuration space, which is the spaces that I am going to be considering here, is the quotient space of this space by the action of the symmetric group where the action is given by the permutation of the factors. So instead of having tuples, we just have sets. I can't seem to. Yes. And there is also a discretized version. There is also a discretized version of these spaces, which instead of only removing the points which have two or more entries equal, we remove every set of open cells which closer intersects these sets. And similar, we can have the discretized unordered configuration space, which is again the cogent of this space by the action of the symmetry group, where the action is given by the permutation of the factor. Giving by termination of the factor. So I have an example of this. If you consider a graph that is homeomorphic to the letter y, so it would be the complete bipartite graph on one and three points. This would be the on-order configuration spaces. This is the normal space and this is the discretized version. As you can see, the normal space is missing like a point here. So, and this white These white dots are meant to represent the fact that that point does not belong to the space. So, this doesn't have like a good structure because it has like open cells. And that is why we consider the discretized version. And the reason that we can work with the discretized version is because of a theorem by Abrams, which says that if a graph has at least 10 vertices and we are Vertices, and we assume that each path between distinct vertices of degree not equal to two in the graph contains at least n minus one edges, and each loop at a vertex which is not homotopic to a constant map contains at least n plus one edges. If that's the case, then both the unordered as well as the ordered configuration spaces, the formation retracts onto the discretized version. So we can work with the discretization. So, we can work with the discretized version, which is much more workable. So, I shall work with these spaces. Oh, what did I do? No. Here, yes. Here, a cell consists of this set of disjoint vertices and edges. The vertices and edges are disjoint, but a vertex cannot be. Vertex cannot be the endpoint of an edge if it belongs to the same cell. So there's less confusion when I'm talking about the graph or the space. I shall call this vertex ingredient and etching readings of the cell. And the dimension of the cell is given by the amount of etching reading it contains. The discretized version is much smaller than. Version is much smaller than the usual version, but it still can be like very big. So, the main tool I use to make this space smaller is discrete Morse theory. I shall talk a little bit about what discrete Morse theory is because it is very useful. So, a discrete vector field and a cell complex is a set of pairs, W, of cells such that every cell belongs to at most one pair. It can belong to one or One pair, it can belong to one or no pair. And if the pair is of the form A, B, then B is a piece and B is of dimension P, then A is a phase of B of dimension one less, B minus one. And in this case, the cell A is called redundant, the cell B is called collapsible, and the cells which do not belong to any pair are called critical cells, which actually are the important ones. Which actually are the important ones. And we often write B equals W of A when the pair A, B is in W. Well, this is a discrete vector field, but we want to more than that. A sequence of P cells is called a gradient path of W if one of the following conditions holds. The first is that A I The first is that AI is a redundant cell and the following cell must be a phase of the pair of AI, in which case it is called an upper gradient path. And the other option for having a gradient path is that the cell Ai is collapsible. Thus, Ai is the pair of some Bi, and Bi is a phase of the previous cell, in which case this is. In which case, this is called a lower gradient path. And well, if a discrete vertical field does not contain non-trivial closed paths, by closed, I mean that the path starts and ends at the same cell, then it is called a gradient discrete vector field. And well, this is like the principal theorem of discrete Morse theory, which says that if a cell complex is unit with a great Cell complex is unit with a gradient vector field W, then X has the homotopy type of a cell complex having MP cells of dimension P, where MP denotes the number of critical cells in X of dimension P. And while that's not all, one can construct a Morse chain complex, which is defined to be the graded R free module generated in dimension P by the duals of the critical cells. This is quite a critical cell. Cells. This is why the critical cells are so important. I shall not give more details of discrete Morseri because it would take a lot of time. But Farley and Sabaita gave a discrete gradient vector field for these spaces for any graph G. But since I am only going to talk about G is a tree, this graph without cycles, I shall just describe the grain. Describe the gradient vector field when G is a tree. So, consider a tree and assume it has a planar embedding in the plane. We shall see that it's sufficiently subdivided if it satisfies the conditions of the Abrams theorem. So, for example, in this case, it would be sufficiently subdivided for n equal to 4. But if we want we But if we want we want to have a greater n, we would have to subdivide every h further. And we shall fix a root. A root must be just any vertex of degree one. Well, the vertices of degree greater than three, we shall call the essential vertices, which are here this. And we shall enumerate the vertices of the tree as follows. We start by the root, which shall have the number. Which shall have the number zero or just asterisk or whatever. And we start to enumerate one, two, three. And every time we reach like an essential vertex, we always take the left branch, four, five, six, and then continue seven, eight, nine. We take the left branch, 10, 11, 12, the left branch, and then continue first here, and then we continue to the previous place where we left. Place where we left, and so on. And this, we shall often refer to a vertex by its number. And given a vertex different from the root, we shall say that Ex is the un we shall call EX the unique edge of t of the form y, x with while small. With while smaller than x, smaller with respect to the numbering. And we shall say that the vertex ingredient in a cell is blocked if this edge does not intersect the if it intersects the cell in which it is in and unblocked otherwise. So, in terms of the picture, for example, if you take the vertex 11. If you take the vertex 11, then the HE11 would be 1110. If this belongs to a cell which does not contain neither the vertex 10 or the H910, then this vertex is said to be unblocked. Or if it does intersect the cell, then it will be blocked. Moreover, Moreover, an edge ingredient in a cell is said to be order-respecting in that cell if C does not contain vertex ingredients V, which are between X and Y, and that V is a neighbor of X. So in our picture, if one cell contains, for instance, the H910, I won't know. Oh no, 919, and it contains the vertex 10, then this edge is said to be non-order respective. Otherwise, it is order respecting. As you can see, there are edges which can only be order-respecting, such as 10-11 or 22, 23, because there is nothing in between. So those are always order respecting. Okay. Okay, and well, the critical cells, well, actually, every cell, also the redundant and collapsible, but those don't matter now. In Farley and Savalka's discrete gradient vector field are characterized as follows. A cell is critical if and only if it does not contain order-respecting edge ingredients nor unblocked vertex ingredients. Like I said earlier, we have a Morse touching complex with a differential. I shall not talk about that because I don't have that much time. But in these places, it turns out that this Morse differential is trivial. So for each M, a graded basis of the cohomology ring is given by the cohomology classes of the duals of the critical cells. Whenever I talk about the dual of a cell, I shall omit the asterisk, otherwise, this screen will have a lot of asterisks. But I hope it can still understand that I mean a critical, the dual of a critical cell. So here's an example of what a critical three cell would look like. One have the block vertices, one can blocked vertices and one can have like a block that they can be blocked at the origin. As you can see, you have here three edges. Since every edge has also a vertex that is between the beginning and end point of the edge and is adjacent to the beginning, that means these edges are not order respecting since we have this and this vertex, but one would be enough. Here we have this vertex and for Here we have this vertex, and for this edge, we have this vertex. And every vertex is blocked. As you can see, if we consider this vertex, the edge that like is in the direction of the root intersects the vertex x, which as a vertex does not belong to the cell, but as an edge does. And I shall use this notation for a critical cell of any dimension. Any dimension. The two at the beginning means that we have two vertices blocked at the origin. The letter X means that one of the edges incites in X. And these numbers say how many vertices are before the edge and after the edge. As you can see in this branch of the tree, the dotted line means that we can have like more branches here or anything can be in between. Be in between the x and the y. It could be like just a straight path or more branches, doesn't matter right now. But there are no vertices here blocked, so that means we have here a zero. On the second branch, we have a one vertex blocked, so we have zero, one, and the parenthesis closes because the following branch contains the edge. On the same branch as the edge, there is no vertex, no block vertex, so we have a zero. So we have a zero, and on the last branch, we have a one. Of course, these could be vectors of any length. If one would have like more branches at each vertex, here every vertex is of degree four or five, but we could have any degree. And just a little bit more of notation I'm going to use and definitions. Once we fix essential vertices, Once we fix essential vertices, essential recall that is having degree greater or equal than three, the complement in the tree t of those vertices, the composers into connected components. And we shall denote them by c iji when the vertices are numbered by xi, or if the vertex is called v, we just put v and And we can also define the set of prune leaves, which would be like where the connected component ends, where in intersection with these vertices. I shall give a picture so it's more clear. In this tree, here it should be one more vertex in my laptop. You could see it. Here's also the root vertex. And we consider the vertices X, U, Y, C, and W. C and W. If we remove them, we have these many connected components. And as you can see, the connected component which contains the root is, you could say, propounded or ends at the vertex x. So we put L01 equal to X. And similarly, for example, the connected components which come from X, we have actually four of them. Have actually four of them, but the one which would be the first one in the ordering of the tree, the essential vertex that are like bounding the component are precisely u and y. And well, this would be the only these four would be the only non-empty sets of protifs. Okay, I shall use Okay, I shall use everything I mentioned later on. Okay, this is something we define to understand a little bit better the comology ring of these spaces. I shall mention it briefly. I hope it's clear. So, if we have critical one cells with the notation I mentioned previously, we can define the interaction parameters. Define the interaction parameters as follows, which would be these great formulas. So we have three parameters, RCO, P I L I and Q I L I and well these depend obviously on the cells and on the sets I defined earlier the pruned leaves like L01, Li, And well, we shall say that if every, well, these are vectors, but if every entry is greater or equal than zero, we shall say that the factors interact weakly. And if on addition the PI has one or more entries strictly greater than zero, then we say that the factors interact strongly. Otherwise, the factors do not interact. This seems a bit This seems a bit complicated, but it's not as complicated as it seems. And it's very useful to understand the tomology ring of these spaces. So I have here an example for n equal to 4. These two cells interact strongly and these two cells interact weakly. Why is that? As you can see, it has three vertices here in the direction of the edge in the following cell. This belongs to the This belongs to the same tree. So here we have one cell and one edge. So if we would want to move these vertices so that one goes to the edge and one to the vertex, we still have one vertex left. And that is what means, sort of, that they interact strongly. This vertex doesn't necessarily need to be on this direction, it would be here. And why does this interact? And why does this interact weakly? Because there are exactly two vertices that can move like upwards, but since there are no other vertices on this side of the edge, that means they interact weakly. If for some reason we would have like here only one vertex, well, there wouldn't be enough to move upwards, and that's the case when they do not interact. So this is why they interact weakly. Well, why is this important? Well, why is this important? Well, we have this proposition that when we have these cells, their cap product agrees with the critical end cell given by the interaction parameters, provided the factors interact strongly. When they interact weakly, you sometimes get zero, you sometimes get like a sum of a lot of cells, and it's more complicated. When they do not interact, their product is Interact, their product is automatically zero. But when interact strongly, you can know exactly what the product is, and that is very useful. And another thing that is like very nice is that every M cell is a strong interaction product of M cells. That happens like all the time. It's very easy to see which one because you take like an M cell and you do like the inverse process of this. You take like a face and see where the vertex. Like a face and see where the vertices can move to. What is less pretty is that, yes, it is always a strong interaction product, but sometimes it is also a weak interaction product. So, okay. Now that I have said all the preliminaries needed, I shall finally talk about topological complexity. So, this is the definition of the higher topological complexity. Of the higher topological complexity of a path connected space X, which is defined as a sectional category of the evaluation map, which sends a free path on X onto this tuple. But actually, I shall not use the definition. I shall use this proposition, which is very, very useful, which says that for a C-connected space, our space are actually zero-connected. Having the homotopy type of a C double. Homotopy type of a CW complex, we have that the S0 divisor couplength is less or equal than the S topological complexity, which is less or equal than S times the homotopy dimension of X. Well, like I said, our spaces are zero connected, so we can ignore the last part. And well, one last observation. Recall that the homogenopy dimension of the space. homogenopy dimension of the spaces is given by um here i said max but it should be minimum of n over two or m why should is this m over two well um from the theorem we know that the dimension is the dimension of the greatest critical cell but in a critical cell each each edge which the amount of edge ingredients is what the dimension gives has has to inside in a critical edge for it to be in a critical vertex for it to be non-order spectrum so if you have very little essential vertices well then the dimension is not so big but if you do have a lot since every um critical cell every etching gradient has to be non-order respecting that means it has to have like an It has to have like an adjacent vertex, so you can only have the half of n for the dimension. So, this is actually a minimum. Okay, so given a one cell, I shall denote by E of A its unique edge ingredient. And just like I was saying, that every critical edge for edge ingredient in a critical cell needs to have a Needs to have a vertex that makes the edging rigid non-order respecting, and we shall call that a critical block. Okay, so I have this lemma. I shall not give the proof of this lemma because it's very technical and very long and not so easy to explain. But if you assume that we have a critical M cells of maximal dimension in the space, such that there is not the Such that there is not, there does not exist an etching grid that belongs to every cell. We can have an etching grid belonging to s minus one, but not all. Then the topological complexity, here would be the s topological complexity of the space is greater or equal than s times m and well this lemma I can apply to obtain a nice theorem, which would be this theorem. Would be this theorem that if m is the amount of essential vertices, k would be the amount of vertices of degree exactly three. Thus, m would be the vertices of degree three, four, five, greater than three. But k of them are of degree exactly three. And assume n is of the form, well, is two times n minus ka plus l plus n. minus k plus l plus epsilon where epsilon is zero or one and l is relatively small with respect to k thus l is less than k over s times s minus one then the s topological complexity is greater or equal than s times m minus ka plus l um well this means that if we have um very much Very much very a lot of vertices of degree three, enough that we can like separate them into different cells, then we can have this mount. Well, the idea of the proof is that if you can see for the vertices of degree four or more, we can construct two different critical blocks having different etching regions. So, as you can see, if this is a vertex of If this is a vertex of degree four, four or more, of course, and the origin goes is it this way? You can have this edge with this vertex to form a critical block, but you can also take this edge with either this vertex or this to form a different block. Well, it's different because it has a different edge. So you can construct two different sets, A and B, each one containing. And B each one containing m minus ch critical blocks, and they have different edges. So you can like ignore the vertices of degree 4 because of this reason. And we can like focus on the vertices of degree 3. So we want to construct S cells of this dimension such that no H ingredient belongs to all cells. All cells. Since, like I said, k is sufficiently large. We can see k as s times j plus r with r little. We can form s disjoint sets, each one containing j critical blocks, like here. If r is positive, we can have like more sets, more blocks, but I don't have to use them. And if we consider the union of all and then remove one of the blocks, like VI would. One of the blocks, like Vi would be all minus one. So V1 would be U2, U3 up until US. V2 would be U1, U3 until US. Then each Vi has J times S minus one, which is greater than L, critical blocks, and this is disjoint from Vj. So this way, at least in the case when epsilon is zero. At least in the case when epsilon is zero, when epsilon is one, we can add the root vertex to every cell. We can construct those the cell Ci consisting of a subset of Vi of exactly L blocks together with the set A if I is even or B if I is blocked. Recall that the sets A and B were sets of this kind of critical blocks. A would A would have these blocks, and B would have this kind of critical blocks. And that way we can have exactly what we wanted, S cells of this dimension, with the property that there is no etching gradient, which belongs to every cell. Of course, there are going to be edges that belong to three, four, maybe five cells, but not to all cells, which is what is important. It's important. I have another technical lemma. This is actually a bit more complicated than the last one. What this says basically is that if we have m times s critical one cells with the following properties, assume it is easier to see if we if I write them down in this form. So we have So we have m times s critical cells of dimension one, and we assume that the product at each line is a strong interaction product. We also assume that the edges of the cells that are from here from here, these edges are all different. So here we can have any edging grid belonging to these two cells. And on the other hand, here I ask the Here, I ask the opposite: that all these critical one cells have the same edge, and not only that, this edge insites in an essential vertex of degree three. But they are still different cells. I mean, they have the same edge, but they are different. One perhaps has more vertices on one side, the other has more vertices on the origin. If all this happens, then If all this happens, then the topological S topological complexity is greater or equal than S times M. So this is actually a little bit more useful, this lemma than the previous one, because we can apply this to more cases, since we don't need to have like every edge different. It well, so I have a theorem that uses this. Like previously, that I defined the connected components of the complement, I shall denote by cjx the connected component of t minus x that lies on direction j. What I mean is that direction zero would be towards the root. The first direction is the first, the one that contains the vertex x plus one, and we follow clockwise. So the theorem says that if now again we can see what did I do? Yes, sorry, it's the same button for pointing as for moving the slide. Again, we have that n equals to two times m minus k over s plus l and this time l is um k over s. smaller than k of earth actually um both this term and the last one we ask that n is smaller than two times m yes only um the first theorem n was even smaller than this time and we shall assume that we have a set v of l vertices having degree three with the following properties Degree 3 with the following properties. The first property is that the remaining k minus L vertices of degree 3 can be separated into S sets U1 until US that are disjoint. I mean, they could intersect by pairs or, but not the intersection of all S sets must be disjoint. Each set UI has cardinality S minus one times K over S. Well, the floor. Well, the floor and for every y and v, there exists at least one direction j in could be direction 0, 1, or 2, and at least two indexes, such that in one direction the amount of vertices that are in q1 is different than the amount of vertices in the ui2. If all of this happens, then the topological complexity is greater than. Is greater of or equal than s times m minus k over s plus l. Okay, what does this mean? I have an example coming up. First, I shall give one more definition that I shall use in the following theorem. That is, given a tree, that we can construct another tree, F T, which has vertex at the essential vertex of T and two vertices are adjacent. If the unique path that goes through T does not That goes through t does not contain any other essential vertex. So, the example to the theorem is this. Well, assume we have this tree and that every h is sufficiently subdivided for any equal to 14. This would be then f of t, the trim tree, as you can call it. And as you can see, we have here eight essential vertices, but only one of them has degree greater than three. them has degree greater than three this k equals seven l equals one and if we take s equal to three we can see in the figure that the set v um since l is one consists only of one vertex would be the green vertex which is this the set u1 consists of blue vertices could be which would be these four vertices which correspond to this this This and these two. The set U2 consists of purple vertices. Here it's perhaps not so clear the difference between purple and red, but I hope you can see this. This one is half purple, this, this, and this is purple. As you can see, U1 and U2 intersect, but the three do not intersect. And finally, the red, U3 consists of the red vertices. U3 consists of the red vertices, which are these. As you can see, there is no vertex belonging to all three sets. Every set U1, U2, and U3 has cardinality 4, which is what we want. So by the previous theorem, the S topological complexity for S equals to 3 of this space is greater or equal than 21. And as you might remember, And as you might remember from the other side, this is the topological complexity is bounded by S times the dimension of the space. Well, the homotopical dimension. And as you might recall, the homotopical dimension was the minimum between the amount of essential vertices, which is eight, and the half of n, which would be seven. So the minimum is seven. So seven times three is exactly 21. Times three is exactly 21, so this bound is exact. It's and well, I still have time, right? Yes, like five minutes, perhaps, a little bit more. Okay, I'm going to give another definition. This is actually very similar to the not to the definition, but to the hypothesis of this theorem, where I wanted a lot of sets having A lot of sets having a lot of properties, only that this time the set V is not, there is not a separated set V, we only have S sets. So given a tree T, we shall denote by H S of T the minimal integer such that there exists S sets consisting of vertices which have degree 3 V1 up until Vs, such that for every set, the cardinality. For every set, the cardinality of vi is less or equal than h s of t. Every vertex that has degree one in the tree f of t, that's in the prune tree. So, sorry. For example, these vertices have degree one in this tree, but degree three in this tree. Those are the ones that I am interested in right now. Well, every vertex of that type belongs to one of the sets. And for every vertex of degree greater than one in f of t, which would be, for example, these two vertices, they have degree three in the starting tree, but in this tree, they have degrees two. Every one of those vertices. I wanted to ask for a J and at least two indexes, such that again, this holds in one direction. There exists a set that has more or less different amount of vertices than another set in that same direction. So, like I said before, the previous two theorems, in the previous two theorems, n was smaller than 2n. Smaller than 2m. So here I have that if n is greater or equal than 2m plus hs of t, then the topological complexity is greater or equal than s times the floor of n over 2. Of course, there is a gap between 2m, perhaps solitude, and h of s, which in I don't know, don't have any bounds for the. Bounds for topological complexity, but when n is sufficiently large, this larger than 2m plus hs, we have this theorem. Actually, the proof of the last theorem and this theorem are very similar to the theorem I did prove. So, the proof of this theorem and the following, we construct, instead of constructing S times S cells of dimension one. S times S cells of dimension one, we construct S cells of dimension M and then use the lemma I mentioned that you can always see an M cell as a product, a strong interaction product of one cell. So I do that and I obtain the S times M cells that were required in the lemma. And with that, I obtained this theorem. And well, one last corollary, like I said in the example. Like I said in the example, these inequalities are all equalities since this is bounded by above by the dimension. And in every theorem, it turns out that the dimension of the space is exactly the coincides with the bound. So these are all exact bounds. And well, that is all. Thank you very much for listening. I don't know if you have any. Listening, and I don't know if you have any questions. Are there any questions? I have a question. Yes. Can you discuss how your work overlaps with the work that Steve and Shire? Yes, I was pretty sure you were going to ask that. Shire does everything for S equals to 2, and I do it for every S. But if you take it. But if you take S equal to two, these are the same bounds that Schreier has. Only his method is different. As you can see, he does something that he, instead of asking for these sets, he says, okay, take a tree, like any tree. I don't know if you can see it. And then cover it with arcs. He asked for something about the arcs. About the arcs. And what I realized, because first I saw that my bounds were the same as his, but I didn't understand why, because he was talking about arcs and I was talking about sets. Well, it turns out that my sets are the endpoints of his arcs. And if one wants to put this in terms of his arcs, one would have to cover, instead of by arcs, you would have to cover the tree by stars. For s equal to three, you have to cover. For S equal to 3, you have to cover it by these stars, the tree. Or if S is like 4 or 5, you take like stars and you cover the tree with stars. So yes, it is in very different terms, but the bounds when you put S equal to 2 are the same. And I think the proof methods are a little bit more direct because SIP has to deal more with the homology of. More you have to do a little bit of jogging and she has a very lucid description. Sometimes you answer the words. Actually, when the tree has only vertices of degree three, I don't need dilemmas because we prove that in that case the cohomology ring is an exterior phase ring. So factorizations are unique and well, everything simplifies. Yes in the case of when s is 2, this function h2 of t, what is its value? What is this? Well, it depends on the tree. I mean I'm asking because I'm confused. The TC2 of these spaces is so. So the space is already isn't it maximum when n is at least 2m? Well, the age depends, as you can see, on the tree. So it's not like, I mean, I would have to do like a lot of examples to say, oh, h is always this. Actually, when s is equal to two, all my theorems I allow. Theorems: I allow epsilon to be one or zero, which when s is really high, it doesn't matter which one is it. But I believe that when we have like small, perhaps small trees or s equals to two, when epsilon is one, you can you don't have to take hs of t, but you can take, I believe, one less in some cases. Cases. But only when S is to that, actually, I didn't even put this there because it's only for some tiny cases that the epsilon makes a real, an important change in the bounds. Yes? Are there graphs that are not trees for which the Morse differential is always trivial? I actually don't know because, well, remember the Spali and Savalka's gradient vector. Spalians have alkala's gradient vector field is for any graph. But the problem for when you don't have trees is that every edge which lies, you fix a tree, a maximal, a generating tree in the graph, and every edge that lies outside of it is considered to be a non-order respecting edge. So if you would have like, sorry. If you have, for example, If you have, for example, I don't know a tree and you have like, I don't know, three cycles. Then one could have a critical cell consisting of dimension three, consisting only of these edges. But that makes the dimension that the dimension of these spaces is no longer bounded by an over two because you don't need for. Because you don't need for an edge to be inside a critical cell, you don't need the vertex lying aside, you can take only the edges that lie outside of the tree. So that makes everything the amount of critical cells is then much, much larger every time you have a cycle. So I haven't basically worked too much with graphs that are not trees. Not trees. It is something I would like to do. I did a few experiments with like one or two cycles, but yes, it gets complicated like very fast. The dimension grows very fast. It's no longer bounded by n over 2. So I actually don't know when the Morse differential would be trivial in one of those cases. Yeah, perhaps there is a graph where it does this, but I'm. It does is, but I'm I actually don't know, and I don't think there is because things get complicated really fast once there is their edges outside of the tree. Yes, did you study the assessment category or the ontological complexity for the question mark? No, I didn't study, actually, I didn't study the topological complexity at all. I just used the proposition that gives me that gives me. position that gives me that gives me bounce and that is it i mean so no yes for what the what the general formula is um not really but like you sus said in many cases the topological complexity is the maximum possible so if you ask me i think that in every I think that in every case would be maximal. That's what I would like because that's nice. But anything can happen, right? The main problem where it is more difficult to obtain this bound is when n is exactly 2m. So if at some point it is not maximal, that would be the point because since it is 2m, you would have exactly images and And vertices, and you don't have like vertices to move around. So that's like the most complicated case. But if I were to conjecture something, it would be that it is always maximal, the topological complexity. I would somehow prefer that it is you find cases where it is lower and and that you can improve the upper bound by constructing some explicit yes. Constructing some explicit motion planners. Yes. More questions? Let's thank Teresa again.
