Okay. I guess I should begin. Thank you. Thank you, Mario, for inviting Jennifer and Pulipong. This work I'm going to talk about is in progress and it's with a bunch of collaborators. You can see three postdocs and three grad students, which means you might write down in case you want a postdoc. So I wanted to go to Oaxaca and I was very excited to go, you know, especially because I wanted to ask everybody in the audience, you know, one-on-one, one question. I had like one question that I've been meaning to ask people around, especially people in the audience. So because I couldn't attend, I decided to give a talk just to ask the question. So the goal of this talk will be to Of this talk will be to ask a question and to show you how you can answer a question, and maybe you have other ideas on how to answer the same question. Okay, that would be the goal of this talk. And as you can see, it's about the pants complex. So what's the pants complex or the pants graph is for a closed surface, it's a graph which vertices are all pans decompositions of a given thick surface. Given fixed surface of genus G closed, and the edges between two panzic compositions will be two types of moves. A moves, which happen where two curves intersect at exactly two points algebraic zero, and S moves, which happen in a one-spunk tube torus where the course intersects in exactly one point. Okay, so that's the main. Okay, so that's the main player we're going to be talking about. But this is an example of moves, right? So in a genus 2 surface, you need three curves to make a parent decomposition. This is an example of an A move. You see, this curve changes to this one. And this is an S move where this curve changes to its one. Okay, so I am a tramanifold person. So I don't just think about fancy compositions, I think about fancy compositions. About fancy compositions where all the cores in that fancy composition bound disks in a fixed handlebody. Okay, so for example, I can think of these two pans decompositions as inducing the same handlebody because they all bound the same code system for our fixed handlebody, right? So, an observation is that A moves do not change the handlebody, and S moves change the handlebody. And S moves change the handle body in a very radical way, right? Because this curve intersects this dual, it tells you that they cannot bound disks in the same handy. So yeah, so I'm interested about this specific subset of the panzig, pH. So just for you to remember, pH would be all panzic compositions where the boundaries, where the corresponding disks in a fixed category H, and P sigma will be the Panzi complex of the surface. The pan complex of the surface. Okay, so here is this is the background in for the question I want to ask you. So this is work of, you can find it in early work of Gay and Kirby, These Ideas, but it's been written by Sambuli in 21 in a very nice paper. So where he proves like a bunch of correspondences between a bunch of sets. And the one I want to talk about today is a correspondence. Today is a correspondence, a one-to-one correspondence between four-dimensional manifolds and loops in Pan's complexes. So there is a one-to-one correspondence between four manifolds up to diffeomorphism and loops in different pants complexes up to some place, right? Let me tell you how to go one way. So, if I give you a loop in the pants complex, how you will build a four-dimensional manifold. Four-dimensional manifold. So let's see. I think I have a sketch here written. So if you have a loop in the Pans complex, that means that you have a bunch of a sequence of pansy compositions of a given surface, right? So let's say that the surface is sigma. And you have sequences, say that you have like an A move here, an S move here, and so on, so forth. You can have lots of things. And how do you build a form manifold? So all of these panzi compositions leave. So, all of these PANSI compositions live in the same surface. So, do you consider the surface sigma cross-disk? So, you consider this disk. And then each of these PANSI compositions bound disks in some handlebody, right? And that some handle body is unique, it only depends on the PANSI composition. So, you can fill in this PANSI composition for some handlebody H1, and then you take that copy of H1 and attach it, a color of H1 to you. A color of H1 to me, the surface cross eye. And you do that with all of the pants, all of the vertices of my path induce little colors of different handbodies attached to this surface cross D2, cross a disk. And then what you get is a four-manifold with lots of boundaries, right? This is a boundary. This is a boundary. You have lots of boundaries in the four-manifold, so you have to close it in some way. Like I said, A moves do not change the hungry. That A moves do not change the handle body. So that will mean that these two handle bodies are exactly the same if there is an A move connecting them. So you can fill this in with a color or a thicker color, right? Like H1 cross I. When you have SMOs, you cannot do that because the antibody changes, right? So H1 is not H2. Well, the fact that you know this is. Well, the fact that this is an S-move tells you that H1 union H2 is a very specific manifold. I would just say nice for the moment. And that nice manifold can be, such manifold can be filled in with another nice object, four-dimensional object. So that is a one-handed bottle. Right? So, so, yeah, so the whole point is that any path can be. At can be filled in uniquely, and that will give you a four-dimensional microphone that is closed. So, yeah, this is written in the work of Isambulli, but I think this direction is, you can argue that this appears in the work of Kirby and Gay, because that's kind of the idea behind trisections of four-manifolds, that every four-manifold can be described by a loop in the pass complex. Okay. Okay, so here's the question. So I keep saying pants complex, right? And pants complex has been around for a while. So, and I really care about this graph. Since this subset of the pants complex, so the question is, what do you know about the pants complex? And what specifically, what did you know about this embedded? That would be a question for the surface people, right? And for manifold people or the people that care about this connection, Care about this connection, the question will be: well, given the information we want, what can you say about the four manifold that is kind of like living in the loop? Right? So that's this is a very big question, but you know, I ask this to a lot of people because I feel that this question, this problem is, you know, it's been there for a while. So there's a lot of things that you could do. So let me give you an example of what type of things you could do, just so you have to have an idea of what I mean. Idea of what I mean. For example, an answer for question one could be the work of Hatcher and Thorsten, where they proved that after adding some cells to the Panz graph, very specific cells, you get a simply connected two-dimensional complex. Okay, that's a fact about the PANS complex. And why is this relevant? Well, all the loops give you four manifolds, but every loop is non-homotopic. loop is non-homotopic. So what Isambouly and Clark in 2019 did was to take this homotopy between a point and loops and any loop and build a coordinate between the four manifold given by the loop and some very standard four-dimensional object. This result is classic in four manifold topology, but the proof of this result was really nice that uses this connection between four manifolds and loops in the past complex. Four manifolds and looks in the past complex, and that's the type of question that I was wondering. Is there anything like that that you can say? Any questions so far? Good. So that's kind of the type of question that I wonder. So let me tell you more properties about the PANS complex, and you start, you know, Googling about it or thinking about it for months. And the following arrives, for example, this. example this this is a subset right this is just a bunch of pans decompositions it's a subset of there's no edges but like the way i think about it is so but the way the way i think about it is that you have this subset right this is like pH inside p of sigma and of course you have a moves between them that do not change the handlebody right you have lots of a moves but s moves take you out of the handlebar take you to another out of the handlebar. Take you to another pH prime. Just take you away. So the first observation is that, well, fancy compositions, you can cook a code system from them. So really every two code systems are, you know, their equivalent of 200 slides. So that, you know, after some work that you can do, you get that any two positive compositions in this case are connected by A B. So this graph. Abels. So this graph is actually a connected subgraph of the complex. That's the one observation. And the second observation is that, well, what do we learn when we learn about handlebaries? That any two handlebodies are omeomorphic, right? Because if you give the two three-dimensional handlebodies to the same boundary, there is always a diffeomorphism that sends one of the surfaces and one set of curves to the other, right? So that diffeomorphism will induce So, that diffeomorphism will induce an isomorphism of these two graphs. So, really, you have the pants graph. So, just from these two, maybe you can call it. So, really, from these two, you have the pants complex. It's really a union, this union of the same thing, right? So, it's like the way I think about it is that you have these like hyperplanes that are laying there, which are all the Which are all the pants complex of different handlebodies, and then you have some S modes between them, which you know have some, which really don't understand how they are because they are so funny. You know, there's a lot of, we really don't understand how these S moves behave because that really tells you something about the four manifolds, all the four-dimensional closed manifolds. Right? So then this becomes like a very hard question. It's like, well, what can you say about Is what can you say about this specific setup? Like you have this complex and you're kind of foliating the same complex, the complex by the same sub-complex. And they're just, you know, yeah. I guess I like to write that, so I stop. But then, so, so this is kind of an observation you have. So then you can ask more questions about just the connectivity or just the embedding of this thing. For example, is this embedding just Is this embedding geodesic, right? Like, is this what I mean by that? Is like, is it, is it, is it curved? For example, maybe that is, you have bad luck that there is a very long path of A moves that takes you between very short path of S moves or, you know, S and A moves that are outside. So questions like that, I haven't found them online. Although there is a bunch of work about from Sebastian Helsel about what? About what? About the Handelbody group, which is a subgroup of the Hamapping class group of the circles. So, this is a complex counterpart of those results. So, maybe these questions have answers. And then, just to finish the style I was going for, these are properties about the PANS graph. Then, what can you tell me about the four-dimensional object, right? The four-dimensional object, right? For example, if this question were to be true, so if one c is true, you can cook, then there exist for manifolds with high L invariance for the experts in the object. So the point is that some knowledge of this. Some knowledge of this, the surface implies things about the topology of your four-dimensional mind. And that's just one that, you know, this is something I've been wanting to answer this particular question. And, you know, I'm just promoting anything someone knows something or wants to tell me what they know about it. Okay, so now let me spend the rest of the talk telling you about what we do know, but what it's proven. And these are a different, this is. And these are a different, this is another way to answer the very vague question. So, in the work we have, we're doing progress, we have the following property of the pants complex. It's a very long part, so I guess I'll read it. And for this, you need to know two pants graph, right? So, you need to know two handlebars. So, you have the first handle body set, right? So, you have like pH one here. One here, and you have the second hand-body set pH2. Again, everything is even in P sigma. And what you know is that together they form a Higger is planning for a very standard format, right? So what we prove is that actually any geodesic, any distance between these two sets is fixed. So it's a very specific number. Specific number, and in fact, every geodesic that arises in there is very nice. So, for those three manifolds in the audience, this should remind you, this should feel like Waihausen's theorem, right? Because these three manifolds are standard Higger splittings, right? And the standard Heater splittings are basically parallel curves and dual curves. Those dual curves are the commuting. Let me draw a picture for you guys to see a little bit. picture for you guys to see a little bit more what this is. For example, if I'm in a, I guess this is genus equal to four, right? My four man, my surface, my two manifold is given by these two here, split these two handle bodies, right? Which is these two are same, these two are same, and you have the dual pairs. So that tells you you have a twice stabilized genus to begin splitting for. genus to bigger splitting for two connected samples, one cross two. And what we're proving is that in the past complex, these two separate islands, right, the handle body sets, are connected by geodesics that look exactly like this. So you only have things that are different at the dual pairs, and everything else is exactly the same. So for example, there is this. The same, so for example, there is this is an LS move, right? And then from here, this is the next move, and you understand where's the commutativity part? Well, you can see that you can duplicate this picture, right? And you can, I can give you another sequence by just changing the order in which I decide to change my course, right? So, for example, instead of changing the top curve, I will change the bottom curve. I will change the bottom code, and that's allowed because they're destroying the domain where the support of these modes are this thing, right? So you can move them around. That's what commuting smooths mean, right? Great. So yeah, that's the property that we know about the Parance complex for this very specific and very nice Gigar springs, right? And then you will say, well, so what? What can you do about the loops in the Parance complex? Well, let me tell you, the Let me tell you, the given this property about the pins complex, you can prove something about every loop for manifolds that have very few A loops. Remember, there are two decimals in the Pan's complex. You have S mules and A mules. So if I give you a closed surface and I give you a loop in the Panz complex with a bunch of S modes, and I only tell you that that loop has only one A mod or two A modes or zero A modes, then actually that. Then actually, that for manifold that the loop is inducing is diffeomorphic to a very standard manifold, right? These are like the William Drupal for manifolds quality. So this is, this is, you know, this, you understand this decomposition is not unique, but the point that I'm trying to make is just to show you that manifolds, if you have an exotic manifold or something funny that is not this very nice manifold, then you must have at least three elements. So that's that. That's kind of the type of results that we have. And let me finish this part just by reminding you of the questions, right? And I'll just show you two ways to answer these questions. So I wanted to write it out. So maybe you can tell me is what do you know about this, specifically about the handle body group inside the mapping class group, right? You can phrase it already. And given information from that, what can you then say? Information from that, what can you then say about the four manifold that the loop is giving you? And just to tell you, this is not a new idea. This happened, this began, at least from my perspective, from work of Jason Johnson, I think in 2016, when he talks about this distance between two underbody sets for he can split in sort of a fixed remicle. Right? So you start, if you know, like the You start, if you know, like the working for Hempel distance, you start asking, well, what can you do if instead of working on the curve complex, you work now in the pants complex or the pan's gap. Well, J.C. Johnson has a nice paper where he begins discussing this idea. And then Alex Supin, let's put it here. I don't remember the year, but then he extended these ideas for bridge position. So what I'm trying to say is that these techniques exist for three months. Exists for three manifolds and three loops, it links in three manifolds with respect to some bigger surface. So now the question is: can you leave those ideas into four space? Right? And that's a question that I've been, I really wanted to ask you at different moments of the week. But let me, so just to end, let me tell you the secret thing that's during the background, which, you know, this is kind of the Which, you know, this is kind of the motivation of these questions. When I was preparing the talk, I realized that you don't have to talk about this background because this is all about the pants complex. That's what makes it really nice and natural. But let me tell you, like, where is this coming from? Like, why these pony definitions and so on. Well, so all of this arises from the theory of trisections of formats introduced by QB and Gay in 2016. And let me just give And let me just give you a definition. I will not define what a trisection is, but the only thing you need to know, or multisection, is that the data that is given to you that determines the four-manifold is a sequence of antibodies, you know, with the same boundary that together by pairs give you standard four-manifree manifold. So these are hit splittings for some number of connectors and robust microscopes. So given that data, you can, instead of having You can instead of having two clouds, you have a bunch of clouds, right? You have a bunch of sort of handle-body sets just lying around in the hands complex. And then, what you can do, you can now look at a loop that passes through each of the handle body sets in a geodesic way, right? You remember, we know the distances here, so you say, well, give me geodesics there. And then what would be the minimum distance here? So computed, computed, computed. Computed, computed, computed, computed, and then sum those numbers, the extra part, not the bridges, and then minimize about all possible bridges that you can have, right? And that's a number. As you understand, you might know already these numbers are impossible to compute. But these numbers are impossible to compute, but you can define them. And these are, we call them the L invariant, here we come to invariant for the multi-section or the. For the multi-section or the sequence and what you minimize all possible user breaches. And then all the results, the results that I told you about, for example, the result about having very few A-moves, actually it's a result about the L-invariant. The results are the following. If your L-invariant, this number that I defined above, I don't care if you remember, it's just a number that depends on your manifold, is no more than two, then your form. Then your form manifold is very special, it's a standard form, and we have other results as well. If you have now, you know, in order to get a stronger result, you have to restrict your setups. So if you fix your genus, genus 2, and if you fix the number of the type of tree manifold that you can have in your trisection and multi-section, and you restrict the number of clouds that you can have. So this would be a picture like this, right? You only have four clouds. Like this, right? You only have four clouds and you have one edge between them, these are one numbers, right? That's how the hunter body said, you have four clouds. Then the thing is, if the distance, the leftover distance, like this plus this plus this plus this, the di, right? If the di's is some, no more than six, then your four manifold is actually not standard anymore, but it's still very well understood. But it's still very well understood. It's a so-called spawn lens. Good. So, yeah, these are the type of results that we can have. And they come motivated from trisections, but really are questions about answers. So, yeah, thank you for listening. And if you have any comments, please, or answers for the question I have, please send me any more. Is there any questions or answers? I have one question. You mentioned that whether the pants graph of the handlebody is geodesic. Is that that gives? That gives you a number of other things. Is there a weakening of that? Can it, can you? Is it enough to say quasi-geodesic, for example? Yeah, that's embedded. I really haven't thought about it, but I think that's the type of thing that I was looking for, you know, like what weakenings are reasonable that you could use. The one that I have, you know, this if you're geodesic, then you can use something else to get something, but the geodesic, I don't think so, right? Because I was told. So, right, because I was told by some people later that I would say this is wrong, but I don't care. The handle body group is distorted in the mapping task group. So that should tell you that if you take a pass and you, you know, let it flow with the handle body group, let it travel, you're going to get something that is like distorted and has batteries actually. So maybe it's like very bad, but who knows? Thanks. Okay, other question? Hi, Roman. Thanks. The handle body set in there has the property that you can, like for non-separating disks, right? You can, there's a symmetry where you can like move one non-separating disk to any other non-separating disk. Separating disk. Does that have any consequences when you start thinking about the four manifolds? I don't think so because you're saying, like, there is this, you're saying there's this excellent, right? Like two, six or something. There is this edge. There is this loop in the hands graph. I think that changes. Well, I have some co-authors that might correct me, but I don't think that gives you like, I think that gives you like a standard for manifold. But the thing is, can you use those tricks to say something? Can you use those tricks to say something about the embedding of this pans complex this complex in the in the in the in the pans complex right that's kind of the question can you do that like you know just combinatorially maybe it's too hard yeah thank you i have one question um do you uh can you do all this with for manifolds with boundary i know there's trisections for There's trisections for four manifolds with boundary, and does tell anything about the three-manifold on the boundary, or yeah, that's a good question. I don't think we have thought about for my focus boundary, but just for you to know, like you know already that the PANS complex is not a closed surface thing. So actually, all our results extend for surface that are punctured surfaces, which correspond. So, I guess I should correct you, right? So, so. Gravity, right? So, so when you have, so when you have a surface is closed, so when sigma is closed, that gives you a four-manifold that is closed. When your surface is punctured, let's just leave it like that, that gives you a pair of a four-manifold and a surface embedded in bridge position. You know, like I can, that that gives me a surface embedded. And the result that we have actually work in both. Result that we have actually work in both cases. And I think that's like that's like us here. But there's other definitions. There is this definition of, I think, Maggie, Tamova, and I think Miller. And I will miss the other authors, right? But they do talk about these ideas for manifold boundary, and they have some relations with the boundary, like you're asking, Shelly. Thank you. Any other question? If not, let's thank the speaker again. Thank you.
