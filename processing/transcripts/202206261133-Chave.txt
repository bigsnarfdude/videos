Converse in the Earth and Ocean Sciences to Multi-Taper. I read the Gospel of 1982 when it came out. It took me a couple of weeks to go through it time and again and to the point where I had some basic understanding. I then coded it up, at least for Power Spectra, and it worked really well. So I went to Bob Parker because I was at Scripps at the time, and I said we should get David out to Scripps as a green scholar to give. Scripps as a green scholar to give a short course on this. And, you know, he was sold pretty quickly, but we had to go to Walter Monk, who is the, at that point, held all the purse strings. And Walter had only one question. Is he maximum entropy? I said, no. He said, good. We'll invite him. And then three years later, I went to Bill Labs. So I'm going to talk today about the analysis of some geomagnetic data. Magnetic data showing very high Q, high, I mean, over a thousand spectral peaks and extensive non-stationarity in the geomagnetic field. And my co-authors on this are Dave, Doug Luther, who's a physical oceanographer at Scripps, and Dave Riegert, who's here. Alan, he's at Hawaii. He's not at Scripps. No, sorry. Here, he's at Hawaii. Okay, how do I advance these? That's not. So, the data I'm going to use here are standard Hanwillu Observatory geomagnetic data from April of 2001 to May of 2002. They're one-minute data. The reason I chose that interval is that I have seafloor pressure data that was collected by Doug and me during the Hawaii Ocean Mixing Experiment. And there is an interest in comparing them. I won't talk about that today. Comparing them. I won't talk about that today. Prior work by, in particular, by Dave and Frank used data segments that were long enough for adequate frequency resolution, but short on the time scale for non-stationarity. And the standard has become 60 days. These data were collected in the early days of flux state magnetometers, and there are frequent data gaps in them. So there were only three 60-day intervals in the time. Three 60-day intervals in the time series that I could use. And those covered yearday, 298 to 358, 358 to 418, and 424 to 484. That's all reference to 1-1-2001. Solar cycle 23 peaked in late 2001. So the geomagnetic activity is moderate to high, although I'll show you in a second that it's not high in the last two segments. It certainly is in the first. The activity level. The activity level of the geomagnetic field tends to be saw-tooth, so it comes up to a peak and then collapses. And that's what happened basically around the first of the year. So in geomagnetism, there are various indices. This is sort of like botany. It's a descriptive approach from the early days. There is something called Kp, which is the planetary K index. This is a logarithmic measure of planetary geomagnetic activity. Planetary geomagnetic activity. If Kp is under five, the interval is quiet. If it's nine, that'll happen once or once to three times in a given 11-year cycle. You'll notice that in the first interval, there are two peaks that are above eight and a third one that approaches seven. The activity level is fairly high there, but when you get to these last two intervals, it's down around five and not so bad. So you might expect that this. So, you might expect that this interval, this first interval, will be dominated by the activity of the geomagnetic field. And I'll show you in a second that that's true. So, this is the power spectrum, multi-tapered naturally, of the average of each of these 60-day segments. So, the components here are H, which is the north geomagnetic field, Z, which is the vertical, and D, which is the east-west. The vertical and the north are of comparable value at high frequencies and separated by an order of magnitude low. However, the east-west is down by a couple of more orders of magnitude. I want to point out that over this interval here, which is right around 2,000 to 4,000 microhertz, there's a lot of variability in the spectrum, more than Variability in the spectrum, more than you would expect for a central chi-squared process. I'll then show you that, in fact, there's marked non-stationary across most of the span, and that explains what you're observing here. So, what I'm going to do is fit a mixture of central, non-central distribution to the raw spectral estimates across 1,000 microhertz wide bands on each of these three data sections. Each of these three data sections. So the model I'm fitting is just a mixing fraction, epsilon, and the non-centrality parameter. Epsilon is the fraction of non-central chi-squared, and one minus epsilon is then the central one. And this was all implemented using a non-linear multivariable programming solver. This is some examples of the FIPS. Examples of the fit over 2 to 3,000 microhertz. So, this is nowhere near where it's at a peak. The solid line is a kernel density estimator fit to the raw data. The dashed line is the central chi-squared fit. The dotted line is the non-central chi-squared fit, and the dashed dot is the mixture model. As you can see in the first interval, which is the one that had a lot of geomagnetic activity, the model doesn't work very well. In fact, the Work very well. In fact, the spectrum is bimodal, just the raw spectrum is bimodal. But if you go to the other two intervals, the model fits pretty well. There's a misfit here up at the mode and there. But otherwise, it explains the width of the observed spectrum that you can't explain with the central distribution. And if you then go and compute the average fit to the last two of these intervals, 358 to 418, 424 to 484, you get the mixture of fractions I've shown here. Over 2 to 3,000 microhertz, it peaks at 35% non-centrality. So clearly something is going on in here that's not expected. So, I'm going to be using or talking about non-stationary spectra. And so, we start with the Cromer representation, which I believe came out in 1940, where you have an X of F, which is an unobservable increment process, and the time series is then generated through a Fourier expansion of this unobservable increments process. As Dave showed yesterday, a stationary process has orthogonal. A stationary process has orthogonal increments. So, for two distinct frequencies, the expected value of dx times dx conjugate at f1 and f2 is just the spectrum s of f1 times the delta function times df1 df2. And the important point here is that distinct frequencies for a stationary process are uncorrelated. A non-stationary process has non-orthogonal increments. So the expected value of dx of f1 and dx star of f2 is now the s of l f1. Is now the Sab L F F1 F2 DF1 DF2. And the point here is that distinct frequencies are correlated. S of L is the Louise spectrum that was, I believe, proposed by Michelle Louev in the mid-40s, 45, 46 in Levieux Scientifique. Another important point is that if a non-stationary process, if there's a non-stationary process present that is forced at a given frequencies, this will result in power transfers. This will result in power transfer to other unforced frequencies with concomitant high correlation. I'll show you that in data. In other words, forced stationarity is inherently nonlinear. For the rest of this talk, I'm going to use standardized spectra. What I'm going to do is I'm going to take the data, each of those 60A segments, and I will high-pass filter the data using a Butterworth three-pole filter with a 3DB point at 3 dB point at 46 microhertz, and I'll run that forward and backward to eliminate phase shifts. I'll then compute the multi-taper spectrum utilizing an AR filter for pre-whitening. I'll then post-whiten the spectrum by fitting and removing a quadratic polynomial to the log spectrum versus logs frequency over one to 500 microhertz. I will then plot the spectrum on a linear frequency versus linear. On a linear frequency versus linear power scale, and assess the significance using the p-quantiles of the mixture chi-square model that I previously fit to it. And just a reference for these 60-day segments with a time bandwidth of five, which is what I'll use routinely, the resolution bandwidth is 1.9 microhertz and the Rayleigh resolution is 0.19, or if you like, 190 nanohertz. I will also use the frequency offset coherence. The frequency offset coherence. This is a proxy for the Llewev spectrum. It has two independent variables. One is ordinary frequency F, the other is offset frequency about a given frequency F, F prime. For a stationary process, the offset coherence is zero, except that F prime equals zero. The resolution bandwidth holds for ordinary frequency, in other words, 1.9 microhertz. The Rayleigh resolution. The Rayleigh resolution pertains for the offset frequency. And I'll plot this as a contour plot of ordinary versus offset frequency with coherence scaled so that the most incoherent elements are emphasized. And I'll describe that further in a second. The working hypothesis here is that these non-stationary and high Q features that are seen in the data are the presence of solar normal modes. This is somewhat controversial. This is somewhat controversial, particularly amongst the space physics community, which believes that geomagnetic or the solar wind is really only displaying turbulence and there can't be any modes in there. But these are well known. They've been studied by helioseismologists now for 30 years or thereabouts. Some of the internal fluctuations of the sun can be modeled as normal modes represented by a spherical harmonic expansion. Spherical harmonic expansion. There are quantum numbers n, l, and m for the radial zeros, latitudinal, and longitudinal modal lines. They are characterized by a center frequency F and a quality factor Q. I'm only going to talk about P modes. These are solar acoustic standing waves that exist over a band of between 25, sorry, 250 and 5100 hertz. Their amplitudes are random due to their origin in turbulent processes in the uppermost part of the sun. In the uppermost part of the sun. P-mode Qs are typically several thousand based on the optical observations. So a given mode persists for a few months and these things fade in and fade out. Because we're observing them on Earth and Earth rotates, there is sometimes cyclostationarity due to the Earth's rotation. There's also a nonlinear process in the magnetosphere that produces cyclostationarity at about That produces cyclostationary at about plus or minus half a mic a day or two days period. So, what I've shown here is that first block of data, the 298 to 358. I plotted the standardized spectrum at the bottom along with the peak quantiles of the mixture, central, non-central distribution. And the peak quantiles extend up here to six nines, so they're quite large. They're quite large. You also see the scale here is such that a four means the coherence is significant at four nines level. The yellow purple border would be three nines and so forth. What you see is where the spectrum has peaks or is elevated, you get pervasive non-stationarity in the form of these triangular. Non-stationary in the form of these triangular blocks or trapezoidal blocks. And you can see one here. This is the most significant level. It's actually seven nines. The trapezoidal blocks are easily understood. If F1 is coherent with a frequency F2 that's larger than F1, then the coherence will be high at positive offset frequency F2 minus F1, and also at negative offset frequency F1 minus F2 at frequency F2. And so the result is these trapezoidal blocks. Is these trapezoidal blocks when there's non-stationary that's present? All that you're seeing in here, I'm not going to argue for normal modes here. There is maybe something there. These green lines are the known frequencies of P modes as indexed at the top. Mostly what you're seeing here is just the high geomagnetic activity, and I'm not going to use this data block any further. If you look at the next If you look at the next data block, however, you do see a 0.99 significant peak under P36 and another one over here at P42. These might very well be normal modes. There is significant offset coherence, although it's not as high as the previous example. So this might be an example of. This might be an example of solar normal modes. And if you go to the next block over, the last 60-day block, you get 0.99 plus significance at P42 and then at P35. If you compute the Q's of these, the apparent Qs, which are the peak height divided by the full width at half power, the Q is at least 270 here and at least 400 here. Here. And it's determined really by the resolution bandwidth. It could be much higher. We just can't sense it with the techniques that we have to employ. You'll notice that the offset coherence is high at this peak. You'll also notice that it has a trapezoid block, which suggests that some of these M-splitting terms are coherent with each other. You don't see much coherence over here at this peak. Coherence over here at this peak. And so you might say, and I should point out that these are about 11 and a half microhertz apart, which is exactly the splitting you would expect for one cycle per day rotation, cyclostationarity of the Earth. So to assess that, what I'm going to do is average the offset coherence across regular frequency, across that peak. And remember that the offset frequency has the resolution bandwidth of 190 microhertz or nanohertz, the Rayleigh bandwidth. So here's the zero peak at the center. What you've got is splitting of that peak. You're seeing small peaks next to it that are at about 450 nanohertz. That's more or less what you would expect. That's more or less what you would expect for rotational splitting. So you're seeing the m equals plus and minus one peaks here. You're seeing nothing at one cycle per day on either side. So that second peak is not the one cycle per day splitting. It's in fact a separate peak. And you do see half cycle per day coherence. And these are quite significant. I mean, that's three nines there. Moving up in frequency, this is the. Oh, no. What I'm going to do here, the state of the art in the space physics community is to use the raw periodogram on data and make their inferences from that. I've only found one paper in that literature where they use multi-paper. So, this is an example where I've taken my spectrum, I've now computed a periodogram of the A periodogram of the data, but I've used all of the standardization processes that we've used before. In other words, the high-pass filtering, the pre-whitening, and the post-whitening. And it actually performs okay. I mean, it finds these two peaks and reproduces that reasonably well. This, however, is not what our space physics colleagues would do. They would do this. That is to say, they would just use the raw periodogram to take the Fourier. Periodogram to take the Fourier transform, square the coefficients, and or the absolute coefficients, and call that the spectrum. And as you can see, it doesn't look at all like the multi-caper spectrum in particular. This peak up here is almost completely missed. That one you can see, but it's got extraneous peaks out here that don't actually exist. They're almost certainly just due to the bias of this estimator. It's a terrible estimator. So, going up in frequency, this is now 1310 to 1410 microhertz for the third data interval. Again, you've got a four nines peak here. The red lines are the center frequency, so that means the m equals zero. If I plotted all of the possible 2L plus one splitting terms for each of these, it would just be a picket fence of red lines. So, this one is fairly close to P. So, this one is fairly close to P248. This one is fairly close to P247. That one to P328. There is extensive offset coherence. So, you're seeing that this peak in particular is coherent with all the remaining peaks that you're seeing in there. If you just count the frequency, that's what you find. And with some, in fact, some things here. This goes back to what I said earlier about force force. About forced forced a non-stationary process that is forced at one frequency will, in fact, show up elsewhere, and that's what you're seeing here. The Q of this peak is again controlled by the resolution bandwidth, so it's about seven, it's at least 700. Going up yet a higher in frequency, this is 2270 to 2370, I think, microhertz band for the second. For the second data interval, there are a number of peaks here that hit 0.999, and they all have Q's of at least 770 based on the resolution bandwidth. This one in particular has very high offset coherence, and it extends to higher frequencies. So from there, up 20 would take you to that. So it's this peak it's seeing. And then up here, it's at 50. So that's probably this right here. Right here. And again, that red is at least 4.9 coherence. And finally, this one, the ones I've shown previously are all 100 microhertz wide. This one is 200 microhertz wide. It extends from 3120 to 3420 microhertz. You get a large number of lines that are significant. A large number of lines that are significant at at least the three nines level and sometimes the four nines level, like that one, and you get a very extensive offset coherence that extends throughout the band. Some of these may be forced by or maybe solar normal modes. I've again put in the center frequencies of these, but because everything is coherent, it's really hard to sort out what's what. But it is not a turbulent whites or one over F. Or one over F squared spectrum by any means. And I'm again, I'm going to go to this 3390 peak. That's this one right here. And I'll average the offset coherence across the regular frequency across that peak. That's what I get. So, what you're seeing here, this is the center of the peak, and these. The center of the peak, and these bands next to it are all offset at about 450 nanohertz. So that would be the m equals one, m equals two, m equals three splitting terms. You're seeing a very strong coherence at half a cycle per day, but you're not seeing much of anything at a cycle per day in this particular data set. So there is some degree of splitting at the two-day period. Again, this is what would happen if you did a periodogram using the process that we've used here, the high-pass filtering pre-whitening and post-whitening. It performs reasonably well once you've done all those steps and does pick out most of the same features that you see in the multi-taper spectrum. But if you do a raw periodogram, you get a mess. It doesn't look anything. You get a mess. It doesn't look anything like it. In fact, you're getting large peaks here where there's nothing in the multi-taper estimate. And you're not seeing what's going on out here. So this is not a good estimator. So, in conclusion, a substantial non-central fraction up to 35% is detectable over 2 to 4,000 microhertz. Narrowband Hertz. Narrowband, high Q, non-stationary peaks are pervasive in these data. The quasi-two-day mode is apparent in some instances, but not the diurnal cyclostationarity. Solar normal modes are detectable with medium degree, but the rotational splitting terms appear to be confined to low values, even to high frequencies. I'm not finding more than m equals one, I mean, m equals plus or minus one to plus or minus three. And noise, non-stationary, non-stationarity is pervasive with forcing at modal frequency. Pervasive with forcing at modal frequencies with resulting in transfer of power to non-modal frequencies, which makes interpretation particularly hard, particularly at high frequencies where the forcing is largest based on the non-central fraction. Next steps on this is I've got the ACE data. ACE is a spacecraft at the L1 Lagrange point, and I've got that data over the same interval. I'm going to be looking at the canonical coherence between the two, and I've, of course, got. And I've, of course, got the seafloor pressure data, and I would be interested in seeing what the mechanism for getting these modes into the Earth is. Is it coming in the geomagnetic field, modulating, if you like, the dipole of the Earth or the bow shock of the Earth? And that, in turn, shakes the Earth, and therefore you get it into pressure data, and you do see these in seismic data as well, as Dave and Frank have shown. And Frank have shown. I'm interested in trying to sort that out. And so that's the next step.
