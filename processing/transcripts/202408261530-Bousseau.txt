I think we're actually really pleased to end on the whole SP control. Yeah, exactly. But it seems like a lot of work. I mean, I agree with the rock. Oh, yeah, sorry. I guess we're just going to start at 10-til. And then we'll hear from the pressure. Yeah, because you're back to back, so I might have to add some of the things that we're going to do. Well, so if we push a little bit into dinner, it's hoping to think it's already a little bit more difficult. Yeah. There's people milling around that side and just make some chairs. I guess you could just say how many of you have to do it. Like if I took a whole map product and don't have to have a structure, there would be to be close structural structures, which is available for contributions to this topic. But when you do the multiplication, all goes to the right. Yeah, on the rest of the skills of the buttons we're doing. My duplication on a screen in this material, like the sentences I have on here.  I can't identify four framings to restrict the oldest profit. C tip C.  It's not about twisting around in the jump exactly the instructions and how to go about this. I don't know what it's about. You're telling me it's just like loose. Oh, yeah. No, okay, but somewhat nothing for you. That's okay. That's functional. So you can do a plus or minus one and then you s then you see how it changes. And then you s then you see how it changes when you look at the way that they don't the way you should look at it. I think you have to somehow capture something like this um like this didn't structure algebraically otherwise that's just the right thing and if you try to do it by some other kind of things but I think that when one could do this in other words but I'm trying to say what it is algebraic then I'm okay you take two sections oh sure yeah Oh sure, yeah. So you're basically trivializing W, which is not the same as the small. But you need to get a spinach. So you choose two relationships. I mean different realizations. That's going to be like sort of one point in your double button. So you have these two. It is cooler in here a little bit. Well, maybe it's a good thing for the speaker. I don't know if it's a good thing for people who are sitting down. That was very nice. I appreciate that once. Oh, yeah. I have been floors. I was coming here. And I really don't know how much time I am. That's the soul goal. I'm always very ambitious. But then also, you know, I also back-to-back talk stuff. Yeah, keep doing control. Yeah, it's true. Okay. Well, I mean, what I want to really say is that, like, that's all the That's the the push forward of the tangent is somehow the square of the square I mean it's the square of the push forward of the tangent you've pulled back from P3 to the universal curve and push forward in modulus space and take the determinant. Because that means the the orientation model of modulus space. Orientation under the sheet for the analog. Oh yeah, I mean. Everybody knows that you have it. Just not sure I can put it in. And then we'll prove to you that's just the different rate. It's just the content. What do we call the covers in the module, I suppose? I mean, okay, you have to put in something about a few large evaluation. Hold back. Well, I mean, you don't. Because P3 isn't oriented anyway. Yeah, but pulling back just by economical balance. Again, I mean, you only need an actual absolute orientation of the mattos of these. So I just want to know what. So I just want to know what the panel model of matrix is. That's the right thing. Okay, actually fill it out. Oh, okay. Okay. It's not directly related to the evaluation and outputs, it's E3. I think it's very nice. I mean, geometrically it's not quite the same thing, it's not a HP. Right, I mean, in the end, we'll wind up basically. Right, I mean in the end we'll wind up basically getting the same thing. I don't think we don't really want I mean it's better if we can avoid looking at the ramification of the validation process because it doesn't have a hopeful thing. Are you a chalk here? Yes. Okay. Now you know we use the default schedule which has a very unpleasant feature that we have to We have two hour talks. So, we do not say we go into dinner. So, come on, maybe. Let's keep it kind of if you can. Yeah. But if you do go over, don't just connect because we can push everything back to the application. But you call it. Of some line. Do you mean let's call it medium lines right there? Just a chart. Yeah, yes, it has cover costs. Yeah, but I so you could write it. Maybe I'll put it. Actually, it's still recording.
