All right, so algebraically a solution of the cell duality equations corresponds to a pair. E phi that is slope stable. Well, polystable, I should say. That is slope poly stable. Okay, so there's an algebraic condition that, I mean, this course. Algebraic condition, I mean, this corresponds to something that is very concrete algebraically about our vector bundle, and I'll just say it in words. It just means that if you take any subshape of E that is phi invariant, meaning that phi maps it to itself, tensored by, of course, the canonical bundle here, then the subsheaf has to have degrees strictly smaller than the degree of the vector bundle E. Okay, but it's something that we can check algebraically. And then, of course, you can study solutions. Of course, you can study solutions of this equation using algebraic geometry, which is great. Okay, so, but the more general setup will be something quite similar. So as I said, now we just have, I'll leave it here, X is a compact complex manifold. And then we have fixed. And then we have fixed. This is just a fixed holomorphic vector bundle. And then here we're interested in pairs. E, phi, our Higgs field now is a bundle mapped from E to E tensored by V, this vector bundle, of any rank. I'm not putting any conditions on the rank. And but we also want P to be holomorphic. So it just is. To be holomorphic. So it's just a section of a holomorphic section over X of the endomorphism bundle of V tensured by V. And then corresponding to these equations, and you have corresponding gauge theory equations, okay? And the equation will be quite similar. In the equation, we won't have the first one from the Salt Duvele because this just tells us that phi is holomorphic, right? So we're already assuming that we're only considering holomorphic phi. Holomorphic phi, and then you have the remaining one, which will be exactly the same equation. Okay, so let me see. All right, so I need to give you a definition. So we have our pair, we have our pair here, E5. Here, E phi, and then let's say that H is a Hermitian metric on E, then I'll define, we'll say that H is said to satisfy the phi permission Einstein. I'll just, for simplicity, always write information as HE equations. If okay, so now on my manifold, I need to put some kind of metric. So here, OPAG G is a good usual metric. On x, which simply means that del del bar of omega, if this is an n-dimensional complex n-dimensional manifold, del del bar omega to the n minus one is zero. And you need the metric to be able to define a degree of your manifold. So this will is relevant in the stability description of things. But now, okay, so but it also comes up in the gauge, um, the gauge theory equation. So so the metric H, So the metric H, so little g is a metric on the compact complex manifold, but here little h is a Hermitian metric on the vector bundle. And little h is set to satisfy the five Hermitian Einstein equations if I times here, well, here we need to be able to define the dual of the Lefschetz operator, we need the metric. So we'll be using that. And then here, my F. And then here, my f is also the curvature of the train connection. I mean, I have this is a homomorphic vector bundle, E. And so I, you know, if I, if I fix a permission metric, then I have a natural train connection, and I mean, I have a unique train connection, and FH is the curvature, and then plus here the commutator of phi and the adjoint of phi with respect to the Hermitian metric model H. And this will be equal to some constant. Will be equal to some constant times the identity of E. Okay, so these are the five permission Einstein equations. Okay, so this is what we have. And well, maybe a couple of remarks. The first is that, well, if 5 is 0, Is zero. I mean, you know, you could start with a pair where the Higgs field is zero. There's nothing forcing you to do that. I mean, obviously, we are interested in cases where phi is not zero. But in this case, then this term completely goes away and you're left with the usual Hermitian-Einstein equations. Then the equations reduce to the known Hermitian isolation. Hermitian-Einstein equations. Simply, I lambda g of FH is equal to a constant times the identity. Okay, and then there is a Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence that tells us that these are all correspond to stable bundles. Okay, so stable bundles will simply be a bundle where no subsheaf, well, every any subsheaf, proper subsheaf of E, will have to have the Sheaf of E will have to have degrees smaller than the degree of E. Okay, so again, a algebraic characterization of what those bundles are. Okay, so this we and we get the usual get usual notion of stability. Okay, now another case where this would reduce to the usual yannal. This would reduce to the usual Yannill's equation or a solution would be if this commutator is zero. Okay? And so one can consider solutions where, if you want some non-trivial solutions that are a little bit, maybe the phi is not zero, but you also want to impose that this commutator is not zero. So if the commutator So, if the commutator is zero, then EH satisfies the usual permission Einstein equations. And so, again, the underlying bundle has to be stable. Well, polystable. Polystable simply means that it's a direct sum of stable bundles of the same slope. Again, it's very technical. So I don't want to spend too much time defining these things, but they're very concrete algebraic definitions. Okay, so one may be interested in, so maybe it is interesting to focus in the case where phi is such that That the commutator is not zero. Okay, so I mean, I'm not, I don't know all the physics literature, but when V happens to be the canonical bundle, then these correspond to T-brains. And Fernando and some others have done a lot of work. Also, Lara, who I don't know if she's here today, but that's okay. But so I know that this is important in physics, but so when V is the canonical bundle. When V is the canonical bundle, then these correspond to T brains. So, you know, Fernando and Rafaele have done quite a bit of work on this, and others. Okay, so this is and then one last remark is that. Remark is that you can have a situation where the underlying bundle does not satisfy, right? I mean, sorry, when you put the full equation, maybe the underlying bundle doesn't satisfy the usual stability equations, but the whole pair satisfied it. So you can have solutions of the phi permission-Einstein equations. equations such that if you want i lambda g of fh is not this is not equal to a constant times the identity so this is telling us that the underlying bundle is not stable is not polystable okay and so you know you it's really kind of enriching You, it's really kind of enriching a little bit of your moduli space because obviously, anything that is polytheist satisfy the Hermitian-Einstein equations, you can just pick phi zero and it will give you a solution to the system. And then, you know, you're just basically enlarging the moduli space. Okay, so that's a little bit the uh um what I wanted to say so far. And I wanted to mention the Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence, which again tells you that you do have a correspondence between these solutions to the Phi-Hermitian-Einstein equations and also these stable pairs. I mean, I don't want to call them Yed-Hitchin pairs because the Hitchin pair I think usually is reserved if phi which phi is zero. Reserved if phi watch phi is zero, and you don't need it for the Kobayachi-Hitchin correspondence. That really comes up when you start looking at the deformation theory. But are there any questions so far? Okay, so I'll state it as a big theorem, even though it's been proved over the years in many cases, so Kobayashi Hitchin correspondence. Correspondence that a pair E phi admits a phi permission Einstein metric. I mean, remember in the equations, I unfortunately already erased them, but E phi, the pair, I mean, your holomorphic vector button on your Higgs field are already fixed, and you're looking. Bundle on your Higgs field are already fixed, and you're looking for a metric, right? Like a Hermitian metric on the bundle that satisfies the equations. Okay, so and then here it omits such a Hermitian metric if and only if the pair E phi is polystable. Okay, and you know, I don't want to forget any names. To forget any names, but you know, the original equations when phi is zero and you're just looking at Hermitian metrics on the vector band that satisfy Hermitian-Arsene equations, and then the correspondence with polystable bundles, you know, so phi is zero. You know, this was already in work of Narasimhamin Seciality on curves, and then this was generalized by, you know, little by little by Luke, Donaldson, and Ula Nekiao in the Killer case, and then also over. Also, over any compact complex manifold with a Caudichio metric by Yaoli. And Simpson, I think, is perhaps the first one who looked at the case where you're now augmenting it by the Higgs field. And, you know, so I'm not saying it appears in work, but then just very recently, I found the thesis of one of Yao's students from 89 that does the whole case for any vector bundle of E, and he even throws in vortex. And he even throws in vortex equations in there. So you actually have, you know, with, I had never seen that in the literature before, and it just happened over the past year. I found that thesis. So you actually have this very general equation that you have everything in there, the vortex equations and also the, you know, these generalized more generalized Hitchin equations. Okay, so, but I will just say that, you know, so if you're interested, then there's a theme. Then there's a thesis by Lin from 89 that does, and oh, but okay, to be fair, he does it for the Kayler case. Okay, in case the underlying, the metric little G is Kayler. And as I said, he even throws in the vortex equations in there. So he gets, he's considering a triple where you have E, the Hicks field, which is just some. Just some bundle map from E tensured by any vector bundle, and then he has his just some map from E to a new vector bundle, right? And then these are these satisfy these more general equations. And he, because he does a code by Ashi-Hitchin correspondence, there, the stability is a little bit, when you have the triple, you know, he tweaks a little bit of the definition of the stability. Okay, but having said that, this should still. But having said that, this should still hold even in the non-planar case. So I haven't seen a proof, but the proof. Oh, but actually, that's not true because I did remember that Adam Jacob did look at the case where V is the cotangent bundle. And he has some work on when you have a good shot metric, but that's the only thing I've seen so far. But the results should follow, right? So the proof should hold. Should hold even when G is not killer but is Bauduchin. Okay. All right. So so before I did I so I wanted So, I want to discuss a little bit also the deformation theory, but before I do that, I wanted to say that obviously, if we don't want to just be considering the standard Hermitian-Einstein equations and usual stable bundles, we want to make sure that we can have a non-zero fee. And this puts some constraints on the vector bundle that you're twisting by. And so, in particular, if this vector bundle is just a line bundle, then one can. bundle then one can can find some constraints some topological constraints um so here so what are some topological constraints constraints on having On having eye on zero. Of course, keeping in mind that I want a stable pair. Okay. So, okay, so I will assume that V is just a line bundle of X. Okay, then the first thing that we can say is that, and also the pair E phi is stable with phi not zero. Okay, so we actually have an honest hence pair. Okay, so the Pabo, yes? Oh, not zero. Thank you, thank you. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Okay, so the first thing that you can say is that then the degree of me has to be greater or equal to zero. Okay, so you can work it out that the degree has to be non-zero. And also, because I was saying that, you know, it's also interesting to consider the case where the communist. interesting to consider the case where the commutator phi with its adjoint is not zero, then in that case, well, if v is the canonical bundle of x twisted by an effective divisor, then and we also impose the condition that phi the commutator of phi with its adjoint is not zero, then this will force the Will force the degree of V to be strictly positive. Okay? All right, so this is something that Fernando Rafael and I worked at when we were, V was just the canonical bundle, but it's none. You can actually generalize the proof. It's okay. But you see that it is, and here I'm not able to, I think to go further just because of how we did the argument here. Did the argument here? I can only generalize it to D being an effective divisor, twisting by the effective divisor, but who knows? It may be a bit technical. All right, but you see that it's already giving you some conditions, because for example, if you're just interested in V being the canonical bundle, right? So you just have a natural generalization of Higgs bundles to higher dimensions. Well, I shouldn't say that. I mean, just really like the curve case where V is just the canonical bundle. Then you do have, it's putting some topological constraints. It's putting some topological constraints on your manifold because the canonical bundle has to be positive. Okay, so you know at least what we're to look for to look for solutions where the phi is non-zero. Okay, so this is one thing. And then you can, you know, obviously if V is not a line bundle, then you can, at least if you can write it as an extension of bundles, then you can start saying things about, well, because it's reducing the ranks of the bundles. And I mean, I'm not saying you can't. I mean, I'm not saying you can't find some topological constraints if you're interested in a higher-ranked bundle, but you know, you don't have such a clean statement in that case. Okay? All right. So, yes. Yeah, here it doesn't matter, right? Like, you really just need it. It's any line bundle. You come to the conclusion that the line bundle has to. Conclusion that the line bundle has to be greater, the duby has to be greater than Q0. So it doesn't matter. And it's exactly the same proof. You just, we were just focusing on Kx, but it's the argument is identical. Okay. All right. So, okay. So as I said, this really allows you to just look for examples. So for example, if you're interested in, so just, I think I started five minutes late. So, you know. So, you know, I don't want to go over, but I do, I would like to get to the deformation theory as well. But, you know, but just to kind of say, for example, if you're picking, let's even keep it simple so that X is a complex surface, compact, complex surface, and V is the canonical bundle. Then this is telling you that. And this is telling you that if I want phi stable and phi not zero, then it's forcing the degree of kx to be greater or equal to zero. So kx has to be either a general type surface or a finite cover of a k3, right? That's the only thing that you can have or. Or I'm going to cover other K3. And if you want the commutator to be non-zero, so you get a T grain, then it's really forcing the canonical divisor to have positive degree. So you're really looking at a, oh, sorry, X is general type. So at a surface of general type. A general type, and then you can, you know, look for yes. You can also have an Olympic search. Yes, yes, yes. Sorry, sir, sir. I forgot because that's what we did. We quick check examples where it was an elliptic surface, right? Thank you. So, or elliptic, properly elliptic. Okay, so I'll say properly elliptic. Okay, and then so here when it's causative or properly elected. Okay, and then you know when I worked on cooking up examples with Fernando and Atari, you know, we were in this case because, you know, they really wanted key brains. And then because general type is kind of scary to me, because I'm not a purely algebraic geometer, we just found some examples of properly linked. Just found some examples on proper related. But anyway, pick your favorite circus in the family and then you can generate some examples. Okay. Oh, and I should say that more recently, you know, I've been considering the case with Yuji Tanaka of what I think you would be calling a wild Wafawitin where you're twisting, it's this case, where you're twisting the canonical bundle by a divisor. I mean, this was motivated in last fall at MSR. In last fall at MSRI, Lara gave a talk in which she was saying that this was coming up in the physics, and you can come up with examples. But we were able to generate examples on ruled surfaces, okay, of things where, you know, these phi is not zero and also the commutator is not zero. Okay, but what am I doing? Better than I expected. That's good. Well, I hope. But I'm getting through my material. I don't know if that's a good or bad thing. Okay, any questions? Any more questions? Okay, so now I would like to get to the deformation theory. I think I can erase here. Okay, because again, I mean, here we were just interested in solutions to the In solutions to the five Hermitian-Einstein equations, right? We're not constructing a moduli space. Okay, and now how about the deformation theory? Okay, so for the deformation theory, here you really need to impose an extra condition on the Higgs field. So in this case, you really want to make sure that is always zero. And then recall that C is a bundle map from E to E tensured by some vector bundle V. And then here, when I'm seeing the And then, here, when I'm saying the wedge, I mean, you know, you can at least, you know, in the local chart, describe the phi using some matrix. And then, when I'm doing phi wedge phi, you just take the commutator of the matrices, and then you wedge whatever the elements in the v. Okay. All right. So, but, and then you need this, and the reason why, oh, okay, but the first, so the, and this provides an extra. So, and this provides an extra constraint when you're looking for solutions, because this is a highly non-trivial equation to solve, to find a solution to. So, that's really the hard part. But because I should say that if you just work over curves, this will always be true. So, you know, there's nothing to check in that case, right? So, oh, is that true? No, the rank is one. Am I saying something wrong? The rank of A is 12. When the rank of V is one, yeah, yeah, sorry. So, when the rank of V is one, then Is one, then phi wedge phi always holds. So there's nothing to check. And then it's, yeah, it was also in my notes. Good. Yes, yes. And then this is highly non-trivial. I mean, many people, in particular Steve, can attest to the fact how hard it is to solve this when the rank is higher. Okay, so highly non-trivial equation, non-trivial constraint. Non-trivial constraint. I mean, just because, you know, at the end of the day, if you want your non-zero fee, you just compute a cohomology group. I mean, that can be tricky, but you do that. And then checking this condition on top of it is what is usually the tricky part. So non-trivial condition when the rank of v is greater than one. Okay, and then I mean, I'm just, I mean, I don't know too. I mean, I don't know to what extent this is, you know, you should hold me to this, but usually in the literature, when you talk about a hitch and pair, you want this extra condition, right? So what is a hitch and pair? A hitch and pair is just a pair E phi as before, but with But with phi which phi is equal to zero. Okay. And this comes up in the deformation theory because this condition of phi wedge phi equal to zero allows you to, I mean, you know, here we have a holomorphic vector bundle E, so you already, and, you know, and oh, and I should say, so phi, you can think of it as being and living in the endomorphism bundle. I mean, this is. I mean, this is a section of the endomorphism bundle of E twisted by V. That's just a holomorphic vector bundle. So I can look at just the normal check complex associated to that, right? So that's one complex. But this is really basically keeping track of how you're deforming the underlying bundle V, essentially, right? So, and then if you want to understand what happens to the phi when you're doing the deformation theory, then you'd like to have something that involves the Then you'd like to have something that involves the phi. And having the condition phi, what phi, there's a natural complex that I will write, and then it allows you to get a complex, right? So let me just write it down. So we get a natural complex. So we get a natural Complex, which is the following. Okay, so you start with the endomorphisms and bundle jits of E, and then here you then take you wedge that with the phi. So again, you know, you take some, you take the tense, the commutator of the endomorphisms, and then Commutator of the endomorphisms and then wedge with the here it'll just be a tensor because you know there's nothing yet. Okay, and then this goes to endomorphism of e tensured by v and then you if you do this again so now I really have if I have a section of this it's actually Hicks field and then I take the wedge with phi itself and I will land in end E answered by wedge two of V and on and on. Two of V and on and on. Okay? And it is a natural complex because phi which V is zero. It is a complex, I should say, when Phi which Phi is zero. And I'm just afraid because of the size of the thing. Okay, maybe I'll try like this. I'll try like this. Then I can throw in, you know, my chains like this. And then I have the normal, you know, if I'm doing just checker homology, like this. Okay, on and on. And then on and on of this. Okay, but the point is that the rows are, these are complex, complex says because. Oops. Because phi, which phi is zero. Okay, but I still have this bicomplex, and then you can take the spectral, the hypercohomology associated to it. And I could write down the E2 term explicitly, but I won't. That's okay. But you just get the hyper. That's okay, but you just get the hyper complex. It's actually not a bad thing having less space. It forces you to focus. Okay, so you get, and then you take the associated hypercohomology and And well, what happens is that if you take the moduli space of stableized space of stable hitching pairs, then the tangent space at the end of the day. The tangent space at a pair will be modeled on the first hypercohomology group. And then the obstruction to smooth it will be the H2. And anyway, the normal theory just follows, right? Plus the obstruction to smoothness. To smoothness is in H2. So, in particular, if the H2 is zero, then your moduli space is smooth. Okay, and then, you know, I should, I'm trying not to forget any names, but here this was in original work. If you are, and I hope I'm sure I'm forgetting names, but let's say. Sure, I'm forgetting names, but let's say that when V is just the cotangent bundle, right? So when V is the cotangent bundle, this was developed by Mitsuram and also Biswas and Ramaman. And also Botachin did some work on this. And the reference that I've seen for the general case is due to Mantingo, but there may be other people. So I'm sorry if I. So general case. There's a nice paper by Mantingo. That treats that, but you know, I'm, but this paper, I mean, the other, well, maybe I'm forgetting Marina. Maybe I'm forgetting Marina. I think you also have because Mantingo cites all these people and also a paper of yours with Vizwas. But Mark, no, here I'm talking about the higher dimensional case. So Bota Ching did do a higher dimensional case. Yeah. Oh, but it's true. I shouldn't forget. Yeah. Okay. So Mark Minute. Let me not forget Mark Minute. It's true, absolutely. If we're over curve. Absolutely, if we're over curved, okay. Anyway, I mean, there's a there's a role established, yes. Yeah, I mean, you know, it gives you just a model for the hypercohomology. Sorry, it gives you a model for the tangent space. Yeah, that's coherent and works well. Yeah. Coherent and works well, yeah. I don't know. I mean, isn't it you look for something that would work and that works, so why not? Right. Yeah, you need, yeah, yeah. Well, yeah, yeah, exactly. And of the spy, and oh, so sorry, my motivation, I wasn't maybe not, I mean, I said it, but I was not clear enough. I mean, if you It but I was not clear enough. I mean, if you just take the vertical rows, you're just deforming each, but you want something where you're picking up a deformation of the phi. So you want a complex that starts involving the Higgs field because you want to also deform that. And then when you cook up this complex, you can actually show that it is a linearization of the deformation. So I'm not saying it's trivial. It's almost like by magic that it's this simple condition on the fee gives you what you need, if anything. Gives you what you need, if anything, right? Like it's a highly non-trivial for finding solution, but it's very simple to state and actually gives you a good deformation theory. So I think you should think of it that way. Okay? Okay. All right. So, you know, you can think of why would we want to throw in this extra condition on the Higgs field that phi watch phi is zero? Well, one motivation is for the deformation theory, but yes, yes. I was later before the round two case remember. And then that was important. Yes. So that was just like the m the most contrivial case I want to do that. Yeah. So yeah. It was an important field in that case. Yeah. It is very natural, right? I mean, here I'm stating it in general just because these things, these flavors of bundles have been popping up more and more, right? Where you're just not just thinking. Not just taking V to be the canonical bundle, you know, so and the theory works in general, okay. And I should say that, I mean, there may be other cases that I'm not aware of, so I would love to know that actually, so here I'm motivating the phi watch phi being zero, you know, because of the deformation theory, but actually, in some cases, where the ones that I'm aware of, I'm aware of. So, you know, if, for example, the V that you start with is the 10, the holomorphic tangent bundle of your X is a complex manifold, and this is your holomorphic tangent bundle. And we are considering, then in that case, the pairs E phi are called cohes bundles. And well, simply because, I mean, this is when V is the cotangent bundle. As I mentioned, Simpson, for example, started looking and buttacin in the higher dimensional case. And in this case, they were calling them Higgs bundles, but are Higgs bundles. Hence the cohigs, you know, when you're taking the You know, when you're taking the dual of the cotangent. Okay, and in that case, well, these first appeared in the context of generalized geometry that you can show that if you have a generalized holomorphic structure, what is a generalized homomorphism? So a generalized oops. Okay. Generalized. General. Parallelized complex structure on your manifold is an endomorphism, you would call it bull J of the tangent bundle, but not just the tangent bundle, the polymorphic tangent bundle plus the canonical bundle. Okay, so I don't want to go into the whole theory, but here, you know, you But here, you know, you are not just considering complex structures, which would be endomorphisms of the tangent bundle. You're augmenting the tangent bundle by the cotangent bundle. And you have a natural notion of a holomorphic, a generalized holomorphic vector bundle, which is basically a vector bundle together with some partial connection that squares to zero, that's integrable. And it just so happens that this This connection that you're putting that gives you your generalized holomorphic bundle essentially just looks like you can break it up, right? Because you're really looking instead of the tangent bundle we're working or the cotangent bundle, we're working with the augmented bundle. And your connection that you're considering that context really you can split it up as the holomorphic structure on E plus the Higgs field. Oops, not a direct sound. Excellent. And so, and such that d squared is zero, right? This is a generalized holomorphic structure on your complex vector bundle E. And, you know, very quickly, I mean, this is just the sum of these two. So, this condition forces the phi wedge phi to be zero. Zero. Okay. So, you know, this was first defined by Marco Gualtheri, but Steve's thesis is on these bundles. Okay. And he's done quite a lot of more work after. And then I also have a grad student who did some work considering these cases. And well, also now, Eric, I think maybe we'll tell you a little bit about it in some cases about the schools that. These people say click is bang with those, but anyway, so so it, but the point is that you already have this condition appearing naturally, and it has nothing to do with the deformation theory, there's already part of what it means to have a generalized holomorphic structure on your vector bundle. And then there's another case where it pops up, which is also very interesting. And it's that if you start with a holomorphic vector bundle of rank two. Of rank two. Okay, so if the rank of E is two, then you can show that this Higgs field induces a holomorphic Poisson structure on the projectedization of E, which is now, this is going to be a P1 bundle. This is going to be a p1 bundle on x, but it is going to be so you know for your puissile structure, you need a bivector, but you need that integrability. You need the is it the shooting, shooten or skelton? Shooten? I will storing the shooten bracket of the puzzle bivector with itself to be zero, and that's equivalent to phi which phi being zero, right? So maybe I should. Being zero, right? So maybe I should say, so this induces a holomorphic, also a section sigma of H0 here, X wedge two of the holomorphic tangent bundle of Pe. Okay, so a holomorphic bivector. And you can check that sigma, the Schoenberg. Sigma the Schudenberg sigma with itself is zero if and only if p is zero okay and you need the condition that the Schuden bracket of sigma with itself you need this means that sigma is a holomorphic Poisson structure on the projectivization of E. Okay, so this was first noticed Okay, so this was first noticed by Polishczik, and then one of Marco's students has generalized this to higher rank. So, in higher rank, you need phi wesch TV. You know, any Higgs field induces a bivector. That's not a problem. And then if you want this integrability, if you have a higher rank, you will need few H2 to zero and you need some extra conditions on the Higgs field, which Nicola, his student, defined as strong. Student defined as strong integrity. But you see that aside from the deformation theory, you already start having this natural condition that pops up. Okay? All right. So I have, I guess, nine minutes left. And I just have one more page, which, you know, could I could spend a lot of time on or less time on, but this is more like what are some of the known things, right? So just about the So, just about the problem, the moduli, and whatnot, and some of the open problems. And we can talk about some of the open questions this afternoon. Is there a problem session this afternoon, right? Okay, but are there any questions? Okay, so, you know, so some results. I mean, I've already given you some results about the general theory, so, some concrete results. Okay, so when you know, when you're over curved and the rank The rank of V is one, then you just have these generalized. It's terrible that we're always using generalized left and right, but I think that's what they were calling them, right? Where you're twisting by just any line bundle, your Higgs, or your Higgs. So generalized Higgs bundles. And there's lots of work by many of you here. Here, and many of the people that I've already mentioned. Okay, and another interesting example is when the dimension of the complex dimension of x is 2 and v is the canonical bundle. And in that case, you get solutions to the Wapa-Witten equations. Okay, so then the polystate. The polystable, I should say. The polystable pairs E phi. And I should say here, we're still in the case where phi wedge phi, this is not an issue, right? Phi wedge phi always holds. So, you know, when you're looking at these things, you're just looking for non-zero sections of NE tensored by V. And e tensured by v, and you know, you work it out. Um, and then the polystable pair, so if you can find a non-zero p, and then this pair is polystable, then these are solutions to the Vapa-Witten equations. And I think Rafael can probably tell us, I'm sorry, uh, Fernando can tell us you more about. Fernando can tell us you more about the physics side of these equations more than me, but okay, so they're interesting because of this. And I should also say from a complex geometric point of view, so this is interesting because of the physics. And also from mathematically, why is this case interesting? Because if you're on a surface and you're trying to understand, you're just looking at the moduli space of stable bundles, right? Like not the Right, like not the cohits, there's no fee in there. Okay, so suppose that here I just have this is stable bundles on X. Okay, then in this case, what is, so you get a similar theory, but you're just looking at in this case, the tangent space at a vector bundle E, stable bundle E. Stable bundle E is really modeled on just H1 of and E. Well, the traceless ones. Okay, so here I mean traceless. Okay. And if you're looking at whether or not your bundles are, if the moduli space is smooth, if the H2 is zero, then it's going to be smooth. Okay? Plus, if H2 of N0E is zero, Of n0 e 0, then the moduli space is smooth at e. But because we're on a surface, the h two is the H two and zero E is isomorphic to. isomorphic to the dual of bicell duality to H0N0E tensored by the canonical bundle okay so you know essentially having a smooth moduli space means that you don't have I mean if if you never have non-zero Higgs fields right Fields, right? Am I saying it the right way? If you cannot have non-trivial Higgs fields, then your moduli space is smooth, right? So it's kind of tied into the whole discussion. If you're really just even looking at kind of the deformation theory of the underlying, just the moduli space of the bundles, the hit fields pop out, right? So if there do not exist P non-zero, Non-zero, then this moduli space is smooth and easy. Okay, so you know, even from a mathematical point of view, the non-juris to the physics, the case where V is the canonical bundle is an interesting one. Okay, yes. It's not just that they're non-zero, they'll sometimes not be able to put the identity. Well, but I have to. Oh, but I took the traceless ones. But thank you. Good point. Okay. All right. And then maybe because I have three minutes left, I'll just say that, so I'll end with this case. I mean, obviously, the, well, or maybe I'll just say it. Okay. So as for Higgs bundles over curves, it's interesting to, there's a natural C-star action. To there's a natural C-star action on the Higgs fields, and you can look at the C-star locus. And this has been studied to define what are called Vatawiten invariants of the circuses. So, for example, Richard Thomas and Yuji Tanaka looked at that and they looked at examples on general type surfaces simply because of that condition that I was saying. I mean, you want some non-trivial fees. Some non-trivial fees, so it was forcing the degree to be. I mean, they actually were getting nil-potent things, so it was forcing the degree of the surface to be greater or equal to zero, and they were looking at drunk. And then some of you probably saw the talk last fall at MSRI that Martin Koohl and Jiang were looking at twisted. They were looking at twisted sheets. So the sea star locus of these Bakawitten bundles. Bundles and you know, and again, to quite a and they were looking at the case of K3 surfaces, right? And then, um, and here the motivation is to just define new invariants on these complex surfaces. So that's one thing that has been done. And as I mentioned, some interesting directions would be to replace the V by any line bundle, in particular, the canonical bundle. Particular, the canonical bundle twisted by some effective divisor. So, this would be, I guess, what Lara was calling the wild Waca-Witten equations or bundles. And then another thing that would be interesting would be to look at the spectral picture of this, right? Because obviously, as for a Higgs bundle over curves, you can define the characteristic. The characteristic polynomial of the Higgs field, and then you have, in this case, you're going to get a spectral surface or a spectral cover if you want. But now the, and then you will have a Hitchin map. I mean, all these things follow through, but the difficulty is just that now your spectral covers will no longer just be a curve, right? And it's not just a question of looking at the branch points and finding what the genus is and on and on. I mean, you're really looking at now understanding finite covers of your. Understanding finite covers of your underlying manifold, which you know was uh but it's still a very interesting question, right? So, but anyway, I think I will stop with this and yeah, and maybe we can discuss more this afternoon. Thank you. Thank you for a really nice talk. Um, are there any questions from the public? Yes, Camilla. Yes, Camilla. Are there any special results on mass resources? I don't know. I mean, I'll look, but I don't know. Well, I mean, I could yes, yeah, what am I talking about? Yes. No, because with Yugi, we've been looking at a rural surface. And yeah. Surface. And yeah. And even there, unlike the K3, we're even finding that you don't even have zero virtual dimension. So, sorry, my brain just, so, and it's very explicit. I mean, the reason I started with a ruled surface is that I really understand bundles. I mean, that's the thing. You really need to, first of all, understand the underlying bundles. Oh, and I should say you can generalize this picture to sheaves, but you know, let's start with vector bundles. And then on a ruled surface, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. I have a question. Yeah. Really love to talk. It's great. Maybe just first building on what Kim said, but different Vs work better with different types of surfaces. Like Cohig's is better at the Pano end. Exactly. Because, for example, Steve even showed even more because I was giving some conditions when, oh, I'm sorry. I knew I would forget some things and I did yesterday. But you know, when I was giving some topological conditions. I was giving some topological conditions when it was a vector bundle, it was just a line bundle. Well, actually, Steve has more in the case where V is the tangent bundle, where he basically proves, I mean, using some differential geometric techniques, I think that's probably fair to say, that in that case, it has to be just general tape, right? Essentially. Oh, no, wait a second. For V equals C, the opposite. No, no, the opposite. It is opposite. It has to be. It has to be Fano. It has to be Fano. Has to be final, it has to be final, exactly. So, so sorry about that. So, absolutely, sorry, I forgot. So, there's a lot of these kinds of interrelated results, exactly. But, but I really meant to, I'm sorry, Steve. So, because you know, but I did say, you know, like when you have a higher rank bundle, you have special cases, but I forgot to include it. I apologize. That Steve, when V is the tangent bundle. And your proof, it's for any dimension, right? Like it is, no, it's on your surface. It is no, it's on the surface. It's on the surface. It's on the surface. There's a flame ribbit that should work. It should work. But let's just say that in his thesis and subsequent paper, X is a surface. And if the V is T, then he shows that the non-zero. And of course, we're always putting ourselves in the case where it's stable, because we do want some solutions to those equations. Then it forces. Then it forces X has to be funnel. Okay, X is final. And but here for Bacha Witten, if you just take V to be the canonical bundle, then unfortunately you're in the opposite direction. Then if you just want the canonical bundle, this is what, you know, with Fernando and Rafael, then here you really need the degree to be positive. So as I Positive. So, as I mentioned, you have a general type properlyptic in K3. But if you allow yourself to twist by an effect of a divisor, then you can get funnel. I mean, you can get, for example, root surfaces. It's okay, right? You can cover nice examples, yeah. And I think you can do more. It's just that I've made myself easier because you have a, you know, so you have a P1 vibration, so you can actually. Have a P1 vibration, so you can actually do things. Yeah, but I think that actually last comment connects with my actual questions because you mentioned that Laura Anderson considers the case with wild Waffa Witten. So are there conditions on the polls? Like they have to be higher order polls in D or any divisor? To be honest, I was hoping to ask her exactly, like more detail about what she's interested in that, right? She's interested in that, right? Because it was, she gave a virtual talk on MSRI. And then I think the past few months, you know, maybe in this summer at some point, I will ask her more details about what she had in mind exactly. I know that she was interested in examples where it would also be over a rural surface or maybe, you know, so I think it's in the right direction, the examples, but I imagine, but because you also had work, you did the wild case, but over curved with her, right? And then you're adding some poles, right? So I imagine. Right, so I imagine it's I imagine it's something like that, but I mean, you know, it will also be interesting. Does it make sense for any vector bundle, any line bundle? I don't know. I mean, from a physics point of view, I don't know if it makes sense for any line bundle, but. So at least it's the right question. Okay, great. Exactly. That's one of the questions. And maybe Fernando can tell us if that would be interesting, you know, or also what some of the homology groups represent. Because I know, anyway, maybe for this afternoon, I have a lot of questions for you. Can I ask just one quick follow-up since we're talking about the divisor? Have people studied instead of these kinds of deformations, I want to look at the model space of Higgs bundles over the model space of vector bundles? So now start to deform V. So you picked up a few Vs for us. So these V's are interesting. First question is, are there other V's that are interesting? Or could we see some kind of wall jumping or some kind of behavior where we have a different So, kind of behavior where we have a different type of fabric now. My habits over, but that's very interesting. And I think you already have all the ingredients, you just have to seem so. Yes, you start looking at this kind of because if anything, I'm not saying it's exactly that what will work, but it was quite defined, Lin's thesis, because, like I said, he even, you just throw in more data, right? And then a lot of the theory works, right? Where I was saying, he even throws in the vortex, right? The vortices, like they're thrown in. Like they're thrown in. So, so something definitely to think about because I think that's a very natural question. Yeah, thank you. So, so real, real simple. So, you say the result is when you structure the Higgs field, you have a smooth model space, right? Is that the result or the aggregate right? Yes. When phi is zero, we have a smooth model space. You can have, yeah, of course. You have it, yeah. Yeah, of course. You have, yeah, because I think this you can even break up the inside the moduli spaces of Waffa-Witten solutions. Oh, and I forgot one thing. When V is the cotangent bundle, it's even tied to Kapistin-Witten equations. So a lot of some of your favorite equations are related to some kind of twist by a V. Okay, but for Waffa-Witten, then, but, and inside all these moduli spaces, you have the moduli space just of stable bundles, right? Where the phi would be zero. Yeah, absolutely. zero yeah absolutely and then you and you have but then this is a little bit bigger because you're enlarging because you could have a non-stable e that has creates a stable pair yeah uh so you have a non-trivial phi yes or no sorry in this in this case oh no in the smooth case you can have a non-trivial phi absolutely yeah where even the underlying bundle is not stable but the pair is stable right so it's in the bigger the bigger moduli space is smooth right but if you were just Is smooth, right? But if you were just to restrict yourself to the subset of just the stable one, no, no, just of the vector bundles, then that may not be a stable. Okay. Yeah. Does that make sense? Or I feel like I'm not answering your question. No, it's just a big confusion. I thought that is when you abstract the existence of the Higgs bundle, sorry, a Higgs field that you have a state, a smoothly modelized space, but maybe I got it the opposite way. What did you say when the statement that you erased there was what when Statement that you erased there was what when phi was zero or phi non-zero that you have a smooth mobile space? The final statement that you then? Oh, oh no, this is just yeah, yeah, sorry. What I was saying is that if you never, if you're if you're at a bundle E where phi can must always be zero, then you know that the moduli space of just the stable bundles has to be smooth at that point. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Now I understand. And it's smooth, you mean that you will not have branches or things like that? No? Yeah, exactly. Like it's just a smooth manifold. Yeah. Okay. So if anything, all I was trying to say is that if you just start with the moduli space of stable bundles, right, they're not augmented by the Higgs field, then the only way that you could potentially have a singularity is if you have the existence of a non-zero Higgs field. Okay. That's maybe one way of saying it. So this makes sense to me? Yeah, yeah. So this makes sense to me. Because I think there's a physics interpretation because these buffer-wheeled constructions in the cases that we look at, they come up with a physics interpretation in terms of a superpotential that is this holomorphic section that you need to take differentials to get the solutions, which are the model space. And so whenever this condition is met, H2N0 of E equals to zero. zero of E equals to zero, then the superpotential is trivial. And when the superpotential is trivial, it has no cubic couplings, then things are smooth. When it has cubic couplings, you will have branches. And then at that point, you will have a singularity. So it matches with the physics. So I would wonder if in the other cases that you were mentioning where the twisting was by another bundle, one could have similar interpretations. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And I'll just, I mean, I don't know if I should say it now or save it for. know if i should say it now or save it for the um save it okay i'll save it okay time to time to uh take oh is there anything but we need questions later on oh yeah that's true that's true so you need to make new ones too yeah but that's not as important as everyone needs to make questions for thank you very much thank you thank you
