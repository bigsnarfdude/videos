Today, I would like to talk something about the curves in advanced space, especially in two-dimensional advanced space and three-dimensional advanced space. This work or not? No, uh oh yes, yes, no. Oh, yes, yes. So, maybe I want to talk first. I will give some notation and also notice. Then, secondly, I will give the definition for the curves in advanced space. Then, after that, we will give some examples and characters for the curves using. For the curves using by using by showing the deep equation, then we also consider some relations between the curves. So here, I will some notions for the curve, especially for the spectral curves in this phase and also in introductory space. So now, So now we consider the curves in obesity space with the Atlantic parameter S and using R S, beta S, gamma S denote the target frame fields along this curve. That means R is the tanita vector field, beta is the principal normal vector field, and gamma the binomal vector field of this curve. Of this curve. So here is the friendly formula for the curve. The function gamma is the calculation and how i is the torsion function for the curve. If we consider the sweater curve, then we can assume that the That the curve, the center of the curve, is the original. And also, we can assume that the radius of the square is equal to 1. Then pledge of x equals this one and pledge y. Let y equal to this one. Then fs x and y x for the autonomous basis on this curve. Then we call fs x x x y x the spherical frame the spherical frame frames of spherical curves in occupancy space. And here is the spherical friendly formula for the spherical curves, PS stabilization for disk, function, and also for comma X and the top X. You'll hit the definition of the expand curve. We consider the curve. It is regular. If the position vector field of this curve only lines in its redfined line, then this curves is called redifferent curve. You know, here the collaboration is the same. Here is the correctness of the experiment code. That means the vector phase and the total culture function and total function survived this equation. The position vector field can be valid in this way. And here, x0 is the swing curve with aground parameter t. Now we consider another curse in incursive space. Let X appear. Let X be regarded as space-like curves in a two-dimensional life cycle curve. We use this one, denotes the life cycle curve, of the negligence space with a run parameter x. Then we put in y x equal to this equation. We also We also use rx equal to this one, then this frame forms the sympathetic autonomous frames around this curve in the couch space. And the conflict formula can be read in this way. And this function we call the con causure function. Kung caused a function of this curve. And here we use the same notations to denote the slender culture function and also the chrome culture function. So we need the following lemma of the solutions for the second of the linear different equation. Let this function be any non-saval impossible solution of this equation. Then put a true base equation, then this function is also the notable solutions of this equation. And I have one and I have two. And F1 and F2 are the complementary of systems of solutions of this equation. So that means the solutions of this question set can be ready this way. So in this part, I will give some theories of the central bank curves in advanced densities. So now we consider curves X be a curves in mercenses in a fine space in advanced space advanced space with absolute parameter P and also I is a real interval and this symbol the standard determinant times in this advanced case. In this advanced case, then without the loss of generalities, we may assume that the zero is lies in this interval. Then, for parameter transformation of this one, by a director calculation, we know this equation, this equation, this equation. And also, we can calculate it this relations this relations the left side is for parameter sigma and right side is for parameter T that means this quality this in this quality this and invariant so here So here, we always assume that the curve is centrally real. That means this condition is satisfied. And also, this condition is satisfied. Then, from this relations, we can give the following divination. Here is the central band algalized parameter. Here is the definition of the central band algalized parameter. We consider the curve X be a curves immersed in plus one space with parameter X. If this condition is satisfied, then  And with this condition, then we can put for the convenience, we can put this one and also this one, then we have this equation. Here, cop i is equal to this one. Then the cup i we call the cup i the The I central band culture function of this curve. Now, here's a remark for the approval of this panther. Here is also another map here. If this condition is satisfied, then this parameter is also an equi-band acclient parameter because this related. So now we give some examples for the central band curves in a plane two-space. So in this case, So, in this case, for the curve in a fun full space, then culture, central bound culture function can be written in this way. And this equation, this equation becomes this one, becomes this one. Then, by solving this equation, we can get some examples here. Yeah, here first one is the copper bond is equal to constants. Then so through this equation, then we can get this curve and second is this curve. And the third is this one. And if we consider kappa one is to minus s, then social distancing, then we can get this equation. Then we can get this curve and also this curve. If kappa one is equal to plus s, then so this equation then we can get this curve and also this curve. You can see the stage of the pool. So now we see some accretors of the We give some characters of the for some special central one curve. So the central one atlant parameter of a curve is also the obligation atlance parameter. If and only if the obliging function cut of this curve satisfies this equation. And this equation can be also And this equation can be also written in this way. Then, for this equation, the first solution is this one. Then, second, the solutions of this equation can be written in this way. And here it is. So now we consider some special curves in three-dimensional appliances. So, for the curves in three-dimensional fine space with the central advanced parameter IS, then formula 14, this one can't rewrite it in this way. Here is for the Kappa 1, here is for Kappa 2. And then we consider the central band curves under this condition. If Kappa 1 and Kappa 2 satisfy this relations, this relations, then we can get this equation. Then this equation can be easily sourced according to the solutions of the cubic equation this equation. Then we can get this conclusion. So the central one curves with this condition can be written as one or open part of the following curves. This one, second, and a third, and fourth. And also, we can get the color the central band curves S with a constant central band curves here, copper one, and constant central band torsion, copper two. Central and total cover two can be written as fine of the curve given by this theorem. This one so the conclusion is the same so in the following we discuss some special central ancilles in a band three. Band three means of band space. If first the central band capture function satisfy this condition, this condition, then we can consider the following cases. A copper band is equal to each genome S in this case a disease. Can't be written in this way. Then the solutions of this equation can be read in this way. And here, this is the salad function. And this function is the Bayesian function of the first hand, and this one is the Bayesian function of the second hand. The solutions of this equation is this farm. And they cleared the principles, and you and we are afforded no solutions of this question and also with this condition. Then we can get these conclusions. Well, let this curse be a good curve with the central abandon x and curve function in this way. A band to this phase, then the curve can be very In the following here. Case 4. Carbo-by used to minus 0 ice. So, in this case, this equation can be written in this way. And also, the solutions of this equation is this one. Then we can get the following conclusions. Let this be a regular curves with the central advanced function S and curve the function comma one and comma three to this one then the this girl can be written as the polar oil. And here is the remark. The central band Atlantic parameter of the curve given in this theory, theorem 10 and theorem 11 is also equivalent atlant parameter. So now we consider the curves in obedience to space. Let X be a regular curves with the central class panel X in the abundance space. We consider also the three dimensions advanced space as the operating space with the start inner product. With the start inner product. So, in this case, if the central one Atlantic parameter is also the alternative Atlantic parameter, then we have these relations. Then, a biodirect calculation is the concrete. The central acclaim parameter is also the obvious acclaim parameter if and only through this vision satimat. This equation starts. This equation can be also written in this way. That means the counter function and the Taussen function satisfy this equation, then we can find some solutions of this presentation. So now give some examples for the curve such by this present or this present example. Let xx be the Let x be a regular curve with the updated advanced parameter s and the counter function cup s equals to this one, the torsion function top s equals this one. Then from this reference, we know that the curve is the rectifier curve. It is easy to check that copper ice and top ice are the solutions of these phases. Solutions of this phases, this question. As a close of this way, using standard formulas of biodirect calculations, we have this question. On the other hand, from this basic, we have, we can. Now we can get this one and this one here. This is the center band curve of the center band carved curve. Then this question, this equation 13 can be written in this way. Therefore, assumption calculations. Therefore, assume transcriptions of the rectangle and code. X can be written in this way. And here is a condition. Then we have also this reasons. In this case, the tangent vector field up of the curve and the tangent vector field of Of the swelter curve are satisfied by this razor. The swagger curve are satisfied this equation here is example two. We now consider a spherical curves in a tidal space with the obedient atlantic parameter S and the svert curve curves function curve T S. In this case, we have these laces, and that means this latest. Releases. Then we can calculate the base release. By direct calculation, we know this cut function, which this torso function starts with also this rhythm. Also, this question. The curve is a swender curve which the Curve with the spherical counter function is far. And from this equation, here, this equation, we can calculate the central bank curve function in this way, in this way. Then this equation, this equation for the centrifugal so this equation can be written in this way. And now we consider another example: the curves in later code. The curves in the later core of the cushion 3 space. Let X be a regular curve with a central account parameter S in the abandoned space. We consider advanced phase also as a recursive space with the standard recursive in the product. Then if X is also a conclusive X is also a conclusion in this phase, then from this equation. This equation, we have this phasor, where Ms is the acclaim parameter of concoction in the current response. The central acclaim parameter The central abandon parameter is also the abandoned advanced parameter of Kronkov if and only if this condition is satisfied. Crown curve function, then concur function is equal to this one, as is the also equivalent and central advanced functor in this case. So for this case, kappa G is equal to even S from the strong equation of concoct, then we have this equation. This equation. But the central band cover, the central band cover coverban is. Cover bar is equal to this bar, and the central band torsion is equal to zero. Then, so this equation we can get the x can be written in this way here c one, c two. C1, C2, C2, C3 is belong to a fine space, and X can be written in this way. Here, U and V are the solutions of this equation. So that means I can write it in this way. Write in this way and also calibrate in this way. Also, this is a selling function, and this one is also this one as a special function. Then we can get the following conclusions that Conclusions. Let X be a regular curve with the central acclaim band S, central band counter function this one, and torsion function this one in the advanced space. Then the curve is a concove in the enclosed space with a ground parameter x and can be written in this way. And here, you and we The way we write in this way is the special case. When kappa T is proved this one, then we have this relations. That means this satisfied. Then from this equation, this equation for the central line current function on the Central line, Cauchy function, and the tossing function. Then this full function can be written in this way. Therefore, from this equation, this equation, we have this equation. This one, this one are the constants. Constant, then this equation can be easily solved. Then XS can be written this way for under this condition and also can be written this way and this condition and can be written this way and this condition. And the code, this code, this one, this code, this one, and also this code, this one. Commit in this way. Here, this one, and also this one. Then we get the base conclusions. Create a special case for the theoretical necessity. So, in this case, we can also consider the following. So, the central band Acclan parameter of curves in a band two space is also the Minkus-Acclan parameter. If and only if the Minkus curved function cap of viscos are saturated distributors. Satisfy this equation. So, this equation can be also solved. Here, for the space lag and the time lag, this equation is the same. Also, for three-dimensional advanced space, the central advanced parameter of the curves in a band three space is also Three space is also the mimus acclaimed parameter if and only if the mimicity capture function and total function are satisfied this equation. This equation is for the first kind of space cycle and this one is for the second kind of space like curve. And this one is for the knockout or switch like or tanner curve. So in this case, we can also find some special curves in this case. The main chart of the day is comes from this. Of the days come from these two works. This is published in 2014 and here's a preference. Then continue, we can also consider these cases and also we can also consider the curves in Switzerland and also curves on the surface. Surface and also with this is between curve and the surface with the thin metal. And here some difference. This one, not this one. Oh, I would like to stop here. Thank you very much.
