Thank you very much. So I'm David and I'm actually I just want to share this slide. So I came from the University of Grecia, it's a small university in the north of Italy. Actually draw. Of Italy. Actually, you should draw a line between Milano and Venice, which is almost in the middle. And these are all the collaborators that help me in doing the work I'm sharing today. So actually, the structure of this presentation is the following. At the beginning, I will spend some time in motivating the second part. So, at the beginning, I tried to motivate that actually looking at channel flow as a model for product media is not too bad if we want to just. Too bad if we want just are satisfied with a sort of first order analysis, and then I will draw some conclusions. So, to start, as we all know, modeling full-podus media is very complicated, and the main issue is that there's a lot of landscape actually spans, so a lot of magnitude. And the main thing that we are looking at is the upscaling, so the idea of trying to. So the idea of trying to start from the physics, the technetics of the port scale, where actually Lager-Tok's equation and transport equation are valid and try to transfer the information across scale at least to the continuum scale like Darcy's scale. These type of approaches can be done in several ways. For example, there are historically the first sort of heuristic way, like the capillary band already or very, very empirical models that can lead to gases law. Orders that can lead to the ACLO. You can also use the formula of scaling like modernization, volume averaging. That's a lot of bitter shots and a lot of words around that. Or also, like Professor Anser was telling before, nowadays there is this sort of revival of thermodynamically inspired model. There are several ways to do it. One is the information-based model that Alex was showing before. There is this model from the Graham-Miller group, but also there is another set. But also there is another pseudo-moneto and thermodynamics for the group in Europe, what's in the classroom below and final in Australia. Just to give an idea, I just want to briefly review the first two. So as we know, the capillary bundle is a very old model, but in some scenarios it may work. Here I just picked up a nice picture from this paper that we're studying fluent transport inside the human brain. And if you start to zoom in inside the tissue, actually. Start to zoom in inside the tissue, actually, at the end, you end up with blood vessels. And at the end of the day, a blood vessel can actually be modelled as a single capillary tube. And if you combine the classical friction factor formulas, you may have an estimate at least the scale of the classical dash is low. An alternative is to use formal scaling. And to show that, I just want to share a work that we did a few years ago. So the idea was to try to To apply the formal upscaling, so the homogenization, the flow, the two-phase flow in polar media. So, the starting point were this fancy experiment done by the group of Armstrong and other others, where they basically were doing experiment in this phase simulation inside the core rock. And what they see is that, depending on the capillary number, two phases can actually flow inside. Phases can actually flow in separate paths if the capillary number is low, or if the capillary number starts to be pretty high, then the non-verting phase starts being mobilized in the form of ganglia. Or interestingly, if you go to super high capillary number, you start seeing the formation of these tubes of a non-vective phase. And this is what they call these connective parts. The starting point was: let's try to use the homogenization to upscale this problem. So, I'm not going. This problem. So, I'm not going into the mathematical details at all. So, the idea is simple. So, you just apply the machinery of thermogenization to this problem. So, you start using the classical assumption. So, this is the existence of two length scales, so one of the continuum and one of the force scale. And then this lets you introduce a scale parameter epsilon. Then you expand all the variables of your problem as a power series, you go the mass, collect the order, check for the solvability. Like the order, check for the solvability. At the end of the day, you came up with a sort of Darcy's law as Darcy's law for the phase flow, you have continued description. The optimization, all the technical details of our work, I'm glad to share, discuss in the next days, but I'm not reporting here, just to give an idea. So you can start from the governing equation for two fluids at the core scale, so continuity nanostokes, plasma boundary condition, then the problem is controlled by. The problem is controlled by a series of dimensionless numbers, so Reynolds root, discolority ratio, capillary number, and LST ratio. And then, if you expand on the variable, collect the order, what you get at the end is a classical, let's say, Darcy's law for phrase plus the equation for the circulation. Why I'm sharing this example, because actually the modernization has some pro and some contro. The pro is that the machinery is made. The problem is that the machinery is very, very rigorous, so once you state the hypothesis, then everything follows directly. And also, it lets you to understand and to classify the limitation of the model. Actually, you came up with the upstate equation only if you are within this colored region. So, you have actually theoretical bounds in terms of Reynolds number, the curvature of the system, capillary number, and so on. So, only if you are within this region, you can So only if you are within this region, you cannot state the problem using the homogenization and the theory points. Otherwise, the theory is just saying that the scales are coupled and you cannot use the homogenization anymore. So these to me are very positive aspects. And every negative aspect is that determining this effective parameter, like the relative permeability, the average curvature, and so on, is very complicated. Because at the end, you should solve the closure problem that came out for the homogeneous. That came out from the homogenization of the report in theory equation. And the closure problem case is quite simple if the geometry is simple, but it becomes quite complex if the geometry or the topology of the phase is quite complex, like in this case. So how we try to skip these difficulties, so the idea was to use a sort of analogy between a real porous medium and a capillary bundle. So we took the structure of the equation of the homogenization. Of the equation of long-term organization, and we just solved them for a very simplified geometry. So, the idea is to reduce the complexity of the system in terms of geometry, and we sort of work in finding the analogy between flow in the real porous medium from the capillary tube. For example, when the capillary number is small and the phases are, let's say, don't see each other, we were modeling the system as a capillary bundle. Instead, where the viscous spectrum are important, then you all know this. Important that you always see a field around the convecting phase, so we're just modeling it as a correlar flow in a pipe. Given that, actually, you can derive these analytical formulas for the relative permeability, which then we try to compare with experiments. So, these are all experiments taken from the literature. The model is simple because then we are using this tabular bundle analogy, but at least we are able to capture the We are able to capture the scaling of the problem. These are cases where the disconstitution is very small. I remember this is the case of gas and liquid flows. But also, if you go to liquid-liquid case where the disconstant ratio is of order one, actually the model is able to capture quite well also experiments in the literature. So actually at the end, the takeover message of this is that, I just want to share this funny picture, is that at the end of the day, if we are satisfied, we sort of We are satisfied with sort of first order estimation, we can just use the spherical chicken, the spherical chicken as such. This is a note published in Science a long time ago. And actually, there was this problem that the farmer was not able to understand and to quantify what is the productivity of his chicken in the farm. But at the end, one way to solve. In the format at the end, one way to solve it was: let's assume that the chicana is spherical. In this way, we can at least proceed in doing the calculation. And so, the same idea was: let's say, okay, we are just simplifying the porous medium to the capillary bundles. This is the main motivation for our work. We just, let's say, as we go back this slide, capture the main scaling and all these relationship things for first principle, but we cannot. Things on first principle, but we cannot predict the single data, but at least we have at least the scaling relationship. And coming to us, the second part of the presentation is assume that looking at standard flows is not too bad if you want to know something about Paulus Medium. So the topic of this will be: why don't we look at a very simple problem in fluid mechanics, which is flow in erect angular duct with an arbitrary aspect. With a duct with an arbitrary aspect ratio. So, this is just a duct subject to the pressure gradient, and this is an arbitrary aspect ratio. It means that the duct has a height dig h and a width big w. So, you can define the aspect ratio as the ratio between the two. So, in the limit of the aspect ratio going to zero, it's the classical two-frame limit of the relational cell, while in the other case, we go to the limit of the square channel. So, the idea was: let's try to see what happens if the fluid is non-Newtonian. Fluid is not Newtonian. Unfortunately, we cannot derive analytical solution for flow in a rectangular duct with an arbitrary aspect ratio if the fluid is non-Newtonian. And specifically, we are looking at a class of fluids that can be described by this type of analogical model, like the Carol viscosity model. So, the idea is to see what happens to average quantities, like, for example, pressure gradient or friction factor, when the viscosity has this. When the viscosity has this type of gain. So, when the shear rate is low, actually, it approaches the classical zero shear rate behavior, while the shear-thinning effect is evident only when the shear rate is sufficiently high. So, the idea, the basic idea is to see, okay, let's see how parameters, like the friction factor actually changes if we change the rheology or if we change the aspect ratio. Can we sort of find a unified version? A unified version of this average parameter. The idea of how we can proceed, if we look at laminar conditions, that is data fully developed. This is the momentum equation. The equation is non-linear. It is subjected to the flow rate constraint. These equations are written in terms of dimensionless variable, where epsilon the n is the aspect ratio. And then they discover that it is a linear function of the shear. The discursive is a linear function of the shear rate described by the Carole discolority model. If we look at the problem, there are a series of initial numbers, which are the aspect ratio of the channel, the Caro number inside the viscosity, and which is just the ratio between the infinite 008, and again, at the top of the point. So we have only this set of dimensionless numbers. What we can do, we can solve this equation numerically, how we did here. Here, I'll just go very briefly. You can easily discretize the problem and solve the momentum equation using the plastic computer method. But to do it, what we decided to do was to couple it with an outer iteration loop, because the idea was to fix the pressure gradient. So, actually, we solve with the Newton method the momentum equation, and then in an outer iteration loop, we find the right dpd, dpdz, which satisfy the florid condition. This is very, very basic. So this is very very basic um idea. And if you want information, these are the discretized equations. But now I want to prefer to concentrate is on the on the result that we can extract from this problem. The starting point was to say, okay, if we focus only on the two-plate limit, which is a very known problem, actually the dpdz is again a function of 10 correct. Again, it is a function of 10, 10, 10 number, and epsilon. In this case, epsilon is going to zero. We just compare the results with the other experimental data on the literature. There is this paper by Pipe and Methilly, where they were running experiments in a rectangular channel and the aspect ratio was low enough so that it can be approximated with the classical limit, and then also with this other theory. Again, the And this is, I go very briefly here. It's just the trend of the pressure gradient as a function of the logical parameter. So, the pressure gradient can change if you change the infinite scale or the power node index. Things are getting more interesting if we go to a finite aspect ratio case. For example, this is the case of a square channel. What we see here on the top is the contours of the velocity, on the bottom are the contours of the effective Of the effective viscosity. When the current number is small, actually, the flow is actually tonight. The viscosity is very, very close to one. Once the current number is getting big, then what we see is that the shear thinning effects start playing a role, except for the corners, where actually there is no flow and the center of the channel, where actually we have the typical flattening of the velocity profile with the shear thinning effect. Cleaning a shear thinning effect. And then you can play with the solutions just to find, for example, other interesting parameters. Like you see, here we were just trying to understand the effect of the power law index on the velocity profiles and also on the viscosity profile here. This is a plot of the effective viscosity. But given that, the main goal of this work was to understand if we can find a sort of generalized description of pressure gradient. Description of pressure gradient for a shear-thinning fluid inside a channel with an arbitrary aspect ratio. Because if you plot the dpdz curve as a function of Caro number, you see that they are not too different. There may be a shift both in Caro number and in the end state here, but the curve seems quite similar one to the other. These are the three cases: so the square, an intermediate, and the two-plate limit. So the data. So the idea was let's try, let's see if we can find a sort of generalized description for the friction factor of the PDZ in this scenario, accounting both for the effect of the rheology and of the aspect ratio. To do so, the idea is, let's say, pretty empirical. So we start from the classical definition of the friction factor in this way, where this tau w is just the average shear stress concluded by the wall. What we can Of the wall. What we can do is we can recast the friction factor in terms of our dimensionless variable. And then the idea was: okay, why don't we use the solution for flow in a rectangular duct that is known as a power series of the aspect ratio. It was developed by Cormich in 28. This is the diameter solution for Newtonian fluid and is valid for a rectangular channel for an arbitrary aspect ratio. So the idea was So the idea was: okay, if we multiply and divide by this quantity the friction factor, the friction factor now assumes this form. Let's look first on the bottom. On the bottom, we have the density, the average velocity, and this expression, which depends only on geometrical parameter. Actually, this I will go through soon, is a sort of an effective length of the channel which depends. Of the channel, which depends on the aspect ratio. While here on the top, we have the mu zero, so the viscosity, which multiplies this coefficient p, which is thus the ratio between the dpdz igno-Newtonian case, the dpdz in the Newtonian case, the one that we know through the Cornish solution. Actually, this pink part, we can define it as an effective length. You see that it depends only on geometrical parameters, while on the right-hand side, this feet, it While on the right hand side, this feed it depends on the radiology of the fluid. Actually, it depends also on the aspect ratio, but we'll see later the dependence is very, very, very weak. So, if we take this p multiplied by mu zero, this is a sort of an effective viscosity for the problem. Given that, we try to see if we can collapse on the frictional factor data. And if we plot this p as a function of the current, the classical current number, the results are not yet okay. The results are not yet okay, but if we define the current number based on this effective length that we just defined, the results are collapsing pretty well. And this P, which is actually a dimensionless effective viscosity, or if you multiply by mu zero, this is the effective viscosity of the problem, actually it follows the logical curves of the Hamiltonian fluid. And again, this is the expression that is written, that describes pretty well the Pretty well, the evolution of P, and this coefficient K, it can be determined doing some classic totalities. I'm not showing here all the classical details, but at the end of the day, what we find is that actually the effective viscosity or this pressure-gradient ratio actually follows the behavior of the non-Newtonian model. So, at the end of the day, if we define this effective length obtained by using the cladical solution for Newtonian. Which depends only on the aspect ratio. And we define this effective viscosity in this way. Actually, the friction factor that we get at the end is still the friction factor that is valid for Newtonian fluid. So there is no change in the power or the scaling of the friction factor, but the Reynolds number should be expressed in terms of the effective length and the effective viscosity. So by the end of the day, The Newtonian scaling is somehow preserved. This result actually came out of another work where we actually observed a similar feature. So a few years ago, we were studying another type of confinement. So if you look, for example, at the flow in a liquid field, this is the classical Landau language problem. But in this case, we were studying the motion of material bubbles. If you look at the field, in this case, the liquid is. Case the liquid is a non-mutonial liquid, the liquid is confined by a means of changes with its shape. But once we look at the average parameter, in this case, the average parameter for this problem is this ratio between the film thickness and the radius of the light. Also, in this case, it was possible, through the numerical solution of the similarity equations of this problem, to find a sort of effective discourse for the problem. And at the end of the day, you obtain the same scaling, it is okay. Obtain the same scaling, it is okay, that is valid for Newtonian fluids. The only difference is that now the Kapiler number is expressed in terms of the effective viscosity and not of the zero viscosity. This type of feature is okay even if we look at H over R in the limit of both capillary number, but then we try to run some simulation and it seems to work also if we look at higher capillary number. These are results made obtained by By simulations. And another example, so last year, this was done in a standard collaboration. Camille was a visiting student in our group. And actually, we're studying a different problem. This is the Lucas-Oschew problem. This is an unsteady problem, very, very different from the other. But also, in this case, if you define an effective viscosity, which in this case depends on time, again, you came up again with the Newtonian scaling of the problem. Scaling of the problem. So I think the takeover message would be that: okay, if we have a sheet of thinning fluid, apparently the scaling, the main scaling of average parameter seems to change, but if you find the right scales for the effective discross here, then you can obtain again the classical Newtonian scaling. This is just a slide to conclude, or we just report. We just report the main result that we are sharing here so that in the case of low-regular annular duct, we can sort of separate the effect of the geometry with the effect of the rheology. In the context of Porus Mira, this may suggest that Darcy's law, even if we look at the derivation of Darcy's law for the capillary bundle limits, at the end of the day, it will not change, but what will change will be, for example, the definition of the effect will be. For example, the definition of the effective discourse and the effective length, but the structure will maybe remain the same. With this, I finish, and thank you for the attention and here for any questions. We have questions.
