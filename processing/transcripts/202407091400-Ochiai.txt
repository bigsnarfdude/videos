So, for the second talk this afternoon, it was a pleasure to hear your speak about the demo approach to invariant distribution with finitely many others. Thank you very much. So, thank you for organizing that to give me an opportunity to hear. I continue that Tao Chi's counter example of his selling fund. So, his author said that there can explicitly That there can explicit subgroup QI loss G prime of G L to N R. And this group has finitely many orbits on real projected space, naturally corresponding to this year to LR, but with subgroup. But still, we specify the character chi H prime really. H prime relatively invariant distribution is infinite dimensional. And he also put these things in a compact homony space to affine space so that correctly speaking, vector space removing the origin, then equivalent statement can be given. Given and with that, so we are. We also deal with the origin contribution from the origin. So this doublety statement is equivalent or in a sense equivalent to the following statement on linear representation. At a linear representation of a group H, which is integrated by such is a group with a dilation. And this group has a finite remaining orbit. It is n plus one orbit, but still same as above. Relatively invariant distribution with specified character. With specified character is infinite dimension. So it's supplied me, and I want to understand this phenomenon why this happened. This is the motivation. So at first it to my early 2000s. Yeah, so anyway, so the group in the Archimedean field case, the group invariance is exactly translated into a Turi algebra for a connected group. So we have a natural differentiation on a vector space. So we have a vector field on real vector space. vector space and our d is so-called by algebra because of differential operator with polynomial coefficients. And even we are considering real vector space, it is natural to consider this ring is sitting on a complex affine space C to n and this map law This map law is a differentiation of group function so that it gives naturally an ERG homomorphism, and by its definition, it is an injective map. And if you have a ERG homomorphism by the universality of universal enveloping algebra, we have an associative original homomorphism from enveloping algebra to things of the differential beta. And in this case, it is not. And in this case, it is not injective, and it is under the key to the observation later. And then a constant is just its first derivative is zero. So means that the relatively invariant condition is translated into it's annihilated by the algebra with character. And as a menu and And as a menu employees, I light the group character and the algebraic character with the same symbol. And so now we introduce the program into the module, and this is a starting point of algebraic analysis. So as a notation, so you As a notation, so usually distribution is denoted by D prime, but D has already been occupied by integral differential operators. So I don't use today D prime, but as an, for example, Catherine Borak, we like C minus infinity for distributions. And for hyper functions, also C minus omega is Minus omega is used, but it is not easy to recognize omega and infinity. So I use a classical notation for a subtle hyperfunction V. And it is not embedding on polynomial is analytic function. Analytic function is C infinity and C infinity is distribution and distribution is hyper function. And then we so this is a function space. So, this is a function space side, and now we move on the module side. So, we have a MIR algebra, and we have several elements in the differential operator, first-order differential operator. Then we define the left ideal i, which is generated by these first-order elements. And once we are given a lift ideal, then we have its coefficient is a natural. Each quotient is naturally left the module. It is abstract. And so separation of equation, differential equation and function is straightforward so that space of homomorphism from the module to function space is naturally isomorphic to invariant distribution. Distribution from the space. The map is explicitly given. Once we are given a homomorphism, then image of the standard generator of this immature M is a solution, an invariant distribution of this differential equation. So it kind of So it it's a kind of algebraic geometry and often for example I felt my last theorem saying that the integer point on the half is only a trivia saying that the equation and the numbers are separated by arithmetic geometry. So algebraic analysis also doing the Recognize also doing the differential equation and the functional space separately to eat it. So, as was mentioned in a several lecture already on holonomic, so let me recall the definition of holonomic demo. So, it is not so. Okay, so let X be a complex pine word, but in our Complex panel, but in our case, this is just a complex finite-dimensional complex vector space. And the cotangent bundle is a boundary on this complex manifold whose fiber is a dual or tangent space. So the dimension is twice. And let M be a sorry, left dimension. So left dimension is abbreviated. D module is abbreviated by d module usually. So left d module on x. And the characteristic variety, I don't like the definition, but it is a closed sub-variety of this cotangent bundle and it is invariant under the complex multiplication with respect to phi direction. Respect to five direction, so synchronic, and some involutivity or otherwise co-isotropic condition with respect to the sympathetic structure of cotangent standard sympietic structure on cotangent wander satisfied. So it must be its dim if it this validity is not empty, then the dimension of each irreducible component of this algebraic. Component of this algebraic manifold must be greater than or equal to its dimension of original complex dimension. So it's in between the dimension and twice the dimension. And if the dimension is lowest possible, so the equality holds, then it's defined to be m is holonomic. So in that So, in that sense, that kind of D module is, in a singularity point of view, it is kind of smallest possible one. It does not mean the irreducible, but it's kind of finite length with respect to irreducible decomposition in a derived category, not derived, but category of the inventory. And as I mentioned, so one of the characteristic properties is holomic dimension, the solution space is always finite, even if we have a largest possible function space, for example, hyper function or distribution or something. But this statement is local so that for each So, that for each point in a small neighborhood, it is a finite dimension. So, that if we want to have a global statement like vector space or a plan manifold, then we have to slightly careful about so that also the global section is finite dimension. But it is case of representation theory. Case of representation, sorry, it is manageable for a well, but not real. Anyway, this is a case of onic so on it implies finite terms. Yeah, as Talistan said, that if you have a complex mind for the complex group with finite A complex group with finite many orbits, then the module expressing the invariant or the relatively invariant distribution or any kind of function is honomic, give a holomic d module. It is standard, comes from standard argument in six operations and localization or which. On localization or which for us is proof of this fact. So, as I touched, I'm saying that in a real orbit is finite. So, this implies that the largest orbit, real orbit, there is a largest orbit with dimension equal to the space dimension of 2n. So this. So this must be extend to complex orbit on open and detailed risky open dense on complex vector space. But still, we have infinite dimension orbit for lower dimensional contribution. So that in the previous slide, the module is not holonomic. But still, we have an open dense orbit so that on this open dense orbit, we have a holonomic demo. So later, I talk about this kind of problem. So if we are doing a special functional representation theory, most cases open dense subsets control the situation. But in his example, His Darshan's example is not such case. So it's so interesting to me. So in a sense, so hyperfunction is actually defined to be a local cohomology of the other form of holomorphic function. So that the solution. This was a solution space of solutions. The solution space is in the Levast order so that we are considering the complex solution of a holomorphic function in the complex space, but with also a higher functor. And then take local components. Local cohomology with respect to real form, then we also get this thing. So my understanding is once we start from complex and then restrict to real, this is one way to understand. So now we're going to explicit. You're going to explicit. So, touchdown deal with n equals 3. This means that the GL6 are, but today I take one more smaller example, which is an original talk given Tales, of course. And let consider G to be GL4R. And so here all Aij is complex number. And so we want to have a Liam to be a CL manifold, CL sub-manifold, Cauchy, Lihman sub-manifold. So this GL4R is not a twisted one, but isomorphic to GL4R. And his H is we not. is uh we not we are considering several subgroups so we name it h3 this is real subgroup of dimension four real dimension four and we enlarge slightly this h3 by h2r by complexification And by complexification, so HCR is a complex four-dimensional group solvable. And H2C is a direct product of foreign subgroup of GO2C. So it is six-dimensional. And we further enlarge this group to nine-dimensional groups in this way. In this way. I didn't like. So H3C and H2C are complexification of PR group and H13. So take taking real form H2C and H3C are same because of this component going to up allied component going to local components so that taking real So, that taking real form, these two things are the same. But in a kind of the module, it is convenient to introduce this H1C. So, for that purpose, I introduce this subgroup in between. And we fix the character of this important group, not important, but at all. Model plot at all. For each L. So not so now I introduce L and for each L we are give a character. And at Tarsna said, so there are infinite many complex orbits. In this case, it is In this case, it is explicitly edited. Sorry, online people. A bit so Hatchet diagram is a direct product of gluteny of the name of three orbit. So it is it is simple. Is it simple and so in the middle group H2C? We have this kind of six nine orbit of direct product type because the group is direct product or a subgroup of GL2 and H1 orbit is so H1 is a larger group so that we have a This is orbit, and so this is orbit. So and as I remain and so contrary, so for a smaller group of Apart from these two orbits or dimension three, other seven orbits is still an orbit with respect to the smaller group, H3. But each of these two orbits split into a continuous family of one-dimensional moduli. So, this is kind of given by the lacio of the two axis, so that this continuous parameter parameterizes the orbit with respect to with respect to the action of touch and group complex complexization of touch and group. So, this is a complex picture. Now we cut out in real. So, real thing only contributes to the diagonal H22, H11, and H20. And it turned out to be it is also orbit of each of these are orbit of a real form of H2 or H3. So even for even under the smallest group H3R, these three are orbit. And this saying that the infinitely many orbits in the complex picture does It in the complex picture does not intersect to the real form. So, for me, it's very kind of strange because no holonic demodule occurs on the orbit of a dimension C, but this does not intersect to real form, but still it contributes to infinite dimensionality. Finite dimensionality of a real form. So, this is to analyze this phenomena. So, once we have a d algebra inclusion, then we have a natural inclusion of the left area. The area area of D lines of differential operator. And then by quotient, we have each of these EDL, we have one D module. And if we have an inclusion of EDL, then we have a natural subjective homomorphism of D module. So we have this kind of situation. And the statement is so even the L group are different, L group or it's the GR4 are different for H2 and H, sorry, it should be H2L. Sorry, groups or the algebra are different, but the idea if the idea. If the ideal indeed are identical, and then, of course, the modulus also identical. So, the same differential equation on the vector space. And the second thing is that each cut out D module by the character L is isomorphic to a so-called synchrohonomic system. It is defined to be for any algebraic variety of y of original variety x, then we have a natural equation taking algebraic local cohomology. And if it isn't manifold, then it is a pure dimensional. Then or it is just a push forward of the Uh, the module on a sub-variety into a larger space. It's supported on a y and each characteristic variety of a normal mantle of sub-variety y. So, it and each multiplicity is easy to see one. So, it is simple in a sense. So, no trivial submodule, sub-demodule here. And it, of course, it also. It is also economic, so it is called simple economic system. And so, not that why is it kind of it's kind of differential equation for direct distribution supported on y. So, real form is sorry, y is complex subman. XR is a real form with Is a real home with OC Riemann type, so these two are different. So it's done to be observation. So counterpart, D module counterpart is observation. So now we understand what So now we understand what's going on. So Talisan defined anyway, module M3. And we add that, so enlarge the symmetry. So we slice out according to the character specified by L. So HD module, in a sense. So correctively speaking, it is quotient, but in a solution, it is a contravariant. It is a contravariant, so we consider some space according to its character. And the first statement of theorem says that it has natural extension to the larger group. And also, we obtain this is a simple honomic system. So it's often the case we have a possibility of infinite dimensionality, but it is problematic to It is problematic to each of them actually has a non-trivial solution, as I mentioned by Teilstan. But in this case, we have this D module is isomorphic to a simple honomic system, and this has a solution written by delta function, direct data function, so that it certainly have a distribution solution. So this confirms the existence of a finite dimensional solution to those. Finite dimensional solution to the original equation. And this is part of the question so that, but each of them have an does not depend on L, it is isomorphic to something simple. So that we may have some of these distribution of intertwining operator with respect to the Respect to the parameter L. So now I want to add change the subject. So I finished the excellent example, but I want to mention something about special function here. So, in an experience, so special function often arises and predicts our representation theory by separation of variable from many variable case. And one of the most typical, so if we work with data functions, so you may have an objection, but I don't hear. So, one of the successful examples is Zona-speaker function. So, it is by K invariant and the K eigen, then by paratonic decomposition, it reduces to the split card. And so, in late 80s, Maupudam did this procedure and given a hypergeometric function with several variables associated with it. Several variables associated with loop systems. So it gives an integrable system on an open subset of Calcan sub-algebra removing walls and it extends to wall A. So originally it had some obstruction on the wall, but accidentally, or luckily, we have a system on all curtain sub-algebra. All Carton sub-algebra. And further, it extends to complexification. So it also has some conjecture so that the invariant differential operator not only on the non-compact symmetric space, but it extends naturally to its compactification. So it is, it is, it, so it is. So it is, I think, it is a phenomenon. It may not have a general theory, but some we have some these kind of experience. And also, Lutmar's implicity is a natural number, but it extends to a complex number like gas-five geometric functions. And once we cannot deform things on the group, but once we work on a correct Once we work on the curtain separate A, so we may have a generalization, so kind of defined operator or like Danko operator or the general kind of HEC algebra and anything else. So another example is different hypergeometry function. So its origin is slightly different, characterizing the image of Latin transform. image of Latin transform. So it naturally living on the Grassmann manifold and linearization, it is living on the left angular matrices and as a constant coefficient to determine a type differential operator is used there. And by Fourier transform, it is a defining defining equation of historical variety. So if we start But if we start from representation theory and separation of variables using symmetry, that we can overcome that seniority and also going to complexification. But touch down the example shows that open dense orbit open dense phenomena sometimes cannot be controlled lower dimensional contribution. What I mean by contribution. Also, the complications have some role in a sense. So, for example, consider the gas hypergeometric function. So, it is classical, but removing a very light assumption on a C is not negative integer, then we have an holomorphic solution after the This is the definition of hypogymetic series. And this power series is polynomial if and only at least one where v is a negative integer. So this condition is polydimension one condition on the three-dimensional parameter space. At three-dimensional parameter space. So, this is of course equivalent to the monogram representation of that three-point removed from the projective space complex projective space into the three group of generator to these two generators as a reducible representation. And as I mentioned, so there is cases. There is a cases to two-dimensional polynomial solution. And this, of course, is equivalent to monodromy representation is trivial. And it is, in a sense, every ABC is integer so that it is co-dimension three. So the co-dimension one and co-dimension three has a gap of dimension two. So as I mentioned, it's not so. As it mentioned, it's not so easy to reach by limiting procedure with this higher co-dimension. Of course, we may have higher residue, but it's not so well fit in representation 7 at this moment. I don't know, future. And so, considering monodromy, we have to turn around the signal point 0 over 1 so that we cannot deal with this kind of interpretation. Cannot deal with this kind of interpretation in our real world. And so, okay, okay. I should finish maybe one minute. So Gauss is kind of utopia so that we have a symmetry of three points. So this can be understood in two ways, but as a sort of integral representation, we have four points in a projective line. point in a projective line so that symmetry is interchanging for points so for factorial will acting and for Riemann scheme we have three singular points and each have two exponent since we have a lamp two differential equation so the symmetry group is a subgroup of complex real reflection group so we have an accidental So we have an oxidal isomorphism so that the data is immediately coincidental. And so the last sort more than second order, if we move to third order, standard generalized hypergeometric functions symmetry with single point one and other two single points around infinity. So we have less symmetry. So we have less symmetry and it is not easy to control the solution corresponding to the singularity one. So we recently constructed the CN differentiation of third order, which have a further symmetry of these three single fonts. And it's coming from the kind of controlling partition function of conformity. Function of conformal field theory, or it is a restriction of automophic differential operator with constant coefficient acting on three by three asymmetric matrix, so-called Eigen module corresponding to SP4. And so if we restrict to the singular line, then it can. Line, then it is obtained in a sense. So we need to extend root multiplicity into a complex number. Okay, so yeah, I finished here. Thank you very much. Is there any question? Just a small question. You say that you you You say that you you you use the D module to explain the example of Toshi Touchdown. Sorry example of Tausan. So sorry Tauchan. Touch. I say Toshi puts it the last name and Toshi is the first name. Sorry, just to I would like just to know if now that you have the tool to understand how this situation occurs, finite number of orbits, but infinite invariant distribution. Can you produce other type of example in the same can you give other example like the Give other examples like the one of Toshi? Ah, so I mean, using the D-module tools, can you see this phenomena appear in the situation where you have a finite number of orbits, but an infinite solution? At this moment, I have no example, but so we may hope to. Of to yeah, yeah, to produce not like but yeah, my attitude is at this moment to lather interflick given examples so that it may be a suggestion. There are not other questions, can send to you again.
