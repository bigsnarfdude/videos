I'm gonna talk about scattering for nonlinear wave equations, but actually I'm quite excited to tell this audience about this because what we've come across are some sort of classical reconstruction problems in this setting that you all know better than I do. And I hope that by the end of the talk you might be Might be happy to see some of these more classical topics maybe appear in a new setting. So, what I want to talk about is, well, scattering. Now, scattering has the word has been mentioned a few times in this workshop, and it every time it means something different. So, what I want to think about is: if you have If you have a wave equation, even just a linear equation, or maybe a non-linear equation, then a natural problem of study is the initial value problem. And there's a question of, for example, for non-linear equations, whether the solutions exist for all time, and if so, what they asymptotically look like, what the asymptotic profile looks like. And the moment you have an idea of what the asymptotic You have an idea of what the asymptotics look like, you can ask a scattering question and you can ask: can I construct a global solution from the asymptotic data? And this map from asymptotic scattering data to initial data or to the global solution, they are called scattering. And even though much of what I say is motivated by non-linear equations. Is motivated by nonlinear equations. I will mostly talk about linear equations that arise when you try to do, when you try to solve the scattering problem for non-linear equations. And it turns out that there's a lot of new structure looking just at linear equations for certain inhomogeneities. So first of all, what is the classical notion of asymptotic data? Asymptotic data, even just for the linear equation. So let's say you look really at the classical wave equation on R3 plus 1, then if you look at first, let's say, smooth, compactly supported data, like this is t equals 0, this is where the support of the data. Then we have, we know already that the solution. That the solution will be zero in what I'll call the exterior of the light cone by simply by domain of dependence. If the solution is zero here, it will remain zero out here, and it will at most be supported in this region. But then in three plus one dimensions, due to like stronger, strong Huygens principle, there's also after some time a region in the interior that opens up where the solution will again be zero. And that's referred to as strong. And that's referred to as strong Huyden's principle, simply follows from Kirchhoff's formula that the solution vanishes in this column that opens up. And I'll call this region here the interior. And then the solution, the region in space-time where the solution is actually supported, I'll call that the wave zone. And in the wave zone, the solution falls off like one over the distance, right? And more so is true if you look at the solution to the wave equation, and now you take a point here and you follow out a light ray in these directions, or in these directions, any direction, and you rescale the solution with, I mean, you multiply with R, then as R goes to infinity, as you're going out on this light ray, you have a limit, and that's the classical Friedlander radiation field. Radiation field. And that is a suitable notion of asymptotic data. And you can ask, if you like, concretely, the scattering problem in the setting is simply given the radiation field, can I find the solution? Now, this is very classical, because if you're really in this setting, then you all know that the radiation field can actually be expressed in terms of the Radon transform of the initial data. And since if I know this function, then If I know this function, then I know the Radon transform of the initial data as functions on R3. So clearly I can reconstruct. So I can, from knowing this, I can reconstruct the initial data and therefore the solution. So for the, but this is only, I can only use the random transform if I have sufficiently fast decaying data. But then. Data. But then, nonetheless, clearly, this question is, if you like, well posed. And Friedlander in the 80s went a little bit further, proved this theorem that says if you look at solutions to the classical wave equation, then the map from initial data, so the map from initial data in energy. Initial data in energy space to the radiation field in L2 is an isomorphism. Now there is, this is often, so if you however look carefully, what he is talking about is, so he's talking about the radiation field, but this radiation field that comes up here is not exactly the one that I've just defined. What he's talking about That I've just defined. What he's talking about is the radiation field of the time derivative of the solution. And between, if I look at the radiation field of the time derivative of the solution, this is now, the radiation field is always, as you see, a function, if you like, on the space of null rays, which is parametrized by a number and by a direction on this field. So that makes a cylinder, and that cylinder is also called future null infinity, which in this Penrost diagram Which in this Penrost diagram sits here. So this is more general, this proof does not rely on the Radhan transform because the data which is an energy space may fall off slower than for the Radan transform of the delta to be defined. So this proof does not, this theorem does not rely on the Radon transform, but one reason, one thing that you take away. One thing that you take away from it is that, in particular, solutions are completely determined by what's happening at null infinity. So, following the characteristics of the equation, looking at the Isengrov profile in those directions completely determines the solution, and there is nothing at what we call time-like infinity. That's to say, the endpoints of all time-like curves. And now, one, when, so So, what I want to talk about is, in some sense, the results that I want to present. They are like Friedlander's theorem for nonlinear equations or for slowly decaying data. And what I'm trying to understand is the characterization of the solution, not in terms of the time derivative of the solution, but The time derivative of the solution, but the solution itself. And so if you look at a non-linear equation, and then, as I said, you arrive at a, you can view as a model problem a linear equation with a certain inhomogeneous term. Now, if you just look, if you take as an inhomogeneous term, like a source term for the wave equation, something which is The wave equation, something which is supported in the wave zone and falls off fairly slowly. Let's do that for the moment. You look at a linear wave equation with a system that lives in the wave zone itself and falls off slowly. Then you can convince yourself by looking at the solutions to the forward problem that as you're going along time-like directions, the solution folds off very slowly, and in particular, what we're going Slowly, and in particular, what we call Puyogen's principle in the Lieutenant case fails. So the solution is supported in what I call the interior. And not only that, you can compute what that is. So this is an example. So you have, this is again our source, which lives in the wave zone and falls off like 1 over r squared. Using the fundamental solution, I can simply compute what the solution here looks like, and I can compute. Here looks like, and I can compute, I can look at the limit as t goes to infinity, and one can compute that, and one finds that the solution is to leading order given by this. So this is a function which is homogeneous of degree minus one as a function now of t and x, if you like. And moreover, this is, you see here, this is a superposition of plane waves. Think of the integral as a sum and you. Think of the integral as a sum, and each of these just depends on t minus x times a fixed vector. So these are the superposition of plane waves, obviously, satisfies the linear wave equation, the homogeneous wave equation, and it falls off very slow, only like 1 over t. Yes? So this is a quant, quant, like a quantitative version of a statement, if you like, that. Of the statement, if you like, that Puyton's principle fails for these examples, and it's a characterization of what the solution looks like. Now, even something worse is true. So, if you look at the, if you try to compute what we call the Friedlander radiation field, so you look at the, you take the point Tx, which is in the wave zone, and you compute what the solution is simply by looking at the convolution with the fundamental solution. You see, we're integrating over the back. You see, we're integrating over the backward light cone, and the backward light column now intersects the wave zone in a really large region. And what you see is that the radiation field simply does not exist, right? You compute this, and as r goes to infinity, the r times phi diverges as r goes to infinity, logarithmically. So the radiation field does not exist. So, but what I can work out is I can work. Work out is I can work out, if you like, an expansion of the solution in the wave zone. And if I do that, then I see there's a leading order logarithmic term, which is the reason the radiation field in the classical sense does not exist. And then there is a term at the order of the radiation field. And this leading order term can be computed from the LG meter. Now the situation that I'm explaining here came That I'm explaining here can be summarized quite nicely in two pictures. So here are two pictures. One is a picture that is much more, will be much more familiar to people who have grown up in general relativity, and the other picture is much more familiar to those who've grown up in microlocal analysis. And what you see here, these are two compactifications of Minkowski space, of R3 plus one. What you have on the right-hand side, What you have on the right-hand side is the idea that Penro said, okay, well, we're in Rorensium geometry. What's relevant here are the characteristic directions. And also for the wave equation, you can say the characteristics is where all the action is. So you take Minkowski space and you take the Minkowski metric, if you like. Take the Linkowski metric, if you like, and let me write it in what we call double null coordinates. So this is the metric on the sphere, and U and V are null coordinates. And if I carry out a compactification in U and V, then I get this picture. On the other hand, if I follow Melrose, And if I follow Melrose, I say I look at this picture and I simply carry out a compactification in the what's called the radial compactification. So I'll just look at a variable something like this. And I carry out a conformal transformation that maps this to finite distance. So then I get on the left-hand side a sphere. These have two different properties here. This picture preserves null lines. This picture preserves straight lines. This picture preserves straight lines, in particular time-like lines. In this picture, this is very useful to the very intuitive picture for the classical Friedlander picture, where you say the whole solution, the asymptotic profile lives at null infinity, at the endpoints of the outgoing null GP system. But what I'm explaining is that for nonlinear equations, or for these particular inhomogeneous terms, there is a lot of action in the interior. The interior. And what is relevant here is the asymptotics towards along time-like curves. And what lives at this is not at the radiation field, but are these homogeneous solutions. So what I'm advocating is for non-linear problems or problems with slow interior decay, one should think of both pictures. Now, why am I explaining all this? So I want to formulate a sketch. I want to formulate a scattering result. Classical scattering result is you're saying, okay, well, all the data is at del infinity, lives in the radiation, is contained in the radiation field. But now what I'm explaining is, what is even the scattering data? Because for these nonlinear problems, there's asymptotics in the interior, which is in principle at the same order, the same order as the radiation field. The solution falls off like 1 over T in these directions, like 1 over R in these directions. So it's the same order. Why? The same or what? What is the scattering data? Is this part of the scattering data or is it still just the radiation field? Now, even if it is just, now, okay, now the radiation field doesn't even exist in these settings. But of course, we can think of an asymptotic expansion, and there's a quantity that is at the level of this radiation field. So we can think maybe that's part of the scattering data. But we'll see this is not entirely free either, because there is something in the interior and the two pieces of asymptotic data have to match. Pieces of asymptotic data have to match. So there's a question: what is even the scattering data in the setting? So the theorem is the following. So if you look at solutions to, say, this inhomogeneous problem like this, where this is an inhomogeneous term which is supported just in the wave zone, falls off like 1 over r square, then we can construct We can construct solutions that in the wave zone have this asymptotic expansion, and they are constructed from the radiation field, which however is not completely free. In fact, it is the radiation fields here do not decay, and even the leading order tail is not free. They are determined from the solution in the The solution in the interior, from these homogeneous solutions, which in turn are determined by the data. And it's only the lower order terms, or the path that decays faster than 1 over q squared, that is free. And not only that, that free part of the radiation field has to satisfy what we call a compatibility condition. So the integral of this free part of the radiation field, the integral Free part of the radiation field, the integrable part of the radiation field, has to be some function that is itself determined from the source. So I'll explain this a little bit more, but basically we think in this setting here, we have interior solutions and in the exterior, there is nothing. So I'm trying to construct a solution for which the radiation field at least decays. The radiation field at least decays in one direction. And as a result of that, there's nothing in the exterior, and I will explain, one should view this compatibility condition as a result of the desire to match to no homogeneous solutions in the exterior. So let me explain this. So let me explain this a little bit more. So let me go back to the setting that what I was referring to: the statement that for classical solutions to the wave equation, the radiation field is given in terms of the Radon transform of data. So you see here also, and that's sometimes not, I mean, I didn't know this until we came across this compatibility condition, but you see from this already that if the radiation field is indeed given by Field is indeed given by the Radon transform of the data. Then, and the data is complex support. Then, if you integrate in time, if you like, the radiation field, this term disappears. But this here is like the integral of the Vanon transform over Q, where Q is this fixed plane orthogonal to omega. If you integrate all these planes, this is simply an integral over R3, and that in general is non-zero. So you can think if you want. I think if you want to study a scattering problem, it looks which if you want to construct solutions backwards, which correspond to solutions which initially came from compact support, then it seems the radiation field is not free at all, but has to satisfy a certain condition, that this integral can't be zero. And what we have done is, if you like, is a generalization of this to nonlinear equations. Now I so usually the plan of the lecture would be to explain a bit more the homogeneous solution in the interior and then the homogeneous solution in the exterior and then how they connect. In the interest of time, I think I'm going to be rather brief on the interior. I want to tell you more about the exterior because that's where really some novelty lies. So the homogeneous solutions in the interior, very briefly, we have, I've said I've said that if you look at this problem, for example, it turns out that from this, the leading order homogeneous asymptotics. In other words, the exact way in which the solution decays, like 1 over t and 1 over t squared in these time-like lines, that is determined by two functions, they can be computed from the source in terms of like the mass and the. Of, like, the mass and this first moment. And they are characterized as, if you like, distributions, that is solutions to the wave equation, which are with sources on the light column where these functions enter, which should be a prime here. And these problems can be explicitly solved, and this is where the characterization comes from. The reason this is important is that if you, so if you, if you, so they are homogeneous. If you, so they are homogeneous. So you can think of them as functions that live only on these lines, right? They're functions on these lines. And I can think about how do they behave as I'm taking these lines towards the light column. I can work out the expansions. If I do that, then I will find certain coefficients. So I will find, so I'm looking at the homogeneous function as expanded as. Expanded as R over T goes to 1. And then if I do that, I get a certain expansion. And the point is that the coefficients in these expansions are the limits of the radiation field, because they have to match. So for example, this one here has to be the limit of the radiation field going to its interior. And for the homogeneous degree minus 2 solutions, the interesting thing is you can say, why do you interested in homogeneous degree minus 2? Well, if you look at the expansion of this, so this is. Look at the expansion of this, so this is homogeneous degree minus 2. But you see the 1 over r cancels, and I get something of a function over r times something divided by 1 over r minus t. So this is the 1 over cube tail of the radiation field, and therefore also fixed by the interior homogeneous asymptotic. So what I'm explaining is, so for the forward solution is there are, if you want, you can take, if you look at the forward solution, you can take limits in different ways. Solution: You can take limits in different ways. You can either go out first along null directions, then you get something on the level of radiation field, and you can take this limit of q going to infinity, of retarded time going to infinity if you like. Or alternatively, you can go along first along time-like curves and then take this limit. And these two have to match, which is the reason, so which for the forward problem is simply a result of the solution is smooth. But for the backward problem, it becomes a matching condition. Condition. So, and this is what I explained. Now, let me talk about the homogeneous solution in the exterior. So, we didn't really, so once we know there are solutions in the interior, you can start, well, maybe homogeneous solution in the interior, maybe also homogeneous solutions in the exterior play a role. So, very classy, look at a homogeneous solution to the homogeneous wave equation, and let's study those which are homogeneous. Those which are homogeneous as a function of t and x to a certain degree. So these would be functions that, if you like, they are functions or lines. And I can take, once I have characterized it, I can take the limit of this line towards the null cone. And these limits should be related to the limits of the radiation field in the other direction. So in this theorem I said, oh, okay, the radiation field decays in this direction. But what if I want to construct solutions which do not decay in one direction, in the in this direction? In one direction, in this direction, which corresponds if you write constructing solutions with data which have slowly decaying initial data, as opposed to compactly supported data. Now, there are some examples, right? So if you, so these are all examples of homogeneous solutions to the homogeneous wave equation, right? These are constants, spherically symmetric. M over R, that's homogeneous degree minus one. This is also homogeneous degree minus one, also a solution to the homogeneous wave equation. This is homogeneous degree minus two. Homogeneous degree minus two. So in spherical symmetry, it's quite easy to write down these solutions. So this is all in the exterior. But we want more. We want the non-spherically symmetric set. So in other words, what I'm going to try to do is I'm going to try to characterize it in terms of the initial data. So if you have a solution which is homogeneous degree minus one, then at t equals zero it looks like this. Conversely also if you have solutions to this initial value problem in the exterior, they are all homogeneous degree minus one. They are all homogeneous degree minus one. Now, this is exactly the kind of data for which the Radon transform is not defined in integrated over planes. These kind of rates are too slow for the Radon transform to be defined. Nonetheless, of course, nobody stops me from so I'm pausing this data here to compute what the solution looks like along these space-like lines. Lines, right? They're just functions, or the solutions are, if you like, they're homogeneous, so they're just functional these lines, and then I can take the limit. And that's a computation. And using the fundamental solution. And what you find is, okay, it's cut, so the limit can't exist because the radiation field doesn't exist. But I can look at the leading order term. And what you see here is that the leading order coefficients are computed from transformations of From transformations on the sphere of these functions, which are related to the func transform. Now, this is, I think, the one audience that I'll ever have where I don't have to explain what the func transform is. But to me, it was entirely new a year ago. I had never seen it before. And so you all know that, okay, it's the analog of the Van transform just on the sphere. I have a function on the sphere, you compute another function. function on the sphere, you compute another function on the sphere from the integrals over the great circles. This obviously has a kernel, the odd functions disappear in this transformation, but it's invertible as a function from even to e. Now, there's this other transformation that appears that this gentleman here calls the Gantt transform. I don't know what you would call it, but it's like a fun transform, just that instead of Just that instead of integrating up the values of the function over the great circle, I'm going to integrate up the normal derivatives. So here, n is collinear to omega, which is that point where I'm computing it. Now, this function I certainly had never seen before, but you can convince yourself that again in the kernel are even functions. And I was wondering, okay, hopefully it's invertible as a function from odd functions to odd functions. And I did not. Function. And I did not find anything until I found this paper here by these gentlemen, Baby Eastbook, Dover and Mason, who had studied this transformation in the context of complex analysis. And it's a good reminder to include figures in your papers, because I would never have found that this paper has anything to do with the transformation that I'm looking for if they had not drawn a figure. So it turns out that this transformation is also invertible. I still don't know an Invertible. I still don't know an elementary proof. Anyone knows an elementary proof? In fact, I'd love to know. I tried to do it myself for a while and I can't do it. But they have a proof of this. So the way we use this result is the following. If you have, it's now, if you give me any smooth, if you give me any smooth functions on the sphere, we can now prove there exists a unique homogeneous degree minus one solution to the classical wave equation. Solution to the classical wave equation in the exterior, which has this expansion as R of t goes to 1. And okay, and let's see how this goes. Well, I'm trying to say that given these two functions, so given these two functions, given these two functions, I want to find the initial data of the solution to the wave pressure in the exterior that gives me this. The wave equation in the exterior that gives me this solution with these asymptotics. Now, in other words, I'm looking at this problem. Now, from the lemma that I showed you, the leading order is this. So, this lends itself quite nicely to decomposing this function into even and odd part. Now, and then I know that the, well, the the the even part of n is determined by the even part of this, and the odd part of n is determined by the odd part of this. Odd part of this, right? But what about the odd part of n and the even part of m? They are still free. Now it turns out that they appear in the next order. So if you look at the simplified problem, say put this data equal to zero and just look at data for the time derivative, assume n is odd, you compute that this doesn't have a Logarita, this has something on the level of the radiation field. And there is another transformation that comes up here, which is like saying, comes up here, which is like saying we're not only, this transformation doesn't only take into account integrals over the great circle, but all the other circles, which are here, if you want, which have constant projection of sigma to omega. And it's an integral like this. And again, I try to invert it. I'll be almost done. I tried to invert this myself, but then reading in the paper, curiously, this turns out to be precisely the inverse of this Young transform. This Young transform. And now you do the next part. Now, the last part is: okay, let's look at this kind of data where m is even, this is the other part. You compute what leading order asymptotics are, and you find, okay, it involves this function. You can think of this as homogeneous degree minus one. I take a Cartesian derivative, I get a function homogeneous degree minus two. This defines this function. What appears is s of these functions. This was odd to odd. Taking the inner product with omega makes even Taking the inner product with omega makes it even to even. Another transformation, which turns out to be the inverse of the funct transform. All these four transformations, they appear in this paper. And we use, and it's a beautiful thing that it's exactly these four transformations that we need. And what is curious about this is that I have come to this as thinking about homogeneous initial data. About homogeneous initial data, and that gives me functions on the sphere in the radiation field. Now, they say you shouldn't think about functions on the sphere, you should be thinking about homogeneous functions on R3. And it turns out that these homogeneities that they tell me I should be thinking about, they match exactly the homogeneities of the data in which they have arisen. So, there is some deeper relationship between these two things that I love to understand, but I don't at this moment. I don't at this moment. So, in the interest of time, I'm gonna just say that what this result allows me to do is to construct solutions to the wave equation, for example this one, with radiation fields that do not decay. And it turns out that if you like, so solution to the wave equation which for which radiation does not decay, which potentially have logarithmic terms, and for which, if you like, you prescribe any function. Like, you prescribe any functions which correspond to slowly decaying data, and what you're seeing is you can only do this if the solutions have slow interior decay, so that necessarily leads to the presence of homogeneous solutions in the interior. I'm just going to skip this because my time is up, but what I'm trying to convince you of is that what we've found is if you For solutions to the wave equation, slowly decaying data is related to slow decaying time. And one can characterize the slow, the leading orders in this in terms of homogeneous solutions in the exterior of the light column and the interior of the light cone. And they we have found ways to explicitly relate them and characterize if if you were in that setting, which part of the radiation field is free. The radiation cube is free. All right, thank you. Can you go back to the Eastwood picture? That's more on the derivative of n, right? Yes. Right. Yeah. M is a function on the write d to n, that's a one for the coach repetitive. Like course, but it takes my integrated one form along the right circle we can get that. Yeah. Okay, so asking our one form, which is uh star of df that integrates to zero. Everything is known in that change. You just heard the phrase, it's a one form, I think. I'd love to um yeah. I'd love to know exactly how that works. Great, thank you. And do you think one can also formulate the other transformations that come up, like this one input, right? Yes. That I haven't thought about. I mean, the usual tools that you do don't transform, it's usually just one doesn't give you any English. Well I think it's an inverse point. So you're actually doing things. You better improve TV data that you can't provide. Now you're using their formula for the inverse that's not taking the case in the random case in the PURID and Yes, okay. Yeah, that's great to know. And I guess, I mean, what so I realize that, you know, these reconstructions are, or these formulas are classical, but what I think is new is that it appears in this setting. And there must be some relation of these inversion, maybe even of these inversion formulas. Sorry? Sorry? No, no sentence. Yeah, that's that's the kind of reference transform. Okay. Any more questions for anyone?
