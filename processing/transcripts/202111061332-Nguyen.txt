The in-person LBS session chair today is Amir Akori, and he's going to introduce the speaker. Thank you very much, Bernate. So, welcome, everybody, for the afternoon session. So, our first speaker is Juan Moen. Po is an associate prof at the University of Calgary. He did his PhD at UC Berkeley. PhD at UC Berkeley in 2014. Then he was a PINS distinguished PDF at UBC from 2014 to 2017. And I think from 2017 up to now he's at the University of Calgary. Hua has a lot of wide interest, general number theory, but also especially dynamical arithmetic, arithmetic dynamic, and combinatorics. And today he's going to give us our first. Today he's going to give us our first blackboard or greenboard talk, and the title is Monogenic Pure Cubics. Okay, yeah, thank you very much for the invitation and the introduction. So I'll try to give a talk that is accessible to everyone. So I'll talk about monogenic field cubics. At least George worked with Social Eigen last year. So let me start with the motivation. Motivation so everyone knows that the quadic fields for every quadratic field k is Q adjoined square root of D where D is a square free integer is not zero or one. Every corrupt equivalent list is monogenic, meaning that the ring of algebraic integers and the set of elements of k that are integral over z. This is This is generated by just one element. Um okay, so everyone would first introductory course in educator numbers. You already know this one. And then the next question: You know, when you start to ask about the cubic fields, you realize that many of them are. You realize that many of them are not so of course the next question is: how many of them are monogenic and how many of them are not. And now, if you look at it long enough, you probably suspect. Suspect that most of them are actually not monogenic. So here's a naive problem. We prove that the set. So let's take a Q3. Positive integer, it's greater than one, where this guy is a field, cubic field is monozenic, its density is zero. And again for a set uh of uh positive integers, so positive integer so well let me remind you what it is you know for any place a subset of the set all natural numbers you know density zero then if you take this limit when you intersect a with this interval one to n 1 to n, well, it is not the same n there. And then you divide by n, in technique, when n goes to infinity, b is 0. Alright, so this button, you know, if you look at it long enough, you see that this is actually wrong. For obvious reason. But after you remove that obvious reason, it becomes correct. Reason it becomes correct. So, before doing that, let me tell you about Syria Edegin in the 19th century. So, let's say n greater than 1 is Q3. And we write n equal to k square m K square m where k and m are positive integers. Square free positive integer. And of course, we have to do this. And of course, because of this AM being Q3, so these guys also have GCD1. And we let alpha is number 2 root of n and k is 0 joint alpha. Then we can easily tell what the integral basis is. The integral bases raise So we have now if n is not congruent to plus or minus one of nine And one alpha alpha square over k is an integral basis of k um so meaning that uh the ring okay The ring OK is free over Z with those guys as the bases. And now when N is congruent to 1 mod 9, plus minus 1 mod 9. Then one alpha k square plus or minus Plus or minus, depending on whether you have plus or minus here. k square alpha plus alpha square over 3k. It's an integral basis. Okay. And because we can easily have an integral basis, we can Have an integral basis, we can easily tell whether chi is monogenic or not. So you will see later. But of course, from here, you have that when chi is 1, you do have a basis 1 alpha alpha square. That's why that naive problem is not correct. Because, you know, corollary, if anything. If n is square free, square free so meaning that k has to be 1. So n is square 3 and n is not gone to plus or minus 1 move 9 then This guy is monogene eh? And you know that the set of square free integers have density like pi square over 6, I think, like, oh no, 6 over pi square, 1 over zeta 2, yes. And if you avoid these congruent classes, then just multiply. Glasses, then just multiply with the number of the corresponding current classes. So it still has positive density. Okay. Alright, so that's naive problem is wrong just because just because at least chi can be one. But now if we avoid this, you know, obvious gauge example turns out to be correct. Okay, so let's consider a more refined Okay, so let's consider a more refined program. So for it? So for it, square 3 must be k. So now I'll fix k, little k square 3 positive. So define a set S K as the set of only m, so square free m greater than 0. Okay, so also require this GCD to be 1 and this case square m is not congruent to plus minus 1.9 where this field adjoins This case where I am is monogenic and we also define the other set, TK It's uh pretty much the same property here, same property here. Same property here. But now we have a case where M is plus or minus one of nine. And this monogenic is a very good thing. Well you can even break this into two sets, you know Tk plus what is plus one Mug9, Tk minus what is minus one Mug9 But at the end they're even approved zero density result so if it's a union of finally many of those it still has zero density and we have the following by the way By the way Because k greater than one? Yes, yes. Square proving a positive k. Oh no no, it's gonna be the next result. What's the statement of the result? By the way, of course this empty whenever ti is divisible by 3. And so therefore whenever we mention this set, we implicitly assume that ti is not If this is later, assume that ti is not divisible by 2. And now we have the following results. Well, first of all, as you saw before, S1 is exactly the square frame M, where AM is not plus or minus 1. Plus or minus 1 mock 9. Okay? Alright, so here's the more refined problem to prove that except for S1 on the other side Fk when k rate equal to 2, d k when k rate equal to 1 have zero density. Okay, so that's a more sensible problem. And I'm gonna study some results that actually prove that solve this problem. Okay, some main results. So make resolve in the number field case. So we have unconditional results. So, this is not very strong, but still enough to imply zero density. So, for every epsilon greater than zero, n square free um kettle to do. Let's go to you. We have on the one hand a lower bound that depends only, what the implied constant depends only on n, not only on k. So we have n to the one-third is a lower value less than so that's less than this quantity if I take the intersection of this guy with this guy another D but this just means that this there's a constant C times here less than this but the C depends only on K. Depends only on K. And that's a lower bound. For the upper bound, now this upper bound depends on K and epsilon. So of the form N over log N to the one-third minus epsilon. And because this little of n, we don't have zero density result here. We don't have zero density result here. So it's that's the first one. Well, and the one for the t chi is completely similar. So for every epsilon greater than zero and square free. Now k is allowed to be one. We have Very same flow value up to some constant and also the same about. Okay, and therefore these zaps have zero density. So of course these upper bounds are quite weak, quite strong enough to imply zero density, but they're still quite weak. Okay, so what if you assume ABC, then you get pretty much another strongest possible upper left. So conditional So, conditional on ABC and upper belt bell that is essentially optimal. Well, so we So we have that for k great or equal to 2, we do have that this guy intersect this guy carrying out the less than n to the one-third plus epsilon. What exactly do you mean number field case? What do you mean by that? Exactly. What what's that? Number field case. What do you mean by that? Uh because there's gonna be a function field result. When you replace Q by the, when you replace Z by a polynomial ring of the t. I'm gonna state it in uh ten minutes and you you will see. So this this box is Q? Yeah. Yeah, Q and uh the tubic field, yeah. And the cubic field, yes? The field or cubic field? For the function field chi, you're gonna have this guy and this guy adjoin q root of f, where f is a polynomial. Okay? But we're gonna get there. I hope. But they say that you wrote that plot means that like instead of Q of something, you're considering K of something. Oh no, it's just P U something P U cubics over Q. Okay. Alright, we have that, and we also have the same upper bound. For which the exponent one-third is best possible because of the lower bound. So when k greater equal to one, we have this guy intersect this guy last night. Less than, of course, there's some implied constant n to the one-third plus epsilon. Okay? Alright, so that's the result for field-quubit number fields. Now we can talk about results in the function field case. Resolve Dissolve in the function field space. Okay, so we can talk about the situation when F is a finite field of order Q. And characteristic P less than up to because when you take too big extensions, you want to avoid that kind of situation. And we also, you know, it's perfectly fine to consider this our little aim now. our little aim now. Let's do free. Here we don't really care about the constant factor, so Q3 meaning that you don't have a positive degree factor, that is a Q. Okay. And alpha is this guy. Is this guy? And then you can have k that is F of F T adjoin alpha and okay is the integral closure. of FT intache. So it's completely similar and then we can ask whether this monogenic, meaning that whether this is F of T and then generated by one more element. Say that k is monogenic if there is theta in k is such that okay. Okay is this thing generated by Z i over F T. Alright, and luckily Delipin theorem still holds. It's exactly the same proof, pretty much. It's actually even easier. We have the following. We have the following. We write, we're going to write other n as k square times m. So c square times h. Yeah, with square 3. Angie Bing Monic Then one alpha alpha square over G is a basis of obtaining Of okay over this guy. Okay, there's uh it's actually even easier than before because previously we actually had to wonder whether we can divide by three or not, but now you know you can always divide by three in FT because the characteristic is not three. Okay, so there's only one case. And then you can ask about pretty much the same question. Pretty much the same question. So, all right, so now we're gonna fix G for it Monica Square Free G here Solo. So I'll let the set U G as a set of square free H where you can see H is one and this guy is monogenic. Okay, then we ask whether this guy has positive density or not. But of course to define a density in this case we have to replace the interval 1n by an appropriate interval in here. And the most natural way is probably just to pack all polynomials degree up to Back opening almost degree up to about. So we're gonna do the following. We're gonna get, we're gonna have this set and define this to be the set of polynomials of degree less than or equal to n. And now we also have We also have that U1 has positive density because we actually have this one. U1 intersect this guy and then we divide by how many elements in here. Well, let's be precise. Turns out to be 1 minus 1 over Q. Why is that? So U1 is exactly a set of square 3 polynomials. And then it's an easy exercise to actually count this. Okay? So this is the obvious counter example for the zero instance. For a 0 and 3. But then ordered at least the same kind of result. So we just avoid the kinds when G is 1. Let G B A monic square free Square free polynomial and the degree of change is positive so that we don't have that case. So we have, okay, now if you don't want to count too precisely, then this has about q to the n many. Due to the n many elements. Well, there's some constant times this, but we don't really worry about that. And so we have a lower value that is that guy to the vowel one-third. Um okay, so say um okay what is the upper bound now previously you have um if you assume ABC you have an upper bound of right this n now is actually q to the end because that's the That's essentially the number of many elements in that interval. So you expect something like this. But actually, we have something stronger. It's just n square q to the n over 3. So can even save, well there's no epsilon can even yeah. Very implied constant debate on F and G. We imply constant depend only on M and G. Okay. And this is actually quite typical when you work in function field. I also have another paper when we analyze problem over function field. When the analogous problem over function field knowledge you can solve it, but you can actually have a much stronger bound uh than the conjectural bound in the number field case. Okay, and now let me talk about the method this is because of the ABC because they say not only function field has ABC, they also have the Riemann House. Field has ABC, they also have the Riemann hypothesis. Everything you can do is true in function fields. I have truth too. But you're saying you get something even better than the expected thing from ABC? Yeah, from number few k you expect to have something like this. One third plus epsilon, right. Here you can forget about the q epsilon and you're just like this extra factor n square here. But is this something that's coming But is this something that's coming from ABC in the function field case? Like some improvement of ABC in the function field case? It comes from ABC, ABC in the function field case. And ABC in the function field case, you see there's no epsilon. Yeah. And it's pretty much like that one is like q to the power log log of n. And a squared is like q to the power log of n. Yes. Actually, if you write it like that, then it's going to be the same. If you write it like that, then it's going to be the same quality as this, no? No, but there's no epsilon here. But if you factor on n, don't you get like log n over n? Yes, but it will go to zero and n goes to infinity. Here, this epsilon is fit at the beginning for the number field. Yeah. Okay. Alright, so before we pro Before we prove before I tell you about the method of the proof, maybe just ask some questions first. Maybe some questions. All right, so of course we first want to improve the unconditional value n over block n to the one-third. n to the one-third minus epsilon in the numbers you guys and of course any improvement of the form of the form let's say n to be log n To the log n to the c, or c bigger than 1, which implies that you have zero density within the set of primes. So instead of consider this, you can just consider this. And then if you have something like this, then this implies that zero, that's something you would in the set of params. Can I say my zero? No, still greater than one. Yeah, because n over log n is the number of grams from one to n. Yeah. Well, yields. I won't try to be too precise. I'll just say zero density result within Set friends and the function few guys. Okay, so in the function field, guys, we are your question is to improve your power and hands well. Where give to the end of three. Now, to be honest, it's very doable, I guess. In our paper, we are generous, but if we try to be mean, maybe we can certainly improve it. So that it is very doable. No, but the real question is: can we improve Like, let's add some constant times q to the n over 3. Now, this might be hard because this is also the lower bound. So, well, what do you think you can do? Um yeah, no, no, I I did not try to be mean, maybe also. Try to be mean. Maybe I'll show you. Yeah, maybe I'll look at it at some point and see. Well, I would say probably something like this is within reach. Yeah, but it go all the way down to just some constant times even maybe. Yeah. Okay. So now let's go back to the method of the proof. And you see it's actually very simple. And you see, it's actually very simple. So you can easily wrote the following. Let's say here M S K if and only if k square M is congruent to no, not congruent to plus minus 1 mod 9. But this is in the condition When this is the condition to define the set and the equation, this is a two-way equation k x power 3 minus m y to the power 3 equal to 1 has a solution x y x, y in z. Um yes, this is a two-way equation. And uh you you you can say that when k is 1, you always have the trivial solution, x is 1 and y is 0. That's why it's only true when k is 1. But you know, if you don't consider k is 1, you fix a k that's not 1, and then you let the m vary, then you explain The M value, that you expect that most of the time this guy doesn't have any solution. And again, you know, there is also some sort of a general heuristic that on average, a sware equation has zero solution. Okay. So that is called the S k. And the T k is also completely similar. If k square m is congruent to plus minus one mod nine and equation And equation pi x power 3 minus m y power 3 equal to 9 has a solution x y in z okay as of for now the only way that I can apply. Way that I kind of know when this has a solution or not, it's just by congruence properties. So, for the unconditional result for the unconditional upper value, and by the way, the lower value is easy because. Because, for example, in this case, we just yeah, how to get a we're looking for M so I guess we pretty much can just let M. pretty much can just let x be anything up to a to the power 1 third just take x to be anything up to this number and then we take out the power 3 factors out of these numbers minus 1 and then we divide that one get m. So the lower r is actually very easy. x can be anything up to here anything up to here and then we take chi x by 3 minus 1 divide the q factor of that. But for the upper belt we can just use some basic seeing so we we know 4k x squared minus m oh no k x by 3 minus m s where we will do equal to 1 Respectively k x squared minus m was x cube or q equal to 9 and p is a prime such f k are respectively k over 9. If not acute P, then P cannot divide M because otherwise if P divides M, then it means that K is going to be a Q modulo P. And therefore, we just see our And therefore, we just seep out all these primes to count how many m. And for the primes p like this, we do know the density of set prime by the chipotle f density field. So and just thank you very much. Just enter it very simple. And for the one using ABC, as you know, for an equation like this, ABC is wonderful for this kind of thing. So, how much time do I have? Two minutes. What's that? Two minutes? Okay, so I guess for the function field guys, it's similar, but there is some combinatorial counting arguments. Counting arguments that we have to use to get down to the end square here. Yeah, pretty much. Yeah, of course it's easier because you have ABC, you can use ABC and then you also have well certain nice well, you know, the ZR functions and so so on, it's just rational functions. Okay. Functions. Okay. Right, yeah, I think I'll stop here. No, you're doing it for me. So, everyone in this room, do you have any questions for our speaker? And Chris. What if anything can you say, following up on on Amir's question, which was meant slightly different, but what if anything can you say about relative extensions? Anything that you say about relative extensions. Like, say something simple. Oh, a quadratic field of class number one, imagine a quadratic field of sort, or something like that. Well, yeah, so I guess, you know, as long as you know the form of a basis. Now in this case we w in this case we certainly have an okay three of rank three over your base. Over your base. Right, over all. Um so number one, can you have anything explicit about the basis of this guy over this guy? Um and then these equations they come from what you call the index form equation. Then you have a corresponding index form equation. So number one, whether you have a basis, a nice basis or not. Number two, if you have an equation like this. Number two, if you have an equation like this, then I guess the the f you know all the arguments probably f go through. Now for ABC there's a a a a zero row ABC by Voida. Yeah, so. So I guess at least in the class number one case or something else. Yeah, so it depends on the form of the basis. Is there any question from people in this room? So in the method of proof, does this work? So in the method of proof, does this tell you if a monogenic basis exists, how to find it? So for example, if you find the solutions to that equation, can you use that and then go and write down? Actually in the method of proof we don't know only M where this has um a solution. We just like cut down drew out uh a lot of m where this guy doesn't have uh solution. Uh. So it's Have a solution. So, from the proof, you know, it's possible that there is some aim that we could not rule out. Yeah. But on the other hand, you know, from the equation at least, there should be a lot of methods that can do it, you know, like Baker theory. Thanks. We still have time for two, three more questions, please. Anything from the chat? How about the people on Zoom? Online participants? Do you have any? Online participants, do you have any questions? I don't see any in the chat. But I'm going to ask another question while waiting. How about the pure quadratic case? Do you try it? Okay, I have not tried it. Well, in that case, even if you have a nice basis, my suspect is that Is that like you don't have an equation in two variables anymore, and you probably have an equation in three variables. It's like here's that you're looking at integral points on this curve. But in that case, you're probably looking at integral points on singles. And then the finiteness and so on is still a conjectural question about yeah, I don't see other questions. Yeah, I will see other questions without. So let's find speaker again. Stop recording.
