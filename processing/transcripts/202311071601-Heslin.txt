Gerva's morning talk, but I'll briefly recall the setting. And all of this is joint work with Martin, Steve, and Gerv. So I'll start with the surface quasi-geostrophic equations. These were introduced into the mathematics literatures in the 90s by Constantine Maida Tabek. So the whole time, the manifold I'm going to be considering is the two-sphere. So there we have these. Here. So we have these equations, and they give a very nice introduction where they describe the motivation for studying the equations. And they give two main reasons. So they say that the equations are interesting in their own right, just from a physical standpoint, because they model the interaction of hot and cold air masses on the surface of the Earth. They also describe what they call, and this is what catches my eye on the Edward, striking matters. Paper, striking mathematical analogy between these equations and the 3D Euler equations of ideal hydrodynamics. So they establish in the paper a conservation law that looks like morticity with mortic stretching, and they also establish a Beal-Catomida criterion that looks like 3D OIDA. Then this is the quote from the paper. They put it better than I do, but what I said is a paraphrase of this. I said as a paraphrase of this. So, about 10 years ago, then, Shea Constantine Wu introduced this family of equations on the two-sphere called the generalized surface quasi-deustrophic equations. So, I'll refer to these a lot, so maybe I'll rewrite them here just to cement them in place. So plus equals zero, and you can use this symplectic gradient of line. Gray names are minus. And then what Gerard would call a colour, so I'll give it a colour. Beta over 2 minus 1 theta. So the utility of these equations is, if you consider the PEE that they described, as you go from zero to one, As you go from uh zero to one, with your beta, here you have 2D Euler and here you have uh SQG. So as PD this interpolates between 2D Euler and SQG, which makes it uh interesting as this is, as I said, a model for 3D Euler. So, Cornelia gave a very nice workshop yesterday where she talked about how this can be. She talked about how this can be realized as an Euler-Arnold equation for the L2 metric. Beta again goes from zero, this is L2. And then the SQG, this is in a paper by Pierce Waschabell in 2016. He says that this is also an Euder Arnold equation for this H homogeneous minus one half metric. Minus one half metric. And in the middle here, we have this homogeneous minus beta over two metric. So 2023, Gerard Mushoek and Shrong Vu showed that this entire family are all Euler-Arnold equations for these metrics. Okay, and you can write the metric in terms of the stream functions. We're on S two, so everything can be written as a symphonic gradient of a stream function. As a symplectic gradient of a stream function. Okay, so you've corresponded the Lagrangian solution map to finding geodesics on this exact volume-preserving diffeomorphism group of S2. So can you find the geodesics that corresponds to can you develop an exponential map? And the answer is yes. So if S is greater than 3 for beta between 0 and 1, there are Beta between 0 and 1, the right invariant metric admits a well-defined exponential map, which is a local lithium morphism. Okay, so what this allows you to do is to study the analytic and geometric properties of this map as you vary beta. So, this will tell you something about how the geometry of this infinite dimensional space changes as you vary from this. Changes as you vary from this to the Euler to the surface positiostrophic equations. So, when I say that we can study analytic properties of the exponential map, one of those is the singularity, so this is Fred Holmes. So, I think at this point we all know what Fred Holmes, so I'll skip this. The flagship result, first result pertaining to fluids about Fred Holmes, is this result from 2006 of Edmund Garrett. Of Levin, Garrett, and Steve. So, if the underlying manifold is two-dimensional, this is without boundary, with boundary was finished after with James Blaine and Garrett and Steve. But if the underlying manifold is two-dimensional, you have a Freddon map index zero. And if it's three-dimensional, it fails to be Freddon. Okay, so then what we've got now is an analog of this. analog of this. So also the beta equals one case here, I'll say that at the end. So if beta is strictly less than one, the exponential map corresponding to this metric is a non-linear Fredholm map of index zero. And it is critical because at beta equals one, it is not Fredholm. That was proven also in the paper of Washington in 2016. So you have, in terms of Fred Holmeness, You start off green is a bad colour, I'm green, but all the way to red is bad, so red is the end. So you're fed home all the way until this critical beta equals one. So that's an analytic property of the exponential map that you can watch as you vary beta. Data. What I want to talk about or focus on here is a sort of a geometric lens to view this exponential map through. So I'll consider again the underlying manifold as all of this solution. We're going to think of a steady state solution to this, which is just rotation. So this is theta is going to be equator. Equator and then phi this direction. So if you consider just the rotation, this is a steady state solution to every single beta SQG equation. And this can be written as the synthectic gradient of this stream function. An important point is that this stream function is an eigenvalue of the Laplacian, or is an eigenfunction of the Laplacian, but eigenvalue this. This. So, when you're talking about the geometry and the singularity of exponential map, you're looking for conjugate points. Conjugate points, first I should say. The flow map for this is very simple. T theta phi is just theta plus t phi. And this gives you a curve on d mu s You S2 beginning of the identity integer gamma T. So if you want conjugate points, so gamma of t is conjugate to the identity. If you can find the Jacobi field J, so that's a vector field along the geodetic. Factor field along the geodesic that satisfies the linearized geodesic equation. And it vanishes at the end points. So if you look at not the Jacobi equation, but the left translated Jacobi equation, it has this nice form, partial t of, so V is my left translated Jacobi field, so J of T equals D E. equals D E L gamma T. I'm going to call this V L, so for left, because you can also right translate it. Okay, this is equal to this W plus, and then how is W change? It's related to this capital L star, gamma W plus this add W U naught equals zero. So that's your Jacobi, your left translated Jacobi equation. The nice thing for this. The nice thing for this initial data is that this becomes very simple. So, what does it become? A very depressing amount of words, but in terms of stream functions, if you say V L is, let's say, symplectic gradient sigma, and this double. vector gradient sigma, and this w is some vector gradient psi. Then what you get is the partial theta and sigma is your psi and you have here partial t minus beta 1 minus beta over 2 psi plus this 2 to 1 minus beta over 2 So I equals zero. Okay. Okay. We want to find any Jacobi field that vanishes at the end point. You just want to find some, and then you know that the point is conjugate. So you assume this decomposition, this separation of variables on psi, you're going to decompose it as A to the T, and then It is a to the t, and then this phi n, I now have two phi's, which is unfortunate. I wanted to use a and b as coordinates on the sphere, but Stephen's very upset. So I had to use a b okay. You can write it like this, where this is a spherical harmonic, n plus one, vn, and sorry I should have a partial theta here. partial theta here and partial theta phi is I n v n running out of time so if you jam that into that it becomes a very simple ODE that you can solve on this CT and I can go to the solution now there you go there's CT right you then solve for You then solve for sigma, which is the stream function of your left translator Jacobi field, and you get this expression. Okay, and it depends on beta, which is nice. You look at this, and you can find zeros of this for a certain time. There's the t. You plug in the correct t to make that one, and then the one minus one kills the whole thing. These t beta n's look like that. Look like that. And if you stare at that and just count the powers on n, if beta is less than 1, these spread out. So along this geodesic segment, they're spread out and discrete. If you let beta equal 1, t is this. And as you limit n to infinity, they cluster. So we're seeing now that for beta less than 1, these conjugate points are spread out, and for beta, Are spread out, and for beta equals one, they're clustering at this time. Okay, yeah. There's the general theorem that says that we can actually find for any beta less than one, we actually have it at the bottom. Yeah, thank you. One quick question? Yeah. I don't understand the pirot of thing. Say it again. Pyrootof2. There's a symmetry of the sphere here. There's a symmetry of the sphere here, and everything should be symmetric with respect to pi. Because you can you have sort of the same geodesic, you have a periodic geodesic of length 2Ï€. So if you have at some t you have a conjugate point, 2 pi minus t should also be a conjugate point to zero, no? Because you can just reflect the sphere that and gives you rotation in the opposite direction. So You're saying that I should be able to like modulo this T beta to pi. No, you have a you are looking at the periodic geodetic, right? Which is a closed curve in the group of diffeomorphisms. Yes. On this closed curve, there is a two-fold symmetry, which is an isometry, which just corresponds. Is an isometry which just corresponds to a reflection on the sphere. Yes. So, how could you get the value by root of 2? No? That doesn't make sense. Yeah, maybe that 2 isn't supposed to be. Maybe this is supposed to happen at pi and then it's in the middle. I I don't remember, but I think it's more likely co clustering at pi. Yeah, so this might be the kind of issue. I'm sorry. So this might be a kind of issue. I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. I think we have to move on to the next one.
