As is on invariant functions motivate each other, and okay, so I will start with a definition that each of us will know, and namely we say that with interpolation, we say that interpolate, so giving nodes Z1 and Zn in a domain D. So here D and G are domains in Cn. G are domains in Cn and points W1, WN, and G to interpolate is to find a holomorphic map F that interpolates, meaning that F sends a point Zj to Wj. And as we all know, the simplest case is due to peak. And he showed that such a problem is solvable if and only if this n by n By n matrix is positive semi-definite, and the same argument actually can be solved similar in the case when we consider this particular problem. My kids used this, where here R is a homogeneous domain, and to see this. Domain and to see this one can use Schulz algorithm. Then we can assume that using automorphisms, we can assume that one of the points that two points vanish. And then instead of if f interpolates this, then g of lambda defined in this way solves n minus one interpolation problem, which means that this internal is quite simple. In general, it's quite simple to deal with. It's definitely more complicated when we deal with this interpolation. So here, points, values are in the unit disk, and D is a subdomain of Cn where N is bigger than one. And the only result I know in this direction is due to Jim Adler. To Jim Agler, and he, I think that he put this in his unpublished paper. And anyway, this, this, this will appear later because this condition is quite useful. And he showed that this has a solution if and only if. Okay, so here points are I denote coefficient of coefficients of points in this way. So he showed that this is a solution even only if such equation holds. Well, here gamma and delta are, so here is C one minus C one C two side for this. So that this is solvable even only if there exists gamma and delta, which are positive semi-defined such that this equation holds. And the point is that this condition here can be verified using computers, as we shall see later. And it is convenient to. It is convenient to deal with to assume that this is minimal, and we say that the solution is somehow optimal. We can always assume this multiplying lambda j by some t and then this is minimal. So, the formal definition is that it is minimal if it is interpolated. It cannot be interpolated by a better function because image is relatively compact in the disk. And we are also interested in minimal. Minimal interpolating functions. So, for example, in the mentioned case, when both domains are the disk, a unit disk, all minimal interpolated functions are just Blaschke functions. And this can be easily seen using the Schulz method. And the second question that we are interested in is Is the extension problem? So here we have a subdomain D of Cn and we have some analytic set. Okay, it can be any set, but it is enable to assume that it is some structure. So we assume it is analytic because we consider holomorphic functions. If one considers polynomials, then it is assumed that then it is unable to assume it is algebra. So we say that V. So we say that V is an extension set, so V is in D, if and only if any holomorphic function on V, any bounded holomorphic function on V, extends to a function on the whole D. And the subnorm of extending function is the same as the norm of F on analytic set V. And the point is that this is, okay, we know. That this is okay, we know that such an extension always exists. I think that this is due to OCA. It's called Kartan Furium, I think, but it's due to OCA. But this here lies on opposite side, namely, there are no many sets for which that satisfies this extension. Okay, so here, in fact, we are interested in V, and there is a nice connection between there are direct connections between. There are direct connections between interpolation and extension, namely, if we consider a minimal peak interpolation problem, then all solutions, all minimal solutions do coincide on some analytic set. So tautologically, it has sense to study interpolation on V and then look how functions bounded by one on V extend to. V on V extends to the whole domain D. And the second motivation comes from the oppositor side, namely a simple Montel stype argument shows that V has is an extension set if and only if for any points Z one, Z n in V and any for any nodes Z one, Z N and V and any points lambda one and lambda N in D. one and lambda n in d this interpolation is solvable if this interpolation is solvable as a problem given on v then it is also solvable as as given on on the whole domain d and one way of attacking this of telling something about this about extension sets is to use this argument for n equal to two so if time permits i will show So if time permits, I will show how Pascal's idea, a Pascal-to-Ma idea works works here for this case of two points. So the first part of my talk will be focused on two peak interpolation, namely, we consider just two points. So we have the talk P denotes the hyperbolic distance. So recall that this is given by this formula. 1 plus t over 1 minus t, and it is invariant under optomorphism. So we define this in this way. Okay, it should be absolute value here. Okay, so this is so this is called the hyper%, it's called the prong-have distance on the disk. On the disk. Okay, what we are interested in is in this interpolation, two-point peak interpolation on D. D is a subdomain of CN here. And note that this is solvable if and only if lambda and mi are not too far away from each other. So the first immediate bound is given by this subnum. So this is solvable if and only if. This is solvable if and only if this boundary distance between lambda and me is less or equal than this function here C D of Zw. And it is minimal if and only if the equality here holds. And this is the first invariant functions that we shall be dealing with during the talk. So let's look at the basic, basic, basic, basic, basic, basic parties. Basic, basic, basic, basic properties. So, this is the definition. So, okay. So, first of all, C D is a pseudo-distance, which means that it doesn't need to be a distance. For example, if D is the whole space, then this vanishes because there are no, this is equal to zero, because there are no bounded colomorphic entire functions. On the other hand, if these On the other hand, if D is hyperbolic, for example, if D is bounded, then this is actually a distance. So this gives the same topology. It has the following interesting property. If phi is a holomorphic function between domains D and G, then C G of phi of Z phi of W is less or equal than C B of C B of Z W. And this condition actually can be. And this condition actually can be used, is extremely useful in complex analysis. For example, it shows that, for example, if we consider a holomorphic mapping between two domains, then one can use this, it's seen that one can use this to show that there exists a tangential limits of phi because of this property. So, this is quite often used. In particular, if phi is a very particular if phi is a biholomorphic mapping so if phi is a bicholomorphic mapping we have equality here so this justifies the name and if this is the unit disk then the schwarz lemma immediately implies that that this is just the hyperbolic distance on on the disk okay and looking at this at this at this at this conditions here one wants to define more More such pseudo-distances. Okay, this has important motivation, namely, we know that if this is a subdomain of a complex plane, of the complex plane, then it is simply connected, then it is always bi-holomorphic with the unit disk. This doesn't hold in higher dimension. For example, even the ball and the poly disk. And the poly disc are not biholomorphic to each other when n is bigger than one. So, one is looking for some invariant objects that would help us to tell whether two domains are biholomorphic or not. So, anyway, using these conditions, one wants to define more invariant functions and matrix. So, here D denotes the class of all domains, all possible domains. Domains, all possible domains for all possible n equals one, two of e, and so on. And we say that dd is a family of invariant pseudo distances if and only if these three conditions are satisfied. Namely, this is a pseudo distance indeed. On the disk, the family D gives just the hyperbolic distance. And if phi is a holomorphic mapping between d and g, then the distance between phi of z and phi of w is less than this. phi of z and phi of w is less than distance between z of w. So this in part again this in particular means that the equality holds here if phi is a bicolomorphic matrix. Okay so there are two obvious consequences of this. The first one is the following. Look, if we apply this okay maybe I will switch to that. Okay, if we apply this condition to D, to G equal To D, to G equal to D, we immediately get we get that this, okay, so here we have a mapping F that is holomorphic on D and with values in sorry values in the unit disk. So immediate consequence is that this distance here, which is the point carrying distance, is less or equal to sorry Sorry, yeah. So, this is the point carrier distance between points f of c and f of w. This is less or equal than dt of cw. So, taking maximum over all possible functions f, we simply get that any such invariant function is bigger or equal to cd. And similarly, using this third condition for phi. this third condition for phi equal to for phi for for for phi coming from d to d uh such that phi of lambda is equal to c and mu of mu is equal to w we get that that what that this is bigger or equal than than this for n5 so which means that this distance is less or equal than this Or we call then this function ld. L d has its own name. This is a very important function, it's called the Lampert function. Okay, so we have two bounds. So any such pseudo-distance is bigger than C D and is smaller than the Lampert function. The Lampert function is also nice, namely it's the distance between points it in the Uh, between points in the between points f of c and f of w is smaller than the distance between c and w, and on the disk L D is also the hyperbolic distance. However, in general, L D doesn't is not a distance, doesn't satisfy, it doesn't satisfy the angle inequality. So it fails even in a very elementary domain, which is given like this. So z less than one, w Z less than one, w w less than one, and z w less than alpha, or alpha is less than one. So, so so, so this is a nice two-secret domain of C2. For sure, it is pseudo-convex, and LD fails to be a distance there. So, and here the name Kobayashi comes up. So, Kobayashi, pseudo-distance, is the biggest distance that is smaller or equal to. Distance that is smaller or equal to L D. And of course, one can define this using a chain of pods, using a topological argument as infimum of some of such distances, where infimum is taken over all finite combinations of points, chain of points. And this is called the Kobayashi pseudo-distance. So, as I say, this is how the name Kobayashi comes out. She comes out. So we have these three equalities. So Cd is less or equal than Dd, this is smaller than the Kobayashi distance, and this is smaller than the Lampert function. And note that all these functions are well defined using just an analytic way. So it was a big surprise when Lampert showed that if D is a convex domain, then there's only one way. Then there's only one way of defining such invariant distances. Namely, if he showed that Cariatodari function and the Lampert function are equal to each other on a context domain. As I said, both functions are defined in an analytic way, while context City is not an analytic condition. It's not invariant under by holomorphism. It's an algebraic condition. Okay, so anyway, I'd like to mention. Okay, so this in particular. Okay, so this in particular means that, look, here in the definition of this function, one considered mappings functions defined on D with values in the unit disk. Here, one had analytic disks, that is, mappings on the unit disks with values in a domain D. So, if D is convex, then these two point problems, peak and the P problems, are dual. I will say more about this. I will say more about the sterility later because I'd like to sketch ideas of Lamberts. And there are several ways of solving this. The first one, the most powerful, is due to Lambert. So somehow we want to say that we want to we are looking We are looking for a function that in some point that for some functional so okay we are looking we are looking for a function phi for which the infimoment the definition of Lamport function is satisfied if is attained so if okay so one can construct a functional and phi is its minimum point so this leads to standard Euler Lagange formulas on Poor on the boundary of D and solving them led Lembert to, or maybe it was Poleski who solved them. Anyway, it led to the definition of stationary disks. So these are disks where minimum points are attained. So stationary disk is a function such that, okay, so here I need to explain something. So we have a convex domain D here, a smooth convex domain D, and this is an outer vector, a normal output. An outer vector, a normal outer vector. So phi of z ali sq and the boundary. And stationary disks are disks such that this, if we multiply this conjugate of this outer vector by a positive function, p and by zeta, then this extends to a holomorphic function on the whole disk. Okay, so phi here is a dual map. So, phi here is a dual map, it's called a dual map, it's defined on the whole disk, and it lands its values in Cn. Okay, so look, the convexity implies that this, what convexity implies that this Z minus phi of zeta, this is negative. Okay, so this means if we denote Zw, so this is a standard dot via duct, meaning that this is this, which is Z times conjugate W. So this means that this dot V adduct, here we have conjugate of this vector, the realist part of this is negative. So it changes nothing if we multiply this by a positive constant. Multiply this by a positive constant. Okay. And this in particular means that the winding number of this function, of this disk here, so we look at this. So this is analytic. So Z is fixed here. So the winding number of this curve here is equal to one. In particular, this equation here has one solution. And denoting this solution by f of z, we get a left inverse. Get a left inverse to f. We have a function for which the sub-year-moment definition of function C D is attained. Okay, so this shows that any such phi has left inverse and we are done. I'll show you Limpic shot here more. Okay, and then he showed that his argument is to show that the set of stationary disks is open and closed. So this is just a topological argument. However, to show that Logical argument. However, to show that it is closed, he used many deep, deep estimates that lie in potential theory. And to show that the set is open, he used implicit function theory, which in particular implies that this stationary disk depends somehow smoothly on points. Okay. Why I mentioned this? Because what we actually needed, what What we actually needed, what Lebanon needed is that the winding number of this curve is equal to zero. Actually, we use the fact that this curve landed here in this half plane. And much bigger is needed, as noted by Lampert, namely, this works if this finding is equal to zero. For example, this works for bounded CPC convex domains. So I will put a definition here. So, I will put a definition here. So, D is called C convex if D intersected with any line. So, L is a one-dimensional line. So, this intersection can be viewed as a subdomain of C, of the plane. So, if this is simply connected. So, one can think that one can say that domain is secret. Domain is C convex if intersection with n line is a disk in analytic sense. Because n is simply connected, it is biholomorphic with its conformally equivalent with the unit disk. And it is clear that convex domains are C-convex. However, he needed also to assume that they are smooth. This is quite important. Okay. The second idea of this. The second idea of this is due to Wong. Actually, this is due to Wong. He showed that his idea involved a famous duality principle, and he used just tools that, how to say, belong to function analysis. I mean, so D is convex, he considered it's Minkowski functional, and what he was interested in is. What he was interested in is to hi, I need to speed speed speed speed a bit up, so speed up a bit. So he was interested in this value. And in circle of duality, says that dealing with this value, one can go to a dual space. So dual space of the space is quite nice. Namely, one can see that using dual, one can find a measure. Using dual one can find a measure if we have a measure, maybe we are able to find a function, and okay. So, okay, anyway, this works just for convex domains. It cannot be generalized to C convex once, for example, in C convex domains. There are no Minkowski functionals. Okay, and the third idea is due to Agrai, and he also showed this for context domain. This is for contact domains. However, I attended once his lecture when he claimed that he believed that his idea is as general as possible. So a good question is if this works for C-convex case. In general, it is not known whether Lambert's equaling holds for C-convex domains. It is known only that it holds for smoothly bounded C-convex domains. Therefore, the answer to this question would follow. The answer to this question would fallow a much more difficult question that attracted attention of many people, not working in complex analysis, but working in geometry. The question is whether any C-convex domain can be exhausted by smoothly bounded C-convex domains, but this is far beyond the scope of the lecture. Okay, so what Lampert's again, what Lampert's theorem says that if this is minimal, then this is solvable even only if this is solvable. Again, if this. If this is solvable again, if this convex, if our smoothly or smooth C convex, similarly, if this is solvable, this problem is minimal and solvable, then that one is solvable. In other words, this says that if they are similar, if they are minimal, then there exists an interpolating function f and phi such that this is identity. And phi is called Phi is called, this is the famous Kubayashi geodesic, and this is called left inverse. Okay, and this holds for two points. Okay, so that was, but it took me too long. That was to two introduction. What the introduction, what I want to, what I wanted to say during my talk are During my talk, are the following. I wanted to say about converse to Lempert's theory, and that was that part is due to work carried out by Agder Young. I should also mention the name of Konstantin Postaya. Then I'd like to say something what happens for more points. So far, we considered just two points. Consider just two points. And it is a big surprise that Chlori Potential Fiori gave some motivation that allowed to extend this to more points. And finally, if I have time, but I see that it will not be the case, I'd like to say something about duality applied to, about this level's duality applied to Reality applied to extensions, to extension sets. So there's a famous list of open questions due to Feynman Siboni, and one of them is the following. That question was put by Abate. Whether there exists a domain for which the equality of these invariant functions cannot be deduced using just William Lempert's papers for convex domains. domains and for i think that for many years mathematicians believed that that that such domain such domain didn't exist and surprising is and young showed that the firm found such such such a domain and this is surprising because genesis of this of solution to this question was question was an was an engineering was in an engineering application namely namely Agni and Jang studied some particular question of mis synthesis so I will focus on a very particular question so here by by me I denote the so so so so so we consider So we consider a very special case of this missing task. And by omega, I denote the spectral ball. So this is the set of two by two matrices whose eigenvalues lie in the unit disk. And for sure, omega is unbounded, it's definitely non-convex, and definitely it's not homogeneous. It's automorphisms were studied by Janswick and White. And Agleri and McCarty were interested in interpolation here. So they studied, they wanted to study interpolation, two-point interpolation in the set omega. And what they showed is the following. So denote the eigenvalues of x by lambda 1 and lambda 2, and denote pi of x, and let pi of x be this map. So for sure, this pi is. So, for sure, this pi is a well-defined holomorphic map. And they consider this domain, G2. G2 is called, today it's called the symmetrized biodisk. So, this is the set of pi of x such that where x, where eigenvalues of x lie in the unit disk. And what they showed is the following: that studying interpolation here, okay, I think that they showed this. Okay, I think that they showed this for I okay, they showed this for endpoints. So this is not what I, you know, they showed more. They showed that studying interpolation in an omega is equivalent to studying interpolation in the domain G2. Okay, and why is it so important? Because G2 is a bounded domain. G2 is a bounded domain. Domain. G2 is a bounded domain, it's hyperbolic. And one can show that, okay, this is obvious that G2 can be experienced as Z plus W, Z W where Z and W are in the disk. So this justifies its name. And what they showed is that, okay, so it looks like the bi-disk, but it's definitely not the same object, namely it's still non-homogeneous. It's still non-homogeneous. It's okay, it's even non-convex. On the other hand, it's hyperbolic, it is star-like. And what Agler and Young showed is that this domain satisfies the assertion of Lempert's theorem, that invariant distances can be defined in a unique way on G2. In particular, any two points in the symmetrized biodiesel lie on some geodesic by. Sound Giordas, Kobarashi Giodes. Then it was shown by Konstantin. I think that at this time he was some students in Quebec City. He showed that G2 is not biholomorphic to a convex domain. Then I haven't mentioned this here, but then it was shown by Edigarian that using the same methods that G2 cannot be exhausted by domains by holomorphic to convex domains. To convex domains. So, this in particular means that the question to that the answer to Abati's question is negative. So, this is an example of a domain for which the assertion of Leopard's theorem cannot be deduced beyond his papers for convex domains. So, nevertheless, it turns out that symmetrized by disk is C-convex. Symmetrized by disk is C-convex. And it was shown a few years ago by Fluke and Zvonek that G2 can be exhausted by smoothly bounded C-convex domains, which is a bit disappointing because this means that equality of Lampert's file, that this equality here can be deduced on Lampert's paper. Yet the paper remotely. Then later, Abla Rukova, Young, White, and others studied more particular cases of misinthesis that add to other domains, like the Dania block, like the Penta block. It's still not known if they can be exhausted by steelly convex domains, but smooth convex domains, but they are C-convex. So which means that, okay. That's okay. Okay, so anyway, it's quite interesting that the answer to this question came from applications. And now I'd like to show how pluripotential Fourier motivated interpolation and how pluripotential Fourier had an impact on things such as von Neumann inequality. So, okay, so in a few minutes, I will just mention something that is far beyond the scope of this workshop. However, I'd like to show you some motivation. So, the G2 is a complex function with parts P1, Pn, and it is given as. Pulse P1 Pn, and it is given as a sublime of, okay, it's semi-stature, U should be perisapharmonic. So it's a sublime of US or U as a negative period harmonic functions with logarithmic pulse at p j such functions are often studied in potential field. There are many such functions like Chichak function and so on. And motivated by one-dimensional case, common introduced. Introduced the Lampert function. Okay, he was motivated by one-dimensional case and by Lampert's paper. So he defined Ldz with, so he defined the Lampert function Ld with poles at points P1 and Pn as in FIMO of such now of some of such numbers where in FIMO was taken over analytic disks. So this is the case for the So, this is the case for the unique disk that this function can be defined using just analytic disks. And it is simple to check that this function, that L D is bigger than G D. And if the L D is parisapharmonic, then L D belongs to this class. So, if L D is perisabharmonic, then these two functions are equal. And comments show that if for two poles, for two poles, two poles for two poles and d equal to okay so there is a mistake here and t equal to to the unit ball that this is indeed the case that l d is player subharmonic and motivated by this he conjectured that these two functions are equal and then the next obvious case was studied the case of the bi disk and it was studied extensively by pascal tomar and we are i think that pascal tomato And we have, I think that Pascal Tomas has a dozen of papers devoted to this question. And then in 2005, I think, Wigsteum made some computations that suggested that the answer should be positive. So his idea was simple. He defined a function C D as a sublimum of logarithms of Absolute value of f of z. And note that any such function is parisapharmonic, and where if because of the fact that f of pj vanishes, it has logarithmic pulse. So for sure, Cd is less or equal than Gd. And what Vixtram did is that he actually made some numerical computations and they suggested that they suggested that that this that we have equality here actually to perform these computations he used agler's paper agler's result on on interpolation so his idea was to okay and he showed that actually that this this in this case this this matrix is of special form and he made some numerical computations and this led him to suggestion that this should hold Suggestion that this should hold. Okay, and this is quite motivating because what does it mean that we have equalities of these two functions? So here, look, so here we have a function, the functions on the bi-disk with values in D. And here we have analytic disks, which means that we have a functions on D with values in the bi-disc. And deal with values in the biodisk. And what does the equality here mean? So it means that, okay, there always exists F for which maximum currents attain. However, here, it can happen that one of points lambda 2, lambda 1, or lambda 2 goes to the boundary of the unit disk. It cannot happen that both of them will go to one. So there are two cases. So, okay, so there are two cases. The first one is that there is analytic disk psi passing through points p1 and p2, such that psi of 0 is z, such that this f composed f of psi of 0 is equal to lambda 1, lambda 2, and then f of psi of lambda 1 is equal to psi of lambda 1 is equal to p 1, and f of p 1 is equal to 0. So this is 0. Okay. Okay, or it can happen that one of points, let's say lambda two, goes to the boundary. Then, after a permutation of q1 and p2, there exists an analytic disk passing through p1. So it should be here that c lambda one is equal to p1 and such that this equality here holds. So, what does it mean? This means that in the first case, this is a blush. case this is a blush a function of the at most two and this means that this is a this is a magus function okay so in this sense this means that these two groups so here we have this z goes to some alpha p1 goes to zero and p2 goes to zero and here you have that one zero goes to Okay, so we have this, and what he showed actually is that there exists phi passing through at least two nodes, analytic disk passing through at least two nodes, such that this is a Blaschke function of the E at most two. So it can be a matrix. So here again, so this suggests the duality. So this keeps a duality. So, this is this keeps a duality between these two interpolation parameters. So, here, but here we have these two values are equal. So, it is natural to ask what happens if these values are distinct. And it turns out that these two interpolation units are dual indeed in the following sense. So, this is what I call if f is minimal, then there is. If f is minimal, then there exists an analytic disk passing through these points or at least two of them, such that this composition is a Blaschke function, or if it passes just two of them, this may be smart. Okay, so this gives a duality and okay, so let me show you how this pluripotential stuff. Okay, so we started with pluripotential stuff and ended up with interpolation. So let me show you how. So let me show you how this works in the biodisk. The three-point interpolation problem in the biodisk was solved by Agri-McCarty. It's in one of chapters of the books. So here I consider this problem, but we can assume using automorphism that this is equal to zero and this is equal to zero. So let's assume that this is the case. So what does it so we have to see to so we have two possibilities. So phi passes your So, phi passes view just one node and this is degenerate, or it passes through two nodes, and this is this composition is a Blaschke reductor D. So, this is a reductor of lambda and the MAPISMA. So, okay, and five here we say generalized geodesic. Generalized geodesics were in the meantime defined by In the meantime, defined by Agli, Makova, and Young. They have a paper in one of London Mathematical Society's journals, I think. I think that that one was published in 2015 when they considered generalized geodesics. So anyway, using these ideas, using clear ideas, one can show that there are a few possibilities. Either this face of this form, so here we see that this picking. So here we see that this peak interpolation is one-dimensional because f can depend. If there exists a function that interpolates, one can find a function that interpolates and depends just only on one variable. It can happen that it is degenerate and if it is non-degenerate and not one-dimensional, then this is of this form. Of this form. And then there is a unique formula for F. So using this equation, one can show that there is a unique formula for F, and it is given by something like this, Z1, Tz1 plus 1 minus T Z2 plus a unimodular constant Z1Z2 over 1 minus TZ1 plus TZ2 plus eta or eta bar something like. Or eta bar, something like this. I think that Knies mentioned these functions during his talk. Okay, so using these ideas, one can find a formula for interpolating function. So this duality also holds for viewpoints in a high-dimensional polydisc. It also holds for the ball, which was expected due to Commons result. And it also shows. And it also should hold for homogeneous classical domains. And Knies applies these ideas when he showed that von-Neumann equality holds for special case. And it's hopeless to extend this to more points, namely, this duality doesn't hold. doesn't hold hold for four points already for it fails already for four points and this is a simple argument for this is that the common conjecture fails for more points even in the pi disc so and for the ball as well okay so i have just four minutes yes so maybe i will Maybe I will. Okay, I need to skip something. Aha, okay. So let me just mention that this duality and the real discs means that if a problem is equidimensional, non-degenerate, then it is of this form. Okay, so here delta must be in a convex combination of alpha, beta, and gamma. Okay, so one can see that there are two ways of finding. One can see that there are two ways of finding such f. So one can take a combination of here, a function that was used in the bi disk, one can use, and then take a combination of this point and the combination of this. So the function would be like that. Or one can start here. So one can start with this and then take a combination of this. Then take a combination of this point and that. So there are at least three ways of defining such functions. And using this idea, Machasek showed that, computed the uniqueness variety for three-point non-judenary two-dimensional problem. And he showed that up to of the morphism of the poly disc, it is isomorphic with this set. So this nice set. And okay, so this is the last thing that I will talk about. So, look that this set can be written in this way. So, this is x, y, k of x, y, where x, y lie belong to a domain D. So, here d is a domain, and d is given in this way. And it can be shown that d is a lampered domain, however, d is not c convex. And that good question that is if it is. If it is bi-homorphic with a C-convex domain, actually, I have no idea. Okay, so maybe I think that I will not talk anything about extension VRT, so maybe it's a good point to stop here. Thank you very much for an interesting talk. Are there any questions or comments?
