Thank you to the organizers. So, this will sort of be in spirit a quite different kind of a talk. And this will, in the world of this talk, everything is good. And by everything is good, I mean manifolds are finite-dimensional and smooth, and stochastic processes are continuous and all of that. So, it's sort of a rather simple case. So, I'll be talking about symmetry and reduction for SDEs, and I'll start. SDEs. And I'll start by sort of connecting stochastic processes to second-order differential geometry. And this is something that allows us to sort of think of stochastic processes in a very deterministic way. Then I will talk about stochastic differential equations on manifolds. I'll be sort of, in both of these sections, I'll be kind of very hand-wavy in a certain sense to save time. Then I'll talk about the reduction of Stretanovich operators. The Stretanovich operators are sort of the natural analog you have for. Sort of the natural analog you have for ordinary differential equations. And this was something that was done by Jonathan Lazaro Kami and Jon Pablo Ortega. This was done around 2007. And finally, I'll talk about something I'm working on at present, which is production of Schwarz operators. So Schwartz operators are sort of the second-order analog of Stratonovich operators, as we'll see, and they're kind of very general objects to determine STEs on manifolds. On manifolds. So, stochastic processes are collections of time-index random variables, and what you can do with them is you can take one stochastic process, sufficiently well-behaved, and integrate it with respect to another stochastic process. And in this context, semi-martangles serve as both integrants and integrators. Now, two commonly used notions of stochastic integrations are the E2 and Stochastic integrations are the E2 and the Stratonovich integral, but they're sort of different in some ways. So, on the analytic side, the E2 integral has an associated dominated convergence theorem. On the probabilistic side, the E2 integral does not look into the future of a process. But, where the Stratolovich integral really shines is the change of variables formula. And that is why it's very useful to do differential geometry with these guys. On the other hand, if you sort of rewrite the Ito change of variables formula, you might notice that this guy looks awfully similar to a second-order tangent vector. And this is characterized independent of coordinates. And so, the basic principle that lets us connect stochastic processes with second-order differential geometry is this observation that Observation that this guy should behave like a second-order tangent vector. So, second-order differential geometry. Take a differential operator of order less or equal to 2 and no constant term. That will be called a second-order tangent vector. And then you can sort of, very analogous to the first order case, you can define tangent and cotangent bundles, vector fields and one forms, and the push-forwards and pullbacks of math. And now, what you might think of is, well, I. Think of is well, I have my usual one-forms in first order, I can integrate it along oriented curves. What about second-order one-forms? Now, you can integrate these along semi-martiga's. And so we have a stochastic integral, which is the integration of a second-order one form along a stochastic process. I won't bother defining this. But the important part here is that on a manifold, you can define stratovox. On a manifold, you can define Stratonovich and Ito integrals as sort of special cases of the Stochastic integral. And you get these special cases by considering certain classes of second-order one-forms which are derived from usual one-forms. Then basically for all intents and purposes, we can think of a Stratanovich integral, I'll not talk about the eta one, you can think of the Stratanovich integral as the integral of a one-form. Now this pairing notation really helps. Now this pairing notation really helps because you can think of this dx and this del x's as sort of second order and first order tangent vectors respectively. Alright, let's get to SEs on manifolds. So we have a vector field on a manifold. We want to stochastically perturb it. And you can do this by sort of first of all doing something that you do sort of when first year students get introduced to ODEs. So take DT to the other side, pretend it's a fraction. With subfraction, but we want to add noise on the right-hand side. So, we want to add noise on the tangent bundle. Now, in most cases, noise is known only on Rn. So, an example is you have sort of n independent Brownian motions. And so, you can take a Brownian motion on Rn, but then you need a prescription that takes this Brownian motion on Rn and sends it to some noise on the tangent bundle. And to do that, we assume that there are sort of n vector fields on M, and then you can. M, and then you can symbolically add noise by using these vector fields. But this is still stochastic, and I can't do differential geometry with it. So what I want to do is rewrite this equation. Now, the only thing I want you to notice is that you have a family of linear maps between tangent spaces. Well, the important part is this is entirely deterministic. Entirely deterministic. X is something that's known, X is a known noise, so you don't have to worry about X at all. The ST is then completely determined by this family of linear deterministic maps, which means that you have boiled your STE down to studying these maps. And in fact, these maps represent ODEs, but I won't go much into it. And a stratonomy chopper is sort of a slight generalization of this, where you have Rn plus 1 in the previous case replaced by some. Previous case, replaced by some manifold. So that's the first order picture. What is the second-order picture? The second order picture, of course, replaces tangent spaces by second-order tangent spaces. And you have some linear maps which kind of arises as push-forwards. And it's not as particular as it might seem. But anyway, I won't go much into that to save time. A Schwartz operator is a smoothly varying. A Schwartz operator is a smoothly pairing family of these linear maps. Alright. So, and corresponding to this Schwartz operator, you can define a general stochastic differential equation on a manifold. Great. So, we have a first-order picture, we have a second-order picture. What connects these two? What connects these two is the Stratonovich transfer principle. This tells you that corresponding to every first-order picture, every Stratonovich operator, there exists a unique Schwartz. There exists a unique Schwartz operator that represents it. But the more interesting part of this is this is entirely deterministic. You can connect this return over which to the Schwartz in a completely deterministic way, which is really good. But anyway, let's move on to reduction of Stratonovich operators. So I'll only focus on, so you have a Stratonovich operator between n and n, n is the manifold on which you have a known noise. Which you have a known noise. M is your manifold in which dynamics occur. So, for all intents and purposes, the manifold we are interested in is M, not M. Right, you can define symmetries, and you can actually show that symmetries conserve solutions. That's fine, and then you can do a reduction. So, if you have a Lie group, well, if the Lie group has a free action, then you can actually have a regular potion manifold M mod G. quotient manifold M mod G. If you do not have a free action, well the next best way you can get a quotient manifold is take the normalizer of an isotropy and quotient it out by the isotropy. And you define something called an isotropic type submanifold and then you can show that Li has a free and proper action on Mi. So this is a good reference for this is the book by Juan Pablo Ortega and Teodor Ratio. But anyway. But anyway, the bottom line of all of this is you can define a reduced return of which operator on the quotient. Well, when I read all of this part, I have two questions. Well, we did the first order part. Good. There is a corresponding second order part. What about symmetries of the corresponding second order part? Number two. Well, the transfer principle gives you two Schwarz operators. One on the base. So one second order picture is there in the base. One second order picture is there on the. Place, one second-order picture is there on the quotient. Can you do a reduction for the second-order Schwartz case then? And that answer, as we'll see to both of them, is yes. Reduction of Schwartz operators, this is something I'm presently working on. So again, you have some Schwarz operator. You can define symmetries. The only change over here is in the previous case, you have a push-forward between tangent spaces. Now you have a push-forward between second-order tangent spaces. And you can sort of And you can sort of easily prove that if you have a Stretonovich operator, then if you take the corresponding Schwartz operator, then it's symmetric. Now, you can show that the isotropy-type sub-manifolds in the Schwartz case are invariant sub-manifolds. Now, I didn't really define invariant sub-manifolds in the case of stochastic differential equations, but you can think of them pretty much the same way as you would think in ODEs. The corresponding case holds for the Stratonovich operators. For the Schwarz operators, and for the Stratonovich operators, what you do is you take a first-order analog of this lemma. And for the second order case, I wanted to prove... So this lemma basically characterizes tangent spaces of isotopic type submanifolds. And I couldn't find a reference to this lemma anywhere over the internet for the second-order case. So this is something. For the second order case, so this is something we actually had to prove. But I won't go into the proof of this, but if you prove this, then you can pretty much very easily show that Schwartz operators can be reduced. And once you get a reduction for Schwartz operators, you can sort of have a transfer principle for reduction where you have a Stratonovich operator, you reduce it, you take the corresponding Schwarz operator, and it reduces to the corresponding Schwarz operator for the reduced Stratonovich operator. Reduced, Stratonovich operator. Now, one thing, once you get reduction, of course, you would like to talk about reconstruction. So, for the Stratonovich case, the reconstruction is done. For the Schwartz case, this is something I'm working on at present. But I'm very hopeful this can be done because there's some notion of second-order connections and existence of horizontal lifts of second-order of stochastic processes. So, I'm hopeful that these can be used in reconstruction. Can be used in reconstructing solutions. So I'll just mention a couple of references. Michelle Lemeris' book and Paul Andrew Meyer's papers are really good references for studying this connection between stochastic processes and second-order differential geometry. And Lazar Pami Ortega's paper is the one where they discuss reduction of Stratorovich operators with a lot of applications to Hamiltonian. It is with a lot of applications to Hamiltonian systems. And that's my talk. Question? Yeah. Can we give you a super example of the condition? Oh, possibly. I mean, that's probably the like you can have. So, Lazaro Kam and Ortega actually defined Hamiltonian systems in general, stochastic Hamiltonian systems. The basic Hamiltonian systems. The basic idea behind that is you have some known Hamiltonian H and then you have a bunch of Lois Hamiltonians. And then to each of them you can assign your vector fields. Okay? And then by a sort of process I mentioned before, you can consider a Stratonovic equation corresponding to this. By exactly By exactly the con the sort of idea I mentioned before. So you pick something like XH dp plus XH1 del. Let's take arbitrary semi-arting rules or Brownian motions. You can sort of have a perturbation, stochastic perturbation of your system, and then you And then you can do this for any Poisson manifold. Okay? Okay, but it was just a question as a super stupid question. I just wanted to complete example of reduction, yeah. I'm just coming to it. Because you can do it for a Poisson or symplectic manifold, you can do it for a T star G of a Lie group. And you can take a Lie Poisson reduction. And it gives you, if these things are symmetric, you can actually get something in the quotient. Something in the quotient. That's actually where they apply all of this formalism to Hamiltonian mechanics. One more question, okay? So, what does reconstruction mean here in this case? Reconstruction means exactly the same thing that you would have in, let's say, symplectic reduction or something. You have a solution in your quotient, you want to lift it to a solution on your manifold. And I mean, so in terms of the randomness, for instance, Randomness, for instance. So you just increase it to the degree of randomness. So, how do you, what's what's the point is that the point is this, that you, when you, the point about doing Stratonovich operators is that you want to sort of forget about your randomness and think of something that's completely deterministic. Right? And that's something I find really interesting and really helpful about all of this, that you can forget about your randomness. The reason you can forget about your randomness in some senses. About your randomness in some senses is because the noise x, so if I write it in terms of a stratonomic case, this looks like something like this. This noise is known. So everything boils down to studying this family of linear maps. And this really behaves a lot like ODEs. And that's actually the spirit in which it's done. There is something known as the Malia. Known as the Maliya-Lana transfer principle. So that tells you that pretty much what you can do with ODs, you can do with stratolomous operators. It's a meta theorem, there's no official roof of it, but yes. Okay, well, right, you get the background.
