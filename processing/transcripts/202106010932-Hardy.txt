Let me double-check, yes, and then I have and I'm missing Marius. Is Marius is Marius here? Is Marius is Marius here? No, I don't see him at least. Is he in Gavatown? I can see that Julio is talking to someone. I am back and disabled, so what? Presumably also also Robbie's back. But no, Marius is also not in Gather Town. Okay, I guess we can start and then if he shows up, we can just add him. Okay, okay. Okay, great. It would be nice to have him here. No. Okay, let's get started. Okay, so to start with, can So to start with, can I just ask each of you to sort of give the sort of big picture for your research and for the field where you think it's going and what the challenges are, what the big challenges are. So let's start with Esteban. Hi, so the big picture is I think quantum reference frames offer the opportunity to Am I muted? No, I'm okay. Can you hear me? Yes. Can you hear me? Yes. We can hear you, yes. Okay. So they offered the opportunity to perhaps understand a more general notion of symmetry or covariance of the laws of physics, in which the reference frame is quantum. And I think this is where I would say not very close yet, but we have made some progress. We have made some progress. And as a next step, I think we have made progress in understanding, like having superpositions of these very large, say, gyroscopes or very large reference frames. But yet, I think some aspect that we will have to focus on is to understand the problem of resources. What if the spin is not infinitely large? And this is not only for practical purposes. Uh, practical purposes is for fundamental purposes. What if I consider, say, not a situation in which I have like a cat state, the superposition of two semi-classical things, but rather I consider the fluctuations itself of the reference frame. So, I think this is an important open question. It's not very easy, but yeah. I have to unmute. Okay, Marcus, maybe could you say what you think are the big picture? What's the big picture? What are the big challenges? So for quantum reference frame, I can only really say what I personally want to look at, what I find interesting. So, I mean, in general, I find interesting a lot of the research program that is fun by people. A lot of the research program that is fun by people here, like looking at gravity in the context of quantum reference frames, taking it seriously that a clock is also part of the quantum state of the universe and so on. So I find this really fascinating. I personally would want to address this in a way that is perhaps a bit more axiomatic. So something I find interesting is what if we forget that we have quantum theory, we have say an operational theory. We have, say, an operational theory, and we want to make sense of the question of formulating a relational theory that carries group representations or so. This I find interesting because what brought me personally to quantum reference frames is the fascination, certainly, with Luke quantum gravity and other approaches, where people start often with just the Hamiltonian constraint, which is something like the Page-Weoters formalism. And I would find it interesting to analyze. And I would find it interesting to analyze: is that really the most general possibility? Or are we overlooking something by focusing on that particular picture? Or how can we axiomatically approach a description of that form? So that's what drives basically what I'm interested in at the moment. But yeah, there are many other questions that one can address here that I do find very interesting. But yeah, maybe I stop here. Thanks, Marcus. Thanks, Marcus. And Anjan, what are the big picture issues and the big challenges in the field? That's a very tough question. I mean, there are so many challenges. Well, I feel that what is needed is really a formalism which is general enough, powerful enough, that allows us to think about space. Think about space-time in the continuum, in a way, or at least maybe continuum is not relevant in quantum gravity, but I feel that here we have this kind of piece model frameworks, discrete, allow us to think about various situations. But I feel that something that is missing is like a powerful framework where you can, in a time-neutral fashion, treat. Treat quantum physics with indefinite causal structure, but you know, where you could formulate first principles of framework, where you would be able to formulate first principles, theories of dynamics, like motivated by Lagrangian symmetries and so forth. So, in relation to what I spoke, I mean, what I talked about is quite a minor step where I'm trying to just at least understand. I'm trying to just at least understand what are the different ways of re-describing these transformations that allow us to move between these different type discrete structures that we normally talk about, like circuits, process matrices, and the like. And I think that there is at least one small, let's say, potentially useful step: is this realization that it's really like a change of basis. Most of these different descriptions are. Most of these different descriptions are related to something like a unitary change of basis. Of course, we're still lacking, even for what I spoke about at this discrete level, there is no beautiful formalism, nothing simple and intuitive. I think that these approaches based on the page voters formalism, which are applicable in different kinds of contexts, are nicer in this way. At least to me, they are more intuitive than the discrete thing I described. Than the discrete thing I described. But the discrete thing I described is quite general. So I feel that it's a step in this direction, but ultimately I feel that we need kind of a powerful formalism where one can discuss dynamics. Okay, thanks. And Christos, sorry, Marius, it's good that you're here. Yeah, so can you? Yeah, so can you ask everyone else to give the sort of what they think is the big picture and the big challenges in the field as they see it? So could you do that? Thanks. Yes, so I don't think I have the expertise to say what the big questions in particular in the field in which the other speakers are experts. I'm trying to learn. I'm now with Jaslav at Vienna. I find all these things very interesting. At Vienna. I find all these things very interesting. Somehow, the big aspiration a couple of years ago when we started the Keys collaboration, which many people are here a part of in one way or another, is to somehow materialize this idea on which perimeter institute was also based on to put the information theoretic basis in quantum gravity. How to say, I think we need some simple application, maybe can be even a tankian experiment. My perspective is that's how I work, though, that's how I function in my head. That I want to have a concrete somehow physics that we explain, however, redundant and unnecessary it may be. And my hope was that. It may be. And my hope was that we would describe these experimental proposals by Succato and other people about gravity-mitted entanglement with Lukan gravity, even if it's not necessary to do that. Why? Because there is an opportunity there, which is what? Lukan gravity often people grapple with ideas that are in the far quantum gravity regime, the deep because the non-profit. Resume the deep because a non-perturbative approach, so you don't have space, you don't have time, you just rely on abstract concepts and rules. But now, phenomenology, this new low energy phenomenology, it's exactly in the low energy. So this is first of all something that's conceptually easier to visualize, having superpositional microscopic geometries. Second, it's coming from the quantum information community. Coming from the quantum information community, the ideas, and it's not completely evident how you use these theories like Luke and gravity to actually describe such low energy physics. There's also the issue of how to get, in fact, this continuum limit, if you want, the low energy limit. So, this is open on all sides, and what I What I think is still missing is a clear, somehow, signal that look, here, these people are doing quantum reference training, I think, of all these ideas. And there's many frameworks. Here, we take this, we put it into quantum gravity or the output we just meet. And with this, we can actually describe physics in the low energy limit, that there is a cross-versatization that is somehow concrete. Cross-versalization that is somehow concrete, it helps us understand physics where space-time is quantum, but it's quantum in a simple enough sense, that is quantum superposition of macroscopic geometries, that we actually know what we're talking about. That is how I see the next step. Thanks, Maris. So, if we have questions, and I see a few people are running. A few people have raised their hands. So let's start with Gavin. Go ahead. Yeah, hi. Marius, that was interesting just to hear you say that you were thinking about how loop quantum gravity would describe this experiment where mass can be entangled by gravity. Could you just say more about that? You know, like how would, you know, would know like how would you know would would would quantum gravity look different to other other ideas for quantum gravity in that in that experiment so i mean i haven't done it this is something that we would like to do but uh how would you do that in the loop kind of gravity you have a state space that is defined with graphs essentially you don't have a handle on the projective limit but you get the continuum Projective limit, but you get the continuum. You have graphs, right? And you build states on graphs, the Hilbert space, the composes in Hilbert spaces that are defined on a graph. Do you need to superpose different graphs? No, not really, but they're going to be different in the sense that I was talking about. It's going to be the same graph, but it's going to be with different names. So, how are you actually going? Let me put it this way. Somehow, if you have a graph. Somehow, if you have a graph, you can say a story in loop kind of gravity where you say I have semi-classical state and so on. I'm not sure about the Hamiltonian constraint, but if I assume that it's going to be projected right and say a whole story about having a state that is describing a space-time geometry, at least at the fixed time, the intrinsic geometry and the extrinsic geometry. Now, how do I put two of these? Well, actually. This, well, actually, this is not done in the theory. We never deal with things like that. My feeling is that you would need to do something like what I said in the talk, that's the motivation behind it, that the rest of the story you sort of have it or you don't, but those are not the kind of technical problems you really have to solve to describe this. You have to understand how you propose graphs. Graphs, even the same graphs, just by using names. I don't know how you would do it in string theory, if that's what you're asking about. Other approaches, I don't know how you would do it because I said I'm not an expert in that. Okay, so that moves us easily on to Faye. The next question from Faye. This is a question for you all, I think. You all, I think. So, and I suppose the key words here that I've heard a lot are quantum reference frames and the idea that they are, that a reference frame is a physical system, physical systems are quantum, therefore quantum reference frame. So, and then and then the going on from that, people have said, well, understanding this is going to be important in quantum gravity. Be important in quantum gravity. So, there, I just want to draw the distinction, not in quantum gravity as such, but in just classical gravity between diffeomorphism invariance or general covariance. So, general covariance takes the form of diffeomorphism invariance in classical gravity and Lorentz invariance and physical symmetries in general. So, diffeomorphism invariance. Dipiomorphism invariance is a gauge invariance. It's not a physical symmetry, and you can think of it more as a degeneracy in the mathematical description of the theory. There are different mathematical ways to describe exactly the same physical state. So, there's in some sense nothing physical at all about a diffeomorphism transformation. Some transformation. But of course, the Lorentz symmetry is different. That's a genuine symmetry. In GR, of course, it's only approximate, but it is a genuine symmetry that exists in our world. So if you boost a system with respect to the rest of the universe, defined by the fixed stars, say, then the physical description in that boosted system will be the same approximately because it's. Approximately, because it's there is curvature, but approximately will be the same. So, I so the question is: sorry, rambling question. If this work on quantum reference frames is to be useful in quantum gravity, and given that distinction between gauge theory, gauge symmetry, gauge, I don't like to use the word symmetry, the gauge invariance, diffimorphism, and physical symmetry, i.e., Lorentz invariance. Lorentz and where which which one of those, if any, does this work on quantum reference frames pertain to? That's my question. Thank you. Should I briefly begin and then take a look so go ahead, Marcus? I'm not sure. I'm not an expert on quantum gravity, but the way I understand it is that it would hopefully cover both. Is that it would hopefully cover both. So, when I think about gauge symmetries, I typically do not want to think about gauge symmetries of the whole universe, like a global diffeomorphism, but rather, say, some electromagnetism or so, where you say I pick out a sub-region and I do a gauge transformation in the sub-region. This doesn't make any physical difference for the sub-region, but there's a way in which it changes the relation to the region around it. To the region around it. So, this at least that's how I would take, for example, an essay for Carlo Rovelli who wrote about this. So, in the approach that I've looked at, you could see this as gauge symmetries. So, the way I talked about it today was to say, I declare this as a physical symmetry that's completely where state and a transformed state are completely physically indistinguishable. So, that would fall into the gauge symmetry regime. The gauge symmetry regime, but I don't see any reason. I mean, even in that reason, you make up a quantum information theory picture by imagining a potential reference frame outside, which allows you to use the quantum information framework to reason about the situation. Now, when you say Lorentz symmetry, I take it that you also mean situations where you say you have a laboratory and you boost the laboratory relative to another laboratory or so. So, at least the way I think about it, but maybe you can clarify that whether that fits the question or not, would be situations where there's a subsystem which is subject to a transformation, but I can at least imagine a hypothetical system that would be outside of it that would serve as a reference frame, which allows me at least to define the transformation in the first place. Okay, does anyone else want to address this very interesting question? I wonder if Fay has something to respond here. I similarly think that, yes, it is exactly. I would agree here with something that Marcos said at the end. We can think about symmetries or gauge symmetries in the language of lacking or not lacking a reference frame. Reference frame. I think this is a very kind of useful, instructive way of thinking. Let's say the laws of gravity, they are diffeomorphism invariant, but they also hold if I choose the Earth or the stars as a reference frame and describe a subsystem relative to them, I believe the Einstein equations would still hold, plus, there will be extra constraints. So it's just that in the absolute field theory, there are no this. Field theory, there are no this extra constraint. How this could study quantum reference frames could possibly help us in quantum gravity, that I personally don't have an answer. It is for me, it's curiosity. We also have discussed a lot with Esteban that it could unfortunately turn out that perhaps everything that you can find out by Uti. Everything that you can find out, but ultimately, let's say you develop a theory of quantum reference frame transformations, which is something like a generalization of the type of classical transformations you consider, and you demand covariance with respect to it, or invariance, and then you find out that the same you could have achieved by just demanding the classical notion. That is a possibility which would be unfortunate, but I feel that there is a lot to learn myself. So just a small comment that at least in the framework that I presented, there is the possibility of taking this reference frame transformations in both ways. There is a sector of the, say, Hilbert's. A sector of the say Hilbert space, which is not accessible to Alice. And then all the transformations there can be considered a sort of gauge. I don't know if gauge in the strict sense in which people would use it, but these transformations can be more general than the usual translation group, rotation group, etc. And then in another sector, you can consider actually the relative degrees of freedom between the systems. Freedom between the systems. And these, you're allowed to do transformations that are apparently more general than the transformations you would allow if your reference frame were a classical system. So this doesn't answer the question, of course, but I think by abstracting this, by understanding the structure of these transformations and abstracting away, I think one can find, one can ask the question whether the full notion of symmetry can be. The full notion of symmetry can be generalized to these quantum reference frames. And Marios, do you have anything on this? I mean, I can quickly add that the fact that what you see here is that we don't know what is the correspondence, and I think that's what should be answered. In particular, these quantum reference frames, are they really? These quantum reference frames, are they related to diffeomorphisms? Are they only doing diffeomorphisms separately on each branch? Or are they something more? It seems to me it's more than that. And I think that's the whole point. Okay. So let's move on to... Can I just have a quick comment? Okay, please go ahead. So, thank you very much for those answers. That was quite illuminating. I think. I think it is a good question to ask whether what you're doing is relevant to either diffeomorphism. I mean, you're thinking of it in terms of diffeomorphism invariance, or you're thinking of it in terms of physical symmetry. So as a sort of slogan, I would say anything physical is not gauge. So by definition, right? So a gauge transformation doesn't touch the physics, doesn't it? Doesn't it if you're doing something physical with some physical systems and talking about physics, then you're not that's nothing to do with gauge symmetry, gauge invariance. Sorry. I think we're one problem that we have, you know, the whole history of, we're bearing the weight of the whole history of 20th century physics in which what people should call gauge invariance has been always called gauge symmetry. So, you know, symmetry is principle, blah, blah, blah. Symmetry is the principle, blah, blah, blah. And it's very difficult to rest one's mind away from that just because that term is used all the time, gauge symmetry goes, but it's not a physical symmetry. It's a degeneracy in the mathematical description. And so anytime you're talking about physics, physical systems, I think that you're not, you can't be talking about diffeomorphism and variance, anything that's going to tell us anything about diffeomorphism and variance. Okay. So I mean, maybe I. So, maybe I can slightly abuse my position as chair. So, my own research is very much in accord with what you're saying, Faye. I sort of set up a paper talking about quantum coordinate systems rather than quantum reference frames. And those are meant to be sort of have the same on this footing as coordinate systems in general relativity. They don't pertain to a particular physical system as such. And then you can define quantum diffeomorphisms in terms of those. In terms of those, but it's a program that's inspired by the quantum reference frame program. Anyway, I'll send you the link perhaps to that paper. So let's move on to the next question. So Chaslov, please. Maybe just before I pose this question, I find it like a previous phase question is really very, very relevant. And somehow there is a lot of things to be done. A lot of things to be done, but there is also kind of a pressure from the immediate experimental efforts where people right now try to make superposition of a mass at two different positions. Now, these different positions obviously related to some translations. And so now, maybe one would say, well, that's just diffromorphisms, so there cannot be any observable differences. But the thing is, what actually Marcus Is what actually Marcus in his statement made is that we don't move the laboratory, we don't move the walls of the laboratory. So, this superposition is made with respect to the wall of the laboratories that are somehow fixed. And that's why we should not understand this as a full deep form of reason. But I think these situations can be addressed by quantum reference frames, and hopefully, they are also relevant for some domain of. Or some domain of quantum gravity, at least from the experimental point of view. Now, my question is rather kind of, I would like to be somewhat negative about our efforts. So Esteban mentioned these two things that seems to be kind of very important. And one is maybe with the quantum reference frames, we end up with some larger group of symmetries for our dynamical laws. Maybe we can see. Maybe we can see that they are kind of they have this larger symmetry. Maybe this we can even observe at some point. Now, what I have a problem with the whole project in a sense is that at the end, even when we talk about quantum reference frames, and even if we assume that maybe we can extend this to some finite reference frame where maybe the clocks will not be. Where maybe the clocks will not have an infinite dimension and infinite resources, but rather fineness, and maybe we define the evolution with respect to these finite clocks. All at the end can be seen yet from ordinary reference frames in which we as an observer stand and can reinterpret. So, even if I try to attempt, I think we hear some typing, someone. Typing, someone's microphone is on. So, even if yes, we try to define, for example, dynamics with respect to some finite clocks, and this will maybe look very different dynamics than the one that we encounter right now. The fact that these finite clocks can be rewritten in the evolution of some kind of a background time, let's say, that we experience. Does it somehow feel? Somehow, I have a feeling that this could be a criticism, like, oh, yeah, but after all, we can reimpretate everything in our reference frame, the one which we use here in laboratories. And so what's the biggest and fundamental kind of novelty of this? Would you like to comment on that? Yeah, I think this is a big challenge because at the end. At the end of the day, you will measure in a big laboratory that you will build with your hands. So, in that sense, it might, as you say, trivialize the whole thing in some sense. However, I don't know. When you propose an experiment, you have to assign a meaning to what you say you're measuring. You have to say, okay, these are the concepts that I'm testing. Say, okay, these are the concepts that I'm testing. And I think we are at the stage of developing the concepts. So, even if we, in the end, say, okay, we're going to measure something macroscopic with what we mean by ordinary space and so on, we have such an understanding that within our framework, it makes sense what we are measuring, even if its description is macroscopic. Is macroscopic. And it makes sense in a way that it wouldn't make sense if you wouldn't take this approach. Of course, this is very challenging, but I think this is something we should aim for. Can I also answer the Chaslav quickly? Yes, please. I think this is the question to everybody who wants to. Okay, so let me first say something positive and then maybe something negative along your lines. So positive, I mean, in the. I mean, in the weakest case, I mean, you can definitely make a case that quantum reference frame transformations are unitaries on your Hilbert space, canonical ones, kind of natural ones that are interesting, and that may simplify some of your calculations. This may be just useful sometimes, and you've shown it in a paper, for example, where you can use it to jump into the operator algebra that describes the frame of reference, the rest frame of, say, a spin one-half particle. You can say, well, this is a very nice kind. You can say, well, this is a very nice calculational trick. I can also attach some interpretation to it, and it's really useful. On the negative side, you could also add another, you know, another thing to it when you say the main motivation that you say we all live in this big quantum world and I have to take it seriously is that the reference frame is just part of my huge quantum system. What if you take, say, a Bayesian approach to quantum theory and say quantum states are nothing but a catalogue of probabilities for some observer? Catalogue of probabilities for some observer. And then you would naturally always take the perspective of some outside observer that goes a bit about along the lines what you said. They can just stand side by side to the experiment and place their bets. So maybe there's a positive and negative to both, and I wouldn't know how to phrase it finally. Okay. I just want to, I was very happy that Chelsea passed. I was very happy that Chaslaf asked this because I felt like I forgot to mention when you asked about what I say are one of the important questions. Is that actually I think it's an important question to properly understand the difference between the gravitational switch and other switches. Because mathematically, of course, they are equivalent. We can do all these transformations, let's say, subsystems or something else. But there is something about the gravitational switch. But there is something about the gravitational switch, which is different than we know it, because it has to do with inertial frames in the laboratory, Sephalis, and Bob. But I feel that this question, I feel that there is something more to say about that. It's not just, okay, these are inertial and the other are not inertial or whatever. I feel that there is something special about the gravitational switch where one can express a property about it. Could, it's a hypothesis, I don't know, I really don't. It's a hypothesis. I don't know. I really don't have a solution to it. But I think that there might be something to say that it does not imagine that it does not admit this external observer description in a certain sense. There could be a good sense, this deratum of some kind that actually shows that this is a genuinely different type of effect from a physical perspective than. Then the other time the localized realizations in the usual laboratory. Okay. Lucien, can I? Yeah, please. Sorry, you haven't asked. Go ahead. So I think it's important what Cheslav is asking, and what's the point of all this. The point of all this. From my perspective, when I came to this community and started talking to you during loop quantum gravity, I can see both points of view. Somebody that only does loop quantum gravity would say, wait a minute, we have all this theory with all this stuff. These are very simple regime that you're talking about, which is applicable. It's low energy, for instance. Yes, but let's not forget that we have exactly zero experimental evidence. We have exactly zero experimental evidence for quantum gravity, and we shouldn't bring our convictions of what we think is going on. So, let's go back to a century ago. It was really step by step that we were throwing out elements of reality because you need experimental evidence. You just see the spectrum of blackboard radiation, then you see the Foglectric effect, and you say, Okay, wait a minute, there is quantization of energy and so on until you get. And so on, and until you get through quantum field theory and start using other things. So, I think the point of what Onyan is saying about the graph density is important. For instance, take the notion of an event defined as space-time coincidence. This has survived. It has survived the quantum theory in reality. It's still there. Nobody has shown experimentally that I cannot define even approximately with quantum uncertainty. With quantum uncertainty in some space-time vicinity, that there is an event there while seeing the gravitational quantum switch being realized would tell you that, no, in fact, you cannot. It might be a superposition of events, or it might be actually an event that is happening, and this depends on your reference frame. So, you would lose the notion of event. That would be a big thing, I think, for actually having an experience. For actually having experimental evidence for that. And the question now is: you have a Gitankin experiment there, completely unfeasible. I think several times, I don't remember estimation I did, 10 to the 5th time of the universe or so. Can we think of one that we can actually do? It's simple steps, but they are also monumental, right, for science to be able to say, I have an experiment that says forget about the. Experiment that says forget about the notion of event. If you ask anybody to quantify, they will tell you, yeah, but I don't believe it anyway. Yeah, but it's not only about us, it's you have to convince everybody about it. Would you say that the notion of event breaks down or that it changes to some sort of if you select gravitational quantum switch, I think you just have to accept that there is. That there is no that one observer might see an event and another might see a superposition of events in time-like separation, and you cannot distinguish between the two. Physically, they're equivalent. Yes. Why do you use plural superposition of events? It's still one event, but it's superposition of location. So, like, yes, yes. Or, like, yes, yes, yes, that's what I mean. It's still one event, but it's in a superposition of locations. But this is what I meant when I said that we're developing the concept, like this concept of event, for example, I think is a very important one. And I think quantum reference frames can offer clues as to what we would mean by an event in such a situation in which I put a mass in a superposition. Perhaps it's not just the point on a manifold. Perhaps it's not just the point on a manifold, but rather something that can look from some perspective at two points in time, but for another one as localized in time, for example. So, this is a different kind of aspect and is the type of things that I think we should focus on understanding. Okay, so we still have lots of questions, which is great. We're running a bit low on time. Running a bit low on time. I think I'm going to go out of the order in which the questions were raised just to give people haven't spoken so far a chance. So Magdalena, can you ask your question? Thanks, actually. Great, because I actually wanted to just add a few points to the last discussion about switch events and so on, because they're essentially what happens, I think, is exactly true. What happens, I think, is it exactly stresses that even though we directly want to focus on understanding how events be generalized or maybe how they lose the usual meaning, we still think in old terms, like when we say, oh, there's a superposition of events. I would say it's a good exercise in the context of this field to distinguish two things, events and coordinates that you use. Events and coordinates that you use to describe the events. And what happens in the gravitational quantum switch is exactly that, depending which coordinates you use, you will ascribe single space-time coordinate to an event and say, and then from our perspective, you would conclude, okay, well, there is a single event with coordinates as such. Well, when you put the mass in superposition and you choose a path. Position, and you choose a particular observer, you would say that there is a single event, but whose coordinates have some kind of quantity property. In a sense, you would ascribe a superposition of different coordinates, but still to a single event. And I think that's helpful because that's also actually probably useful for understanding how to relate quantum. How to relate quantum reference frames with the switch and how to map the idea of relativity of subsystems and tensor products to this case where you exactly see how different regions, I mean, how regions of space-time defined by an event might be across the localized subsystems or rather a localized subsystem, depending whether you use. Whether you use, I mean, which coordinates you use, and if you start to use coordinates that are not related by some classical transformations, but those more general transformations, then you'll find situations where you'll have events with non-classical coordinates, which doesn't necessarily mean that you lose the notion of an event. There is still a single event that is operationally defined by some physical system. But the relation between this event But the relation between this event and coordinate that you use to describe it can change. Maybe actually just finish a bit. Okay. Anyone want to address that? I completely agree. I would like to just express, I kind of agree, but I also want to express a slight doubt about the distinction between coordinates and events, actually. To me, this is not proven. I do not fully understand that. Not fully understand that. It's possibly just my lack of understanding, but I think that, well, okay, I think that one could imagine putting reference frames to pretty much any coordinates, at least classically, even spherical and other weird things. So in the quantum system. This is true, but there is no contradiction because you define events with some systems and then you define. Events with some systems, and then you define coordinates. You need an array of systems to define a reference frame or a coordinate system. And then you will define events in that reference frame. And they don't have to be exactly the same systems that you use to define the reference frame. And that is how you can have a difference between, I mean, you should have a difference between events and coordinates because otherwise. Because otherwise things would trivialize. So it just depends which systems you use to define events. Like if you want to have always a physical picture for everything, for an event, for a reference frame and for absolutely everything, you can have that and they don't have to be always having the same properties in a sense, who is classical relative to whom, because you can use different systems in different states relative to one another to define. To one another to define reference frames and to define events. And of course, you can swap their roles. That's, of course, also fine. But this will show you exactly that you can have these scenarios where an event, depending on the set of other physical systems that you use as a reference frame, can have, say, single coordinate or some superposition of coordinates. Just to say that there isn't a tension. Okay, just whatever Magdalen is saying is applicable to your time delocalized systems on here. And this time delocalized system is one event, but it's time delocalized in the coordinates of the laboratory time. I mean, this is a prime example of this. Maybe I misunderstood. I had the feeling that she's suggesting that, let's say, in the gravitational switch, there is a notion of event locally, which is more. Of event locally, which is more true in a sense, or then so I probably completely misunderstood. No, no, so the only point is that there is always just one event that depending which observer you use, associated with a mass or associated with some asymptotic region, you would say that this is a single event with single coordinate, or is it an event that is delocalized over coordinates? Over coordinates. This will always be there. There will always be this relativity. And it is exactly just as the gravitational switch is directly showing how that can come about. So what changes here in the notion of event would be then that for, say, classical reference frame transformations, an event is always like a point, it always happens at a sharp time, according to all observers. According to all observers, but when you include quantum systems and these time delocalized subsystems, you can have still events, but from an observer, it can happen that this event looks at like a delocalized. I thought you were suggesting that actually that there are some situations like in the gravitational switch where the coordinates might not actually go to a global background time and they might not. To a global background timing, they might not correspond to an actual reference frame, they're rather just three labelings. I thought that's what you were suggesting, but that probably I misunderstand. Like, well, for me, it's not, I mean, we can do all these mathematical tricks. So, well, they are not only mathematical, but in a sense, does there correspond? Does there exist, you probably know this, this description for the gravitational switch, which is relative to a faraway observer. Is it? Faraway observer, is it all well-defined? This coordinate description of the experiment, which would look like just like the optical switch, is that like a well-established result, or just probably I'm not familiar. Is it clear? You can, in general, even beyond that, you can prove that as long as you're talking about symmetrics in this case, because we talk about two. Metrics in this case, because we talk about things that are coming from a massive object that defines some space-times. So, even more generally than what maybe specifically you are asking about the gravitational switch, optical switch, whenever you have a scenario where something comes about because of, say, a system-defining metric being in superposition of states that are related by. Related by some symmetry of the theory, and translations are symmetries in this case. And you can always rewrite everything, just it's really rewriting exactly the same probability amplitudes in the way in which rather than having fixed coordinates of a faraway observer that observes the mass in superposition, you will end up. Superposition: You will end up in a scenario where you have a mass that has a fixed coordinate and all your systems are suitably correlated with each other and in a weak entangled state. And so that's then something that you can say, oh, well, it's just kind of like we have in the lab. Obviously, well, there is one experiment with entangled quantum switch, and obviously it's quite specific in that photons have. It's quite specific in that photons have to go various ways. I mean, because I'm just trying to avoid saying that it's exactly like optical setups, because each optical setup will be very specific about how you exactly, you know, build the interferometer and so on. But more generally, whenever you have some scenario where some quantum aspects of space-time are just because of the position of states that are related by symmetry, you can always map it to a scenario where you have quantum matter in some state. Quantum matter in some state on a single background, on single space-time. And then you, yeah, you just, depending which way you start, if you start, like as with the superposition of the mass, if you do the exercise, you just find what is the corresponding state of the matter that you have to prepare in a single space-time to achieve the same amplitudes in the end. And that's exactly what would be related. That's exactly what would be relating coordinates with these various properties of describing events as localized or delocalized. This all comes together. Okay, so I think this is clearly an interesting subject, and there was a bunch of questions I didn't get a chance to go to. There is Gavatan, which I think will continue to be open even for all. I think it's open 24 hours while the conference is running. So, anyone who wants to head over there and continue the conversation should do so. And so, yeah, so if the people who didn't get to ask their questions, so that was Rob, Alex, and Anupan, if they can just remember those questions and perhaps we can get back to them at a later date. And so I think all that remains is for me to thank all the speakers, panelists, for a very interesting session. And we'll close there and we'll continue with the
