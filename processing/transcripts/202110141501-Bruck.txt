We lost the video.  Sure, yeah. We'll just power through and probably one of them will just show up there. Okay, so the object I'll talk about is at least in the beginning now mainly h to the k of SL and Z with coefficients in Q. And I will be interested. I will be interested now in the highest, say, interesting k possible here. So what do I mean with the highest interesting? Well, we already saw that in Den's talk, for example, on Tuesday. The V C D of this group, S L N Z, is equal to n times n minus 1 of n times n minus 1 over 2. Yeah, I'll write this as d from now on. And okay, you can see that, as I mentioned, by letting it act on the symmetric space. And in particular, this implies that the cohomology of the group with rational coefficients becomes trivial above the V C D, this virtual cohomological dimension. Yes, so this is zero if zero if k is bigger than d. So highest interesting would mean, well, k is equal to d or shortly below it. Okay, let me say what is known about this thing shortly below the highest interest in D. So the cohomology of this group coefficients in Q in the B C D is trivial. At least if N is Trivial, at least if n is bigger equal to 2. And that's a result by Li and Shaba from the 70s. Now what happens if we go one step below that? H D minus I of that group is also trivial. Now if N is N is at least 3 by result of Church and Putnam. Okay, so it's trivial in the top dimension, it's trivial one dimension below, and then there is a cojector due to church, Parmen, Papman. Which says that probably this is not a coincidence, but there might be a more general pattern. Namely, the conjecture says that h to the d minus i of this group is rationally trivial if at least n is small enough, big enough, and this is probably n bigger than i plus 2. So what this So, what these two results here say is that this statement is true for, well, okay, I'll call this the co-dimension I co-modulate of SLNZ. And these two statements say that the co-dimension 0 co-modulate vanishes, the co-dimension 1 co-modity vanishes. So the statement is true for I equal to 0 or 1. And what I would like to talk about now is joint work with what With Jeremy Miller, Peter Tutz, Robin Sloka and Jenny Wilson. Alright, 21 question mark. I'll say something about that in a moment. Where we show that this conjecture is also true if i is equal to 2. So that the codimeter. So that the codimension 2 co-multi of SO and Z vanishes with coefficients in Q. And maybe a short remark on the question mark here. So we are optimistic that we did everything we needed to do, but it's not written up yet. And we started writing up. Of course, there might be still problems occurring on the way. We hope that this won't be the case, but it's still maybe with a small question. Maybe with a small question mark here. But I think we should be, I'm at least quite optimistic at the moment. Okay, so this is a rather short talk. So what I will do is just outline the strategy that Church and Putman use to show the co-dimensional 1 result, because this is very similar to what we do to prove the theorem over here. Then I'll give you a bit of an idea of what we do, what we do differently than they, and what we do very similarly. That day, and what we do very similar to them. And in the end, if there is a bit more time, I'll also say some words on the corresponding case of symplectic groups, S, B2, and Z, in the very end. You also prove this with like rational representations as coefficients? I mean, no, so far it was no, so far exactly in the form that it's written over here. But I think it should. But I think it should be the same I mean, yeah, it should it should work the same, I would say. Um okay so let me outline first now a bit the proof of this co-dimension I thing, which is very similar to what we will use. So first, okay, a recap, we already saw that in the first two days. The theorem of Bobalzer, we saw, for example, in Andy's talk, a dance talk. in Andy's talk, a Dan's talk, actually also in Nate's talk, which uh tells us that SLNZ is a virtual world. It says that the d minus i-th cohomology of SLNZ with rational coefficients is isomorphic to the ith homology of this group. But now with different coefficients, namely in this Steinberg n tense Q. Where the this Steinberg n was the Steinberg module for SLNQ and we saw that this can be defined as uh the top-dimensional homology of the associated T spilling to S L N Q. To SLNQ. Yeah, okay, I mean, for now, we saw that this building here can be defined as a post-set of proper subspaces of Q to the N. But that doesn't matter too much for this talk now. I mean, the point is just we have some description of this group on the left-hand side by something else on the right-hand side. And if we want to compute now, high-dimensional cohomology of this object on the left-hand side, we can instead have a look at the right-hand side. And for computing the right-hand side, And for computing the right-hand side, what we need to do is basically understand this module here, the Steinberg module, seen as a module of SLNZ. This is basically what we need to compute the right-hand side. And maybe let me write down one more precise statement of the alphabet here. So the following is true. Okay, this is from also the paper of Church Putman, but that's more an. The paper of George Putman, but it's more, it's a general homological algebra argument. Namely, the following is true. If we have a sequence like this: C2, C1, C0 to Steinberg tensor Q, which is a resolution of this module. By flat SLN set modules, then if the co-invariance of all of some of these CIs, the SLNZ co-invariance of some of these CI vanishes, then Then the ith homology of the object on the right, so the ith homology of SLNZ with coefficients in this module is trivial. Yeah, and this is the same by Bovazer, what is morphic to h d minus i of S L and Z with coefficients in Q. Yeah, so this is just a bit more precise statement of we can compute this by understanding Steinberg as an SLNZ module. The strategy now we want to use to show mention of that. One wants to construct a resolution or a partial resolution of this module, then shows that the co-invariance of this thing here vanish and can conclude that these are trivial. These are trivial. And one way to phrase what Church and Putman do is they construct a partial resolution of length 2. So something that looks like this. Now, of course, just having any resolution of the module is not very helpful, which is, I guess, a general statement. Which is, I guess, a general statement. Yeah, you can always find some kind of resolution of that. The important part about this resolution is that we need a description of the resolution that is concrete enough such that we can compute the co-invariance of that step. This is the crucial point. We need a concrete description of this group so that we can understand the action of Essemanz on it. Now, I won't say too much about how one can get the resolution, but let me just say that the key step in the proof of Church and Putman for constructing this resolution is to show that a certain simplicity complex complex and pushing complex which they call VA is highly connected, namely n minus one connected. And then I mean roughly speaking one gets the resolution by using the relative homologic groups of this complex and these are Complex and these are relatively concrete because one knows what the cells in the complex are. Okay, and let me... So how does one define this complex BA? One starts like this. It starts with the complex BN. Bn is a simplicity complex which has as its vertices the set of all The set of all lines in z to the n, that b is now a primitive vector in z to the n. So something that can be extended to a basis. Yeah, all these one-dimensional lines are the vertices of bn. And then a set of such lines is a simplex if and only if it's a partial. If and only if it's a partial basis. Yeah, so if you can take the 0 until vk and extend it to a basis of z to the n. These are exactly the simplices of this complex. Okay, now you get a simplicity complex, which actually turns out to be n minus 2 connected. But to get the complex BAN, and afterwards, you still start. Afterwards, you still start with this complex. You take BAN0, so the vertices to be exactly the same vertices as that of BN. So all of these parameters, all of these lines. And then to get to the entire complex, you take all the simplicies that you have in Bn, so these partial bases, together with the simplicies. Together with simplicities that look like this: 0 plus v1, v0, v1, comma v2, and so on. Where this part here is a partial basis again, and this is the sum of the first two things in here. So this gives you another type of simplex that you glue in. You glue in. And yeah, the result of George and Putman, as I said, is to show that this complex is in fact n minus one connected. Now, okay, then you show that this complex is n minus one connected. You look at its relative homology, you do some general, I don't know, homology argument. You get such a resolution that is relative, that is concrete in terms of the construction. That is concrete in terms of chains in this complex over here. Now, what do we do? So, let me see, I'll just abbreviate it. What we do is we use the similar or more or less the same. The similar, or more or less the same, strategy to show vanishing of co-multi in co-dimension tools. Namely, you first define a new complex BAAM. BAAM is obtained from BAN by taking the same vertex set as BAN. So the vertex. So the vertices of this complex are again aligned and set to the n and then attaching certain I'll just write new types of simplices Yeah these simplices also have a concrete description in terms of you take a partial basis plus certain linear dependencies among them certain ways to to add them and to or to subtract them this gives This gives you a simplicity complex, and what we show is that this complex is n-connected. And then we get a resolution, just as in the Church Partner argument, we get a resolution. Now, the general argument tells us that this resolution is one step longer. So we have a C2 over here. We show that the co-invariance of this resolution van. Coinvariance of this resolution vanish. And as a corroborary, we get exactly from this thing on the right-hand side that hd minus 2 of SL and Z with coefficients in Q is trivial. And let me maybe just say what the difference in the argument is. So the main part, so this part works very similarly for us. It's a general, I don't know. Similarly, for us, it's a general, I don't know, logical algebra argument, if you want. What needs to be done differently is showing this connectivity. There, we still can do an argument that is very similar, that starts somehow the same way. But, well, roughly speaking, at a certain part in the argument, you need to define a map and do a certain case distinction for the types of simplices in the complex. And for the Church-Putman argument, there were only two types, namely, these partial bases and then. Partial bases and then these additive relations. But we get some more types of simplices, and that makes the combinatorics get, I mean, yeah, get much harder. And what we do there is to use computer calculations in order to well, there is an argument that reduces the the problem in the end to showing that a certain number of finite simplicity complexes has vanishing homologies in certain degrees. Homologies in certain degrees. And we use a computer first to list all these isomorphism types, and secondly, to show that this homology of the complex suspensions. So, which gives an automatized argument for all these, which allows us not to do all the case distinctions for all the different types of simplicies here. So, how many cases does it end up being? I mean, how many types of complexes do you need to compute? I mean, it's of the order of 60 complexes with each around 10 verticals. Each around 10 vertices, so it's not that much, I guess. For a computer, yeah, I mean, my hand I didn't want to do it, but yeah, for a computer, that's just not a problem. And yeah, the gong was already here, so let me just in the last minute, let me just take one minute to mention a similar story for the symplectic group. Yeah, I'll really just mention two or three words. Two or three words, namely, um it's a joint project with um Robin Sloka and Peter Patz, where we look at the similar story for sp2 and z. This is also a duality group, so we also get the same result for L. The virtual homological dimension here is n squared. Is n squared. And now one can also ask for this group: is it true that the codimension i cohomology vanishes with rational coefficients? And if i is equal to zero, then the answer is yes, by a result of um Paul Gannon's. And if i is equal to one, and here I'll just say uh we are investigating the question. Um And I'll just say in words: this is by far not as advanced as the project here. I mean, here we are really writing up and hope that we have all the details already. Here, this is really ongoing work. I think we made important steps. We have certain simplicity complex. We have a rough strategy for showing that it might be as highly connected as we wanted. Might be as highly connected as we want it to be. But there are certainly many things still to fill in here, and this is not a result at all. I think we, yeah, I'll leave it like this. Thanks. Any questions? I don't know if people over Zoom can ask directly or Directly, or maybe you type in chat, but can you hear me? We can hear you very quietly. All right. Well, maybe people on Zoom can type questions into the chat and Jeremy will read them out. I caught something on turn to turn the volume off. I think it's related to the echo. You might get feedback. Turn that off. People on Zoom will just. Does Dem is saying maybe something on the I'm going to say maybe something on the. They'll probably come in and help us. Maybe let's start with in-person questions in hopes that they fix the Zoom questions. Are there any? I have maybe the obvious one. Is the obstacle to going to I equals 3 computational? Yeah, not only. I think, I mean, it seems to us like, so the problem is finding this correct complex first, finding the definition of the complex. Complex first, finding the definition of the complex. So you wouldn't just add another A? Well, you would add another A. Yeah, the question is basically what does adding another A mean? And I mean there are ways to do reasonable guesses on that. So I think we have a good way maybe of guessing what a new complex could be. Showing that it's highly connected, probably the argument would work similarly. Probably the argument would work similarly. But yeah, I mean, we start looking into this and I mean, and computationally, it should also, I think it should still be feasible. I mean, of course, at some point, the complex get user and user here, then will already be, for three A's there would already be more cases. But I would be optimistic that the calculations can be done similarly by the computer if one has written down the context correctly. Complex correctly. Then, afterwards, the question is whether it's still feasible. But for one more, I think you could push it one more with the method. But I don't know. Yeah, for me, it's going to make an interjection. And I just, you know, that might be possible. I think pushing it too far beyond that, you're going to run. These are very closely connected to things like the Borderline desolation. And the fact that these things stop being simplicial at some point and they start being massively complicated, I think just is going to be a Complicated, I think just is going to be a gigantic brick wall. So I don't think we'll approve the general case of our conjecture like this. No, no. Not that's true. So sorry if I missed this, but why does the complexity of the computation you have to do increase with n? Yeah, no, that's not so clear from what I said. Yeah, okay. I was only very Yeah, okay. I was only very, very rough on what you need to do. So the I'll still stay rough, but roughly speaking, at some point in this connectivity argument, you have a... Okay, you have a reduction argument. You need some kind of complex that you reduce some rank of the vertices in the image. So you take a sphere, you map it to this complex. Then you can define the rank of the sphere as somehow the maximal. Is somehow the maximal, say the maximal rank of the last entry of some of these partial bases that shows up. I mean, these concrete vertices in set to the end, so they have a last entry, and that's an integer. You need to try to reduce the integer step by step. And how you do this is at some top point, you take such a point that is bad, so it has this maximal value. And now the idea is you want to feel, you want to remove this thing from the image. Remove this thing from the image by filling in something in the link of this vertex. And roughly speaking, what you need to show this is you need that the link is highly connected somehow by kind of an induction argument. You can say maybe the link of this thing is highly connected and this allows us to avoid the simplex. But you need to be able to define a certain retraction from this link to a link of all things that have smaller rank. Yeah, if you want to. If you have this vertex here, you have the link of the vertex, and you want to have a sphere that first goes maybe like this, and you want to push it to go down here. Then you want it to be in an area where this last entry here, so this has last entry R, and you want to push this thing, this sphere, basically in a region which has also area. Region which has also area last entry smaller than R. Now what you okay and this you can do if this region that is smaller than R and still in the length of the vertex is highly connected. Now in order to show this, you have to define a retraction basically from a version of the link which has arbitrary last entries to this Arbitrary last entries to this version which has last entries smaller than R. And for defining this retraction, this is basically where you need to show that some finite complexes are highly connected, yeah? Very roughly speaking. And now the way you define this retraction, or you can define it, is by induction over the skeleton. You define on vertices, there everything works fine. But then you define it until the Define it until the, I don't know, one, two, three, maybe four skeletons of the complex. For each dimension showing up there, you need a separate argument of why you can fill it. But it turns out that these new types of simplices, every type is already there if n is at least 4. So starting from n equal to bigger or equal to 5, the types of simplices you get are the same as before. And so also for these higher complexes, for higher n, you only need to. For higher n, you only need to show how to retract the four skeleton into the smaller region. And this is roughly why it's sufficient. Yeah, so everything shows up already in the four skeleton. That means you can define a map on the four skeleton. And the rest is then automatic and doesn't need to be done for higher. There's some questions over Zoom. Abner asked: do you have a candidate for B with lots of A's? With lots of A's, and then Peter and I said some things, but you feel free to say whatever you want. I mean, what did you already say? Oh, Peter said you basically want like Voronoi and then partial bases. Yeah. Yeah. Right, I mean, right. I think we lost audio. I think you can hear me now, right? Okay. I mean, I can't hear them anymore, but at least things clue. Can they? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Some kind of complex esoteric way to understand the. kind of complex where SLN where you understand the SLNZ action of nicely and that is highly connected. And I mean the candidate for that is if you want the symmetric space contractible and it's scalar or then highly.
