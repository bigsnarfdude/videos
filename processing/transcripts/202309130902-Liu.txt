Feedback can propose based in defining cell functions. We provide mechanistic models that we hope that it can meaningfully engage when the experiment vocalizes. And today I'd like to present one of the ongoing projects in the group. It concerns the focal adhesion mediated mechanical sensation. And in the past few days, we have heard a lot about cell phone migration, acetoskeleton, and focal adhesions. And vocal adhesions. So, here I would just like to have a very simplified introduction about vocal adhesion. So, to move around, the cell dynamically forms a complex organelle called photopartition. Focal partition is immigrant-based transmembrane linkage that connects the cell with the ECMs. So, it's basically the fruit of the migrating cells. So, focal adhesion is one-awaiting the cell. Focal artitian is one layer of the structures. So here bind to the ECM on one hand and coupled to the acting cytoskeleton on the other hand where the adapter portions. So ECM, integral, adapter and the acting cytos um acting cytoskeletons and each occupy its own age. And focal adhesion is what and is very dynamic. And it is very dynamic. From its nascent state, it grows and matures by sequentially coupling to the acting retrograde flux and the stress vibrant. So focal attention underlines a diversity of mechanical sensation of the cells. A well-known example is the virotaxis. Basically, the cells have a tendency to migrate towards the To migrate towards the stiffer substrate. And the neurotypes is well conserved and is important for many physiological functions. For example, the wound healing, immune response, and tumor amicalysis. And very recently, my experimental collaborator, Ying Chen, she discovered that focal adhesion also underlines the cell response to the The cell response to the extracellular fluid viscosities. So, to mimic the high-viscous environment that sticking our religions to the cell culture media. For example, 1% of the methane cell are MCs. So, it will make the soil culture medium about Cell culture medium about 200 times more viscous than the water. And as you can see, in response, the cell rapidly flattened and spread out. The whole process is totally reversible, as the cell will retract when we wash out the MCs. And we know that the whole process is the hinges of the The focal adesions. The reason is that when you specifically disrupt the formation of the focal adhesion by culturing the cell colourously on the PCI, the viscosity response is completely abolished. And we also know that the enhanced cell spreading here couples with smaller individual focal adhesions. So when these experiments, we ask So when these experiments, we ask three questions. First, how does the focal adhesion modulate the cell spreading in response to the viscosities? Second, why don't how the same focal attitude will undermine the viral taxes? And third, what is the coherent model of the vocal artesian that kind of explains the diversity of mechanical sensation of the cells? Yes? That's a question about the experiment. So the 1% mental cellulose was added to the cell. The 1% method cellulose was added to the cell in the solution. In solution. So, was it mixed? Was it all mixed? It takes about 2-3 minutes that the cell will respond. Yeah, I'm wondering if it's really viscosity. I mean, it's a concentration of something. Right. As far as we can tell, it's well-mixed. So let's focus on the first question first. Question first. So let me just tell you what we got first. So we show that during this viscosity of response, the cell basically reduces the cortical tension, and that will relax the cell front. And that will enable the extensive cell front protrusion, which will funnel the most of the acting polymerization at cell front when cell front protrusion. And we very unwitting of acting polymerization. A little of the acting conversation for the acting retrograde flashes, and that will reduce the directional growth of the focal partitions. Now, let me tell you how we get there. So, to build a theoretical model, we first use our experiments to guide our model constructions. We know from our experiments that this viscosity of response hinges on acting polymer decisions. However, it's totally insensitive. However, it is totally insensitive to the inhibition on the alphal mouth and contract kinetics. So, therefore, considering the different developed stages of focal adhesions, this experiment means that it is the growing focal adhesion, not the matured focal adhesion, that undermines this viscosity all response. So, therefore, guided by the experiment, we're going to build a theoretical model. We're going to build a theoretical model on adhesion that starts from the adasant state and incompeting with the cell from protrusion without the engagement of the stress fiber. And the first models build upon the fact that the focal adhesion is well-layered structures. So ECM integral adapter and acting set of sand, each occupy its own layers. So this basically tells us where things are and how they. Where things are and how they physically interact with each other in accordance with these layered structures. Secondly, the model depicts the branching actin networks polymer invision at cell front, and the anti-corporal tension will resist the cell front protrusion and convert part of the actin polymer invisions into the reciprocal and acting fluxes flow to the interior of the cells. So when these actin flux pass over. So when these actin flux pass overhead of the focal adhesions, it will engage it with and hence stretch the adapter proteins. Here the model describes both the catch bond and sleep bound behavior of the focal adhesions. So here many of the adapter proteins here are mechanical sensitive. So the more they get stretched, the more they will open up the critical binding sites that will further engage with the acting integrant atom. Instead, and the other dark components. So, the upshot is that the initial mechanical challenging from active sparks will build up the full partition and strengthening the mechanical linkage with the substrate. However, when the stretching becomes too big, I'm going to break the bounds. So, that's slip bound behaviors. So, and now the And now the disengaged focal partition adapters will drift when the atom flocks. And therefore, deposit themselves downstream by binding to the ECM RPA, that will promote the evaluated focal partition work, downstream of the acting funds. So, taking all these four effects together, we're going to In fact, together, we're going to model how to focus our teaching world in company when a sell-front future. And what I'm going to do now is to translate these qualitative pictures into a quantitative mathematical equations. We modeled acting flux as the incompressible Nova-Stokes hydrodynamics. So the local velocity of the acting flux is governed by Atom flux is governed by its internal pressure gradients set by the boundary condition at the membrane as well as the external resistance from the acting from the focal adhesions. And here the F of adhere here due to force balance is also the focal adhesion traction force that transmitted onto the substrate. So we model the memory. The membrane protrusion dynamics as being driven by the internal pressure from the atom flux. And yes. You had a source term in your mass conservation equation that you're writing about electrodynamic equations. I'm specifically tracking a cognitive atom. Yes, I'm going to talk about here. So the memory protrusion is driven by the internal pressure from the acting flux. From the acting flux, and the going to be resisted by the cortical tension. And we treat the membrane as a moving boundary condition for the acting fluxes in such a way that the velocity of the acting flux at the membrane is equal to the acting polarization rate at the membrane minus the membrane protrusion speed. So we model the focal adhesion growth dynamics of the reaction. Growth dynamics are the reaction, the fusion, and convection process. And here, the internal, the local chemical reactions basically describe the interconversions of the formal adhesion components in according to this layer, the structures, depending on when and where the bond form and dissociate. So let's take the one example, the integral bond adapter protein compound that has Adapter protein component that has not bind to the ECM yet. So, in this equation, the dynamical change of this complex at the local scales is governed by the two-dimensional diffusion of the complex and the drifting of the complex when the local acting flux, as well as the interconversions when other focal partition species, according to the In according to the layered structure. And importantly, both the on and off rate of this complex is modulated by the local attraction forces that this complex is engaging when the actual fluxes. And finally, the over attraction forces include the focal adhesion frictional force and shear stress when the actual flux. Taken together, that's how. Gather, that's how we model the coupling between the focal partition growth in feedback when the tracking force generations. With that, the model can readily recapitulate the progression of the focal partition growth in component when the acting flux and the scale front protrusion. And here, the bright domain here represents the illiguing concentration field, and the red. Concentration field and the red arrow is the velocity field of acting flux. And the size of the red arrow spills with the amplitude of the velocity. And what happened here is that as the acting flux engages with the focal adhesions, it will invoke the catch bond first, and that will build up the adhesion and also build up the traction peak. But when the stretching becomes too big, it will drift the focal partition component and promote the evaluated growth of the focal partitions. And reciprocally, as the focal partition builds up, it's going to impede the unoccupied fluxes that effectively anchor the acting polymer positions and push the cell front forward. And here we try to identify the model parameter. Identify the model parameters that critically control the viscosity response, the enhanced cell protrusion and the smaller by individual focal petitions. And we identify two critical model parameters through the phase diagram studies, the quadratic intention of the cell and the rate of the focal adhesion we model. And the red dot here represents the nominal parameter size. The nominal parentheses that correspond to the model result that I presented in the previous slides. And to qualitatively capture the enhanced cell protrusion and the smaller individual focal adhesions, the model predicts that the quartical tension has to reduce and the rate of the focal adhesion remodeling has to be split up. Consequence of these two conditions, the acting on Conditions, the acting retrograde flux has to be significantly slowed down. And to test this prediction, we first need to know to measure the cortical tension. So here we use laser ablation to cut a small wound at the cell cortex. And then we measure how fast the wound is going to expand. And we reason that the smaller the wound expands, the smaller the cortical tension would be. Based on that, Tension would be. Based on that assumption, our experiment shows that the cause of tension indeed decreased during the viscosity response. Just a conceptual question. So the 1% methylcellulose also has an osmotic effect, probably. Do you control for that? We control that. We uh in the in that experiment they uh they also put other uh reagent to balance the uh osmetic. Balance the automatic. Yes. And here, our third microscopy experiment also shows that during the viscosity response, the form adhesion undergo explosive remodelings. And the quantification from this data, it shows that the thick line here represents the changes of the focal attitude in pensive. Changes of the focal adhesion intensity between the consecutive frames. So it shows a massive remodeling. And this is totally consistent with our measurements on the on-off read of the focal adhesions. It also shows that the read of the focal adhesion remodeling is much faster than the wild-type COS without the viscosity reading. And lastly, we have measured action. We have measured acting retributive flux at Celfront. And as you see, that from the comet graph shows that the actin flux indeed significantly reduces during the viscosity response. So taken together, we arrive at this very simple model of viscosity response. So during the viscosity response, the quantity called tension Response, the quantitative tension reduces, and that will react the cell front, and then we'll have very extensive cell front protrusion. And that will find out most of the acting flux when the cell front protrusion and when very little of acting reflect fluxes. And that will reduce the directional growth of the focal tension. All this point makes sense, but then the real question is: what really caused the decrease in the coincidental tension? I must eat up the focal adhesion. And the speed up of the focal addition of models. And our experiment shows that actually the memory raffling seems to play a key role here. As you see, that during the viscosity response, the raffle is completely abolished. On the one hand, we kind of know that the waffleing controls the actual memory of the cells, and therefore help maintain the cortical tension. That schemes could explain the cortical tension reduction during the post coffee response. The voice coffee response. However, the real picture could be much more complicated. The reason is that, for example, the focal adhesion seems to control the membrane roughly by itself. The reason is that the phobal adhesion localizes the protein kinesis, is known to phosphorate cofilin, which will promote the membrane on rotamin and that will resist the membrane. Will resist the cell front protrusion and hence potentially to cause the tension, increased acting flux, and that will impact the phobopartition growth. So it's a feedback. So the question is, what exactly does the viscosity do to the cell? Does it really just mechanically impede the memory roughly so that we'll modulate this feedback? Oh, there is something else. Oh, there is something else which might be vibrant. We do not know the answer at this point. We feel that we are just at the tip of the X word. But in the future, we are going to interrogate how the teacher feedback when the membrane is roughly modulating the viscosity response. But what we learned so far from this project for sure is that the acting retrograde flux will drive the development. Rashburg for us will drive the directional focal adherent growth. And that's coupled when the cell phone proclusion. And this will constitute the, will provide a base for us to model Euro in taxes. And for now, let's switch gear and focus on a second question. Whether and how does same focal partition analyze your taxes? So here's my experimental climate surge. He used Circuit to use a micro needle to stretch the softer ECR. That will stiffen the movable substrate. As expected, the cell will migrate towards this stiffer substrate. And in this process, thirdly to use the traction force microscopy to map out the traction profiles. The traction profiles that each of the focal adhesion exerted onto the substrate. And the microfootprint, the focal adhesion traction forces have well-defined the spatial pattern. And the red dot here represents the location of the traction maximum for each of the focal adhesions. And in this direction, it is towards the focal adhesion distal T facing the self front. And interestingly, And interestingly, it also shows that the traction peak kind of alternates both in time and in space. It alters every 10 to 20 seconds, and the peak appears to travel about a micron distance along the length of the focal titans. And when the peak is near to the frontal end of the focal artesius, the amplitude is smaller compared to the end of the 19th century Is smaller compared to those at the focal articles and centers. So we have an antiphase and correlation between the amplitude and precision of the focal attitude traction peak. So the key question is how and why does the traction peak oscillate? And let me show you what we got. So inside of a single traction peak travels in space along the lines of the focal adhesion, we demonstrated Adhesion. We demonstrated it's actually full adhesion have two tracking peaks. The frontal peak remit fixed, the central peak oscillates up and down in laggit. So it is just a decompetition between the two traction peaks that gives the impression of the traction peak oscillation in path and in space. Now, let me tell you how we got there. So, as you may remember, in our current model, In our current model, the traction we, as the focal attitude, builds up, there emerges the traction pit. But this traction peak does not oscillate at all. What we are missing here is that, well, we know that the durotaxis is known to depend on the actual mouse and contractivities. So, this means that it is the mature focal adhesion underlies the urine. Underlines the Euro taxes. So now to capture the Euro taxes, we need to further our model to describe the focal adhesion maturation process. Specifically, we need to answer the question of how does the stress fiber form upon the focal adhesion as an integral part of the focal adhesion maturation process. And you may remember that during the directional growth of your focal adhesions, there emerged. Your focal adhesions. There emerges the decreasing traction gradients towards the focal adhesion proximal tip. It emerges because and here you have a lot of the drifting events take place. So in this part of the focal adhesion, the focal adhesion does not really fully anchor to the substrate. So the traction remains low. So the model predicts. So the model predicts that this traction gradient actually paves the way for the stress fiber formation upon the focal adhesions. The reason is that the focal adhesion voltamides, protein and tyrosine kinase, the PDKs are mechanosensitive and is in a neutral inhibition when the protein-kerosene phosphorus exists. Then exist. So the PDK, so at the tip, at the frontal tip of the adhesion, the high focal interaction will promote the PDK and inhibit the PBK. But near the proximal tip of the focal partition, the traction remain low for time being. That will tip the balance of the toggle switch towards the PDP activations. And this not only expands. This not only explains the observed higher pd activities near the focal adhesion frontal band that we know for sure. But it's also introduced a nice transition from the branching acting network mediated to the stress fiber mediated focal adhesion matrices. The reason is that activated PDF. Is that activated PDP? It is known to activate rho A and hence the stress vapor formation and atoms contractions. So taken together, the model can readily reconfigure the observed traction T oscillation like that in experiment. So here's the predicted traction force profiles along the central lines of the focal artesian or Central minds of the focal artesian over time. This is the front of the focal artesian, that's the back of the focal artesian. The frontal peak does not change, the central peak alternate up and up and down. Now the real question is, do we really have two traction peaks? So here is the typical traction force microscopy experiment result. As you see, we have two traction peaks. Frontal peak remains fixed, the central peak oscillates up. The central peak alternates up and down, just as we predicted. So, a combinatorial model, the frontal peak stands from the mechanical engagement of 4 rotation when acting flux, and the central peak stands from the actual mausoleum contractivities from the stress vibrant. So to test our model, we can just perturb these two distinctive acting structures in different ways. And we did exactly. And so far, the experimental result is consistent and has. Our result is consistent and can support our model prediction. For the rest of my talk, I'm just going to focus on one of these exercises and concerns how and why does the central tracking take a possibility. According to our model, the actual muscle contraction will apply tension along the stretch fiber, and that will promote the innovation of the stress fiber by incorporating more of the active monomers to the plastic end of the stress fiber. On the other hand, the aquasin. On the other hand, the upper biosin contraction itself behaves like a catchball. The more the gutter resisted, the more it will contract. And conversely, the more the gutter relaxed, the less it's going to uncontract. And taking the two effects together, we get an active feedback. So the actual mousein contraction promotes the strong stress fiber innovation. But in the eyes of the actual mousein, it's like I'm pulling a rope. It's like I'm pulling a rope, but the other end is at loose. So this relaxation turns out the contract timer. So we have a negative feedback. So we also know the contractions at a little bit faster time scales than the stress factor elongation rate. So we have a time delay negative feedback that will naturally give rise to the oscillation. The oscillation behaviors. So, according to the model, during the traction peak oscillation, the stress fiber innovation rate equals oscillator. To test this prediction, we design a photo-labeling experiment that we photoche two narrow straps across the stress viral. Then we create a punctuation, a black punctu. By tracking the position of the black punctu over time, we get a touch. From this, we can tell. Touch. From this, we can calculate the speed of the pump tau, and that should correspond to the stress factor elongation rate. Here's the typical experimental result. And we have other pointifications as well. So far, we have told you how the traction peak oscillates. But why does it oscillate? Well, in control that we have the traction peak oscillations, the focal adhesion shows a very nice mechanical sensing. Very nice mechanical sensing curve. That is, the focal addition can generate sufficient arterial traction on the stiffer ECM. That means they can tell the difference. But under the condition that the traction peak oscillation compromise by either inhibition of the stress factor innovation or the actual mouse and contract activities. The focal artesian mechanical sensing curve is myself. The traction I Myself. The traction either remains old, regardless of the ECM stiffness, or only show some sensitivity in the softer ECM limit. The reason is that we can think about this result from a pure mechanical perspective. Consider the focal adhesion as the elastic splits. The cell builds the focal adhesion as the mechanical sensor, and then apply the contraction through this mechanical sensor to sense the To sense the mechanics of the ECM. So if you work out the math, the focal adhesion traction will be modulated by the ECM stiffness like this. It's going to increase with the ECM stiffness until the substrate is stiffer than the focal partition itself, which makes sense. You cannot measure something as. Something is, you cannot sense something is more stiffer than the sensor itself. This is without the negative feedback. However, when the negative feedback and also when the traction peak oscillation, what we get is that you kind of taper down the focal partition traction. But the gain is that we're going to increase the working zones. To increase the working zones of the mechanical sensor and broaden the range of the ECM stiffness, that the focal adhesion can have an effective mechanical sensor. And we think that at least constitute one of the functional roles of restraction peak oscillation. So to sum up, we provide a coherent model of focal plots and growth in component with the cell front protrusion. Self-front protrusion. Here, the active flux drives a directional growth of the focal adhesion, which paves the way for the stress fiber formation on the focal adhesion and the subsequent focal adhesion matrix. And the tracking peak oscillation basically reflects the spatial tuple coordination between the two different acting networks and converts the the uh efficient focal adhesion mechanical sensor. Focal adhesion mechanical sensing. And we hope that we can convince you that we have a coherent focal adhesion model that may serve as a base to explain a diverse agreement of the focal adhesion, the cell mechanical sensation process. We expect a lot of work will come up in the future in this direction. And over that, I'd like to stop by sending the people who are involved. The people who are involved in this project and also our funding agencies. Thank you. In the experiments, very interesting topics. The experiments with the viscosity response, what is the response of the stress fibers in the cell? Well, what do they Well, we have a movie shows that the stress fibers are involved in the focal adhesion formation in that case. But it's just that when you get rid of the stress fiber, nothing really changes in terms of self-spreading. How do you get rid of the stress fiber? By um twenty uh macro um micro molar of uh Um macromolar of uh barber studying treatment. So when we get rid of the we inhibit the actual mouse and contract intimidities by statin treatment, there is no there there is essentially no enhanced cell spreading. And focal adhesions can be And focal adhesions can exist in the presence. And we have an image show that. Of course, that depends on penetration of the vibrant study. If it's too high, then everything dies up. So you want to say that focal adhesions can exist without mild. Without miners in even controversy. Yes. Which is actually a strong statement. That's true. Yeah, and very surprising. That's true. But the focal adhesion have a lot of the nascent focal adhesions. They can grow. They can grow. But all we're saying is that when they grow, it's not a necessary immediate engagement with the stress fibre. Engagement with the stress. They had to pass through the stage that engagement will act in flux. Why is this acting flux actually? Because the simple-minded picture is that you have focal adhesion associated with the contractile stress fibers and it is growing because it experiencing the pulling force. Now you are saying that they are growing not because of this pulling, but because of epsilon flux. But because of federating flux, what is the acting the flux I you sign from you have a soft turn at the fo the acting will polymerize at front, right? But by itself is not going to push the scale front. For most of them we will just fall back. That's the active fast. So it is because of friction of this actin that polymerized at the lithium age and then going back. Going back. Going back mostly because of polymerization, even though mys and if the still participate due to the friction of this movement of cortical action through the focal adhesion of alcohol, yes. All I'm saying here is that is we don't need the acting we don't need the actual mass of activity for the active function. For that influence. Because polymerization by itself making it back in a relatively narrow when we report the part, not over the entire point. Not over to the point. Over minute false over to the answer is yes, they are roughly on the same. Is yes, they are roughly on the same order. That's totally true. And I mean, that's how they interpret the force bound. Confused about a couple of things, but just one question, maybe. What do you mean exactly by cortical tension? Because the lipid, of course, is under no tension, right? If you have negative and positive curvature and ruffles and all that kind of stuff, so there clearly is no tension in the lipid. That's true. The cause of attention here, we mainly refer to the tendency. The tendency that the cell can do hold the cell shape. Sure, but it's based on the cortex. I mean, since the actin cortex. Yes, the cortex titan mainly comes from the actin cortex. It's not really the membrane titan by itself. If I have to put in a number, the membrane titan maybe constitute 10% of the quadratic potential in fun. And so there's a top layer of quadrature and there's a bottom layer. Recording attention and there's a bottom there, there's a difference or audio vision? In current model, we did not distinguish that. We just say that the overall tendency that the stellar will hold out shape, that's kind of rum-thound effect. That's the simplest model we could build at first. Do you want to say that if cells do not form focal adhesion for some reason, some kind of a good thing? That vision by some reason, some conditions. It will not respond to this. Yes. Yes. And we know that because when you initially, the perceived disrupt the focal gene formation by culturing the cell on cover sneak without the ECM. The enhanced spreading is completely gone. Just I remember, but you of course know this that simultaneous. Course, no one is bad. Simultaneously with your paper in nature physics, there was a paper in nature by Konstantinopoulos, which also noticed this effect of this positivity on cell migration. Are you sure in all kind of situations that he described, there are no focal adhesions? I don't know. Because he took the protocol and the cell act. But in our hands, we never saw some of the effects that we saw. So there is some open question there. But I think.
