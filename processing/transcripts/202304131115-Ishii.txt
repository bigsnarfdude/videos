All right, let's begin. This is the last talk of the morning session. Welcome you to Taka Mushin. Is going to talk about on the connections and logos for the commons in Africa. Okay, thank you very much. So first of all, I'd like to thank the organizers of this wonderful conference for inviting me and giving me an opportunity within the talk here. So today I will talk about it. I want to talk about the connectless locus for the conception of a link. And well, so here is today's agenda. So basically I will talk about two topics today. And the first topic is about the construction of the first example of the complex hennomap, furious set is titably and connected. Well, so the importance is the connectedness of the filio set and it is non-planned, meaning that you cannot obtain this. In that you cannot obtain this dynamics at a small perturbation of any dynamics. And the second topic is about the lever-seen mapper algorithm to verify disconnectivity of the media set of XNF. And at the end of my talk, as I combine these two results, I will explain you a certain topological property of the connectedness locus for the connectedness founding. Okay, so by the way, this is a joint work scheme in progress with Z. Joint work still in progress with me arrived recently to token striped technology. Right, so everyone in this classroom will know what they are, but just to repeat very shortly, so the simplest one I'm looking at is the complex genome family, which has two complex parameters, C and B. So its parameter space is where C times C are crossed. And a little bit more generalized family is the generalized context normal family, where I replace the quadratic form by a more general polynomial of the idea, is two. And the yet more general class of maps is the finite composition of the generalized complexional map. And I will call it a polynomial detail morphic non-C2. And for this map, its degree means that it is defined. It's defined as a product of the degrees of the one-dimensional polynomial power. Okay, so that's the standard definition. And well, this is also okay, I can guess. So by k plus and k minus, I mean the set of all points with forward or backward orbit is bounded in C2, and the boundaries are denoted by J plus and J minus. And throughout my talk, well, here we But there is no maximum could be met. So by the durial set of F, I mean the intersection of Z minus and Z plus. And in particular, when I want to look at the context Henon map, majority context Henon map, we write the Juliac to be J sub C D. And from time to time, I say I simply say that a map is hypoglidic when the its Julius set is a hypocrite set. Hyperlink set. And finally, I also look at the greens function defined by this way. Okay, so this is a picture of the Juria set drawn by Shimihiro Shiki from Kyoto University. So that's the Juria set of the classical choice of anonym. So of course this is a big time scene. So, of course, this is a picture in C2, but if you take the real slides by R2 of this studio set, you have the iconic picture of the classical henon strange attractor. But you can also observe that if you go into C2 and look at the Turia set, we have a form like this. But because this map can be regarded as a kind of incomplete horseshoe, so some portion of the So some portion of the force to pass to escape from the real frame. So that appears as their forms here and also it remains here, here, etc. etc. Yes? I think so. Okay, so the second example, this one is a conservative case. So here you have a complex mixture of the chaotic C and the quasi-chaotic part. So this is another interesting situation of the DBSF. Okay, so the first example of a high fabric canona is uh constructed for Nice and Siboni. Constructed for nice and Siboni and the Haba reports and the others. It's the following. So take an expanding quadratic polynomial, and then if the Tefouian determinant V is sufficiently small and close to the zero, then the corresponding quadratic kennel map is hydoublic. And moreover, in this case, the penal map on each duratape is vertically coordinated to the project shift map on the projective limit. Project will limit the new set of PC. So, this is a result. The second part is actually by Hubbard and Post. And together with John Smiley, I think they are two L's. So we get a kind of formulation of this DNS, and as a byproduct, we are able to give an explicit bound of the DNS. Explicit bound for the smallness of the absolute value of B. And for example, if you take C to be zero, then if the absolute value of B is strictly smaller than 0.2, then the corresponding Handel map is about that. Okay, so well, the map in this class is not dynamically so interesting because it is conjugate to the one-dimensional dynamics. So, I'd like to introduce. So I'd like to introduce the following notion. We say that F is non-quite planar, that is, the map is essentially, it has essentially two-dimensional dynamics, meaning that if F is not quite continuous with a projective limit for any expanding polynomial B. So, one question is whether such a hyperbolic example really exists or not. And quite a moment ago, I proved that But long ago, I proved that the cubic kernel map given by this parameter is a hyperbolic of the UV set and actually non-plana. But unfortunately, its UV set is connected. So, but unfortunately, this is a cubic kernel map and it does not have a connected Julia set because of some technical reasons. So now my first result today. Result today is that the Henon map, the quadratic Henon map with this particular parameter, C is equal to minus 1.29 and B is 0.23, is actually hyperlic and non-planar and the duriously connected. And in fact, it has a two-affected cycles of every two months. Okay, so this is. Okay, so this is a picture of the Julia Z, and probably you can observe that this bottom part looks like the Julia Z of the basilica. Yes? All these pictures, what are we looking at? Is that part two cross-bottom dimensionary axis or which part of the C2 is this? Well, so this is a projection to the two-dimensional screen. Your screen, part three. No, no, it's projection. Yeah, protection. Okay, so if you look at this bottom part, this part design will be a basic UDL set, and the above part looks like an airplane UDL set. So, in some sense, the dynamics of this handle mark is a kind of mixed. So this Heno mark is a kind of mixture of the zero curve and the and we will see what it's actually going on in data form. Alright, so how to prove this? So basically there are three or four small ideas. The first point is that we first have a Julia set, but a family of product sets in C2 with certain core fields which are defined And quantities which are defined by foreign power metrics. That I will be called the foreman power box. And that implies this is a tool to prove the complexity of it. And by looking at the transition between the boxes, you can easily see that there are two attractive sizes of table two and three. And by using this part, you can show that the F is not lana. And the third part. And the third part is the, well, in my talk, apart from 2018, it means that I will introduce the notion of connectivity graph, which describes the connectivity intermediate with that by analyzing that graph, it is possible to prove the connectivity of To improve the connectivity of the USA. And overall, I need certain computer assistants, but not so heavy. Okay, so let me start with a proof of algorithm. Should look at the computer. No, that's I think it's Thank you. Okay, so to start with, uh let me start with the simple situation. Start with the simplest situation. So, what is this one variable? So, we first take two domains, say D sub x and d sub y, and consider its product. And I will denote it by calligraphic A, and take a point in the product step. And at that point, we define a column field display, where as a strict value of certain domain, we present a colon current. If it isn't a form parameter, okay, so let me draw a picture. So, for example, if you have a holy disk like this and take a point in the middle, then the cone field is like this. But if you approach to the vertical boundary, To the vertical boundary, this gets wider in view of equilibrium, and if you approach to the horizontal boundary, it becomes narrower. So, this is a form of a field defined in this product. And well, there is a nice verifiable condition which implies the invariance and the expansion. The invariance and the expansion of this NP. More precisely, so let's take two ampere boxes, say domain box and range box, and if the kernel map restricted to the domain box satisfies certain conditions, which I call the cost mapping condition and the non-tangency condition. Well, so roughly, I don't want to give you the precise definition of these two conditions. Precise definition of these two conditions. But roughly speaking, the crossed mapping condition is an analogy of the polynomial like mapping condition in dimension one. And the non-tangency condition means that the domain does not contain a critical point. And the conclusion is that the corresponding pairs of point is invariant and expanding. And moreover, these two And uh the overall these two conditions are actually checking quite good. Yes, we can, but the boundary is much strictly outside. Okay, so that's the single point parabox case. But for the HANA map in the server, we have to construct many point parabolic. I actually reconstructed six quantum fire boxes as in this cartoon picture. Okay, so there are six control boxes. One is here, one is here, and one is here, here, and here, and here. And for example, this box has two holes: the blue one and red one. And this box has one holes. And this box has one pole, the red pole, that is. And in the after it, some of these boxes have overlaps. For example, this one and this one have overlaps here. And I choose these boxes in such a way that the union of these guys covers the ESF and maps appropriate choices of player boxes. Uh here are the boxes, uh the cross-mapping conditions and the uh non-tangent conditions that is false. Are the boxes actually parallel to the XYZ? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's a quite important point. But before going to that, I want to mention that well if you trace this red box, uh this red hole is not into this one, and this red hole is not into this one. Red fall is mapping to this one. So, by a C hypoisy of the horrid disk, you can find the attractive cycle of period 2 inside this red hole. And if you trace the blue one, you can find the attractive cycle of period 3 in the blue hole. So, that's the mechanism why you have two upper cycles. And yeah, I want to show you here. I want to show Matthia. I I want to show not just the real life, but at least but you see uh you know the vertices and the original axis are very far from the prior one and actually I define some of the boxes as the curated image of a projected boxes by the handleman so that it gets very much non-linear by things. Okay, so here you have one Okay, so here you have one project report, you have another one, and three, four, five, six, six steps. So this is a picture in R2. So how do they look in C2? I have no method. No, no, no, I don't want to show it, but I mean, I do describe it in words. But so basically, um Yeah, the starting point is to it's a kind of projective path. I mean a disk in the x-axis and a disk in the y-axis and you take the product with respect to certain projected polynomials and for this blue band and green band I iterated twice. Yeah. So some of the boxes in this picture, here are some other boxes in this picture. Uh yes, yes. So which are the first boxes? Well, so for that one, the the mid one is the first replay to that. Is the first three plate of black and this blue one is the present image of this occur one yeah and this blue one green one and the twice detected image of some project boxes here so it's you don't see yeah I didn't draw the boxes yeah and it's real symmetric And it's real symmetric, right? These boxes? Yes. Yes. Is that eliminating at all? Just take the real slice in these boxes? Like, does that give you kind of a simpler view of what these boxes look like? If you just take the real slice? Yeah, I took a real slice. Oh, that's a real slice? Okay, so um so So at this point, I have an expansion of hydroborosity when you choose a pair of domain box and range box. But as I told you, there are some overlaps between the boxes. So if you take a point in the overlap, you have more than one point. One is from, for example, if you take a point in the overlap of blue one and the black one, then And the black one. Then, at this point, we have a cone associated with this blue box and another cone associated with this black box. So, the config is not globally when we find the other. So, the problem is to patch up these configs into one. So, you see, it's like a definition of a manifold. You have a You have a local data local chart, and on the OPA lab, you require certain conditions to make the global definition. And in my case, I take just the union of the associated form and take the minimum as the corresponding norm. And then a non-trivial fact is that this intersection is non-trivial because as I showed you, intersection of two boxes may be very much twisted, like this red box and blue box. So no emptiness of the intersection is a non-figure. But this can be again used We again could use by using the cross-marking condition and the penguins in condition as well. So, suppose that we have red box and blue box like this, and then in most cases, I can find another black box like this, so that the transition from black to red box and the black to blue box all satisfy the cross-mapping condition and the non-fantasy condition. So, by the invariant, So by the invariance, this red cone contains the image of this black cone, and similarly, this blue cone contains the image of the black cone. So it follows that the intersection of the font contains the image of a certain form. But here this is non-name. So this way you can so uh you can construct a global uh form field, see intersection. See intersection with a normal intersection, and one change check that this keeps in here. So that's the end of the good program. All right, then next, how do we prove the non-plane ID? Well, so it's not so difficult. So assume that my product is hand-on-bound. My product normal is pondinate on its double set to the project limit of certain expanding polynomial P, then by computing the entropy, you can immediately know that the degree of the one-dimensional polynomial P is two. So it has at most one attractive cycle V C. Okay. On the other hand, as I told you, my map C naught, V naught has two attractive cycles of two and three state V. And also note that the cardinality of n-puric points are the same for the Hennel map and the one-dimensional formula. And again, due to the hydroplicity, we may count these cardialities without multiplicity. So by comparing the numbers of those points in the previous set. So again, here I use a fact from BetPost Marie number one that Might be number one that any herd points are either subtle in the ULZ or atopic cycles. And of course, a number of earlier points are preserved by pointing as a unit Z, we arrive at the connection. So this is a way to not find it. But the last point is the connectivity that we just said. For that, I would like to introduce a couple For that, I would like to introduce a kind of label graph, calendar as follows. So, sigma is a set of labels of an hour box. So, it's it's zero upper, zero, sorry, zero up, zero down, one up, right, one left, two, right, two left. So, there are six symbols. And for any analysis word of n, sorry, this is n plus one. Sorry, this is n plus one. I define a sub a node data a n this way. So this is a set of points whose generate by f is i know that at i n okay so the vertices of the graph consist of such sets a naught dot data i n and i lay Letter I n, and I literally write that last letter I n. And I draw edge between two vertices if the intersection contains a part of the stable manifold of the fixed point. So P is the fixed point in the third quadrant in L2. And I call this Debian graph D is N, the connectivity graph and this family point. And this family of horrible cities. And the key claim is that this connectivity graph is connected for any n. So I will show you what's going on for small n. So by looking at my how-to picture, you can first draw the connectivity here for n to be zero. It's like this. Okay, then I looked at the transitions, which satisfy the cross-mapping condition. Which satisfy the cross-mapping condition and the non-tangency conditions, which are drawn by red arrows in this picture. Then, for example, let's see. So, actually, I didn't see how you got this first picture here. What do you mean something contains a stable part of the statement? You know, your condition before this line. What does it mean that it contains part as a variable disk? That's a very good question. Well, what is that? So, for example, K id of data IN is like a box, box like this, and the other one is also a box like this. And well, often you can find a piece of stable mindful between so these are boxes in your six these are your six boxes. Or six boxes or I partition according to this. So, what is what is O 0 U 0 for which? These are these are symbols or labels to each one particular symbol. I see, so which which I see, so so that's the names of boundary parts? Yes, yes, Okay, so the connectivity graph number zero is like this. And the red arrows represent the good transitions because it has to satisfy the cost marking conditions and no transition conditions. And well, for example, the only transitions to come to D down is from one up. So I replace this vertex. Replace this vertex by one R in the next step, like this. And from this vertex, there are sorry to this by inductively defined. So I replace O U and O V by a subgraph 2R to L to R to 0 U that's because 0 U yeah or U at 0 U is mapped to 2 L to R and itself. So I and well this transition is a degree two transition but it's like Two transitions, but it's like a solenoid. So if you take a pullback, you only take one connecting component here. But the transition from zero U to 2R is like a horseshoe. So if you take a pullback of this component to this, you have two distinct components. So I replace 0U by a sequence of 2R, 2L, 2R to U. So this part is replaced by this tree. And you do the same thing for And you do the same thing for every vertex of the MOS to get G1. So this is the picture of G1. And you repeat the same thing to get G2. And I hope you believe that this holds for every end and and that the uh the uh connectivity graph is connected for all things. But actually this uses some complicated induction, but it works. Or an induction of works. Connectivity graph is connected. Yes, so you apply the same home at the moment. Yes. So, how is it complicated? If you apply always the same rule, it doesn't seem so complicated. You're disconnected. Uh well, it turns out that it's not so easy. Yeah. Okay. Okay well so once you know that the connectivity graph is connected um it's an easy exercise uh it is an easy exercise to show that the previous set is connected. But here you use a very elementally state part and if you have a decreasing sequence of connected compact set then its union is that's the proof of the connected union. Oh, yeah, right. So, um, so this is actually this is the end of the first main result. And so, let me let me put some comments, remarks, and problems. So, according to a result of a bit from Smiley in number seven paper, so our UPSA can be UVSA can be described as the quotient space with a unit solid. So it should be an interesting problem to compute equilibrium solution very explicitly. Because one possible thought is that it might be related to the kind of combinatorial position of the parameter C node in the parameter space. So that's why I'm interested. I think it's interesting to impute this equivalence relation specifically. And well, another interesting problem is to construct about three-like objects for this map and the create quantum review function and the compute automaton. And more probably important problem is to find the The problem is to find more examples of a similar uh university. So I'll be handling okay, so that's the end of two computer one. So implementer. So um in fact uh I as I show you I used a family of boxes in C2 but this work is not the first one to use such a family of boxes and actually the paper of Bedford and Smiley in two Of Bitford and Smiley in 2006 is, I think, the first paper where it's a kind of family of boxes was efficiently used. So this theorem, so I let H sub R is be the real hostial locust, and P sub R is the real maximal. So we are T, R2. And then these two parameters also. These two parameter rosa can be nicely described by a real analytic function from the pubian axis to the translation axis C. So here you have a big white region, so that is the interior of this region, is a hyperlico region, and if you take the closure, you have the maximum topography. So, and in fact, Bethany Smiley showed this part when So this part when the absolute value of P is more than 0.05 or 06, and together with Z, I extended this document of Z. And in particular, this provides an answer to the question of Pierre yesterday. So he presented a conjecture of fan streaming saying that the equip entropy set. entropy z is connected and connected and at least for the maximum value group 2 it is true for the minimum. Alright now let's shift to the second main result. So in the toiletic family you can decide the connectivity or disconnectivity of the data set by looking at a signal or bit. By looking at the single orbit, that's the orbit of the picture point. But in the complex anomaly, for the complex henum map, the story is not so easy. And our second main result is that we are able to create efficient numerical algorithms which verify rigorously if a given complex genoma has a disconnected individual. Okay. So well, this is not assuming hyperbolicity, right? No. So this algorithm heavily depends on the result of deep photon Snowden as follows. So let's take a uniformization of unstable manifold of a photo deep potential, take Q, which I would not quite five. Result is not quite five. And the starting point is this result. So assume that the Helm mouse is volume increasing. And if there is a golden curve in the uniformized coordinate and the point in the interior of gamma, of the Jordan curve, so that in such a way that, so if you look at the You look at the value of the green function in the loop, and the minimum of the green function, a value of the value of the green function of the loop, is richly larger than the value of the green function at this interior point. Then the Julia set is this. So basically we implemented this theorem into our computer program. So how did we do that? So how did we do that? So first of all, Romain put a nice following path. So he put the existence of a critical point, yeah, existence of a critical point, a central point of the Green's function when the Jacobian determinant is less than or equal to one in moderas and the PPJ is not connected. So for the So, for example, in this picture, you can find here the solid point. And then you integrate the gradient vector of the Brilliant function to the upward, then you have this curve and also you integrate to the other side this curve and you connect these two ends of the path by the equal. ends of the path by the peak potential curve. And similarly, starting again starting from this saddle point, you integrate the vector field to the downward to find the interior point here. Then by applying a previous theorem, you can make yourself sure that they are responding to yourself in this method. Okay, so it looks that this computation is easy, but actually it's not so. So let me show you again in a real line. So this is a picture of the slice of the TVSA. And it looks connected, but actually it's not. So I first enlarge somewhere here. Oh, and have a speaker like this. Well, still it looks connected, but I again enlighten somewhere here. It's disconnected. And again, if I enlight this button, you see there are lots of lots of thoughts formed, so that the actual is quite wavy. Quite wavy. So I think you can imagine that this computation is very clear. And what is worse is that, but this is for fixed map. So in order to avoid this wrong, you have to divide this curve into very tiny pieces. And moreover, if you want to prove that the Julia set is disconnected. The unique set is disconnected for certain set of parameters. So, you are now in the parameter space, and you want to show that for every parameter inside certain set of, say, size of order one, you have to chop this set into smaller pieces. And you have to verify this procedure to each hypertube in C2. But in generic situation, the size of this hypertube we can take is something like 10 to the minus 6. So since you are in dimension 4, in order to verify for all hypertubes of this size, you have to treat a 10 to the 24 hypertubes. So this is a kind of Q is a non-f So this is a kind of huge amount of numbers. We have a problem of computer. Okay, so anyway, I missed last button. We have a computer able to do this computer boxes alpha stations. Thank you. Okay. Done my conclusion yet. Alright, anyway, Alright, anyway, because of this kind of difficulty of computational time and money. But there is one important trick by which we can reduce the computation time. So that is an option of getting to the trick, let me tell you that in order to get the estimate for the green function by a standard estimate, you can You can estimate the G plus from above and below by the X iterated image of the point. So the point is to estimate the X and above and vigorous. Alright, now the trick to the trick to reduce the computation time. Reduce the computation time is the Silof boundary idea. So basically, the Silof boundary is the phase where it's often the proper subset of the topological boundary where for all the three harmonic functions its maximum or minimum is obtained. So the point, for example, if you look at the So if you look at the bi-disc V2, then its zero boundary is much smaller than its proportional boundary. So it's a two-dimensional torus. So if you try to estimate certain really harmonic functions, such as the Green's function, where it is positive, you can only look at the two-dimensional function. So the computation reduces from a four-dimensional computation to a two-dimensional computation. Computation into two-dimensional computation. So, this is a great game for us. And well, by using this technique, we actually do the following. So, take a 4 distance in the parameter space, say P sub C times P sub D, and fix a parameterization of the Jordan curve and fix a parameter P, P naught. And then I look Then I look at this X sub n as a function of the parameter defined on this qualities. And well, you can easily show that this Xn is a homomorphic function C and V, so you can apply to this function the of zero function to gain the computation of time. So that's basically the idea. That's basically the idea for the second statement, the algorithm. So, combining these two theorems, we eventually have this consequence. So, recall that by calligraphic N, I mean the connectedness locus, the mandate process for the complex non-family, and the main statement is that, well, right now, I just Well, right now I cannot show that n is not connected, but at least for the real size of the mandible set, it is not connected. So the proof is that the connected example in the first main results is somewhere here, and the small perturbation example is somewhere here. So this is a real pranetta picture, by the way. And by using the Using the algorithm, the second domain, state domain, I can show that this loop is in the complement of the multiple. So sorry that the coloring is opposite function. The white, the colored phase is where we were able to show that the new set is connected. So you can take a look like. loop like this which is indeed a reversal loop in the complement of the language all right and so let me show you a zoom up of this phrase so you see there are some very um weak paths Weak paths like this, like this, like this. And actually, we were rigorously able to show that you can find a task here, which is in the complement of the Android. Very narrow task, as you see in this one. So, in order to verify that, let me show you a complex slice of this picture. So probably this is the A frame this is the A frame picture where C is fixed to be minus 1.23 and so this is the real axis and it looks that you cannot go through from below to above because this gap thing looks con uh connected. Connected, but you zoom up some part, then you get like this, and again you zoom up some part, then you have a gate. And actually, this point is where I chose in the previous cell, at previous chorality, and the vibration is showing that this is not in the mandible sex. Under process of the single okay, so because of this numerical observation, we arrive at the conjecture that the Mandaro set itself is not connected as a subset of complex parameter space. And the point is that the first point is that the algorithm we have developed does not require that the loop is intended to pass. So it applies basically to all parameters, all complex parameters. And as this it shows, the corona includes the kind of hardest part of the temperature, because this is somehow the narrowest part in this diaspora. So we proved that we already proved the hardest part of this movement. Okay, so let me show tell you the current state of R. So in the orally, we only treated the real slides of the mandible set, but actually we have explicitly constructed a sequence or sequence pair that separates my example and the small database with example in the complex parameter space. The complex parameter space, and it seems that this sphere is contained in the complement of the modulus. But not yet. So of course our remaining task is to apply our algorithm, which is to be spared, to verify legal C that it is in the end. But however, as I showed you here, the folding space is kind of huge. Space is kind of huge, so we still need a tremendous amount of computational time. So, right now we need to speed up 10 to the two or 10 to the three times faster. But according to our estimate, in order to finish our proof, we need 10 years. We really need to speed up. Alright, so have we got one time? Oh, what do you have time? So, could you give me two minutes? Yeah, sure. I have two more pages. So, okay, so our corollary looks like bad news, but not actually it. So, because they suggest that the continent of the Mandel process has complicated topology and which may have some dynamical information. And actually, there is a conjecture by Chris Piper, which means that. By twisty path, which means that the action on the fundamental group of the whole SU locust, but not the complement of the mandible set, to the group of zip-to-tonamic observability sequences, reflects certain verification structures of the complex bit. And unfortunately, his PhD thesis has some undefined mathematical terminology, but quite recently, Thomas Witter, his He's a student of John Smiley, who is now beaten in Tuesday University, gave a more careful numerical analysis and provided better formulation as well. So it takes the impassive data. To conclude my talk, let me tell you one more thing shortly. When I look at the picture of the Julia Seaton, The Julia set or multiple set of the complex MV, I often feel frustrated because it is a two-dimensional image and it's hard to imagine what is going on in the actual C2, the real four-dimensional space. So some years ago, I launched a theorization project by using virtual reality system. Virtual reality system. So, this is a group of people working on algorithmatics and the virtual reality system, including Hiroyuki Ino. And for example, we have created a kind of four-dimensional version of child CMD computer-based design. And also, another thing is that we have constructed the algorithm to see a four-dimensional space by combining the motion parallax and the Motion parallax and binuclear disparity. So, by using these tools, it should be interesting to look at the accepted genoma and the exotic domain. And well, this is biological locus of the alternative iteration d square plus a and d square plus b, which if you have any questions, please ask in the man chat. But anyway, what But anyway, what UT hero found is that there's a hole inside. So, this is, I think, the first discovery by using virtual reality systems. So, once he is able to prove that there is a hole, I think this will be the first theorem which is written by this.
