I forgot the word equivariant. Right. Hagar genus is additive. Great. Well, thank you so much to Mario and Jennifer for inviting me to speak and to all of you for coming to this talk. I do wish we could be together in Mexico, if for no other reason than that I could escape these awful caterpillars which have invaded my town where they shed My town, where they shed their toxic spines, and they just the spines just sort of float through the air. And you come in, you can't see them, but you come in contact with them, and then you break out in this awful rash. So, but I'm not going to tell you any more about caterpillars. I will instead tell you about this ongoing project I've had with Maggie Tomova to understand the additivity and non-additivity of certain kinds of not and three-manifold invariants. Invariance and with a special focus today on equivariant Hagard splittings. So by way of introduction, I'll remind you of some sort of general philosophical things. So, you know, if we have two manifolds or if we have knots inside manifolds, we can, of course, take their connected sums. And the basic question is: how do various kinds of How do various kinds of three-manifold or not invariants behave under connected sum? And there are lots of classical examples of this. For instance, we have, there we go, Hagar genus. So every three-manifold, let's say compact orientable, but extends to other situations as well. Every three-manifold can be built by gluing to handle bodies or more generally. Two handlebodies or more generally compression bodies together. So, for instance, here I have a genus 3 handlebody, and I'm going into another genus 3 handlebody, and I get a 3 manifold when I do this. And the Hagar genus is so called G of M is just the minimum of all the genre of Hagard splittings. Splittings. So H a Hagar surface. And Haakon proved that Hagar genus is additive under connected sum. The object that corresponds to Hagar splittings, but for knots, are bridge splittings of knots. And so this is due to Schubert. And the way you And the way you create a bridge splitting of a knot is you start with a three-ball and some boundary parallel arcs. Inside the three-ball, you take two copies of it and you glue it together by a homeomorphism of the boundary, taking the punctures to the punctures. And so you can visualize this in R3, where your bridge sphere is that horizontal plane. And the and And so the bridge number of your knot is just the minimal, maybe I should say, half the minimal number of punctures of a bridge sphere. And Schubert showed that the invariant bridge number minus one is additive under a connected sum of knots. This can be generalized to higher genus bridge splittings of knots in other three manifolds. So, for example, if we have a three-manifold with a genus three Hagard surface, we can imagine putting our knot in relation to the Hagard surface so that the Hagard surface divides our knot into boundary parallel arcs. And we can define Arcs, and we could define, say, a higher genus bridge number. And that is not in general additive under a connected sum. A related notion is that of tunnel number. And so the classical way to define tunnel number is to say that you have your knot, and you think about the minimal number of arcs that you need to add to your knot so that there's a sequence of. Your knot so that there's a sequence of edge slides and isotopes taking the resulting spatial graph to a planar spatial graph. And so in this example, if I contract this edge and then expand it differently, you can turn that region into that picture and this part into this part. And then an isotopy takes you to that planar graph. So this knot has tunnel number less than or equal to 2. equal to two. So total number of k is the minimal number of arcs needed to make that picture work. And maybe a better definition is that it is the genus of the exterior of the knot minus one. And you can generalize these to a tunnel number of spatial graphs as well. Graphs as well. So, one question that has been on my mind for a while is: Is there any way to use invariants that are additive under a connected sum to study invariants that aren't additive under a connected sum? Oh, I should mention that tunnel number is not additive either. So these last two things. These last two invariants are not additive. Okay. So, is there any way to use? So, is there any way to use some sort of additive invariant to study non-additivity? So, maybe it's helpful to actually think about how we could show an invariant is additive under connected sum. And, you know, there are probably many ways to do this. But if you even just think about a very simple question, which in general, of course, is extremely difficult, something like crossing number, right? Crossing number, right? So here's a composite knot, and we actually know what the crossing number of that knot is. And one way we can figure out what its crossing number is is to appeal to a result of Monascos, which says that because I have an alternating diagram of my knot, the fact that it's composite can be witnessed in the diagram. So, in other words, we can actually see the summing sphere in some way. The summing sphere in some way. And so, in general, whatever, you know, maybe we're not interested in diagrams, but whatever kind of situation we're in, we might hope to see a summing sphere that witnesses our manifold or our not as a connected sum. And the just by way of foretaste here. Just by way of foretaste here, what I'm going to mean by C is that the summing sphere is going to show up as a thin level in some sort of decomposition of the knot or three manifold. So for my example here, you'll notice that this is a bridge sphere for the figure eight knot. I have those two unknotted arcs, and then I have unknotted arcs here. And then I have a knotted arcs here, which if I close it up to actually see the figure eight knot, we see that I have a two-bridge sphere for that. And this red thing is a two-bridge sphere for the trefoil. And then they're separated by my summing sphere. And we can ask, well, can we always arrange that this happens? And the answer is going to be if we use kind of the right definitions, we can. Right definitions, we can. So let me tell you about the construction that Maggie and I have, which is, you know, I should say, builds on the work of so many people in three-manifold theory and not theory, many of whom are here. So you know who you are. The way I'm going to phrase this, though, is in terms of handle decompositions. So let me define a zero handle to be Find a zero handle to be either a three ball that doesn't have any bit of not in it. And I should say I'm also going to do this for spatial graphs. So I can have my zero handle could be a three ball with no spatial graph or not inside of it. It could be a three ball with an unknotted arc inside of it. Because I'm going to work with spatial graphs. It can also be a three ball that has an unknotted tree inside of it. Tree inside of it where my tree has a single interior vertex. If you like, this thing is the cone on finitely many points. And then I'm also going to have this, to handle things with boundary, I'm also going to have this other kind of zero handle where what I've done, this is a schematic depiction, what I've done is this thing is a closed surface, closed. Surface, closed-orientable surface, possibly disconnected. This is f times i, and one side of it is called the positive boundary, and the other side is called the negative boundary. And then on these other zero handles, the boundary that you see is all the positive boundary, and the negative boundary is empty for those. Okay, so this. Okay, so those are zero handles. I then want to think about attaching one handles. And there are going to be two types of one handles. So one type of one handle is just the traditional one handle that doesn't have any bit of not or spatial graph in it. And then the other type of one handle is going to have its core as As part of the spatial graph, or not. So those are my two types of one handles. And then we are going, just like in the classical situation when we create handle bodies or compression bodies, we're going to form a new kind of compression body, which I'm going to call a VPC to abbreviate here, which stands for vertex punctured compression body. And it's, I kind of regret the It's, I kind of regret the choice of name, but anyway, maybe we're stuck with it now. And where it came from was the fact that if you puncture this vertex and treat it as a boundary component, then this picture is really the same as that picture, where you have F as a sphere. So here's some examples of VPCs. So take your favorite closed-orientable surface times an interval, maybe include. times an interval, maybe include some vertical arcs. Here's a zero handle of that form. Here's another zero handle of that form. And then just arbitrarily supposed to attach a one handle like this. And that's this kind of one handle. I attach this kind of one handle as well, creating a component here, which is a core loop of that handlebody. Here's another example. So you might Here's another example. So you might ask: how do you recognize if you have a VPC or not? And the idea is that for a VPC, you can find these disks, basically the co-cores of the one handles. And these disks are either zero or once punctured. And if you compress along them, you need to get zero handles. So, you know, I guess. Handles. So, you know, I guess the way to say it is: you have a compact orientable three-manifold. One boundary component, well, it has to have boundary. One boundary component is designated as boundary plus, and there's a collection of disks with boundary lying in boundary plus. The disks are all zero or ones punctured by the graph. And when you compress, you get the model pieces there. So, for example, So, for example, compressing along this disk gives you two of those joined by a one-handle that form. Likewise, over here, for this last example, there's kind of a disk, a once-punctured disc that lives like this, and another one that lives here. So, if you compress along those two once-punctured discs, you will get a piece like this that's disconnected. A piece like this coming from right here, and you can see that you've used two one handles of that form. So VPCs inherit boundary plus and boundary minus. And I should say that when you attach the one handles, just like when you're creating traditional compression bodies, the one handles always have to be attached to the positive boundary. We never attach one handles to the negative boundary. Attach one handles to the negative boundary. So maybe I'll just pause there and ask if there are any questions about what a VPC is. Are we good? Okay, excellent. So what we are, I don't know, I should say too, I guess because I'm sharing my screen, I can't see the chat. So, you know, you should feel free to just unmute and interrupt me if you have a question. Unmute and interrupt me if you have a question. Um, so these are the VPCs, and now we're going to stack these things together in a way analogous to the generalized Hagard splittings of Charlman and Thompson for three manifolds. And so I should say, I mean, what's the innovation here, which is really due to Maggie from her PhD thesis work, and that is using these once-punctured disks. Disks just like we would use compressing disks. But kind of the miracle is that even though I don't think when Maggie first started thinking about these things, she was thinking in terms of orbifolds, that these VPCs really do correspond to things called orbifold handle bodies or compression bodies. So, but I will get to that later. Okay, so what we're going to do now is build our spatial graph inside our three-manifold. Spatial graph inside our three-manifold. And so the M here is the three-manifold, and T is a spatial graph. And we're going to build this by stacking these VPCs together. And the so the VP, the multiple VP bridge surface, and the terminology is modeled in that of Hayashi Shimakawa, who Who were highly influential in our approach. So, the multiple VP bridge surface is H, which is a closed-orientable surface in the three-manifold transverse to the graph. And its components can be sorted into two types: thick surfaces and Surfaces and thin surfaces. And each component of H is either thick or thin. There's no component that's both. And when you stack the VPCs together, the boundary plus of the VPCs are glued together. So, for instance, this thing represents the positive boundary of this VPC and this VPC, where they've been glued together. So, boundary plus. So boundary plus become the thick surfaces, and boundary minus and the boundary of the manifold are the thins. Or sorry, I should say the other way around. So the boundary minus of the VPCs are the thin surfaces together with the boundary of the manifold. We're going to think We're going to think about a certain kind of orientation on these things. So I want to give each element of each component a transverse orientation. So I'll see. So H is transversely oriented. And that means that there's this dual digraph. That there's this dual digraph where we take a vertex for each VPC and join them by an edge if they are adjacent across a thick or thin surface. And there's a certain sort of compatibility. So, like if this thick surface is oriented that way, the neighboring thin surface has to be oriented that way as well. Oriented that way as well. And the requirement is that the dual digraph is acyclic. So the components of H can be non-separating, but they kind of all fit together in a separating sort of way. And then we can just look at the set of all these things. So I guess. I guess I should say oriented multiple VP bridge surfaces up to, and the equivalence is just isotopy transverse to the spatial graph. So think about all those things. So this is a way of building spatial graphs inside three manifolds, and it generalizes. So I should point out to spatial graphs. I should point out two special cases. So a Hagard surface for M is an element of, well, once you assign an orientation to it, it's an element if you don't have a spatial graph. A bridge surface. For a knot K inside a three-manifold M, either in the sense of Schubert if you're working in S3, or in the sense of Dahl if you're in some other three-manifold. Again, once you assign a transverse orientation, it's one of these things. In both these cases, you have a single thick surface. Single thick surface and no thin surface. Okay. So we can use this construction to define some new invariants. And if we do it right, we'll actually get additive invariants. So, here is one particular way of doing this. So, for one of these multiple VP bridge surfaces, I'll define the net Euler characteristic to be the negative Euler characteristic of the thick surfaces plus the Euler characteristic of the thin surfaces. So I like working with positive numbers, so I'll generally always work with the negative Euler characteristic. And then I'll define something called the net extent. Define something called the net extent to just be that net Euler characteristic and then take the punctures into account. So I'll take the number of punctures on the thick surfaces minus the number of punctures on the thin surfaces and divide by two just for the heck of it. Well, for reasons you'll see. So basic example, if you have a one-bridge sphere for the unknot in S3, it's networking. In S3, its net extent is zero. And in general, if you have a knot in B bridge position, the net extent of that bridge sphere is going to be B minus one. If you have a Hagard surface for a knot complement, like here I took that example from before, and I just inflated the knot together with the tunnels. So this blue surface is a So, this blue surface is a Hagard surface for the non-exterior. The net extent there is just going to be the negative Euler characteristic divided by two, which is the number of tunnels that we've added. So this counting starts to interpolate between things that are additive, like bridge number minus one, and things that are not additive, like And things that are not additive, like tunnel number. And we can define, turn this into a invariant of the three-manifold graph pair in the usual way by just minimizing over everything. And we find it helpful to kind of stratify the invariance by Euler characteristic. Oops, and I guess what I should have said here was. Here was that we are minimizing the net extent of these multiple VP bridge surfaces. And if our invariant is stratified by x, we're only considering multiple VP bridge surfaces whose net Euler characteristic is at most x. So x is always an even integer. So, x is always an even integer between negative 2 and infinity. If you take it to be infinity, then you're just minimizing over everything. So, for example, if you have a three-manifold and you don't want to think about a spatial graph, then the net extent is just going to be one less than the Hagar genus. If you have a knot in the three-sphere, the net extent at level negative two, the negative. Level negative two. The negative two basically means that all your thick and thin surfaces have to be spheres. And so whatever this is, it's going to be less than or equal to the bridge number minus one. And in fact, so the fact that it's less than or equal to bridge number minus one is supposed to be just obvious because bridge spheres are one of the things you're minimizing over. Something that's not obvious is that it's actually equal to bridge number minus one. Bridge number minus one for naught. And then again, if you don't really care about Euler characteristic anymore, the net extent is at level infinity is going to be less than or equal to tunnel number. So Maggie and I were actually able to show a few things. So, first of all, if your net extent at any level is Any level is equal to zero. This basically means you have the unknown in S3, or there are a few, just a couple other situations. For instance, you could have a you could be in a lens space and And your knot could be a core loop, or you could have, so I guess maybe I should say if this is a link, so you could have like a hop link in the lens space or a core loop of a lens space or the unknot in S3. So this net extent detects the unknot and it is additive under connection. Under connected sum. And I think, in the interest of time, I won't say exactly what I mean by this. But basically, the values add, and there's a certain sort of additivity that happens at the indexing. And it is, as far as spatial graphs go, it is minus a half additive. Under the trivalent vertex sum. So trivalent vertex sum is when you do a connected sum at a trivalent vertex. And the key idea for all this is basically thinning. So again, this is where we rely heavily on those who have come before us. And the key idea is that. The key idea is that, with the right notion of thinning, basically, when you allow untelescoping using zero and once punctured disks, that twice and thrice punctured spheres. So if your spatial graph is composite, or if you're not as composite, actually, I can even throw in there zero, twice, and thrice punctured spheres. Are guaranteed to show up as thin levels or as thin surfaces if they exist. So if you're composite, you will definitely see a for instance if you have a composite knot, you will definitely see a twice-punctured sphere showing up as a thin level. And in fact, you know, one of the advantages of our Of the advantages of our setup for thin position is that all of the thin surfaces will be essential in the graph complement. So I'm not going to say too much more about that, although I know there are many experts here in the audience. So if you want to talk about this at the end, I'm happy to say more. Okay, well, what's the connection to aquivariant Hagar genus? So let me table that discussion that we're just having. Table that discussion that we're just having and think a little bit about equivariant Hagar genus. So the setup is that we have a three-manifold. So I'll take W to be a compact, connected, orientable, three-manifold and And I'm going to think about a finite group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms. So, kind of schematically, what I have here, and I'm going to be interested in reducible manifolds. So, I have this black thing, which represents a three-manifold. This red thing is a sphere that is equivariant under the group action, meaning that each group element Either takes the sphere to itself or takes it to a sphere that's disjoint from it. So it turns, so that's kind of the setup. And it turns out that if you have a three-manifold with a finite group of diffeomorphisms, Zimmerman showed that there is. Showed that there is an equivariant Hagard surface, actually, an invariant Hagard surface. So a Hagard surface that's taken to itself by each element of the group. And so we can define the equivariant Hagar genus to just be the minimum genus of an equivariant Hagard surface. Also, maybe now is the right place to point out that Meeks and Yao famously showed the equivariant sphere theorem. Which says that if you, one way of phrasing it is if you have a reducible three-manifold with this group action, then there is a sphere that's equivariant. Sphere that's equivariant as well. And one consequence of that is that there exist prime, maybe I should say this way, there exist equivariant prime decompositions. You have to be a little careful when you're talking about this. So if you think about the picture I've drawn here. It might be the case that actually, like, all the interesting topology for this three-manifold is contained in these flanges, and that this is really just a three-sphere minus some open balls in the middle, in which case, it may your prime decomposition, your equivariant prime decomposition, not all the pieces need be non-trivial. You can end up with a trivial piece of your prime decomposition. With a trivial piece of your prime decomposition. So, the right notion to think about is actually what are called efficient decompositions instead of prime decompositions. But for the purposes of this talk, let me just refer to them as prime decompositions. So I believe this is due to Petronio. Okay, so the question then is, is equivariant Hagar genus additive? Equivariant Hagar genus additive. And on the one hand, right, I mean, why should anything be additive? On the other hand, we know that Hagar genus is additive under connected sum. And recently, Charlamin showed that if you have your favorite reducing sphere and you have a Hagard splitting for your reducible manifold, you can isotope the Hagard splitting. You can isotope the Hagard splitting to intersect your reducing sphere in a single simple closed curve. So, if you have an equivariant sphere and you have an equivariant Hagard splitting, you can isotope the equivariant Hagard splitting to intersect the equivariant sphere in a single closed loop, which means maybe you think it should be additive. On the other hand, this isotopy almost certainly destroyed the equivariance. So, you know, maybe it's. So, you know, maybe it's maybe it's the toss-up. So, as I mentioned, if your group is the trivial group, you're just in the setting of Hawkins' lemma. So it's additive. And a slightly more sophisticated argument, going back to work basically Hawkins' lemma combined with work of Zimmermann says that if your group acts freely, it's actually going to be additive. Going to be additive. And I can show that if each component, sort of each factor in your efficient decomposition is what I call it, equivariantly comparatively small, then it, well, it really should be additive, but maybe it's at least the sum of the factors. So just to be clear here, this means. This means take W and surgery spheres that are giving you your prime factorization. And the group action restricts to the group action on the factors there. So, and this thing might be disconnected, in which case what I mean is just. Connected, in which case, what I mean is just add up the Hagar genre of the pieces. So, you know, maybe this is evidence that the answer should be yes, that equivariant hagogenus is additive, but it's actually not additive. So, yeah, go ahead. Sorry, can I'm a bit confused about the setup? Sure. Zimmermann was doing invariant Hagerton. Invariant Haggard splittings, right? Yes. Equivariant Haggard splittings are possibly disconnected, of course. Even for the orientation-preserving case? Well, I'm just thinking the definition of equivariant surface, you know, it could have translates that are disjoint from itself. Right. Right. So are you requiring? Let's say there are two translates for specificity. Each one is a Haggard splitting. Are you requiring anything about how the union of the two splits the manifold? No, let me maybe just for simplicity here, let me go ahead and just restrict the invariant Hagar splittings. I think there should be, yeah. Yeah, yeah, maybe we can talk a little more at the end about the kind of the disconnected case. So, um, yeah, let's think, let's just let's think about the invariant Hagar split situation. Yeah. So the um so there are examples where the um Maybe I should say invariant Hagar genus is subadditive. And there are also examples where it's additive. And there are examples where it is super additive. And each of these examples is constructed as cyclic covers over knots. And it's closely connected to issues of non-additivity of tunnel number. So let me go ahead and, oh, right. And I should tell you about this other theorem. And then I will make the connection to tunnel number. So the so once you know it's not necessarily additive, you want to ask about upper and lower bounds. About upper and lower bounds. And there's an upper bound here, which looks complicated, but basically, you know, it's something in terms of the number of factors and the order of the group. And if you have a cyclic group, then those twos can be ones, and the previous examples actually. And the previous examples actually show that this is sharp. And I think it should be sharp in general, too. On the other hand, for lower bounds, assuming that G is not acting freely, the lower bound is going to be bounded below by something here. But the basic idea is it's about 112th the order of the group, which is not really a great. Which is not really a great lower bound, but I have examples that show that, at least asymptotically, in terms of the order of G, this is sharp. So I can say more about what those numbers are in a bit, if you like. Okay, and so underlying all this is a new invariant, which is basically the The generalized Hagar splitting version of Hagar genus, but where you take into account the thick and thin surfaces. Okay, so what's the basic strategy? So we have our three-manifold W, and if we want to think about equivariant or invariant. Equivariant or invariant Hagard surfaces for the for W. Zimmermann showed that these descend to basically bridge surfaces for the orbifold. So when you have a group action, find a group action on a manifold, the natural thing to look at is the quotient orbifold. And for my purposes, what is it? My purposes, what is this orbifold? It consists of an orientable three-manifold together with a spatial graph, and the edges of the spatial graph have labels on them. And the labels capture information about what the group is doing. And there are rules about how these labels interact at vertices and things. And so, In this orbifold setting, there's this idea of orbifold Euler characteristic, and I'm going to use the negative of it, where basically you just look at the negative Euler characteristic of the surface and then count the number of punctures. And the punctures have weights coming from the weights of the edges. So, for instance, this puncture. This puncture contributes one half to the Hagar character to the orbifold Hagar characteristic to X and the great thing about orbifold Euler characteristic is that it is multiplicative under orbifold covers and so if you know something about how this quantity behaves down here when you lift When you lift back to your back to W, you just are multiplying by the order of their group. And so the strategy then, really for all of those results, is to think about: okay, in this orbifold, I'm going to take a bridge circle. A bridge surface for this weighted spatial graph. And I'm going to apply the fin position machinery to break this up into thick and thin surfaces. And it so happens that the reducibility of W corresponds exactly to a certain kind of reducibility of the spatial graph, namely with. Graph, namely with respect to summing along zero-punctured spheres, like a distant sum, or along twice-punctured spheres, which is a connected sum, or along a thrice-punctured sphere, like this one, which is a vertex sum. And so, the fact that the thin position machinery will witness the composite nature of the spatial graph. A spatial graph means it's also picking up the fact that the orbifold is composite, and that corresponds to the three-manifold W being composite, being reducible. And so we do all of our counting down here in terms of the basically the net version of this. The net version of this, where we are taking that on the thick surfaces and subtracting that on the thin surfaces, and then lifting back to the manifold that we had the group action on. So that's what's supposed to be this picture here. Be this picture here. So, you know, in terms of the business about being, what do they say, equivariantly comparatively small, that's basically the condition that's going to guarantee that when you split open along your factors, you have just a single thick surface in each piece. In each piece. And when you have just a single thick surface in each piece, these things lift to Hager surfaces up top. So that's really the idea. If you want lower bounds, what you need to do is bound the number of We had uh oops, I don't know what happened to the right, so we had net x here. What we have to do is bound this quantity for each of the pieces and show that it is no bigger than something, and then just lift back to there to get to get a lower bound. On the other hand, to get upper bounds, you need to You need to either ensure that you have just a single thick level in each piece, or if you have thick and thin surfaces, you need some way of combining them back to namely some form of amalgamation to turn it into a single thick surface. And in general, you can't always amalgamate these things like you can with generalized Haggard splittings, but there are various kinds of tricks that. There are various kinds of tricks that allow you to concoct a single Hagard surface when you have the thick and thin surfaces. And the challenge is just keeping track of all the arithmetic that goes on when you do that. So I think I will. Oh, right. I wanted to say one thing about the example of super additivity because I think so. The examples of subadditivity and additivity are basically correspond to the fact that tunnel number can be subaddititivity. Number can be sub additive or additive. Although you have to be really careful when you do it because you need to have some kind of control not only over like Hagard surfaces for the NOT exterior or bridge surfaces, but also the hierogeneous bridge surfaces. So for super additivity, you can construct examples by taking naught Taking knots. So, this is supposed to be a knot in S3, and this is a Hagard surface for its exterior. And you pick the knot so that it has a Hagard surface for its exterior of very high distance. And this is possible by work of Minsky, Mariah, and Schleimer. And when you connect some two of these things together, Two of these things together, you end up with a picture like this. And if these surfaces are of high enough distance, then basically this is going to be kind of the unique thin decomposition for this knot. And so the trick then is to think about this thing as being an orbifold. A fold. So you assign a label to it, which basically means you can lift to a K-fold cyclic cover. And the fact that these were of high distance is really going to constrain what your equivariant Hagard splittings are in the K-fold cyclic cover. And that will be enough to show that the equivariant Hagar genus is superadditive, which is the Super additive, which is the goal. So I will stop there and I'm happy to talk more. Are there any questions? Okay, well, thank you very much for this very interesting talk. I hope to think more about it in the future. More about it in the future, it looks quite interesting. Um, further comments, questions? Actually, I had a question, I was muted. Um, you were talking about sort of a general philosophy seemed to be to look at things by, I mean, by thinning things, but having the right thinning operation. So, I'm familiar with, you know, you rearrange your handle structure for the three minutes. For the three can push a one-handle below a two-handle rate thinning. And then for not two, are there any other thinning operations you were thinking of, or are you just mixing these in the right way? So I mean, I would say that the really important thing for what we're doing is the fact that our one handles can have the cores living in them. You know, if you're thinking in terms of like Gabai's thin position, in that setting, all you like. In that setting, all like all the spheres end up being concentric. And in this case, we can get more interesting sphere, more interesting tree structures to it, too, which also seems to be really important. And then the final thing I will say is that the thinning operations also involve like all your favorite destabilization kinds of moves. And there's a whole collection, there's a whole collection of those which can. You know, can in principle, they're all very straightforward, but there's a lot of them to keep track of. I see. Yeah, yeah, okay. It's starting to gel there. And one of the interesting things that can happen is actually like you might start with something that can't be destabilized. And then as you thin, like do the untelescoping, the weak reduction kinds of things, you can then start to see stabilizations show up. Show up, which is kind of corresponds to this idea that you can't always amalgamate. Exactly, yeah, yeah. I just remembered a question I had fairly early in your talk, and I'm not sure if I've got the terminology correct, but you said something about you restrict these decompositions to ones where the digraph was a tree. Acyclic, yeah. Acyclic. Yeah. A cyclic. So why is that a, maybe this is an unfair question, why is that a natural thing to require? Do things go wrong if you don't put that on? Sort of. I mean, they don't go very wrong, but they go wrong enough that a lot of what we do doesn't work directly. So like if you don't require that, then you're basically doing circular thin position. And one of the things we need to be able to do is to allow, because we're interested in reducible manifolds and composite knots, is allow yourself to use disks whose boundary are inessential, but where the disk itself is essential as part of your thinning, which is very difficult to do. Is very difficult to do. And because when you're thinning, you need to have some sort of complexity that guarantees that you eventually stop thinning. And in the circular setting, you can just kind of keep pushing handles around so that you never stop in that situation. Any other questions? So I just wanted to follow up on my comment from before, although I have to admit that I haven't thought about that since invariant. About that, since invariant Haggard splitting for many years. But if you want an equivariant Haggard splitting, then you can do something very cheap. Let's say it's a closed manifold. You can take any Haggard splitting you want and isotope to be very, very close to its spine. And by transversality, the spine will be destroyed for itself, and then it's automatically aquivariant. Right. That's what I was asking if you want to know something about. Was asking if you want to know something about the pieces between them or some constraint. Yeah, I think really I just want to be talking about invariant Hagar splittings. Yeah, that is quite a bit more complicated for sure. Yeah. Because that's what guarantees that when you are like if you have an orbifold Hagard splitting and you are lifting it back to a Hagard splitting. Right, right. Yeah. And yeah. Right, right. Yeah, and yeah, that's right. That's what guarantees that you can descend to the quotient, of course. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So it, you know, yes. I thank you. And I think that's a good point. I really should have been saying invariant Hayard splitting. Just as I should say, right, I mean, I was talking about equivariant spheres, but really, because I want to think about like the prime decompositions, I really want an invariant system of summing spheres, just a single equivariant sphere. Just a single equivariant sphere doesn't do very much because, like, you can't extend the group action if all you have is one sphere. Yeah, so thank you for that, Jov. Yeah, sure. Other questions? Okay, well, thank you, Scott, once again. And we will reconvene in about 15 minutes.
