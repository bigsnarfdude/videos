Okay, is that good to go? Yeah, I think if you can make like slide mode, that would be great if you could. Slideshow, yeah. Yep, perfect. Okay. Oh, well, hello, everybody. Thanks for having me. I'm very disappointed. For having me, I'm very disappointed I can't be there in banff with you physically. You'll have to make do with this version, but I hope you're having a good time at the meeting. Looked like a great programme, actually. And I know quite a few of you already, and it's a shame we couldn't meet this time, but I'm sure there'll be other times. So I'm going to talk about disease progression traits. And why are we interested in disease progression? Well, most of what we do is about risk factors, disease risk factors. Disease risk factors, especially in GWAS work. You know, nearly all GWAS of disease have been about risk of disease through case control studies and so forth. But if you're going to take those findings and develop therapies around those or treatments around those findings, that will directly speaking, it will only address prevention of disease, right? Because we're looking at how disease develops. If we want to actually treat disease, then we should be doing studies of disease progression. Then we should be doing studies of disease progression, and then factors that affect disease progression could point you towards ways of treating disease that's already in place. So, there are various types of progression traits we might be interested in. Most obviously, perhaps, is survival time. So, if you have a terminal disease, then the time that you survive with the disease is a type of progression trait. And we can look for SNPs and other factors that associate with survival time. Associate with survival time, or it can be time to some event like a surgical event, surgical intervention, time to surgery. Or we can look at quantitative progression traits such as decline in function. Where I work in Leicester, a major interest is in lung traits, lung function traits, and lung disease. So, over time, if you have lung disease, the amount of oxygen you can absorb is decreasing over time. Or you might be looking at dementia, for example. Or you might be looking at dementia, for example, and a decline in cognitive function over time. So those could be measured as continuous traits. And recurrent events, by which I mean something like having a second heart attack. All right, so you've had one event, cardiac event, you've survived that. And then as time goes on, you may or may not have a second event. And then looking at risk factors for those second events may be different from the factors that affected your first. The factors that affected your first event. So, here's quite a nice review by people in Bristol who opened the discourse around this area in genetics a few years back now. So, it may be that risk factors that affect the development of disease, they may not always associate with the progression of disease. Okay. But there are very few GOS for progress. But there are very few GOS4 progression, and some of the reasons for that are: well, the main reason, in fact, there's no shortage of disease cases, but in harmonizing the phenotypes across consortia, it turns out to be a lot harder to do that for progression traits than it is for just diagnosis of disease. And that's been one practical reason why there have been few GUAS for progression. And those that we have tend to have smaller sample sizes than the ones we have for disease risk. So the So, the studies we have have found fewer hits than we have for standard GWAS. Crohn's disease was one of the more successful studies there. So, they were looking at whether people needed a surgical procedure after a period of time. I think they found four hits there, which were different from the Crohn's disease hits. And they also took an apologetic score with Crohn's disease, apologetic risk. Crohn's disease, polygenic risk, and they found that wasn't associated with prognosis. So they claimed there, then there were distinct genetic basis to prognosis compared to susceptibility of Crohn's. Other areas in which this is done, so in heart disease, they have big studies there, big sample sizes. So there's been some work. The largest consortium data actually is still being drafted for submission. So I can't share that yet, but there's been. Can't share that yet, but there's been some work on polygenic scores looking at subsequent event risk and showing that the association with subsequent events is much weaker than it is with disease risk. And that holds across all common risk factors for heart disease. Stuff like smoking, age, cholesterol, they do associate with subsequent events, but less strongly than they do with disease risk. And the breast cancer, again, another study. Again, another study, another area with very large disease GWAS, they've not been able to find any variants associated with survival or with mortality at genome-wise significance. So we could call this an emerging area, perhaps. It hasn't quite had the same immediate impact as GWAS have, but as time goes on, we're going to see a lot more of this. Now, there's a potential issue in studies of progression because you only have a disease progression if you have the disease. Progression: If you have the disease, so everything's conditional on having a disease. And if there are common factors that affect both development of disease and progression, those are the confounders in this graph here, then that can induce a bias when we estimate the effect of an exposure on progression. Because we've conditioned on disease, this opens a path that's called a collider bias, whereby the association Whereby the association with progression is biased by this additional path through disease, through the confounders, and onto progression, where the effect we would like to estimate is the direct effect of an exposure on progression, the red line here. So this is a form of selection bias that happens in all studies of disease progression. It's called index event bias in this scenario, but it's a special case of selection bias. Selection bias. Now, if you work in Mendelian randomization, you might recognize that graph as the same graph that occurs in MR studies. The difference being that in MR, we assume that this direct path is actually missing. It's one of the assumptions of MR. And what we're trying to estimate is the red arrow here, the causal effect of an exposure on the outcome. But the structure of the graph is the same. And we're going to exploit that similarity in a minute. Similarity in a minute. So, in MR, the causal effect, in the simplest case, it's the ratio of the genetic effect on the outcome, the total genetic effect on the outcome divided by the genetic effect on the exposure. That ratio is an estimate of the causal effect. Now, in the selection bias scenario, we can use a similar principle, and we can remove the collider bias arising from selection. We can show that this red line here, We can show that this red line here, the direct exposure effect here, is equal to the effect of the exposure on progression, conditional on disease. This is the bias effect. And we could subtract this quantity here. So it's the ratio of the gene effect on progression over the gene disease effect times the effect of the exposure on the disease. It's this line here. So we can use the genetic instruments in the same way as we do in Mendelian randomization. Mendelian randomization to de-bias the effect of the exposure on progression. Right now, if you look at this equation at the bottom here, you can recognize this as this ratio here. It's the same expression that we estimate in Mendelian randomization. That's the ratio of the gene effect on progression to the. Can you see my mouse moving by the way? I hope you can. I'm just going to put my pointer on permanently here. There we go. Here. There we go. So the gene effect on progression there divided by the gene effect on disease. That's the same ratio that we estimate in MR. And we can use that ratio in a similar kind of way to remove bias in studies of disease progression. Okay, so if we want to do a GWAS of disease progression, we can essentially study each gene in turn. Study each gene in turn and use all the other genes as instruments and apply Mendelian randomization methods to remove any collider bias of each gene. And the assumption here is that the collider bias, the magnitude of the bias is the same for each gene in turn. So when I study G1, then all the other Gs here will be instrumental variables. When I study Gene 2, then that will be the gene of interest. That would be the gene of interest, and then all the other genes, gene one and genes three to five, they will be the instruments for correcting bias in G2. And the assumption that is that the kind of polygenic instrument has the same effect for all genes, which will be the case when genes have small effects. Okay, so by dropping out each one in turn, though, we will have essentially the same degree of bias that we are estimating. And we can exploit that now to do a GWAS of disease progression. A GUS of disease progression using the same principle that we have in Mendelian randomization. Okay, so there's been a few papers now that have explored this principle. I think the most general one that's focusing on genetics is this one we published a year or two ago now with collaborators in Bristol. Yeah, and we make the point here that although we've Make the point here that, although we focus on the IVW method of MR, but any method that does MR could be used in the same context to estimate corrections for selection bias. And the method that we settled on ourselves was similar to MRRAPS, but we had a sort of quick and dirty approximation to MRRAPS, which works much more quickly in simulations. Here's an application where we use. Here's an application where we use. So, this is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and it's a terminal disease of the lungs. This gene here, MUC5B, has a very strong effect on risk. It has an odds ratio of five, but surprisingly, it was associated with improved survival. So, if you're carrying this very strong risk factor for fibrosis, it would seem to actually give you a longer survival time. When we first developed these methods, we actually reversed the direction of effect. We actually reverse the direction of effect for this gene. So it seemed to resolve this paragraph, this paradox. But more recently, with improved methods and more data available, we got a more inconclusive result. And now we can't say either way whether this gene affects survival or not. Confidence intervals are too wide. Now, what if we want to remove both confounding and selective? Want to remove both confounding and selection bias at the same time. So we're moving from GWAS, we're moving away from GWAS now, but we're looking at a non-genetic exposure, which we might use Mendelian anonymization for to remove confounding. But supposing we also are concerned about selection bias. So we want the causal effects of this exposure on this progression conditional on disease and where there may be unobserved confounding of that exposure as well. So, can we As well. So, can we remove both confounding and selection bias at the same time? That would be nice, wouldn't it? Okay, so we find that we can do this by using bivariate Mendelian randomization. So, multivariate Mendelian randomization, but with two variables, where these variables are the disease trait and the exposure of interest. This is the graph we have here. Graph we have here. So if I just flip back one, you'll see that if we just relocate exposure in the graph, it's the same graph. This is the effect of interest here, the red line. And we've introduced genetic instruments here for both the disease and for the exposure. So this is now a bivariate Mendelian randomization design. And we can show, this is work that Siang Tsai has done in my group. We can show the following. We can show the following. So, oops, sorry. So, if beta prime here is the total effect of the genes on progression conditional on disease, and that's what you would get from a GWAS of progression in cases of disease. So, those are the biased effects that we observe. Okay, we can show that that biased effect is linear in the two genetic effects on disease and on exposure. And we can get those from. And we can get those from GWAS of disease, those are typical classical disease GWAS, and GWAS of the exposure of interest, which presumably we can get as well. Okay, so these three quantities are all things we can observe in GWAS, and we can show that the biased effect of the gene on progression is linear in the two other effects. If we now fit a regression then of the biased gene progression effect on the other two genetic effects, Effect on the other two genetic effects, we can show that the coefficient of the exposure effects is the causal effect that we are looking for. So we take the coefficient of these effects, we have a whole load of these from a GMAS, we fit that regression, and then the coefficient of these effects is, in fact, this cause and effect that we aim to estimate. Okay, that's very nice. Okay, that's very nice. It's very elegant. The only slight complication is that is weak instrument bias. Okay, so to make an accurate adjustment for selection bias, we need to use a lot of SNPs as instruments. And when we start to have many large numbers of SNPs as instruments, then we have weak instrument bias. And in this case, it will tend to undercorrect for selection. In Mendelian randomization, it tends to overcorrect the causal effect. To over-correct the causal effect, right? And so people are not quite so concerned about weak instrument bias. It gives you a conservative result. It's more critical in this situation because here it will actually undercorrect for selection bias. Okay, so in order to deal with weak instrument bias, there are various methods out there which can deal with weak instruments in a bivariate Mendelian randomization scenario. I've listed a few of I've listed a few of them here. These are developed for general multivariate designs, and they will estimate the entire vector of causal effects. For us, for the time being, we're in a bivariate situation, and we only require one element of the bivariate causal effect vector, essentially. And in that special case, we can now actually write down a formula that will give us the corrected. Give us the corrected causal effect for weak instrument bias. All right, we don't have to understand it, I just want to show you that the formula looks like that, and it just involves things that we can get from GWAS summary statistics. Okay, so the D, you know, the D's here are GWAS effects, SNP effects on disease, the X's are SNP effects on exposure, and the Y's are SNP effects on outcome, conditional on disease. Of lung disease, and the sigmas are standard errors. All right, so these are all things we can get from GMAS, and we can calculate this very quickly. So, that's the kind of state of play in this area. There's a growing interest in doing both GWAS and Mendelian randomization in disease progression traits that will be relevant for treating disease rather than preventing disease. By definition, studies of progression potential. Studies of progression potentially include selection bias because you only have progression if you have a disease. So these studies are conditional on people having a disease, entailing selection into the study. We can correct for selection bias using instrumental variable methods, analogous to Mendelian randomization. And indeed, if we want to do MR of a non-genetic exposure, we can potentially use bivariate MR to adjust for both. Used by variety MR to adjust for both selection bias and confounding in that association. It's important to bear weak instrument bias in mind in this situation, and we have proposed a simple correction in this particular case, which can give you an answer very quickly. I'm afraid the work isn't published now. We're currently revising it and hopefully we'll have something to show you in press in the next few weeks. So I'll finish there. So we'll finish there, and thanks again for allowing me to speak. Happy to take your questions. Thank you, Brian. I think we'll have time to take forward your questions. Thanks so much for a really healthy talk. I'm just wondering if you could say anything about how any of your methods might apply in the rareberry case. Typically, there's a lot of interest in studying disease progression of the individuals who have. You have pathogenic variants, but it's like sort of just starting up. And one of the things that we need to be really wary of in that case that you've got to field is. Okay. Is it possible to repeat the question a bit nearer to the mic? I'm afraid I could hear you, but the acoustic was a bit difficult. Things like that. The same set of issues. The same set of issues, but with rare variants rather than aggregated common variants. Oh, okay, with rare variants. Yeah, essentially, the same ideas could apply. The only slight issue might be that rare variants may have stronger effects, and then some of our assumptions may be violated because we assume that all the SNPs have similar effects, which are small, and if some of them have Effects which are small, and if some of them have stronger effects, like a rare variant, might, then that may.
