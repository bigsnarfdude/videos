Uh talking about number covianity in open quantum systems. No, that's the title of the conference. But maybe if Onsova can uh read the title for us. Thank you. Yes. And so indeed I was going to talk about sort of monomic. We have an audio problem. But we have an audio problem. You have to can you do something with your audio, maybe go closer to your microphone or something? Um yeah, I can but it's the networking, yeah. Let's switch off this video. Yeah, maybe I can try this. Right now it's good, yeah. It's good, okay, yeah, okay, okay, so what I was saying is that so I wanted to discuss not really in the context of many body systems, so when we have a large system with interactions, but actually so with this probability to study there. And so it is basically the object of my talk, so I have many things to say, so I and I won't So namely through the large system size and remote mobility. To motivate why it is to go beyond standard in blood approaches when we have large systems, especially in the context of dt-batic resolution. Solution. And then we discussed some methods that we developed recently to deal with strongly correlated systems, so that are basically based on non-micron stochastic methods with metric product states. With an example. And then if I have still time, I will flash some on how we can actually describe dynamics at the market system, so it's not something we can on measurement. Okay, so graphic buzzing slide, right? So we are interested in the dynamics of an open system S, which is potentially driven by some time-dependent field. And then we have some environments or several environments, which can be modeled as a pass of harmonic oscillators. And when the interaction is done, we come system as controling a new system of Involving some system operator of L. And so in open system, so it's a way to describe the dynamics of the system. And probably the most of the aspect that we already know the most informed metrics of the system. And which is in the most static scenario. Which we derived so using uh the width approximation. The weak approximation, so which is basically a determination theory with respect to the interaction, and using the born approximation, which is saying that basically the full density matrix of the system in the past can be decomposed, I mean, in a separable form with a system of distributions. Form of the Nostrom equation that I wrote here for a bus at zero amplitude. What we can see here is that even in the very simple scenario, so from the derivative, so the time evolution of the system and centimetrix depends on a template, so between the system spectrum, because of this LOFT, so the system operator in the So the system operator in the last quarter function but of course there are errors I mean there are some uh some situations where um things are are easier. But for example if the passport function If the pass prediction function behaves very fast, it can be approximated by a direct delta function, then we don't really care about the spectrum describing it. And we can actually write the mass regression in this internet platform, but a little bit this thing runs by the mass reaction. It doesn't decay that far, so it can decay exponentially or something like that. But so we cannot be hard review, we can do the part of heart distribution, which I think can get some again, some red for the system with some reds that depend on the system. system with some rates that depend on the past different evaluated different transition frequency of the system. So it's very a bit simple because it is very obvious, right? But to the right to the fact that even this very simple Markovian approximation, Markovian regime and weak open mass distribution, we basically need to know the fact and write the mass distribution, so total to solve, right? So or Or even we need to spectrum the system in here. So, if now we think about going to many body systems, so then we see that this is already a kind of important, right? Because for many body systems, by definition, we don't really know the structure of the system, and so we need it to be a structure for many body systems in the Macomb regime in general. Of course, this is the case if the bus again is a pure delta function. If the bus again is a pure delta function, and this is also why most works where you are focusing on this so you can also ask at this point maybe actually uh this is enough and we don't need to go beyond this, right? We could posit this to be anybody system without But at least I mean to go beyond this pure direct delta description of the mass breakfast function to capture what I said in the title, but in the context of the job is not giving an anti daily from the UK about uh About uh just uh I'm not the cavity is closing. And then you want to study uh I can have basically two choices for the open system Choices for the open system. Either the system will be the atom's first activity mode, and in this case, we know very well what activity is outside the world, and we can treat it with a very good approximation of this side. Francois? We can't hear you very well at all. You come in waves, kind of. Are you wearing earbuds or something? No, not at all. I can try to change the computer quickly, but. Could be the noise cancellation on Zoom is too aggressive, which you can change in the your when you are him. Maybe you can connect with the just the mobile and use the audio of the mobile, that's what? Yeah, I I have a an end phone I can.    Okay, so is it better now? Right now we can hear you well, yes. Okay, because I just put the next one, it's on it, so maybe it's better. Um okay, so if it if it's okay can continue, otherwise not it's statement tricks I I can try to do something else. I can try something else. Okay, let's continue like this. It seems to be okay right now. Okay, so I'm a rhetoric, so usually. Okay, so let's go back to this. I was describing two different open descriptions that we can have in the context of chemical. So a simple one in terms of dissipation, where we have a large filtered space, so consisting of the two-level atoms plus the chemical. Atom plus other chemicals, that we have to deal with, I mean, quantum mechanically explicitly, so which is problematic if we have a lot of chemical modes, or if we have a lot of atoms. And a steam, I mean, a description for which the system is smaller, so it's not only the atom. But then the bias consists of dark cavity modes, which potentially can be some non-micromanic case. So what we wanted to know in this previous role was to look at actually how can we install How can we, starting from this simple Markov description of the atomic cavity system, goes to atom of the description. So, what approximations can be made so that we can still capture the right in some specific models. So, with revantity benchmarks, this kind of derivation in the context of revantity capacity models which describe the collection of two-level atoms collectively compared to a single. Full of an atom, so it's difficult to a single colour. So, this mortal can be written and it can be described with this mass derivation for all the atoms of K. So, where we have the CK Hamiltonian, which consists of the sum of the energy of the atom, the energy of the cavity ball and the extraction 2, and the simple CT percentage traveling plaster for the galvanic law. So, this model can be actually experimental. Again, so we can. Again, so we can derive, for example, from this mass recognition some mean-shield equation of function for this operator. And we can look, for example, at the steady-state value of SZ, so the magnetization of the atom is a function of G. And what is known is that if you look at the thermodynamic limit, so the limit of a large number of atoms, we have two different regimes, two different stages. One where all atoms uh are in the repron state and we have no pattern in the K regime. And we have no protons in the CBD, and one where we have a different state for the director and a microscopic number of protons in the gamma. So, this is what known, this has been observed experimentally. And so, again, what we want to show is that it is possible to derive a virtual description of the TL, so an atomic distribution, the skill can choose the right and so uh it it is actually not very difficult, right? The system of uh textbook derivation of upper equations. So, we talked with Of our equation. So we started with the bone approximation of the down Gavin T, which is now the bias. And we use the valve correlation function in the form of charging functions. So L is P for down the computer. And when we do this both across the stain as expected, so redis must be represented for the atom only. So only in terms of quality spin operators and also involving some complex rate. So inverting some complex rate cubic and minus or test depends on other parts of the substance. But from that, so we know that this reduced matrix does not preserve the positive TV and so on. People usually complain about that. So we can think about doing additional toxication, such as the particular toxication, which consists of giving two terms, I mean terms with two express oxygen, or Or using the large gening limit, which basically consists in saying that if omega naught is very small compared to omega, we can probably select this omega naught in the race is less than minus, and so I have only one parameter due to. So we were a bit surprised when we we studied this parameter. So we we looked at uh the different mean six distributions of these of these four different macro equations, but depending on whether or not we do this these uh On whether or not we do this additional approximation. What we found is that the only way to capture the separation phase conditions, so, for example, the sensitivity value of FZ distance on G, the only way to do that was to not perform this coordination of mass direction, so the distribution optioning, and so to stick to this radio distribution. And so, what this means is that the patient was captured by a sequence of the radio notification, so the fourth of an application with all the same. The border cost equation with all the similar substitution. And if you put this relative equation in this standard form, well, the cross-catoxy matrix LIHA here is not necessarily positive. So this means that if you diagonalize it, you have some negative vector rate constantly. And which, and since negative vector rate gives uh I mean uh free time for non-macroed effects, so we have some all some non-macro end effects needed to capture this uh this banding system here. DC passive phase configuration. So the single message here is that, I mean, beyond this simple story model, is that D C passive transition can be missed by another minimal concentration and that it could be interesting and useful to go beyond these trans to capture phase conditions in the immune model of gene. So a bit later on, so you are going to do this a slightly more actual model, which is about this new. Model, which is basically a two-month model with the U1 symmetry, which also is called return state position. The one they showed there was even more surprising, but they showed that the second order rate of transformation was not able to capture the state position, and then it goes for fourth-order one to be able to capture it. So again, so coming back to to this slide, so yes, it's actually useful to go beyond this kind of uh pure data description of um uh The mass pressure functions, especially in the context of the C-static transition. And this also shows that basically it's not clear at all what kind of methods we can use to do that efficiently. And so we looked in the research of how we could do that in a different system as a way, so without having to use some approximation. And we found it quite unpossible using this non-macroestogate method. Evaluating this non-macro gets that they were quite suitable also to debris this quantum of this method. I mean, more conductive matter technologies like Matrix Poly said to this formula. And so I think I would like to go a bit, I mean the skip of parts, I guess, in time, but just to to okay, if I want to talk about non-non-market stochastic method, I remind a bit what are the the the stochastic uh methods and markets. They don't macro and yet, but I mean probably most of you know. So but looking what they are, they were initially developed to unravel some smaller macro and applications to use that form, such as the one in the box here. And the idea is that instead of solving the mass request one for the database, well, you can solve several times a wave function which is time involved according to a Schrodinger equation driven by constochacy concerts. And but if for a range of enough trajectory, you will Of enough trajectory, you will cover the average evolution of the system. We have two main studies of this stochastic training equation. So the quantum jump, they correspond to current evolution intercepted by chance of chant on time. And quantum space diffusion, maybe slightly left down, which corresponds to uh the limit of uh chunk of a very time step or continuous diffusion of the system in the state. And so we can have it difficult And so we can I mean discuss the technical details there, but it's easier to see what what they do on a specific example, like if you look at the continuous emission of two level atoms. So we see that for quantum jumps, so starting in the excited state, we see that we have really discurrent evolution up to some point at random time t where we have a channel of the frequent state. But if you average over many trajectories, you recover the expected exponential decay of the probability to be in the expected state of would probably seem to be in the effective state of the algorithm. And the quantum state level shows really the difference where we have even for one predictory for uh a geometric state of four geometry steps, but again if you are range enough of a main predictory you get the expectation of the expected. So these methods uh are uh very nice because they can uh allow to study larger system size because dealing with the dense images of a large system is harder than uh dealing with Harder than dealing with the wave function, even if we have to deal with several wave functions. So it's efficient numerically. But also, there's a nice feature that they have a measurement interpretation, that a given trajectory can be interpreted as conditioned by a given measurement because of the path. We can relate, for example, conclusion interact total detection of the orchard signal and quantum state diffusion for one time or external. State deficiency for multi-traulting decisions of and so now to this work for the Markovian case. So there are generalization of this method in the Nomarkoden regime, so in the case of transfusion and in the case of transit division. So I want to avoid the the case of transformation because they are just limited actually for generalizations machines. And uh for the case of non recording constant division I I just want to say that um I just wanted to say that I mean the basic idea, but without going into the technical details. So how do we do? So basically you actually write the state, the full state of the system in the fragment in a valid fragment, current state of the bar. And the idea is to look at the find an evolution equation for the in full state of the system and the bar, project it onto some static. Project doesn't do some specific properties of this parameter for analysis, you can find an equation or equation for this face, which looks very much like the Markov Face, except that the noise, for the stock system that appears, is no more a white noise, so uh for uh a linear process as usually under term, but a colour noise which has some uh statistical properties. Which has some statistical properties which are relative to the bath relation functions of the certificate. And then we saw this vocal picket system, which is Kernel with the bath relation function, it's not functional derivative with respect to this tokenic concept. So this method was derived in the late 90s, but was not very used actually, when it was very complicated originally to deal with these functional derivatives. But I mean, now it was a decade ago, so there was a lot of different. About uh decade ago, so there was uh this hierarchy of pure state methods that appear, and which roughly speaking consists as an efficient way to solve the NXPLD. So, instead of solving the NXQL T, what we do in this method is that we define some auxiliary state, psi K of T, as the result of the application of some objective T of T that takes this format, which is permitted as M of C s on the physical state. And if you take this definition here, you can rewrite with all the approximations the first line, then FQST, as the first line here, which basically says that the physical state, the evolution of the physical state, depends on delta and on the first object. And then if the black F is decomposed as a sum of decay exponential, so with the complex argument, which can usually be done in the very short. Usually be done in a very efficient way directly. Then you can find the evolution equation for the post-OPRI state, and so on, so that in the end you obtain a DRP of coupled stochastic troni equations for the sequence and the oxygen state. And so in practice, you initialize the system by saying that the first, I mean the zero, the physical state, it's just the initial state of the system, and all the electric state will tend to zero. And over time, And over time, so when you propagate the system, so the population starts to be populated and can give some back action on the dynamics as if they were acted as a kind of memory category. So and yeah, if actually uh presented in this file, we see the signal position as the sign and the revolve gets this package and created negative. So this method is actually that as soon as you can approximate the valuation function as uh somehow begin. and uh some of the game exponential. And uh which is particularly uh useful here is that uh we we see that by the keywriting the set of equations for op does not require no detection of the system. And so contrast uh to this idea of dealing with many body systems. So this method was very efficient and we indeed uh found a way to separate it with many body installs by especially for example one system by using permanent policy state. For this day. And so, since I think the time is almost done, so I won't go into details, but if we understand this, is that you need to see it's not that complicated to use microphonic state. So, what we did is error the physical state and the authority state that again is spreading equation using a face-of-the-art method of sense compression and which allows. Compression, and which allows us to study, for example, the case of electron tonal sense. So I'm not entirely how we keep this, but I think so. This is the case of the dissipative user-based model. So what it is, so it's just electrons on the latest coupled to local phonons. And if that is a case where the electrons are coupled to the phonon, and the phonon are done. And using this method, we could. We're using this method, we put the CT regime of parameters very hard to access in general, and to see what happens when you have CT patients of the system, and what are the differences more market or more non-markovaged in the system. And we could show, for example, it would enhance the brain correlation, so the the correlation between electrons medium divided the panel by doing a receiver with uh which is more having non mark of the end. More, I mean, it's not mark of Yan. So, by including the clipping, and we also show by delete the equanimity that we could particularly important because of the size of the stock, and basically what is the effect of this equation of them, and so that you could localize them uh as uh in the case of uh of the kind of quantum temperature. So, I think I don't know all that I uh I don't know how much I have time for this, but if I just want two minutes, I just want to mention this last thing about the non-macroid condition on the German, which basically can be summarized in this picture. So let's say you have again this program atomic coupled chemical, but it can be actually any system coupled to This time coupled to pseudo-holes, they are done by their owner reservoir, which we also fit with UV or intelligent formats and so on. And so usually, I'm a system, it's also useful to know what happens if you measure the value to extract information about the system, or to be able to use the the measurement to apply some specific feedback to drive the system uh technical. Driving system nice positive or driving in the conditioning of Google is proven known for the non-market case, but not very much in the normal case. So, connect back to this slide I presented before. So, we know that these stochastic fictional equations have a key amendment interpretation, but for the non-According, it was normally base, but with you. But when you finish summarizing this paper by SAC Weisman and Professor, when they basically say that actually the NMQEC or the OS method that I present on this actually do not have a measurement specification, we cannot interpret the given trajectory as a real trajectory which could be observed in a given experiment. So you can average, you can use this. You can average, you can use this trajectory to obtain the reduced distance value when you are raised, but you cannot interpret an entire trajectory as a real trajectory. And so, yeah, but I guess what we have done in this last work is to find a way to see the dynamics of the Dynamics of the non-marshan system describe having conditional elements, and the idea was actually to relax this property to say that we want a pure state forest and to go to a mixed state further. So, what we have done, so again, just starting that, but starting with the initial Markovian system description, from which we know the system relates, for example, in the model incurrence to the dynamics of the system, which is here the supervised system of the KVT. The combined part of the cavity, we can find a way to, between these parameters or eliminate the cavity models and obtain a ERC but density metric, physical density and some of the very density efficiency that are directly related to the current geometric review or what we can do about the if you look at a simple geometry model we And if you look at a simple chance killing model, we see that now we have, instead of getting the distance or condition on thermodynamic current evolving on the surface of the sphere, since we are in the non-macroeconomic effect, we have actually the diffusion of the system inside the here, so which really characterize this big state condition. So, with this, this I mean you can look at the details in this At the details in the paper, the context of multimodal cavity, where we can actually show how we can extract information about the atomic monitoring of different cavity mode, and how we could potentially do some correlation between different parts of an atomic detail in the atom cavity, and also how we could generate a better screening of the collective speed by using uh quantum speed path control by selling it to uh a good galvanic regime. A good DICTION regime, so in a regime where that I think I will finish here. Some very strict on the sound problems, I hope that is the end. And so just to give maybe one step of the stage is that this is a different condition, which is which happens for large system size, and manybody can be missed by stomach substitution. So it's useful to. So it's useful to have some methods to go beyond that. And also, this new methods are conditional normal analytics and this hybridized method with multiple sets and postactive methods, which allows us to destroy the distance in your region. Okay, so thank you very much, and over again for the transformers. We're a bit over time, but if anybody has an urgent question for a very interesting talk, I didn't understand. At first you introduced a hierarchy of um pure st uh of pure states and then uh you show a slide uh where instead uh A slide where it said that it's impossible, non-Markovian unraveling, white fewer states. So, what was the problem? It seems like contradiction. So, there is no contradiction probably because I went too fast. So, this off method or NFT, so this is this uh a non-machine stochastic method, which is well valid and actually with the And as actually written in this slide, so the first thing, so you can really use POS or an MQSD to, as a tool, as a mathematical tool, to deduce the reduced system dynamics when you are average of the many parameters. So basically you if you you know this IOP data is here, you can very well to propagate this using OPS and then so And then so I mistake the expectation value of this obtained to be well not defined. But what I'm saying is that you cannot interpret one enthusiastical trajectory that you obtain from Ox as a real trajectory that you will observe that you tell in the next president. Okay. And what's uh the truncation order uh typically of uh the ops? Is it large or small and how it is spelled with the uh with the With the number of particles on the system. Because I know HiOM, for example, another hierarchy, is very, very computational expensive for large systems. Looking at such a problem or hopes is much more cheaper. So I mean, if you like, Ox, uh not actually twice on it, but Ox, if you like, it's uh a rubber Old T2I is unraveling of HQL. So it's really like this market classification unraveled by stochastic innovation in the market region. So OT3 is an unraveling of HQN. So instead of dealing with z images, you deal with wave functions. So you gain already a kind of very good advantage. And then so the number of of I mean the size of the reactivity depends as HUM on the the kind of density of compact manifest. Kind of instant video from background and effect, I would say. But here the idea is that if you have a one-bit system, for example, you can write the state and battery policy state and some gains directly. And you have also ideas that for this UN method that I can set this condition and regional. So you can also, if we die, want to use this standard network method to get some very short question. Do I correctly understand if Question: Do I correctly understand about the first part? That only a red field equation allows one to describe phase transition in contrast to lean blood, but fourth-order equation allows to describe even more some things which are not described even by the rest of the second-order equation. Is it true? So I think Germany does. So, I mean the ZK model state transition is really peculiar. I think I mean there are other models from which similar Model for which Limblantification can feel very well dependent. But for this particular model, so the standard lead plant, so derived L-tat dimension wouldn't work. But here, if you like, you can look at this recent approach by Steven Jager and Giovanni Morici, where they found a way to have a a completely positive matter equation that captures the D base transition. But if you look at the paper, you will see that the method is That I fail, we see that the method is much more involved than other methods of reflection. And for this one, I think it's very difficult to have two of the stimulation of the foreign and so on. And you can look at the paper. Yeah, it's very well described. And you can also share up the slides. Okay, thanks very much. Thank you very much. I think it's time to wrap up, unfortunately. Thanks, Francois, for the nice talk. For the nice talk.
