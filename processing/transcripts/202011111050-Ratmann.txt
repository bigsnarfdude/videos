Matthew, fantastic. Thank you, Matthew. It's really nice to see so many familiar faces from my office, my home office, essentially. So it's really nice. But I guess we're all grieving sunny Mexico. So hopefully, in two years from now, we will all be reunited and enjoy a nice coffee and snack and our company. And SNAC and our company. But in the meantime, I just wanted to update you today on the progress that we've made in estimating population level transmission dynamics. And I think the main thing is from deep sequence data. So that's essentially what we've really focused on over the past two, three years. And this is for HIV. So we're moving a bit away from. So we're moving a bit away from bacteria for the next 15 minutes. And it's really been a big collaboration. So it's not just me. So it's embedded in the Pinjaya HIV consortium. And Matthew is really a key figure and player in that as well. And so it's really nice to have him share the session. And then the main collaborator is also the Rakhai Health Sciences program in Program in Uganda. And Jo Yu, who is a PhD student in my group, she's really helped drive many of the stats developments that I'm happy to present today. And so we focus on Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, especially because that's where the HIV burden is the highest. And you may not know just how pockety and heterogeneous the burden of HIV is. The burden of HIV is in sub-Saharan Africa. So red is where HIV prevalence is high, and you can see it's just really like a few hotspot areas in Africa. And these are estimates from 2017. And we can zoom in. And this is looking, so here is this beautiful Uganda. And I've been heavily involved in work on these fishing communities here. Fishing communities here, and you know, as you can see, is here, and a little bit further inland. And this is the Rockhai community cohort study. So, there's 40 communities under surveillance, four of them on the shore of the lakes, and it really looks like this. So, it's pretty green and nice. And another particular aspect, you know, just very broad brush, you know, in addition to. Broad brush, you know, in addition to this heterogeneity of HIV burden, is the youth bulge. We are seeing, so this is a population survey data from Uganda, from this lakeside area, and you can just see this population pyramid and how many young individuals there are. And it's different, so there's structure. So this is like growing population inland, and this is like these kind of fish. And this is like these kind of fishing communities, kind of like more high-risk communities where people just go for work to work in these fish farms, and it's a very different population structure. And you can see here, this is HIV prevalence on the y-axis, just how rapidly HIV is increasing in these really young populations. Look at these steep curves, especially amongst young women. By age 25, you have in these fishing communities 40. In these fishing communities, 40% of them being HM factors. I mean, these are dramatic figures, are much more attenuated in the inland communities, but still, and this is really like the main thing that all the policymakers are trying to address to get these rapid increases down. And they just haven't been able to do that. And so this is where we are coming in with our deep sequencing and the phylodynamics. And so we're really asking, you know, like, this is where the group, my group has helped. Groups has helped with specifically. So, in terms of geography, so we asked: are areas with high HIV prevalence, are these the main sources of infection in neighboring areas? That's what's commonly assumed. And then in terms of age structure, so are men aged larger than five years older than women and the younger adolescent women in particular? Are these the main sources of infection? Are these the main sources of infection in those women? So we looked at questions like that just to make this really specific. And what we are doing as part of the Pangeos Consortium and MASIU and others is to essentially bring phylogeography to individuals. That's all what we're essentially doing. And then we do some fancy stats on top of that. So, you know, all you know, like from the COVID talk and like all the other talks, you know, if this is the UK, you know, we can show that. We can show that the UK got lots of COVID-19 from Spain. Now, what we're doing is like we're not looking at countries, we're looking at individuals. So, this is person M2 and this is person F1. And we can do exactly the same as you would do between countries, you know, for far age or. And the reason for that is because of the deep sequencing, you get multiple sequence fragments per person. So you have to study this in two. And because you're looking at virus, And because you're looking at virus, you have high mutation rates, so you get this distribution within the photogenesis. And you do this across the genome. So you don't do this just once, you do this multiple times. And this is just showing like the GAG gene, the HIV GAG gene. And so you have these multiple evaluations. And you can imagine on the short ruled data, it's incredibly noisy. But look at, you know, and then we developed this grammar. So we have these particular topology configurations. And Matthew's really been driving. And Matthew has really been driving that. And then we can characterize these pairs of individuals in terms of the grammar of who's a sync source and who's a sync across the genome. And you can see how consistent these colors pop out, showing that the signal is really consistent across the genome. So this was the big surprise that we can do this from data on 250 base per stretches. And then, you know, like lots of the work that we've done over the years is doing this on scale. The years is doing this on scale, so moving this away from just looking at peers of individuals to population-level surveys involving thousands of individuals. And I've been primarily involved in doing this for roughly 2,500 individuals that were deep sequenced from these 36 inland communities and these four fishing sites between 2011 and 2015. Um, yeah, that was published in 2020 in the Lansde HOV. So, we what ultimately what we get is not just that individuals are showing up close in the phylogeny, but now because of this ancestral and this children signal that we get, you know, think phylogeography in individuals, we have these source recipient peers at the individual level. And then we can look at them, right? So, we can ask source. We can look at them, right? So we can ask: so, in how many cases was the source in the inland community, and in how many cases was the recipient also in the inland community? And we can just enumerate them, right? And we can all count. So, in total, like in this data set, we had 265 pairs between the inland and fishing communities, if we exclude migrating individuals. And we found that 94 were just within the inland. We're just within the inland communities, so this big, large stretch here. In 1141, we're in this very small area here. And we found that 23 are going from the inland to the fishing and 7 the other way around. And this was opposite to what we had hypothesized because here HIV prevalence is really high and here it's low. So we were expecting to see more from here to there. From here to there. And we saw the opposite. And we got worried. And because of that, and then we also got worried because the numbers didn't seem to make sense. So this is because here there's 15,000 people living and here is 170,000. And we just found such an overwhelming indication that transmission occurs just here. And it just didn't make sense. Yes, we know that HIV prevalence is high here, but it just doesn't. Doesn't you know, um, doesn't overturn this really large population size over here. So, what's going on? And so, with that, like, we kind of started formulating a statistical model to interpret the data. And that is available on the Filo Scanner website on GitHub, and it's called Filoflows. And I'm just going to talk you to the bare minimum without the time that I have, seven minutes or so. So, the data now are Data now are, he knows not phylogenies, but we're looking at observed flows from a population strata one. So you can think of that, say, as men in age group one to women in age group one. So maybe 18 year olds to 18 year olds. And you have 50 year olds to 50 year olds. If you think in terms of space, you have just a two by two matrix where you have inland to inland, inland to fission. Inland, inland to fishing, fishing to inland and fishing to fishing. Something like that. So that's our data. So it's just a number of flows, as I just presented to you on the last scene. And then we think about what's actually happening. So what's the latent data? And we denote this by Z. So this is the actual flows from the two population strata. And this can be really arbitrary. And then because the total of Z is random in itself, we just model this as. Itself, we just model this as Poisson processes. So we have transmission intensities lambda ab that just describe the probability of the latent data Z, the actual transmission points. And what we're really interested in is the proportion of transmissions between different population strata. And that, as you know, falls really nicely out of these fossil models if you just self-normalize the transmission intensity, the transmission intensity. Intensity, transmission intensities by the sum. Okay, so that's the backbone of the model. And why do I tell you this? It's essentially think Poisson regression. That's essentially what we're doing. And you can immediately see that this is fast and it's flexible because you can account for all kinds of covariates if you wanted to. And it doesn't have the time component. So that's the main thing. So usually the constraints that you get from SIR model as you move in time, like in how do you Model as you move in time, like in how these flows are expected to evolve, you don't get this in this framework at all. So, this is usually best applied to cross-sectional data. So, that's the main constraint. And what we do is like there's a process of going from the latent data to the observed data. And it's kind of a binomial picking process, sampling process. And we have sampling processes for different strata. And that's important because you can really nicely adjust for this in these equations. Nicely adjust for this in these equations by adding offsets. But I just leave you with these kind of thoughts. And so, what we do is like, so we account for these sampling biases. And the main thing that we did is to realize that we've essentially sampled almost everyone here in the Vake side. And we can calculate this. So we estimate that we are basically seeing three out of four individuals who live there in our server. In our survey. But further inland, there's many more communities, especially on the highway, that we're actually not surveying. So that is what kind of drove these estimates is like the survey bias that we're not seeing all these communities that are just here everywhere. And we're estimating that we're only seeing 12% of the entire green inland area in our communities. And when we're just for just that, you know, you can see how these numbers flip, right? So now these numbers make much more sense. Right, so now these numbers make much more sense. We're estimating that 88.7% of transmissions occur between inland communities and 5.2 in the lakeside area. And the flows have still stayed consistent. So we're still finding that there's more flows from low prevalence areas to high prevalence areas. I could talk hours on that because we looked at mobility and so forth, but I don't have the time. And instead, I just want to focus a bit on the stats, because that's the purpose of this workshop. Because that's the purpose of this workshop. And so, what are the disadvantages of the model that we have? It's, well, it requires deep sequence data, and we can't do it otherwise. It's cross-sectional, so we shouldn't really try and do this over time. It's problematic. It doesn't have the consistency properties that you would expect from infectious disease models. And in fact, we are only using a small amount of these data that appear in these source recipient pairs. Appear in the source of Cypriot pairs. But what are the advantages? So now the inference is pretty tractable because it's just a Poisson equation. We can implement it in standard. There's no way of recursively tracking ODEs and things like that. We can adjust for sampling bias, so it's quite easy by just adding offsets to our equations. And we can smooth over neighboring strata. And I just want to show you. And I just want to show you the impact of the smoothing property, just add Gaussian processes to our Poisson equations. And I want to show this on estimating gender and age-specific transmission dynamics. And I think, now is the time. Let me talk about this a little bit. This is again, this is important data from Kwazum Natal in South Africa. And it just shows you the incidence rate. Just shows you the incidence rates amongst young women. It's just crazy. It's just so sad. And how steep they are despite all this effort over so many years. And this is like across the entire survey population. That's what they find. It's 60,000 people on the surveillance. Now, if you, however, focus on individuals who report the age of their partners and The age of their partners and repeat the same incidence estimation, that's what you find. And you can see how reporting bias and the availability of additional information on the partner really changes the interpretation of the data. So this is what we were trying to come in and just add this phylogenetic layer on top of existing data from just plain surveillance and try to just to help understand what's going on. So, our data, you know, bear in mind it's a small So, our data, you know, bear in mind it's a small sample, it's just 293 individuals, including those who migrated. I can show them on a 2xD plot where I'm showing female to male likely transmission. I can show the age of the female and the age of the male. And you can see it's bulged above. So, females tend to infect older men. And male to female, it's the opposite. So, it's the men are older, and the women are younger. And the women are younger. So that's the raw data. But how do we make sense of that given that we know that participation rates and so many other things differ by age? So you can look at this, like, for example, phishing sites, we look at the probability of participation and you can see there are differences. And so luckily, we can integrate this into our analysis. And I'm running out of time, but these kind of figures, they are kind of But these kinds of figures, they are kind of like you know, you can calculate this quite easily. It's essentially looking at what's the age of the men who are transmitting in our sample, and if you're just for sampling devices, how old do we think are they? So that is quite a standard calculation. But now, because of the Gaussian process, we can do this in much more detail. So, we can borrow information across different age groups. We can ask the question. So, looking at women who are aged 15 to 15. Are aged 15 to 16. So, this is this line here. We can ask what's the probability density of the men who are infecting these women of that age group. And you can see it peaks at men aged 27. And it has a bit of a long tail, what's usually these sugar daddies, like much older men who are infecting them. But it's not the majority. And so, this speaks to this, you know, the power that. This, you know, just the power that the Gaussian process modeling that it brings to these analysis. And I'm aware that I'm running out of time, I'll skip a bit, but I just want to show you these numbers, you know, that we only get this because we're able to do this at one-year age resolution. And you can see, if you're looking at women who are infected at age 15, how many of them are we estimating to be infected by men who are at least five years older? And we're estimating 91%. It just speaks to this: the massive importance of age-disparate sexual relations in driving the pandemic in this particular setting, at least if you look at our sample that we have. And that kind of goes down very quickly. So, depending on how you do your age break and how you average, you're not going to see the same findings because you're not going to, if you're not modeling this one-year resolution. So, with that, like the take-home messages that I have is, so if you have these. So, if you have deep sequence data, you can estimate the direction of transmission. And what we found is that HIV epidemics in areas that neighbor HIV hotspots, they are not necessarily brought under control if interventions are targeted just at the hotspots, because the flow may be the other way around, as we show. And HIV incidence remains high amongst young and adolescent women, in particular, which is crazy. And our data from Rakai suggests that these Our data from Rakai suggests that these infections are by a large margin acquired via age-desperate relationships with men of at least five years older. And the phytodynamics inference based on the simple PuShall model that we've developed is really fast, it's flexible, you can add all kinds of covariates. And you can get these high-resolution estimates by one-year age bands and between men and women because you're borrowing information across populations from it. And with that, I'd like to thank everyone involved, especially my PS. Everyone involved, especially my PhD student, Jo Yu, everyone else. And I stop right now. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Oli. Time for one quick question. Dave Asperson is asking: Has your deep sequence data provided insights into when people are transmitting during the course of their infections or their care status? Ah, that's a good question, David. Good question, David. We haven't looked at that. So in the bigger Pangea group, like Tanya has looked, Tanya Golubczyk has looked into estimating the time of infection. And from that, you can calculate, you know, like how, at what stage did those people then infect others? So that is in the process. That is in the process. We didn't find it very easy to specify the particular dates in the care cascade, if you so want. When do people start treatment? When did they stop medication and so forth? So that's been a challenge. But it'd be clearly super exciting to look at it in the detail.
