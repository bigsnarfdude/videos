Married with Agnieshka, and this is also a particular occasion today. You know, we are together, still together, and we hope, you know, to double and maybe even triple the time together. Okay. In fact, this is also the topic that we start like 14 years ago, it was just our daughter was born, was. Was born, was a very small girl, and we also started to work on Mushellak Orlif spaces. However, the topic that I will talk today is much younger, means this is some collaboration we have with Agnieszka, Mira, and also Martin Kalosek from Prague. And in fact, this is that my talk will be based on two papers with these three. Two papers with these three co-authors. First, before I will go into the detail of the homogenization, I should say that the problem is that I need to spend some time what are the Muschera-Corlidge spaces, unfortunately. And generally, the example of Mushella-Corlich spaces are Lebesgue spaces, but there are also some this Musha spaces. And there are also some this Michelac spaces are much more general. And you need first to say something about the object which is called n function. And this is a function which is karatodori, which is zero at zero, is convex and even. And what is also important, there are some which we are imposing. We are imposing that there are two functions and There are two functions, M1 and M2, which are stabilizing from above and from below this M function, M capital M. And these two functions, in fact, are also M function in some sense. And they are also zero at zero, also satisfying sup linear at zero and superlinar and superlinar at plus infinity. Infinity and if we have these two n functions, then we can just define several objects. First, we can define Orlich class. After that, we can define some space AM and also the space L M. In fact, both these spaces are Banach spaces if we equip them with the so-called Luxembourg. With the so-called Luxembourg norm. What are the difficulties with these spaces? The difficulty with these spaces are that first if we just define such n function which is m with star, which is m conjugate, in fact, this is only with respect to xi, not with respect to x, because this is depending on x and psi, and this is this conjugation is only with respect. This conjugation is only with respect to ψ, not with respect to x. Then we can observe that is a closure of bounded function in the LM norm, for example, this Luxembourg norm. And then we know that there is following duality property, means that the AM star is simply the Star is simply the L M space. And there is also some very important property which is for Orlich spaces, it's so-called delta 2 condition. In fact, this is, in this case, the Orlich space is very similar to, for example, to spaces LP. This is this doubling condition or delta 2 condition, which is saying that if we double argument, we can, with some constant C, With some constant C, bound the argument of M for double argument by the function M plus some integrable function K. And if this delta 2 condition is satisfied, then the story is simple, means that then we know that all these objects defined on the Defined on the previous slide are equal, but if it is not satisfied, then they are not equal and they are not strict. And in particular, what is also obvious is then the bounded functions are not dense in space LM, in Maushi-La Cauli space with respect to strong topology. Of course, from the point of view of Of partial differential equation, density of the bounded or even smooth function complex is loopholed is extremely important, but unfortunately it is not true. And now I would like to say before I will go to the homogenization, I would like to say about the existence for such equations. In fact, this is some facts which were known. Some facts which were known was studied in the 60s and 70s for classical Euler spaces. This is if we have such an elliptic equation, then we can just say about the such elliptic problem if we impose some some control on the vector field A. On the vector field A, just in the term of n function. This is exactly this slide. And typically, if we say that A is a Karatodori function and we know that this is such a growth-coercivity condition, in fact, they are together written growth and coercivity together in this condition. And also, we have some mono. And also we have some monotonicity. We can prove existence of the solution under certain assumptions. And in fact, there are two possible assumptions. Assumption M1 means that M function or M star function satisfy delta two condition, or another possible assumption is so-called Lockhelder continuity, which says that says that this log herder continuity says that if we just divide m function in point x by m function in point y then we have some estimate with the logarithm inside and this is this is in general not enough but but what is enough is some some some assumption of this type but we can prove that if But we can prove that if this is in fact the function, m function depends not on ψ but on absolute value of xi, then this there is an implication from 2 to 1. And in fact, we can also say that this is this one condition that is satisfied. And in this case, we have existence of the solution. And in fact, this is based on what is very important is the question of density of Of density of smooth and compactly supported functions in our space. This is impossible in the norm, but what we can prove, there are in fact two possibilities. One possibility is in the case of delta 2 or delta 2 for m star, there is we can use weak star topology to prove it, and this is enough. And in the case of this And in the case of this loghelder continuity of the modular, important notion is modular convergence, which is something between weak star convergence and strong convergence. This is stronger than weak star, but weaker than strong topology. And because of that, we can prove that We can prove the following theorem. In fact, this theorem I think we proved first in the paper in Journal Functional Analysis, I don't remember the year, two or three years ago. But this is somehow similar theorem was proven by Goses in or published by GOSES in Studia Mathematica in 1982, I think. 8 to 2, I think, but for classical early spaces. And this is saying that unfortunately, you cannot prove the convergence of smooth, compactly supported function in strong topology, but you can use this modular topology and you can pass in modular topology to limit, and you can just prove that they are dense. And in fact, this is a this is a In fact, they are somehow earlier paper about the existence and what I want to talk today about are the result about the homogenization. The result about the homogenization, in fact, there are two papers. This is both with three co-authors, with Mira Agnieszka and Martin Kalosek. And in fact, one is in this case. one is in this case with nabla2 and delta two and for m and delta two for m star and another is with this log helder continuity condition and what we have in mind is that now we are not talking about the existence but we are talking about the homogenization means periodic homogenization of the operator we are taking the problem in the divergence The problem in the divergence form, and we are just passing with epsilon to zero. And what we expect is similar property, like typically in two-scale conversions, that we will have a problem on cell and we will have a general problem, and that cell problem will be corrector for the general problem. And if you go for the And if you go for the literature, for the homogenization, of course, you should probably start with Luke Tartar, but also with Olenik and Zhivkov, and also with Sanchez-Palencia. And the typicalist two-scale convergence for this, for example, there is this paper, nice paper by Alaire about the homogenization and two-scale convergence. But and how it goes, of course, it goes, you have a problem you want to homogenize, and then you are getting the problem, which is the problem on cell, means this is this problem. Fortunately, in this problem, what you can expect is that you are lost in the dependence on X. Dependence on X and after that you have a corrector in the in the original okay this is the this is a problem something okay sorry this is this is different this is of course this is fast fast variable means here is there is no dependence on x in the problem on omega and the dependence on x is only on the in the cell problem and you can pass to the limit and you You can pass to the limit, and you are just replacing the problem, this problem, by these two problems. And of course, this is that for the practical purpose, if you have some fast variable, it's very difficult to compute this. And if you pass to the homogenization limit, you are once you are solving the problem on cell, you are just putting the new form of the operator and the conditionality, numerical conditionality. Numerical conditionality of the problem is much better. And in this case, what are the assumptions? The assumption are that this A is just controlled like previously by some Karatodori mapping, which is n function. And this is in the same type, except that now this n-function is just periodic with period. Periodic with period Y. And this is just like typically for homogenization. What is different from classical result about the homogenization is that in classical result in homogenization, you have fast variable only in the operator because the classical space is, for example, L P space, and this is not changing with X. And now you have a situation where the space, some. Where the space somehow is changing with epsilon and together with the operator. And under the assumption, which were in fact imposed even previous about the stability, we can prove existence of the homogenization of this limit. What is important to underline Important to underline is that these spaces do not allow using the method based on Hemholz decomposition because simply they are not reflexive spaces and you have not this Hemholz decomposition. And also what was, for example, used by Luc Tartar, compensated compactness argument is also not valid in these spaces. And in our case, this is a completely different approach based on some adaptive method. At the end of my talk, I would like to make some commercial, means I would like to just make some commercial to our new book, which I hope will be published soon. This is in Soon. This is in Springer Monographs in Mathematics. This is a book about different aspects of partial differential equations in anisotropic Muschelak-Ohrlich spaces. Also, some review of the results, these results about the homogenization is also coming in this book. Thank you for attention. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
